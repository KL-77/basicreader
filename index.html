            <h2>Victory for Elon Musk: US labor board abandons authority over SpaceX</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/victory-for-elon-musk-us-labor-board-abandons-authority-over-spacex/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The National Labor Relations Board abandoned a Biden-era complaint against SpaceX after a finding that the agency does not have jurisdiction over Elon Musk’s space company. The US labor board said SpaceX should instead be regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations at railroad and airline companies.

The Railway Labor Act is enforced by a separate agency, the National Mediation Board, and has different rules than the National Labor Relations Act enforced by the NLRB. For example, the Railway Labor Act has an extensive dispute-resolution process that makes it difficult for railroad and airline employees to strike. Employers regulated under the Railway Labor Act are exempt from the National Labor Relations Act.

In January 2024, an NLRB regional director alleged in a complaint that SpaceX illegally fired eight employees who, in an open letter, criticized CEO Musk as a “frequent source of embarrassment.” The complaint sought reinstatement of the employees, back pay, and letters of apology to the fired employees.

SpaceX responded by suing the NLRB, claiming the labor agency’s structure is unconstitutional. But a different issue SpaceX raised later—that it is a common carrier, like a rail company or airline—is what compelled the NLRB to drop its case. US regulators ultimately decided that SpaceX should be treated as a “common carrier by air” and “a carrier by air transporting mail” for the government.

In a February 6 letter to attorneys who represent the fired employees, NLRB Regional Director Danielle Pierce said the agency would defer to a National Mediation Board opinion that SpaceX is a common carrier:

In the course of the investigation and litigation of this case, a question was presented as to whether the Employer’s operations fall within the jurisdiction of the Railway Labor Act (“RLA”) rather than the [National Labor Relations] Act. As a result, consistent with Board law, the matter was referred to the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) on May 21, 2025 for an opinion as to whether the Employer is covered by the RLA. On January 14, 2026, the NMB issued its decision finding that the Employer is subject to the RLA as a common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce as well as a carrier by air transporting mail for or under contract with the United States Government. Accordingly, the National Labor Relations Board lacks jurisdiction over the Employer and, therefore, I am dismissing your charge.

The letter was provided to Ars today by Anne Shaver, an attorney for the fired SpaceX employees. “The Railway Labor Act does not apply to space travel,” Shaver told Ars. “It is alarming that the NMB would take the initiative to radically expand the RLA’s jurisdiction to space travel absent direction from Congress, and that the NLRB would simply defer. We find the decision to be contrary to law and public policy.”

We contacted the NLRB today and will update this article if it provides a response. The NLRB decision was previously reported by Bloomberg and The New York Times.

“Jennifer Abruzzo, NLRB general counsel under former President Joe Biden, had rejected SpaceX’s claim that allegations against the company should be handled by the NMB,” Bloomberg wrote. “After President Donald Trump fired her in January last year, SpaceX asked the labor board to reconsider the issue.”

In April 2025, SpaceX and the NLRB told a federal appeals court in a joint filing that the NLRB would ask the NMB to decide whether it had jurisdiction over SpaceX. The decision to seek the NMB’s opinion was made “in the interests of potentially settling the legal disputes currently pending between the NLRB and SpaceX on terms mutually agreeable to both parties,” the joint filing said.

Shaver provided a July 2025 filing that the employees’ attorneys made with the NMB. The filing said that despite SpaceX claiming to hold itself out to the public as a common carrier through its website and certain marketing materials, the firm doesn’t actually carry passengers without “a negotiated, bespoke contract.”

“SpaceX’s descriptions of its transport activities are highly misleading,” the filing said. “First, regarding human spaceflight, other than sending astronauts to the ISS on behalf of the US and foreign governments, it has only ever agreed to contract with two very wealthy, famous entrepreneurs. The Inspiration4 and Polaris Dawn missions were both for Jared Isaacman, CEO of Shift4 and President Trump’s former pick to lead NASA prior to his public falling out with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Fram2 was for Chun Wang, a cryptocurrency investor who reportedly paid $55 million per seat. A total of two private customers for human spaceflight does not a common carrier make.”

The letter said that SpaceX redacted pricing information from marketing materials it submitted as exhibits. “If these were actually marketing materials provided to the public, there would be no need to redact pricing information,” the filing said. “SpaceX’s redactions underscore that it provides such materials at its discretion to select recipients, not to the public at large—far from the conduct of a true common carrier.”

The ex-employees’ attorneys further argued that SpaceX is not engaged in interstate or foreign commerce as defined by the Railway Labor Act. “SpaceX’s transport activities are not between one state or territory and another, nor between a state or territory and a foreign nation, nor between points in the same state but through another state. Rather, they originate in Florida, Texas, or California, and go to outer space,” the filing said.

The filing also disputed SpaceX’s argument that it is a “carrier by air transporting mail for or under contract with the United States Government.” Evidence presented by SpaceX shows only that it carried SpaceX employee letters to the crew of the International Space Station and “crew supplies provided for by the US government in its contracts with SpaceX to haul cargo to the ISS,” the filing said. “They do not show that the government has contracted with SpaceX as a ‘mail carrier.’”

SpaceX’s argument “is rife with speculation regarding its plans for the future,” the ex-employees’ attorneys told the NMB. “One can only surmise that the reason for its constant reference to its future intent to develop its role as a ‘common carrier’ is the lack of current standing in that capacity.” The filing said Congress would have to add space travel to the Railway Labor Act’s jurisdiction in order for SpaceX to be considered a common carrier.

When asked about plans for appeal, Shaver noted that they have a pending case in US District Court for the Central District of California: Holland-Thielen et al v. SpaceX and Elon Musk. “The status of that case is that we defeated SpaceX’s motion to compel arbitration at the district court level, and that is now on appeal to the 9th circuit,” she said.

SpaceX’s lawsuit against the NLRB is still ongoing at the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, but the case was put on hold while the sides waited for the NMB and NLRB to decide which agency has jurisdiction over SpaceX.</div>

            <h2>Apple releases iOS 26.3 with updates that mainly benefit non-Apple devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/apple-releases-ios-26-3-with-updates-that-mainly-benefit-non-apple-devices/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple has just released the latest major updates for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe, and all the other operating systems it released back in September of 2025. The 26.3 updates for these operating systems are fairly mild, focusing mostly on bug fixes and security patches, but Apple is adding a handful of iPhone features designed to make it easier to use third-party devices in Apple’s ecosystem.

The first is a “transfer to Android” feature that will facilitate switching away from Apple’s phones into the Android ecosystem. Apple offers to transfer “photos, messages, notes, apps, and more,” as well as the user’s phone number, but won’t transfer things like Bluetooth pairing information or sensitive data from the Health app.

Whether third-party apps can have their data transferred is likely tied to the AppMigrationKit developer framework that Apple added in iOS 26.1. Apps using this framework can import and export data to and from other devices and also access and download content the app has stored in the cloud. Apple notes that AppMigrationKit only functions for transfers from an Apple device to a non-Apple device; Apple already has several systems in place for preserving and transferring data and settings when upgrading from one iPhone to another.

The transfer system will rely on the target Android phone also supporting the feature; on Google’s end, the Data Transfer API was only added in the recent “QPR2” update to Android 16, released in early December. Android phone makers are considerably better about updates than they used to be, but it will still take time for a critical mass of even the newest non-Pixel Android devices to get this update.

Apple released a “Move to iOS” Android app back in 2015 to make switching to the iPhone easier and away from Android. Doubtlessly, that’s still the direction Apple hopes most switches will go. But as with Android’s gradually improving support for AirDrop, better interoperability is a pretty straightforward win for users.

Another iOS 26.3 update is also aimed at interoperability, though it may only apply to iPhones covered by European Union regulations. A feature called “notification forwarding” will send your iPhone’s notifications to third-party accessories, including Google’s Android-based Wear OS smartwatches. Once the setting is enabled, users will be able to decide which apps can forward notifications to the third-party device, similar to how Apple Watch notifications work.

In current betas, Apple allows notifications to be forwarded to only one device at a time, and forwarding notifications to a third-party device means you can’t send them to an Apple Watch.

Finally, both iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 are introducing a feature for some newer devices with Apple’s in-house C1 and C1X modems: a “limit precise location” toggle that Apple says “enhances your location privacy by reducing the precision of location data available to cellular networks.”

This feature is currently only available on a handful of devices and even fewer carriers: In the US, Boost Mobile is the only one. Only the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, or the M5 iPad Pro will offer the toggle; devices like the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and older phones with Qualcomm or Intel modems won’t support the feature.

Apple has also updated all of its other major operating systems today. But macOS 26.3, iPadOS 26.3, watchOS 26.3, tvOS 26.3, visionOS 26.3 and version 26.3 of the HomePod software are all quieter updates of the bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements variety. Beta testers have found early evidence of support for the M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips, pointing to pending refreshes for some higher-end Macs, but that doesn’t tell us much we didn’t already know.

The 26.3 updates are mostly sleepy, but the 26.4 releases may be a bigger deal. These are said to be the first to include Apple’s “more intelligent Siri,” a feature initially promised as part of the first wave of Apple Intelligence updates in iOS 18 but delayed after it failed to meet Apple’s quality standards.

Apple and Google jointly announced in January that the new Siri would be powered by Google’s Gemini language models rather than OpenAI’s ChatGPT or other competing models. As with other Apple Intelligence features, we’d expect the new Siri to be available to testers via Apple’s developer and public beta programs before being released to all devices.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/china-showcases-new-moon-ship-and-reusable-rocket-in-one-extraordinary-test/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">China’s space program, striving to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030, carried out a test flight of a new reusable booster and crew capsule late Tuesday (US time), and the results were spectacular.

The demonstration “marks a significant breakthrough in the development of [China’s] manned lunar exploration program,” the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said in a statement. China and the United States are racing to accomplish the next human landing on the Moon in a competition for national prestige and lunar resources. The Long March 10 rocket and Mengzhou spacecraft, both tested Tuesday, are core elements of China’s lunar architecture.

The launch of a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket, still in development, provided engineers with an opportunity to verify the performance of an important part of the new Mengzhou capsule’s safety system. The test began with liftoff of the Long March 10 booster from a new launch pad at Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan Island, China’s southernmost province, at 10 pm EST Tuesday (03:00 UTC or 11 am Beijing time Wednesday).

A test version of the Mengzhou spacecraft, flying without anyone onboard, climbed into the stratosphere on top of the Long March booster before activating its launch abort motors a little more than a minute into the flight as the rocket reached the moment of maximum aerodynamic pressure, known as Max-Q. The abort motors pulled the capsule away from the booster, simulating an in-flight escape that might be necessary to whisk crews away from a failing rocket. The Mengzhou spacecraft later deployed parachutes and splashed down offshore from Hainan Island.

NASA and SpaceX performed similar in-flight abort tests before flying astronauts on the Orion and Dragon spacecraft. The test boosters on the Orion and Dragon abort tests were expended, but the Long March 10 rocket wasn’t finished after the Mengzhou abort command. Remarkably, the booster continued its ascent without the crew capsule, soaring into space on the power of its kerosene-fueled YF-100 engines before reentering the atmosphere, reigniting its engines, and nailing a propulsive landing in the South China Sea, right next to a recovery barge waiting to bring it back to shore.

“The rocket’s first stage and the spacecraft’s return capsule were safely splashed down in the designated sea area according to procedures,” CMSA said.

A recap video released by Chinese state television shows highlights from the test flight.

In a matter of minutes, Chinese engineers moved closer to human-rating the Mengzhou crew capsule and achieved the country’s most successful test of a reusable rocket.

“The test successfully verified the functional performance of the rocket’s first stage ascent and recovery phases, as well as the maximum dynamic pressure escape and recovery of the spacecraft,” CMSA said. “It also verified the compatibility of relevant interfaces across various engineering systems, accumulating valuable flight data and engineering experience for subsequent manned lunar exploration missions.”

The low-altitude demonstration of the Mengzhou launch abort system follows a ground-level abort test last year that verified the spacecraft’s ability to escape an emergency on the launch pad. The Long March 10 booster also completed two test-firings on the launch pad prior to the in-flight abort test. At the same time, Chinese engineers have run a prototype lunar lander through a series of ground tests.

The Mengzhou spacecraft is the vehicle China will use to ferry astronauts from the Earth to the vicinity of the Moon, where crews will transfer into a lander to carry them to the lunar surface. After a short stay on the Moon, Chinese astronauts will take off and rendezvous with the Mengzhou capsule to bring them home.

Chinese officials say the Mengzhou spacecraft will also service the country’s space station in low-Earth orbit, replacing the Shenzhou capsule in use since the 1990s. The Mengzhou capsule has the capability for “multiple reuses,” according to CMSA. Mengzhou flights to low-Earth orbit will carry crews of up to seven astronauts, with smaller crews for lunar missions.

Mengzhou, which means “dream vessel” in Chinese, is scheduled for its first orbital test flight later this year. The spacecraft will launch on a Long March 10A rocket and dock with China’s Tiangong space station in low-Earth orbit. The Long March 10A, optimized for low-Earth orbit flights, will consist of a single reusable first-stage booster flying in combination with an upper stage. The full-size Long March 10, with 21 engines on three first-stage boosters connected together, will have the power to place payloads up to 70 metric tons into low-Earth orbit, and enough energy to propel the 26-metric-ton Mengzhou spacecraft to the Moon.

China’s leading state-owned space industry contractor, the China Aerospace and Science Technology Corporation (CASC), said the recovery of the Long March 10 booster after the in-flight abort test lays the foundation for “subsequent full-profile flight tests” and marks a “significant step” for China in “mastering reusable rocket technology.”

“The flight test further evaluated several key technologies, including the reliability of multiple engine restarts and high-altitude ignition during the rocket’s reentry phase, adaptability to complex force and thermal environments, and high-precision navigation control during the reentry phase.”

CASC oversees a sprawling industry of rocket and spacecraft manufacturers, including those responsible for designing and building the Mengzhou spacecraft and Long March 10 rocket.

The successful splashdown and recovery of the Long March 10 booster continues a busy period for China’s reusable rocket initiatives. No fewer than 10 Chinese companies are working on reusable rockets at different levels of maturity, all seeking to match the success of SpaceX’s reusable rocket program in the United States.

In December, two Chinese launch providers debuted new rockets—the Zhuque-3 and Long March 12A—with recoverable and reusable boosters. The rockets reached orbit, but their boosters missed their landings downrange from their launch pads.

Several Chinese companies have also completed high-altitude “hop tests” to evaluate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies ahead of launching their first orbital flights.

These advancements in China’s reusable rocket and lunar exploration programs come as NASA prepares to launch a crew of four astronauts on a loop around the far side of the Moon as soon as next month. A US-made lunar lander is likely still a few years away from being ready to transport crews to and from the lunar surface.</div>

            <h2>Smart home PSA: Apple's "new architecture" for Home app becomes mandatory today</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2022, Apple announced it was adopting a “new Home architecture” for its smart home ecosystem to improve its performance and reliability and make it possible to support different kinds of accessories. Although it was mostly an invisible update when it worked properly, some users who attempted to switch to the new architecture when it first rolled out in iOS 16.2 ran into slow or unresponsive devices and other problems, prompting Apple to pause the rollout and re-release it as part of iOS 16.4.

If you put off transitioning to the new architecture because of those early teething problems or for some other reason, Apple is forcing the issue starting today: You’ll need to update to the new Home architecture if you want to continue using the Home app, and older iOS and macOS versions that don’t support the new architecture will no longer be able to control your smart home devices. The old version of the Home app and the old Home/HomeKit architecture are no longer supported.

If you’re like me, you hit an “upgrade” button in your Home app years ago and then mostly forgot about it—if you open the Home app on a modern iPhone, iPad, or Mac and don’t see an update prompt, it means you’re already using the updated architecture and don’t need to worry about it.

For those who haven’t upgraded, Apple’s support document outlines what you need to do: Make sure every device you plan to use the Home app on is running a supported operating system (“iOS 16.2, iPadOS 16.2, macOS 13.1, tvOS 16.2, or watchOS 9.2 or later”), open the Home app, and tap the update prompt. Apple says that some users “may be automatically upgraded to the latest version of Apple Home,” but it didn’t specify under what circumstances an automatic switch will happen.

Apple has never gone into explicit detail on just what the updated Home architecture does, but the additions the company has made to its Home (formerly HomeKit) ecosystem in the last couple of years generally work only with the updated architecture and app. According to Apple’s support page, that includes “guest access, robot vacuum cleaners, and Activity History in the Home app.”

For features that require a “home hub,” like sharing control of a home with other Apple users, receiving notifications, or adding accessories compatible with the Matter smart home standard, switching to the new architecture will also require you to have a HomePod (either full-sized or mini) or a modern Apple TV box on your network. The old version of Home/HomeKit allowed iPads to function as home hubs, but they can’t be used that way with the new architecture.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following three of the warmest years on record, as scientists reckon with climate tipping points and states and cities grapple with the escalating cost of extreme weather and more intense wildfires, the Trump administration this week is expected to formally eliminate the US government’s role in controlling greenhouse gas pollution.

By revoking its 17-year-old scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency will demolish the legal underpinning of its authority to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin will be alongside President Donald Trump for an event Wednesday focused on boosting US use of coal, as mercury and air toxics standards are repealed. That is expected to be a prelude to Zeldin finalizing the endangerment finding repeal, an assignment the president handed him in an executive order signed on the first day of his second term in office.

“President Trump will be taking the most significant deregulatory actions in history to further unleash American energy dominance and drive down costs,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.

The move marks a far more radical retreat on climate change compared to the steps to weaken regulations that were taken in Trump’s first term. Instead, Zeldin’s team has asserted that the EPA never had the power to write such rules to begin with.

Climate action advocates and Democrat-led states have vowed to challenge the repeal of the endangerment finding, a decision that not only erases President Joe Biden’s most important climate regulations, but is designed to make it more difficult for any future administration to rein in fossil fuel pollution from vehicles, power plants, or other industries.

“Communities across the country will bear the brunt of this decision—through dirtier air, higher health costs, and increased climate harm,” said Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees, in a statement. “The Trump EPA is surrendering its responsibility, turning its back on families and communities already facing the highest pollution and health risks, and dismantling decades of science and progress.”

Said Joseph Goffman, EPA’s top air official during the Biden administration, “This move is a fundamental betrayal of EPA’s responsibility to protect human health. It is legally indefensible, morally bankrupt, and completely untethered from the scientific record.”

The battle seems destined to land in the Supreme Court, forcing it to revisit its landmark 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases were pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The outcome of a legal challenge is by no means clear, with all five of the justices who formed the majority in that case, Massachusetts v. EPA, dead or retired.

To help readers sort through the meaning of the highly technical legal maneuver by the Trump administration, and look to what comes next, Inside Climate News tackled some of the key questions raised by the reversal of the endangerment finding:

A panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) put it bluntly: “The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused [greenhouse gases] is beyond scientific dispute,” the scientists said in a report submitted to the EPA as it launched its repeal process. They said that the endangerment finding that the Obama administration adopted in 2009 is now supported by longer observational records and multiple new lines of evidence.

The most recent National Climate Assessment in 2023 reported that temperatures in the contiguous United States had increased by 2.5° F (1.4° C) since 1970, a marked increase from the 1.3° F (0.7° C) warming over the 20th century that the EPA reported in 2009. Annual heat-wave frequency has tripled since the 1960s, storms are producing more intense rains, and wildfires have become more severe. Hurricanes have been intensifying more rapidly since the early 1980s, and they break up slower. “Multiple lines of evidence show that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the primary driver of the observed long-term warming trend and other changes in Earth’s energy balance,” the NASEM panel said. “Natural forces cannot account for observed changes.”

The Trump administration didn’t ask NASEM for input, even though the Clean Air Act indicates that the EPA should consult with the National Academies on scientific issues. Instead, NASEM had to self-fund and fast-track its work to meet the tight deadline set for public comment last September. The group noted that it worked in the wake of a slew of climate-driven disasters in the United States: “the heavy rainfall of Hurricane Helene that destroyed homes and roads in the mountains of North Carolina, the fast-moving wildfires that displaced thousands in Los Angeles and affected air quality for miles around, and the rapid flooding of the Guadalupe River in central Texas that led to at least 135 fatalities.”

Such manifestations, and analytical methods that have allowed researchers to attribute them to climate change, are the most significant evolution in climate understanding since 2009, said Phil Duffy, chief scientist for the nonprofit group Spark Climate Solutions. “The evidence for societal harms from greenhouse gas emissions has become more of a present day reality than something that’s predicted and expected,” he said. Duffy, a top science adviser to President Joe Biden, was not involved in the NASEM report but was author of a peer-reviewed 2019 study that also found the scientific support for the endangerment finding had withstood the test of time.

When asked about the National Academies’ work, the EPA has stressed that its decision was based on new legal doctrines. In its proposal last year, the EPA asserted that the uncertainties “are more significant than previously believed,” and that “the more pessimistic assumptions” in the 2009 finding have not been borne out.

It was not immediately clear whether the agency, in its final proposal, would continue to lean on the well-worn science denial talking points compiled by the so-called “Climate Working Group,” five prominent climate skeptics hand-picked by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil executive, as advisors for the endangerment finding repeal process. More than 85 climate scientists submitted a report to the EPA detailing errors in the Climate Working Group’s report, and a federal judge ruled that Wright broke the law in establishing the group without regard to the Federal Advisory Committee Act’s transparency and fairness provisions.

In its original proposal, the Trump EPA relied on recent Supreme Court decisions it said restrict its authority to act on climate under current law, and close observers expect that will be the administration’s strategy.

“We expect EPA to revoke the endangerment finding for legal reasons, not scientific ones,” said Jeff Holmstead, a partner at the Bracewell law firm who served as head of EPA’s air office during President George W. Bush’s administration. “This is the only way that they can ‘drive a stake through the heart of climate religion,’ as Administrator Zeldin has said.”

The second Trump administration had the confidence to take on the endangerment finding largely because of how the president reshaped the Supreme Court in his first term, legal experts say. In two 6-3 decisions from a conservative majority bolstered by Trump’s three appointees, the justices created new doctrine that limited the power of federal regulatory agencies like the EPA.

“We’ve had an administrative law revolution,” said industry lawyer Matthew Leopold, who was the EPA’s general counsel in Trump’s first term, speaking at a forum last fall at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative think tank. “The playing field that the Obama administration was playing on [when it made the endangerment finding] looks entirely different today.”

The Supreme Court struck down Obama’s signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, in 2022. And in that case, West Virginia v. EPA, the court established its so-called “major questions doctrine,” saying regulation of greenhouse gases was an issue of such great economic and political significance that the EPA could not regulate them without explicit direction from Congress. Then, in a 2024 case over fishing regulations, the Supreme Court overturned the principle that had guided regulatory law for 40 years, saying that federal agencies were due no deference in interpreting ambiguities in the law. The court said judges, not agencies, should decide the meaning of the law, even though in the environmental realm that typically involves application of science and knowledge of the best available technologies for reining in pollution.

Climate action advocates, however, argue that the Trump administration faces an uphill battle in defending its repeal of the endangerment finding, largely because the Supreme Court already has interpreted the Clean Air Act as applying to greenhouse gases—in Massachusetts v. EPA. The court has repeatedly declined efforts to overturn that precedent, including in the West Virginia v. EPA case.

“To be sure… the court limited precisely how EPA may regulate those pollutants, but even the current court has not challenged whether EPA may do so,” said David Doniger, senior attorney and strategist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, at a briefing for reporters several weeks before the decision was announced.

Doniger’s colleague, Meredith Hankins, legal director for NRDC’s climate program, says the Trump EPA is clearly relying on legal strategy since it can not offer a scientific rationale for repealing the endangerment finding. “Since EPA’s attempts to make up their own climate science has been laughed out of the room, the agency is left trying to make these tortured legal arguments that do not stand up to the slightest scrutiny,” she said.

Both The Washington Post and POLITICO reported in late January that debate within the administration over the EPA’s legal approach was delaying the process. Outside the administration, even lawyers who supported the move to overturn the endangerment finding acknowledged the challenges. “They are working to break the tool itself,” said Michael Buschbacher, a top attorney in litigation against greenhouse gas standards for vehicles, speaking at the AEI endangerment finding forum. Buschbacher said the many potential pitfalls make it “like a regulatory Everest … It’s dangerous. It’s a high-risk, high-reward endeavor.”

The Trump administration’s best chance of scaling that mountain is if it can make it to the Supreme Court, he said: “That’s probably where this is going to go if this administration is going to prevail.”

Not in the least. The EPA’s regulatory determinations are challenged in court more than those of any other federal agency, according to tracking by the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, and this high-stakes decision will not be an exception.

Climate action advocates see the endangerment finding as a key line they must defend in what they see as the extraordinary all-out assault on environmental protection in the second Trump term. “Put simply, this is a gift-wrapped package for the fossil fuel industry,” said Manish Bapma, CEO of NRDC. “It is unscientific, it is bad economics, and it is illegal. So we’re gonna fight it.”

The first stop will be the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals of nationally applicable regulations. Seven of the 11 judges on that court were appointed by Presidents Obama or Biden.

It depends on the courts. If Massachusetts v. EPA is still standing at the end of the battle, the EPA will still have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, like an arrow in its quiver that it just has to decide to use. But if the Supreme Court were to rule the Clean Air Act gives the EPA no authority over greenhouse gas emissions—reversing the Massachusetts decision and perhaps later cases that relied upon it—that leaves future administrations with an empty quiver.

“Then there would be the problem of a lack of authority, unless Congress wrote a new law,” said Doniger of NRDC.

But it has been more than two decades since a bipartisan consensus on climate action seemed fleetingly within reach in Congress. Congressional action has grown more elusive even as public support for action—especially deployment of clean energy—has grown. Democrats were able to get a $390 billion investment in clean energy, the Inflation Reduction Act, passed without GOP support in 2022.

The Biden climate plan was a carrot-and-stick approach to drive the United States to cut its carbon emissions 50 percent by 2030. The IRA’s incentives and subsidies were meant to drive down the price of clean energy, while EPA regulation pushed industry to make a transition away from fossil fuels. But over the past year, Trump and the Republican Congress have clawed back the IRA’s carrots. By revoking its endangerment finding, the EPA will also drop its stick.

Holmstead argued that withdrawal of the endangerment finding might actually force Congress to try to reach a bipartisan agreement on climate legislation: “The business community would like to have the long-term certainty that would come with bipartisan legislation, and if the environmental community sees that it can’t get what it wants from EPA, they might be more willing to make the kind of compromises that are always required to pass meaningful legislation.” But Holmstead added that he did not expect that to happen during the Trump administration.

No matter the outcome of the coming litigation over the endangerment finding repeal, the fossil fuel industry has won time. The Trump administration has ensured that the nation that has contributed the most to the atmosphere’s overload of climate pollution, the United States, will be entangled in litigation during years that scientists have said are crucial for driving down the pollution that is increasing risks and costs for communities as it alters the planet.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Aviation Administration abruptly halted flights into and out of El Paso International Airport on Tuesday night at 11:30 pm local time (1:30 am EST Wednesday) and said the restrictions would remain in place for 10 days.

In its notice, the FAA also restricted air space extended in a radius of 10 nautical miles from the airport. Violators were subject to being shot down, the agency said.

However, less than 10 hours later and without any additional explanation, the FAA ended the restrictions. “The temporary closure of airspace over El Paso has been lifted,” the federal agency said on social media. “There is no threat to commercial aviation. All flights will resume as normal.”

Later on Wednesday morning, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the decision to close airspace was made to counteract drones from cartels.

“The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,” Duffy wrote on X. “The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.”

In announcing the closure on Tuesday night, the FAA offered no explanation for the closure aside from determining that the area was classified as “national defense airspace,” and adding that the United States government may use “deadly force” against any airborne aircraft. According to reporting from The New York Times, local officials in El Paso and statewide were not given advance notice for the air space closure.

Similarly, in announcing an end to the restrictions, the federal agency offered no immediate information to local officials or travelers who were inconvenienced. It is rare for airspace over a major airport to be closed for any extended period.

The El Paso airport serves more than 3 million customers a month, and according to the 2020 US Census, it lies in the 22nd most populous city in the United States. El Paso is located along the US border with Mexico, across the Rio Grande River from Ciudad Juárez, a city of 1.5 million people.

The initial lack of communication from federal officials regarding such a disruptive closure, and then its abrupt end, raised serious questions about the coordination among federal agencies, especially if the FAA was making the closure on behalf of another federal body, such as the US Department of Defense.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the Federal Aviation Administration announced it was shutting down El Paso Airport this morning, social media lit up with speculation.

Had freedom-hating terrorists planted anti-aircraft weapons in the desert? Was the government covering up an early-stage zombie apocalypse with El Paso as ground zero? Or had the Trump administration perhaps started firing high-energy laser weapons into the sky without bothering to tell anyone?

The answer, impossibly, seems to be door number three.

According to CBS News, the bizarre airspace closure came under orders from FAA administrator Bryan Bedford. Apparently, Bedford made the call after learning that the Pentagon planned to unleash high-energy, counter-drone laser weapons at Fort Bliss, situated right next to El Paso International Airport.

But wait, there’s more. Separately, Fox News reported that military personnel had shot down a rogue party balloon — like you’d see at a child’s birthday party — near El Paso, after misidentifying it as a foreign drone. Whether this was done using the Pentagon’s mega-laser is unclear at the moment, but it’d be a wild coincidence if this wasn’t the case.

The airspace closure occurred without alerting White House, Pentagon or Homeland Security officials, sources told CBS. Originally, the closure was said to last 10 days, citing “special security reasons.” The FAA’s original notice warned that the “government may use deadly force” against planes if officials decided “the aircraft poses an imminent security threat.”

In Bedford’s defense, CNN reports the military laser weapon deployment came nine days before a February 20th meeting to review the system’s potential impacts on commercial aviation.

Again, it isn’t clear if the Pentagon went ahead and deployed the laser system before officials could meet. That said, CNN‘s sources said the Defense Department was seeking to use the system in El Paso before such a sit-down could take place.

Further muddying the waters are the Trump administration’s claims that the Pentagon had taken action to disable a vague “cartel drone incursion” right before the airspace shutdown. (We have yet to see any evidence that that’s the case.)

So to recap: the FAA and the Pentagon appear to be in such poor communication that experimental weaponry by the latter is shutting down civilian flights by the former — and party balloons are caught in the crossfire. Welcome to 2026.

            <h2>It Seems Almost Statistically Impossible That This Polymarket Bettor Didn’t Profit Off Inside Knowledge About the Super Bowl Half Time Show</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-11</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this year, an anonymous bettor on Polymarket perfectly predicted the US invasion of Venezuela mere hours before over 150 US aircraft rocked the country’s capital of Caracas, netting them over $400,000.

The incident reignited a heated debate over insider trading on prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi. While the act is strictly forbidden on Wall Street, prediction markets are currently operating in a regulatory vacuum, allowing those who enjoy insider status to score big — while everyone else is left to pick up the bill.

And the evidence that prediction markets are rife with insider traders continues to grow. As one eagle-eyed Reddit user noticed, an anonymous day-old Polymarket account correctly guessed 17 out of around 20 bets about Sunday’s Super Bowl half-time show.

Statistically speaking, that’s an exceedingly unlikely success rate, strongly suggesting the account had some kind of insider knowledge of what would happen during Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny’s performance.

The account correctly predicted that popstars Lady Gaga, Cardi B, and Ricky Martin would perform at the show. The account also correctly predicted that rappers Travis Scott and Drake, as well as singer Post Malone, would not perform.

The anonymous user placed bets starting February 6, two days before the event took place. All told, they made about $17,000 in profit.

“If you bet, you’re a rube for these people,” one Reddit user commented. “Literally spending money to give it over to insiders and cheats.”

Polymarket has yet to publicly comment on the matter and didn’t respond to the Wall Street Journal‘s request for comment.

Ironically, gambling was a major focus during Sunday’s sporting event. Companies spent untold sums to air commercials for betting services like DraftKings.

Trading volumes on prediction markets hit record highs during the Super Bowl, with Kalshi reporting over half a billion dollars in trading tied to the final outcome of the game. Polymarket’s equivalent bet saw trading volumes hit over $55 million.

Given ongoing regulatory uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether the two platforms will be able to meaningfully address insider trading, a subject that demonstrably continues to be a major problem.

While a knowledgeable few, including professional gamblers, get away with major profits, plenty of other users are incurring significant losses. As Business Insider points out, for each “winner” on the platform, there’s a “loser” as well, since users are betting against each other — not against a house, like in a traditional casino.

The latter will need to remain confident that the setup isn’t rigged against them for the ruse to work.

“Those other people are going to, on average, make losses if they know less about the subject matter than the experts,” professor of economics and prediction markets expert Eric Zitzewitz told BI. “So you need them to be willing to trade despite that.”

“You need them to be overconfident about how much they know, or you need them to be participating for some other reason,” he added.

Prediction market regulations could take years before they materialize — if ever. The White House has made it clear it supports the industry, with president Donald Trump’s Trump Media and Technology Group announcing in October that it would enter the prediction markets business.

In the meantime, lawmakers are desperately warning that gambling on the platforms comes with some inherent risks.

“New Yorkers need to know the significant risks with unregulated prediction markets,” New York Attorney General Letitia James warned in a statement six days ahead of the Super Bowl. “It’s crystal clear: so-called prediction markets do not have the same consumer protections as regulated platforms. I urge all New Yorkers to be cautious of these platforms to protect their money.”

            <h2>Ring Boasts About Power to Surveil Entire Neighborhoods</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/ring-doorbell-surveillance-dog">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Ring’s latest commercial came on over a Super Bowl ad break, it offered a service that seems like a no-brainer. Called “Search Party,” it’s a new function that lets Ring devices help canvas the neighborhood through its vast network of cameras to find lost pets.

“One post of a dog’s photo in the Ring app starts outdoor cameras looking for a match to help families find lost dogs,” the company’s Super Bowl ad enthuses.

Yet beneath all that is a startling revelation: that Ring doorbells can now surveil living beings throughout every neighborhood the devices might be found.

For those unfamiliar, Ring is Amazon’s doorbell camera company — those ubiquitous gadgets mounted on front porches that record everyone who walks by.

The devices have been the target of widespread privacy criticisms for years at this point. However, their latest data sharing agreement with surveillance company Flock has many activists up in arms, as that startup has no qualms with working closely with federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

With those kind of optics swirling around, the decision to highlight new dog-finding capabilities is a clever PR move for Ring. Who would say no to reuniting lost puppies with their families?

At the same time, the new Search Party function represents a troubling development. Where the company’s Fire Watch system is said to index neighborhood devices to watch for signs of fire emergencies, the Search Party function means the company is capable of tracking living things as well. Who decides when and how to deploy that power is another story — but it’s obvious that Ring has opened Pandora’s box.

As MS Now columnist Hayes Brown observed: “there’s no world in which finding lost dogs is the final end-use for this technology.”

“Ring’s Search Party feature does what neighbors have done for generations — help reunite lost dogs with their families — just with better technology,” a Ring spokesperson told us in a statement. “We built the feature with strong privacy protections from the start and camera owners choose on a case-by-case basis whether they want to share videos with a pet owner to support a reunion. Since launch, Search Party has helped bring home more than a dog a day.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mainstream cryptocurrency Bitcoin plummeted earlier this month, crashing down to a sliver over $60,000 — which is well under half of its all-time high value it reached just over four months ago.

It was a bloodbath that was followed by a short moment of reprieve over the weekend, when it rebounded above the $70,000 mark once more.

But don’t call it a comeback. As CNBC reports, the bounce has faded once again, with Bitcoin slipping back down to $66,000 by midday on Wednesday, down 47 percent over its October record high.

Critics watched in glee as the cryptocurrency kept tumbling.

“I’m going to enjoy watching Bitcoin crash,” former White House staffer Claude Taylor tweeted.

“Not going to lie,” one X user tweeted. “Buying Bitcoin is painful right now. Feels like I’m lighting my money on fire.”

Bitcoin’s woes earlier this month resulted from a surge in liquidations, prompting other traders to follow suit. Uncertainty over president Donald Trump’s pick for Federal Reserve chair also had investors uneasy, with many choosing to bow out of riskier bets like crypto.

The US government reported earlier today that 130,000 jobs were added to the economy in January alone, double the economic forecasts, leading many traders to quickly rein in any expectations of an imminent interest rate cut. However, whether any rate cuts would’ve allowed Bitcoin to surge in the first place remains debatable, as Coindesk points out. For one, the Labor Department also revealed that it had made massive cuts to its 20245-2025 numbers, greatly undermining its latest announcement.

Large selloffs of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which allow investors to get in on Bitcoin bets indirectly through traditional brokerage accounts, added to the pressure.

All eyes are on Bitcoin. Historically, it’s often bounced back after a “halving” event, a pre-scheduled occasion which sees Bitcoin mining rewards being halved, and reaching new all-time highs after. It’s a four-year cycle that most recently restarted following a halving in April 2024.

But whether that will be the case following the latest crash has turned into a heated debate as of late, with some speculating that the “four-year cycle” is “dead,” while crypto bulls claim it’s “intact.”

“2026 I expect to be a bear leg to the four-year cycle,” Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg told CNBC. “We have experienced several four-year cycles since bitcoin has launched and this is no different than any other.”

Others have been far more pessimistic in their outlook, predicting Bitcoin could plummet to as low as $30,000, or even $0.

“This week has shown us that the supply of ‘greater fools’ that bitcoin relies on is drying up,” Financial Times columnist and Bitcoin critic Jemima Kelly argued in a recent piece. “The fairy tales that have been keeping crypto afloat are turning out to be just that. People are beginning to wake up to the fact that there is no floor in the value of something based on nothing more than thin air.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Elon Musk tries to sweep his Mars ambitions under the rug like an embarrassing teenage phase, he’s now shifting focus to the Moon — with no less eye-brow raising ideas.

According to new reporting from the New York Times, Musk told employees at xAI — his AI company recently acquired by SpaceX — that it needs to construct a factory on the Moon to churn out AI satellites. And to launch the satellites into space, he says, it needs to build an enormous electromagnetic catapult.

Sci-fi readers already know where this is going: Musk is thinking about building a mass driver, which is essentially a coilgun for launching payloads instead of deadly projectiles. Paired with the lunar facility, Musk views it as a necessary step in building out computing power for his AI empire, which must not be bound by the finitude of terrestrial real estate.

“You have to go to the Moon,” Musk said at an all-hands meeting, per the NYT.  “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about, but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen,”

The outpouring of lunar enthusiasm from Musk comes after his aerospace company SpaceX bought xAI ahead of what is anticipated to be a historic IPO.

In an announcement about the acquisition stuffed with more sci-fi concepts, Musk argued that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology. He spoke of putting data centers in the Earth’s orbit, where in theory they’d have access to practically unlimited amounts of solar energy. Along with orbital data centers, he imagines populating the orbit with a vast constellation of AI satellites, something he likened to building a “sentient sun.”

The Moon may sound like a logical destination for a space company, but it actually represents an incredible about-face for Musk and SpaceX. Musk has spent years denigrating lunar missions, viewing them as a waste of time and a “distraction” from his ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars. His mantra has always been to “make life multiplanetary,” and “extend consciousness to the stars.” He has frequently provided optimistic timelines for achieving this, including promising in 2017 that the company’s first Mars mission would launch in 2022, and its first astronauts would arrive by 2025. He has consistently reiterated this mission, and presented SpaceX employees with a roadmap to reaching the Red Planet.

Of course, Musk insists he’s not abandoning Mars. In the Tuesday meeting, he described the Moon as a stepping stone to Mars. First, he wants to build “a self-sustaining city on the Moon,” then travel to Mars — and then, naturally, search the rest of the galaxy for aliens.

He provided a timeline for his dueling Moon-Mars ambitions in a recent tweet justifying the pivot.

“SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk explained. “That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When you start a “bounty” board meant for AI agents during one of the worst job markets since the great recession, don’t be surprised when it becomes infested with humans.

Last week, an AI entrepreneur made a splash when he introduced a bizarre job portal to the world. Called RentAHuman, the platform is meant to connect autonomous AI agents to real people in order to complete various tasks. As such, the site is split between two sections: one for humans to register their real-world skills, and another where AI bots post tasks on a bounty board that humans can sign up for, à la carte.

Though the bounty board is meant for AI agents — stuff like “My AI Agent Wants a Video of Your Hand” for $10, to give an example — it only took a week for it to become overrun with human beings seeking remote work.

“I am available for remotly [sic] tasks,” one user from Pakistan advertised. “Hello, I am interested in the Email Mailing remote work. Available daily, flexible hours. I have basic computer skills and experience using Gmail.”

“Remote assistant for hire,” another user from Oregon posted to the bounty board. Many kept it simple: “I do anything,” one poster advertised.

Others were more specific, offering to do highly specialized freelance work for anyone who’ll pay. “Swiss Architect available — building permits, 3D scanning, ArchiCAD,” wrote one user from La Tour-de-Peliz, Switzerland.

One user from Miami offered to do “Mix mastering” for $30 an hour on musical recordings — “rap, pop, trap, emo rap, cloud rap, and US rap” included. “I will mix your voice and master your sound,” the advert reads.

Others are using the platform as an open forum to complain about features or changes they’d like to see. One bounty titled “update website” implores the admin to “PLEASE update the site so you don’t have tk [sic] scroll through each page of bounties one by one after reading a bounty.”

“If I’m on page 7, click and read a bounty, no matter what action I take I have to scroll through each individual page again to get back to page 7,” the human user complained, ironically cluttering the feed for other humans browsing the site.

Whether this grim humiliation ritual actually lands anyone a job remains to be seen. As of last Wednesday, the site boasted some 73,000 human users with only a few dozen bounties. Nearly a week later, the site claims to have some 377,000 users jockeying for over 11,000 bounties.

Either way, it’s a perfect snapshot of the extremes to which job-seekers are willing to go to eke out any kind of living.

            <div id="article-text">Apple has been promising a new-and-improved, cutting-edge, AI-powered Siri since it first unveiled Apple Intelligence in 2024. Over about a year and a half since then, the release date for this new era of Siri has been continuously pushed back. According to a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, we’ll likely have to wait even longer.

While the new Siri was expected to launch with the upcoming iOS 26.4 update in March, now, the changes are expected to roll out more slowly over time, reportedly postponing some features until the May iOS update, or even until the release of iOS 27 in September. Apparently, Apple ran into trouble when testing the software, requiring the launch date to be pushed back further.

The changes are rumored to make the longtime digital assistant more like the LLM chatbots that have swept the tech world — but instead of opening up a ChatGPT or Claude app on your iPhone or MacBook, you would be able to just talk to Siri, which will be powered by Google Gemini.

We’re starting to feel bad for the Siri product managers. Hang in there, folks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Uber Eats announced a new AI feature, “Cart Assistant,” on Wednesday designed to fill customers’ grocery carts faster and easier. The beta version is now available in the app.​

To use the new chatbot, users search for a grocery store in the Uber Eats app and tap the purple Cart Assistant icon on the store’s page to begin shopping.

Customers can enter a list or upload an image of one, and Cart Assistant will automatically add the necessary items to their basket. This includes photos of handwritten lists or screenshots of recipes and their ingredients. Users can then customize the basket by swapping items for preferred brands or adding more products from the store.​

Uber Eats notes that Cart Assistant uses previous orders to prioritize familiar items — like your usual milk or favorite oatmeal — to make the experience more personalized.​

“Users were telling us they wanted a quicker way to shop, and we know how precious your time is,” Uber CTO Praveen Neppalli Naga said in a statement. “Cart Assistant helps you get from idea to checkout in seconds.”

Cart Assistant could help Uber Eats better compete with other food delivery and grocery apps that are already integrating or developing AI chatbots.​ For example, Instacart launched an AI search tool powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2023 to help customers save time and receive personalized shopping recommendations. DoorDash was also reportedly testing an AI chatbot called DashAI that same year.​

Last year, both Uber Eats and rival DoorDash integrated with ChatGPT to streamline food ordering. With Uber Eats, U.S. users can browse local restaurants and menus in ChatGPT, then complete their purchase in the Uber Eats app. DoorDash’s integration allows users to request meal plans and automatically add all necessary ingredients to their DoorDash cart.

Notably, Bloomberg reported in 2023 that Uber Eats was developing an AI-powered chatbot that would supposedly ask users about their budget and food preferences, and help them place an order.​

Overall, Uber Eats is rapidly investing in AI, including tools for merchants like AI-generated menu descriptions, enhanced food photos, and customer review summaries.

            <div id="article-text">Enterprise AI is shifting fast from chatbots that answer questions to systems that actually do the work across an organization. But who will own the AI layer that powers all of it?

Glean, which started as an enterprise search product, has evolved into what it calls an “AI work assistant,” aiming to sit underneath other AI experiences, connecting to internal systems, managing permissions, and delivering intelligence wherever employees work. Investors are buying into the vision, too — the startup raised $150 million last year at a $7.2 billion valuation as more competition heats up against tech giants bundling AI.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/senior-engineers-including-co-founders-exit-xai-amid-controversy/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk is addressing a wave of departures from xAI, including two more co-founders who left this week, bringing the total to six out of the original 12.

At an all-hands meeting yesterday, Musk suggested the exits were about fit, not performance. “Because we’ve reached a certain scale, we’re organizing the company to be more effective at this scale,” he said, according to The New York Times. “And actually, when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”

On X Wednesday afternoon, he went further, making clear these departures weren’t voluntary. “xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution,” Musk wrote. “As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism. This unfortunately required parting ways with some people.”

He added that the company is “hiring aggressively” and closed with a quintessentially Musk pitch: “Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.”

Losing half your co-founders in a relatively short period raises questions, and Musk’s comments seem designed to control the narrative, reframing the exits as necessary rather than a problem for the outfit.

In total, at least nine engineers, including the two co-founders, have publicly announced their departure from xAI in the past week — though two of those exits appear to have occurred a few weeks ago.

Three of the departing staff members have said they will be starting something new alongside other former xAI engineers, although no details are available about the new venture. Others have hinted at a desire for more autonomy and smaller teams to build frontier tech more rapidly, pointing to the anticipated surge in AI productivity.

Yuhuai (Tony) Wu, an xAI co-founder and reasoning lead, said in a post announcing his resignation: “It’s time for my next chapter. It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”

Shayan Salehian, who worked on product infrastructure and model behavior post-training at xAI and previously worked at Twitter/X, said last week he was leaving to “start something new.”

Career update: I left xAI to start something new, closing my 7+ year chapter working at Twitter, X, and xAI with so much gratitude.xAI is truly an extraordinary place. The team is incredibly hardcore and talented, shipping at a pace that shouldn’t be possible. From the Home… pic.twitter.com/HKWOebg9QI

Vahid Kazemi, who had a brief stint working on machine learning, posted Tuesday that he left a few weeks ago, adding: “IMO, all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it’s boring … So, I’m starting something new.”

Roland Gavrilescu, a former xAI engineer, left in November to start Nuraline, a company building “forward-deployed AI agents,” but posted again on Tuesday that he left the firm to build “something new with others that left xAI.”

The departures come at a moment of significant controversy for xAI. The company is facing regulatory scrutiny after Grok created nonconsensual explicit deepfakes of women and children that were disseminated on X — French authorities last week raided X offices as part of an investigation. The company is also moving toward a planned IPO later this year, after being legally acquired by SpaceX last week.

Musk is also facing personal controversy after files published by the Justice Department show extended conversations with convicted rapist and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The emails show Musk discussing a visit to Epstein’s island on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013. Epstein was first convicted of procuring a child for prostitution in 2008.

xAI maintains a headcount of over 1,000 employees, so the departures are unlikely to affect the company’s short-term capabilities. Still, the rapid pace of the recent departures had taken on a life of its own online, with users jokingly announcing on X that they too are “leaving xAI” despite never having worked there — a sign of how quickly the narrative of a “mass exodus” snowballed on Musk’s social network.

Still, forced co-founder exits are rarely a sign of smooth scaling. While Musk frames the reorganization as calculated, the fact that several engineers followed the co-founders out the door — and that at least three are starting something new together — suggests the departures may also reflect deeper tensions. In frontier AI, where talent is scarce and reputation matters, xAI’s ability to attract and retain top researchers will be tested as it competes with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information.

The following employees have publicly announced their departures from xAI on X in recent days:

February 6:  Ayush Jaiswal, engineer, wrote: “This was my last week at xAI. Will be taking a few months to spend time with family & tinker with AI.”

February 7: Shayan Salehian, who worked on product infrastructure and model behavior post-training and was previously at X, wrote: “I left xAI to start something new, closing my 7+ year chapter working at Twitter, X, and xAI with so much gratitude.” He added that working closely with Elon Musk taught him “obsessive attention to detail, maniacal urgency, and to think from first principles.”

February 9: Simon Zhai, MTS (member of technical staff), wrote: “Today is my last day at xAI, feeling very fortunate about the opportunity. It has been an amazing journey.”

February 9: Yuhuai (Tony) Wu, co-founder and reasoning lead, wrote: “I resigned from xAI today. It’s time for my next chapter. It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”

February 10: Jimmy Ba, co-founder and research/safety lead, wrote: “Last day at xAI. We are heading to an age of 100x productivity with the right tools. Recursive self improvement loops likely go live in the next 12 months. It’s time to recalibrate my gradient on the big picture. 2026 is gonna be insane and likely the busiest (and most consequential) year for the future of our species.”

February 10: Vahid Kazemi, an ML PhD, wrote that he had left xAI “a few weeks ago,” adding: “IMO, all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it’s boring. I think there’s room for more creativity. So, I’m starting something new.”

February 10: Roland Gavrilescu, the engineer who left in November to start Nuraline, posted: “I left xAI. Building something new with others that left xAI. We’re hiring :)”

February 10: Chace Lee, a member of the Macrohard founding team, wrote: “Taking a brief reset, then back to the frontier.” (Macrohard is an AI-only software venture under xAI designed to fully automate software development, coding, and operations using Grok-powered, multi-agent systems. Its name is a dig at Microsoft.)

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/microsoft-says-hackers-are-exploiting-critical-zero-day-bugs-to-target-windows-and-office-users/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has rolled out fixes for security vulnerabilities in Windows and Office, which the company says are being actively abused by hackers to break into people’s computers.

The exploits are one-click attacks, meaning that a hacker can plant malware or gain access to a victim’s computer with minimal user interaction. At least two flaws can be exploited by tricking someone into clicking a malicious link on their Windows computer. Another can result in a compromise on opening a malicious Office file.

The vulnerabilities are known as zero-days, because the hackers were exploiting the bugs before Microsoft had time to fix them.

Details of how to exploit the bugs have been published, Microsoft said, potentially increasing the chance of hacks. Microsoft did not say where they had been published, and a Microsoft spokesperson did not immediately comment when reached by TechCrunch. In its bug reports, Microsoft acknowledged the input of security researchers in Google’s Threat Intelligence Group in their discovery of the vulnerabilities.

Microsoft said one of the bugs, officially tracked as CVE-2026-21510, was found in the Windows shell, which powers the operating system’s user interface. The bug affects all supported versions of Windows, the company said. When a victim clicks on a malicious link from their computer, the bug allows hackers to bypass Microsoft’s SmartScreen feature that would typically screen malicious links and files for malware.

According to security expert Dustin Childs, this bug can be abused to remotely plant malware on the victim’s computer.

“There is user interaction here, as the client needs to click a link or a shortcut file,” Childs wrote in his blog post. “Still, a one-click bug to gain code execution is a rarity.”

A Google spokesperson confirmed that the Windows shell bug was under “widespread, active exploitation,” and said successful hacks allowed the silent execution of malware with high privileges, “posing a high risk of subsequent system compromise, deployment of ransomware, or intelligence collection.”

Another Windows bug, tracked as CVE-2026-21513, was found in Microsoft’s proprietary browser engine, MSHTML, which powers its legacy and long-discontinued Internet Explorer browser. It’s still found in newer versions of Windows to ensure backward compatibility with older apps.

Microsoft said this bug allows hackers to bypass security features in Windows to plant malware.

According to independent security reporter Brian Krebs, Microsoft also patched three other zero-day bugs in its software that were being actively exploited by hackers.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/how-to-get-into-a16zs-super-competitive-speedrun-startup-accelerator-program/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Without a doubt, one of the hottest new startup accelerators in tech right now is Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program. Launched in 2023, the accelerator has an acceptance rate of less than 1%. In a January blog post, the program said that over 19,000 startups pitched and fewer than 0.4% were accepted into the latest cohort.

The program used to focus on gaming startups, then expanded into entertainment and media, and is now a “horizontal program,” Joshua Lu, the program’s general manager and a partner at a16z, told TechCrunch. Today, founders of any type of startup can apply, and the program runs for about 12 weeks in San Francisco. It once had a program in Los Angeles, but Lu said the focus will be on SF from now on.

There are two cohorts a year, and around 50 to 70 startups are accepted into each. The program invests up to $1 million into each company, though the downside is that it’s a bit pricey. It typically invests $500,000 up front in exchange for 10% of the startup’s company via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months, at whatever terms agreed to by the other investors. In comparison, Y Combinator typically takes 7% of the company for $500,000.

Speedrun said its program is more “equity expensive” because of what it offers founders. It provides them with access to a16z’s advisory and business networks that assist with tasks like go-to-market, brand development, media strategy, and talent sourcing. Plus it offers the startups perks like $5 million in credits to vendors such as AWS, OpenAI, Nvidia, and Deel.

Given the high interest, and low acceptance rate, TechCrunch spoke to Lu for some tips on how startups can best stand out. The latest cohort began in January and will end in April with a Demo Day. Applications for the next cohort open in April, though it looks at off-season applications year-round, Lu said.

Speedrun focuses on early-stage startups. Because of this, they really examine who is on the founding team and whether their skills complement each other, Lu said.

“That doesn’t mean one has to be technical and one has to be commercial and one has to be marketing,” Lu said. It means that “we prefer not to see any glaring holes in capabilities or interests. We want the founding team to be self-aware and for that to be part of the hiring plan.”

They also like to see teams that have worked together before or have a shared history.

“There are lots of things that a founding team has to navigate in their startup journey and having a bit of pattern recognition, being able to work with each other, knowing how to disagree and how to come out the other side of a disagreement, those are all things people on founding teams with shared histories have an easier time with, on average,” he continued.

Even though AI has lowered the barriers to building software, it’s still incredibly helpful for a founding team to be technical, Lu said. At the same time, because AI has made it much faster to build and validate hypotheses and get a product out there, Lu said the Speedrun team likes to see when a startup already has a little bit of market validation or traction for their product.

“Speedrun as a program is really great at helping teams pour gasoline on a very small spark or fire,” he said. “We look for teams that have endeavored to build and try to show us that there’s a little spark we can fan the flames on.”

Lu said one common mistake founders often make in the application process is spending too much energy talking about the market theory or why there is a defined problem and why their solution is the right one. “All of that may be true,” he said.

At the same time, he added, even the biggest, most successful tech companies faced unexpected blockades when they were young, sometimes even pivoting completely. What a company thinks it’s going to build at the beginning isn’t necessarily what will make it successful at the end.

“What we really want to hear about is why this founding team is really good together,” he continued, “why they’re a great founding team, the best possible founding team to solve this particular problem.” And then on top of that, any validation on the idea itself.

Lu said the program encourages every founder to use AI to “clean up” their application. He said there is now no excuse for grammar errors or misspellings given the rising sophistication of AI tools. He also said AI can help founders sort out their thoughts, making them clearer, more concise, and more coherent.

But if AI did all the work in explaining the startup, that may backfire. If a founder makes it to the next round, it will be a live video-call interview. “At that point, their live narration explanation skills are going to be put to the test,” he said. So founders should be prepared to talk cogently about their startup without the help of AI.

Only about 10% of founders make it to the video-call stage. There are typically two to three investors on the judging panel at a time.

After the live interview, the team typically conducts a few more screening calls with the founders, and then a final decision on the cohort is made.

There are, of course, other accelerator programs for startups to choose from. Lu said Speedrun itself was inspired by some of these other programs.

Still, he said, this accelerator prides itself on giving founders access to a large, specialized operating team. In fact, he said the best teams that get the most out of the program are the ones most “greedy about getting exposure to the amazing people and programs” Speedrun has to offer.

Lu listed off just a few points: a16z has around 600 people, and 10% of that staff is on the investment team, he said; everyone else is an operator who supports the companies the firm works with. As a result, founders in Speedrun will have access to experts who can help with marketing, banking, finance, management, and many other functions. So it helps to know who the startup wants to connect with and why.

“We tell founders that come through the program, what you get out of Speedrun is what you put into it,” he said. “We think founders who want to take advantage of world experts in many different domains early in their startup journey would be really smart to choose us.”

Founder Mohamed Mohamed, who is in the recent cohort, just announced a $5 million raise for his proptech startup Smart Bricks led by a16z’s Speedrun. He was attracted to the program because he said it stood out as one of the few “explicitly designed for co-founders working on frontier AI applications,” and he picked it because he wanted a program that would allow him to “stress-test an ambitious technical vision.”

Mohamed said he treated the application like an internal strategy memo rather than a pitch. “Instead of polishing buzzwords, we focused on clarity — the real problem, why it’s structurally hard, and why our team is unusually well-positioned to solve it,” he said. “We were explicit about what was working, what wasn’t, and where we needed help. I think that honesty and clear articulation of why this problem matters” is what helped the company in the application process.

He called the whole process “rigorous but refreshingly thoughtful,” and said it was designed to understand how founders think, not just what they have built so far. “The conversations went deep into product architecture, data strategy, and long-term ambition. It felt closer to a partner-level discussion than a typical accelerator interview, which was a strong signal for us,” he said.

His overall advice is to be “intellectually honest and precise.” For example, he said in his application he avoided “over-optimizing” for the sake of hyping up his company. “If you’re vague, derivative, or overly defensive about your idea, it shows quickly. Don’t try to sound bigger than you are; clarity about where you actually are is far more compelling than inflated narratives,” he said.

In the end, “Speedrun isn’t looking for perfect companies; they’re looking for founders who can reason clearly about complex problems and build with conviction,” he said. “Articulate the hard parts of what you’re doing and why they’re worth tackling. Depth beats polish every time.”

You won’t find this in Cortina d’Ampezzo over the next few weeks, but for several decades of the Olympics’ history, the contest awarded medals not just for sport but for art too.

In the Summer Games from 1912 to 1948, musicians, painters, and plenty of other aesthetes went brain-to-brain in events such as lyric poetry and chamber music. “Town planning” was even contested one year under the umbrella of the architecture competition.

Lest you think the arts’ inclusion odd—one wonders what muscles need stretching before going for gold in watercolor—the submissions had to be at least about sports.

The Olympic committee ought to bring these events back. Well, maybe not town planning—but add trivia to the mix instead. Organizers can throw in a few sports questions for good measure, but with trivia, if you’re not working up a sweat thinking, you’re not doing it right.

And by the way, did you know that the Andersonville prison popularized the word deadline? Before it came to mean “due date,” the word had a gory, literal meaning: Prisoners at Andersonville and camps like it who crossed a certain boundary marked on the ground—the deadline—would be shot without warning. As dispatches emerged from Andersonville toward the end of the Civil War, understanding of (and horror at) the term quickly spread.

By the 1920s, newspapers had taken up the “do not cross” meaning to describe the time by which they had to finalize their next edition, and the rest of the world took the papers’ lead.

And by the way, did you know that—well, where to begin with Ashgabat? The massive statue of Niyazov is, like, the ninth thing you notice about the city.

All the marble hits visitors first. The capital has nearly 550 buildings clad in white marble, the highest concentration anywhere in the world. Combine that with the desert setting and the wide avenues that international visitors report as spotless and eerily empty, and you get an otherworldly effect.

Hoping to get around the ghostly city? Enjoy your ride in a white car; darkly colored cars are outlawed. You can head to the airport modeled on a flying white falcon, or to the world’s largest enclosed Ferris wheel, made of white steel. There is also the massive (white) Palace of Happiness, which can accommodate seven weddings at once. And in case you were wondering, brides in the country typically wear—got you here!—red.

And by the way, did you know that humans have a bone that does not connect to any other? We think of the skeleton as pretty contiguous, but in the middle of the neck, the hyoid bone, which supports the base of the tongue, is articulated only distantly to the rest of the skeleton by muscles and ligaments. It is, as scientists call it, a “floating bone.”

Because it’s not readily attachable, the hyoid is often left off of model skeletons. High-end ones hang it with string or wire.

            <div id="article-text">“If Liberals Won’t Enforce Borders, Fascists Will.”

So warned my colleague David Frum in the headline of an April 2019 article about America’s failure to control mass immigration. “Demagogues rise by talking about issues that matter to people, and that more conventional leaders appear unwilling or unable to address,” he wrote. “If difficult issues go unaddressed by responsible leaders, they will be exploited by irresponsible ones.”

That thesis looked shaky in 2020. Voters declined to reelect Donald Trump; for the first time in more than 50 years, Gallup found that Americans who wanted immigration to increase outnumbered those who wanted it to decrease––a seeming rebuke of Trump’s cruel family-separation policy and attacks on Mexicans and Muslims––and that 77 percent said immigration is a good thing for the United States. Then Joe Biden failed to control the southern border and presided over record surges in unlawful entries. By 2024, a majority wanted less immigration, Trump won the presidency while promising the biggest mass deportation in U.S. history, and an analysis of why voters rejected Kamala Harris found that “too many immigrants crossed the border” was nearly tied for the top reason.

Today, Frum’s warning seems prescient: The Trump administration has deployed a force of aggressive masked officers onto American streets while promising “retribution.” They’ve detained, pepper-sprayed, assaulted, shot, and killed Americans. And high-ranking officials have repeatedly gotten caught lying about events captured by citizen video footage.

A majority now disapproves of Trump’s handling of immigration. Perhaps Democrats will prevail in their current efforts to force ICE officers to take off their masks and get warrants, or even win back Congress as a result––the MAGA coalition is no less vulnerable than the left to voter backlash. But a Democratic victory in 2026 is not likely to end this cycle, in which majorities hate how both parties handle immigration and ping-pong unhappily between them.

I have covered immigration politics and policy for 25 years; here’s my sense of five basic truths that lawmakers need to acknowledge if they want to implement immigration policy that is both popular and in the nation’s best interest.

1. Even many of those Americans who say that they want to deport all immigrants who are here illegally would likely not stand by that position in practice.  Lots of MAGA supporters insist that deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally is a prudent goal. Some argue that conserving the rule of law requires doing so. “I don’t care if it’s a grandma who’s been here for 23 years and sits quietly on her porch all day long,” the populist-right pundit Walter Curt wrote. “We either have laws or we don’t, we either have borders or we don’t, there is no middle ground.”  Although superficially seductive, that logic is monomaniacal. In the real world, federal laws are enforced by presidents in a manner that predictably fails to catch anything close to 100 percent of lawbreakers, because resources are scarce, trade-offs are real, and maximalist outcomes are simply incompatible with limited government.

Consider the example of tax law. Most Americans abhor tax cheats. But they, and especially most conservatives, would oppose deploying thousands of masked, armed IRS agents into whatever American neighborhoods the president fancies and allowing them to search houses, workplaces, and private papers to catch all the tax cheats.

Yes, lots of Americans tell pollsters that they want every immigrant who came here illegally deported, but how many would stick to that position if told that it would require house-to-house raids, or that the federal government must choose between spending limited funds on apprehending undocumented grandmothers who stayed after their work visas and spending on other societal needs, such as finding a cure for cancer or paying down the national debt?

2. A majority of Americans support some level of immigration enforcement, particularly for unauthorized immigrants who commit violent crimes.

If excessive immigration enforcement is incompatible with liberty, insufficient immigration enforcement is incompatible with representative democracy––Republicans are correct that our immigration laws were duly enacted, and every plausible read of election results and polling data confirms that Americans favor some meaningful level of immigration enforcement.

Americans’ preferences are clearest on the question of immigrants in the country illegally who have been convicted of violent crimes: According to an Associated Press poll, 83 percent of Americans strongly or somewhat favor deporting them, a position that is also held by 79 percent of Democrats. The persistence of contrary policies in some Democrat-controlled jurisdictions is harmful to public safety and the political interests of that coalition.

I support sanctuary cities insofar as that means that local police don’t enforce immigration law, because they want residents to cooperate with law enforcement. But it doesn’t follow that jailers should refuse all cooperation with deportations. If you favor any immigration enforcement at all, who better to focus on than incarcerated bad actors, who can be found without spending any money on searches or deploying federal officers among the public?

3. Refugee crises will happen––and every response likely to satisfy the public requires prior planning.

Perhaps the most difficult challenge on immigration is what to do with large, sudden surges of people. The future will bring wars, natural disasters, regime collapses, famines, and more. Barring entry to desperate refugees seems cruel, but letting in large, unanticipated flows of foreigners can cause voters in democracies to feel overwhelmed and empower authoritarians. Escaping this dysfunctional cycle is in the interests of restrictionists and inclusionists alike. All potential solutions come with challenges, but none is more formidable than the status quo. The future will confront us with many such crises. We need a plan.

4. Even many Americans who argue for a stricter immigration policy find the demonization of immigrants concerning.

It is one thing to deport people and another thing to vilify them while doing so. In my youth, the Republican Party was explicit about the goodness and humanity of most immigrants––see, for example, the way that Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush talked about the issue in 1980. Bush noted that “honorable, decent, family-loving people” were in violation of the law.  Today, in an America where there are many more immigrants, lawful and not, and where violent crime is lower than it was for the entire 1980s and ’90s, data suggest that unauthorized immigrants commit felonies at lower rates than U.S. citizens and immigrants who are authorized to be here. Obviously, some do commit murders and other serious crimes, but it is misleading and incendiary to talk about the entire class as if a large share are violent criminals, or to treat particular ethnic groups as scapegoats for citizens’ financial struggles. Many Americans find such talk unnerving and distasteful.

That is not mere political correctness. It is rooted in the fact that U.S. history is rife with examples of the demonization of ethnic-minority groups preceding mob violence against them. I hope America is beyond atrocities like the Los Angeles Chinese massacre, the World War I–era lynching of ethnic Germans, and the Zoot Suit Riots. But humans today are no more evolved than the perpetrators of those atrocities. Insofar as we’re less likely to participate in mob attacks, it’s because of the existence of cultural guardrails—the very ones that the MAGA coalition is dismantling.

5. Every high-immigration country has citizens who fear immigration and immigrants. They are least likely to sow dysfunction when their predispositions are understood and to some degree accommodated.

The United States has no choice but to tolerate people who fear immigration and immigrants. Although many humans enjoy diversity, a percentage of people in all countries and racial and demographic groups are psychologically uncomfortable with difference. Their discomfort may be to some degree innate, and they are either unable or unwilling to change.

America should never allow its xenophobes to persecute immigrants or violate their rights. But people who hold anti-immigrant views are fellow citizens who influence our culture, politics, and public policy––and we can influence whether they do so in ways that are better or worse for immigrants.

In The Authoritarian Dynamic, the social psychologist Karen Stenner explains how people with a latent predisposition to authoritarianism get triggered, and how best to respond to preserve a pluralistic society. Her work suggests that liberals should stop framing immigration as a celebration of multicultural difference and instead emphasize ways in which immigrants are just like the rest of us: people who seek safety, opportunity, and a better future for their family. These framings can better assuage the fears of those with xenophobic tendencies, she argues. Stenner suggests that countries implement practical assimilationist policies, such as encouraging and assisting with English fluency. She argues that immigration is most sustainable—and backlash against it least likely to succeed—when inflows of new immigrants are controlled, and subject to known limits rather than unlimited in a way that feels unpredictable.

As she puts it in her book, insisting on unconstrained diversity “pushes those by nature least equipped to live comfortably in a liberal democracy not to the limits of their tolerance, but to their intolerant extremes.” And once a society’s authoritarians are activated, the outcome depends in part on how its conservatives react. If they side with authoritarians, repressive policies follow. But under the right conditions, conservatives can be counted on to rally behind pluralism and tolerance. One condition is that they feel reassured “regarding established brakes on the pace of change, and the settled rules of the game,” Stenner writes.

If Democrats or Republicans hope to create sustainable immigration policy, that policy must roughly reflect the public will. Instead of efforts to alter public opinion through persuasion, we’ve seen a succession of fringe factions forcing extremist positions on majorities that hate them. Politicians from both parties should moderate according to what voters actually want. Otherwise, endless political failures risk causing many to lose faith in all politics––which is an existential danger to our democracy.</div>

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, David opens with his reaction to the racist AI video of Barack and Michelle Obama that was posted and quickly deleted by President Trump’s Truth Social account. He argues that when the president engages in this behavior, it undermines his administration’s other actions that resemble those of a normal presidency.

David is then joined by Stephen Richer, a former Republican county recorder of Maricopa County. They discuss Stephen’s experience navigating Trump’s 2020 election denial, standing up to pressure from the president, and confronting election denialism within his own party. They also examine the Trump administration’s current activities in Georgia and how they could set the stage for more election denialism in 2026.

Finally, David reflects on Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire as the series marks its 250th anniversary. Though the monumental work remains essential to understanding the fall of Rome, David explores how Gibbon’s moralizing of history can lead modern readers to dangerous conclusions.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome back to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest this week will be Stephen Richer, formerly recorder of Maricopa County, Arizona, the chief election official in the city of Phoenix in the swing state of Arizona, and we’ll be discussing election integrity and the threats to election integrity—the conspiracy theories and lies that are told about elections past, and that present a threat to the integrity of free and fair elections in 2026.

My book this week is The [History of the] Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which I choose because this month, February 2026, marks the 250th anniversary of the publication of the first volume of that famous book in February 1776. There are six volumes altogether, the last published in 1788, but February 1776 announces the arrival of this tremendous achievement of historical research and English literary triumph.

Before turning to either the dialogue or the book, I wanna begin with some thoughts about a very upsetting thing that happened over the past few days, and that is the posting on the social-media account of the president of the United States of a scurrilous, racist, insulting, and stupid video about the past president of the United States President Barack Obama and his wife, former First Lady Michelle Obama.

I’m sure many of you have seen the video or images of it; you know what I’m talking about. You’ve heard the many stories that the Trump White House has told, many contradictory stories about how this came to be. I’m not interested in decoding which of those stories is closest to the truth or furthest from a lie, and I’m not interested in adding my voice, one more condemnation to this offensive and stupid act. The whole country has reverberated with condemnation, which is right and just, and I’ll say I agree. What more can be said?  But there is a deeper thing going on here that does deserve some comment. Race, of course, is the fundamental chasm, a fundamental wound in American society, and moving toward a more just racial constitution of the United States has been the work—oh, well, it’s been a work that you cannot date when it begins and you cannot date when it ends. It goes on and continues to this day. But the society is changing, and a new racial constitution has been coming into being. Right now, about 93 million Americans are either immigrants themselves or the children of immigrants; that’s almost a third of the country. It’s a different country than it was when the Civil Rights Act was passed or when the affirmative-action programs of the 1970s began to be devised. In the half century since those affirmative-action programs have come to be devised, the racial fabric of America has been reinvented in many ways. And one of the questions that we’re all left [with] in the 2020s is whether these programs of racial restitution continue to make sense in a country that is so different from the country that existed when these programs were put into place.

Now, it has fallen in the Trump administration’s time to respond to these changes. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled, in important decisions, that it is more and more skeptical of programs of racial preference to correct for past racial injustice. In 2023, a pair of cases ruled that preferential treatment of undergraduates seeking admission to colleges is probably almost always illegal. And the Trump administration, in one of its more normal actions, something that you would expect from a more normal kind of government, has followed up, or responded to this, the lead of the Supreme Court, by issuing executive orders rolling back preferential treatment in many areas of employment and hiring. And many American companies have responded by changing their approach to equal opportunity. They’re ending the practice of trying to ameliorate past injustice by having preferences in the present and moving toward an approach that treats all applicants more equally than they have been treated in the recent past.

I must say, I regard this as progress. I think this is the right way to go. I think it’s the only way to go in a country where, as I say, 93 million people are immigrants or the children of immigrants to whom America’s tortured racial history was something that happened before their families arrived on these shores, and they don’t understand why their life chances should be abridged or artificially boosted because of something that happened in a past that was not their own familial, personal past. It’s not sustainable in such a country to treat people from certain backgrounds more favorably and people from other backgrounds less favorably. It’s not sustainable, and it will only inflame feelings that are already touchy enough. But the administration that has the job of bringing us to a more perfect union, of restoring more equal treatment, of finding some way forward from the preferential programs of the past, it is absolutely indispensable that such an administration show itself in every respect to be animated by ideals of equal treatment, racial fairness, justice for all.

When the president is acting like some kind of internet troll, some kind of Klansman with access to an AI machine, he discredits everything that his administration is doing that looks like something that another administration might also do. He ratifies every allegation of every critic of that administration, of every critic of the Supreme Court, of every critic of anyone who has ever held out for equal treatment under law by saying, You know what? The president is obviously motivated by racial animus. He’s overseeing these acts of racial profiling by a paramilitary force that is masked and poorly trained and poorly led; and that is apprehending people because they don’t like the way their accent sounds, they don’t like the look of their face, and sending them to prisons, where they’re held without due process for weeks and months; that is sending children under the age of 10 to similar kinds of camps—in every way that this administration tries to prove that it is indeed motivated by the worst, ugliest, most primitive kinds of prejudice. And then it asks Americans to trust it as it dismantles outdated correctives to the prejudices of the past. This isn’t sustainable either.

If you are going to attain equal justice, you have to do it by treating people equally; I believe that. I think the Supreme Court, its decisions on these matters have been broadly correct. I think it’s going in the right direction. And I think that the critiques of past diversity programs, maybe they were not as powerful at the beginning as they are at the end, but by the 2020s, they remain very powerful. And there are 93 million people to whom all of this has to seem oppressive, unfair, and none of their concern. But if we’re going to get from here to there, we can’t be poisoned by the kind of talk that comes off the president’s social-media page and comes from the lips of the people around him. The people who lead the government must be seen to be just for anyone to believe in the justice of what they do. And this is one case of so many where even the parts of the Trump administration’s agenda that some people might like, that even I might like, are disqualified and discredited by the Trump administration’s own actions and by the president’s own personality.

It’s so tragic. It’s so unnecessary. It’s so ugly. It’s so stupid. It’s so shameful. It just makes you wince and say, Why does it have to be like this? Why can’t it be better? Why can’t we be having a politics that is productive? Why can’t we be talking about things that matter? Why do we have to have people who act like children and adolescents at their worst when we are discussing the things that matter most, or should matter most, to us all?

And now my dialogue with Stephen Richer. But first, a quick break.

Frum: Stephen Richer was elected recorder of Maricopa County, Arizona, in November of 2020, and served in that role from the 1st of January 2021 to the end of December 2024. Maricopa, of course, is the county around the city of Phoenix, the biggest city in what has become a crucial swing state, and the recorder is the most important election official in that county.

Richer, a Republican, held firm against President [Donald] Trump’s conspiracy theories and wild allegations against the election of 2020, and then faced another round of such allegations in 2022 and another round again in 2024, when Kari Lake was on the ballot, first for Arizona governor and then for the United States senator from Arizona. Richer now writes, teaches, and practices law. He’s a native of the state of Utah, a graduate of Tulane and the University of Chicago, from which he holds both his law degree and also an M.A.

I got to know Stephen as a regular contributor to my Frum Forum website in the 2010s. He’s a man of steadfast courage, and it’s a pleasure to welcome him to The David Frum Show at a time when the Trump administration is mounting a renewed attack on the independence and integrity of the American voting system.

Stephen Richer: Thank you very much. Thanks for all you taught me previously, and it’s good to be back. My wife keeps saying, When do you think these invitations are gonna dry up? And then President Trump does something related to elections, and I get another round of interviews and invitations, so it’s good for business.

Frum: So long as he’s crazy, you’ll be employed.

Frum: (Laughs.) Or you’ll be busy anyway because you have a new life away from all of this madness. But let’s start with your first exposure to the madness. So you take office on the 1st of January of 2021, minutes before the attack on Congress, in the throes of all of these denunciations of the integrity of the vote, especially in your state. What was that like in 2021?

Richer: It was surreal because so many people were asking things about the 2020 election, and I was just getting into this office. I was still figuring out, basically, how to dial out of the office, who works in different spots in the office. COVID’s going on. It’s an office of 160 people; I’m just trying to get to know everyone’s faces. And meanwhile, we have January 6 that happens, and then we have protesters outside of our facility. We have some of my erstwhile allies saying that my office had participated in stealing the 2020 election. And then, by my second week, I had been subpoenaed from the Arizona Senate for all of the materials relating to the 2020 election, and that began the whole endeavor known as the Cyber Ninjas forensic audit. And (Laughs.) boy, we spent a whole year going over 2020, and it was a lot.

Frum: Because you were a Republican and always have been a Republican, people in the president’s camp were looking to you to agree with their story, however farcical it was, and you didn’t.

Richer: That’s right. Well, I was very patient with it, and a lot of the people who were coming to me with these allegations were people who I considered friends, they were supporters, and so they were people who I presumed to have good-faith questions about election administration. And I thought that if I dug in, if I researched them, and if I got them answers, and I did it in a way that was polite, and if I did it in a way that was factual, that this would just be a scientific process, and we would have questions, and we would have answers, and we would move on. It took me a while, but maybe a year into the process, I realized that was not going to be the case.

Frum: Yeah. I’ll say here, as someone who’s known you for a while and then watched you or observed you in your public presence, in these public interactions, you’re a very nonfiery personality. You are very patient and low-key, and you agree to take seriously a lot of things that—people will say, I had a vision. It came to me in a dream. The ballots are hidden in a vault underneath a lake. And you would say, Okay, can you give me the GPS location of the vault and the lake? (Laughs.) And you never lost your cool, but the allegations just got wilder and wilder, didn’t they?

Richer: They did, and more than that, they seemed adverse, they seemed stubborn to getting any answers, and eventually, I just realized, You don’t want answers from me. You don’t want me to investigate. You just want me to affirm what you want to believe to be true. And that was very saddening to me because I come from a world in which the epistemological process is highly valued, in which man is a rational creature and things can be scientifically discovered. And so why did I try to be nice? I tried to be nice because I don’t think anyone has ever persuaded somebody else by telling them that they’re an idiot, even though it might be satisfying to say. And I tried to be nice just so that when I look back on my actions throughout this whole affair, I can hopefully at least feel good that I wasn’t too terribly mean to people. I’ve had a few moments where I’ve slipped, but I think I’ve done pretty well.

Frum: Now, you make the point that what was especially frustrating about these allegations was it was not one allegation that people would dig in and stick to, no matter all the contrary evidence. It was a series of contradictory allegations, and each time one fell apart, another would manifest itself, and then it would fall apart, and then there would be another, and it was just a wild series of mutually contradictory—always the same answer, but never the same explanation.

Richer: That’s right, and you’re on the internet, I think, a healthy amount, but you’re on the internet enough to see that a lot of these claims keep popping up. It’s like Whac-a-Mole. And weirdly, the burden of proof always seems to be on those of us who won all the court cases, those of us who won all of the audits, and yet it’s on us to disprove every single wild-eyed allegation. I really hate that framework—I think it should instead be on the movant, so to speak, on the people who are alleging the thing, to have to bear the burden of proof. But what I do is: Somebody throws out a claim, I investigate it, and then I disprove it, and then they move on to another one. And it’s frustrating, and it’s exhausting, and again, it just goes to the fact that a lot of these people aren’t looking for facts; a lot of these people are just looking for affirmation of their beliefs. But my mentality is that if there’s still people out there who are looking for facts, then I wanna give it to them.

Frum: Let’s bring this forward to the present because the reason all of this is suddenly so very, very urgent is not just that we’ve had this ever-continuing claim by Donald Trump, where he says things like, I won the state of Minnesota three times, when he won it no times. And you might think, Okay, well he’s just a deluded old man who happens to be president, and that’s probably not even the most harmful, untrue thing he believes. He is president now—no one doubts that—and he wasn’t president for the four years after the election he lost, and that’s history. But right now, the president and his supporters, including the director of national intelligence, are engaged in an attack on the voting system in Georgia in 2026, with an eye to what looks like some scheme to distort or twist the elections that are expected in November of this year. You have written about what you think may be going on. What’s going on?

Richer: We don’t know. I think we’re gonna find out more in the next 48 hours because the affidavit for the warrant in Fulton County, Georgia, is going to be unsealed, and that could give us a better idea of what motivated this FBI search, what allowed the judge to be convinced that they had probable cause that a crime had been committed. But I don’t know to what ends. Is it really just to pursue one or two people and try to charge them with a crime? Is it with the goal of claiming that the 2020 election should be, I don’t know, undone for—sort of like when they find out that a football team had actually used drugs or had paid players and they strike off the championship from the historical records, and this way, they’ll strike off Joe Biden’s 2020 victory from the historical records? Or is it for stuff moving forward? I’m not sure, but this is unprecedented territory. Sure, Donald Trump and others have done a lot to cast doubt on our election system, but this is the first time where the entire machinery of law enforcement of the federal government has mobilized and has gone into a county.

Frum: Well, one thing that you hear said that they may be thinking of is, in the wilder precincts of election denialism in 2020 and 2021, there was a fantasy that the government of Venezuela, not a known technological leader, but that somehow had magic technology, which allowed it to change the outcome of votes in the United States. And now there has been the Trump raid into Venezuela, which a lot of us hoped would be some effort to restore Venezuela democracy, but, no, it’s just a kidnapping of one of the thugs who runs Venezuela, leaving all the other thugs intact. But the election aspect is, some people speculate that what Trump has in mind is take Nicolás Maduro, former dictator, put him in front of an American court, and have the prosecutors—the ones who have not resigned because they have integrity, but the ones who remain who don’t—have them say, Dictator Maduro, you can either spend the rest of your life in an American jail, or we can let you go, if you just affirm this crazy idea we have that magic Venezuelan technology changed the results in 2020. Does any of that sound like something that could happen?

Richer: So some of your listeners might be like, What the heck is David talking about? What is he making up? This is so facially ludicrous that nobody would believe this. But people do believe this. This is born out of a theory from the 2020 election that two election technology companies, Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems, had connections to [former Venezuelan President] Hugo Chávez, who had somehow gotten in cahoots with those companies to rig future elections, and that this tabulation equipment flipped votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. And I should say that we know this isn’t true because 98 percent of Americans vote on paper ballots and those paper ballots can’t be hacked and they are hand-count audited after the election. Nonetheless, people believe this, and so some people think that, Oh my gosh, the reason we went to Venezuela, the reason that we extracted Maduro isn’t because of narcoterrorism, isn’t because of opioids in American streets, isn’t because of wanting to get their oil, but is because finally, the plot will be uncovered to steal the 2020 election.

And so if you’re Nicolás Maduro and you’re sitting there in, I think, presumably not the nicest conditions, I think he’s gotta be thinking about this as potentially a golden ticket out because you and I know, and many [who] are surrounding Trump know, that the one way that you can get in his good grace, no matter what misdeed you have committed in the past, is that you can tell him that he certainly has never lost an election and that the 2020 election was stolen from him. This has just been a path for so many people to get appointments, a path for other people to get pardons, a path for people to get business negotiations. Even right now, Tina Peters, the Mesa County clerk who committed a number of felonies under state law in Colorado, but they were done in the name of Donald Trump winning the 2020 election, he’s pulling out all the stops to try to get her out of prison in Colorado, and I think it could even extend to a mass murderer like Maduro.

Frum: Well, Trump let out the former president of Honduras, who’s one of the biggest drug dealers in the world. That wasn’t about the election. By the way, in the Tina Peters case, she was convicted under state law, correct? So Trump can’t just pardon her—he has to muscle the state of Colorado into somehow releasing her.

Richer: But it’s extraordinary what he’s doing right now. He’s pulling funds from Colorado. He vetoed a water bill that was very important to the residents of Colorado. He’s calling [Governor] Jared Polis a terrible person on a regular basis. And so he will leverage whatever power he has. And in the instance of Maduro, he does have much more power than he has over Tina Peters.

Frum: Now, let’s go to the forward-looking part of this. Are we seeing in Georgia some kind of dress rehearsal for using the muscle of the federal government and the military or other assets to intervene in state-run elections in 2026, and try to stave off what otherwise looks like a likely Republican defeat if the elections are allowed to be free and fair? And the scheme seems to be: Find some way, by looking backwards to 2020, to prevent the elections of 2026 from being free and fair.

Richer: Yeah, I don’t know. I don’t know how much of this is about Trump’s ego and about looking backwards. You had the president of the Brennan Center on previously. He’s somebody who has said that this is about looking forwards—this is about the 2026 election; this is about the 2028 election. But your guess is as good or better than mine, and so is this a dress rehearsal for involving the federal government in ways that never would’ve been before contemplated?

And I’ll say that, over the last few months, I’ve ordinarily been pretty reluctant to embrace any sort of theory that Donald Trump can manipulate the 2026 elections. People normally talk about stationing ICE at a few voting locations, or they talk about him pulling federal funding from cybersecurity programs. And to those allegations, or to those concerns, I usually say, Well, at the end of the day, the counties run elections. They’re run by bipartisan teams. They have a lot of checks and balances built into the process. And they’re gonna be administered. But this is the first instance in which I could begin to believe that something truly spectacular is going to happen in which our 2026 midterm elections are not administered like past elections have been.

Frum: Well, let me ask you because you sat in the chair; you ran the office. You know the very minute details of how elections are administered, something most of us don’t pay attention to, because we just think we’ll go vote. The votes get counted. We believe what they say. Sometimes the one we want wins, and we’re happy. And sometimes the one we want doesn’t win, and we say, Wait ’til next time. But going inside the box, supposing you—I’m not going to ask you to say anything that, probably, the people who would abuse this information don’t already know—but you’re at a tabletop exercise, and you’re invited, in the name of election-hardening, to say, We want you to play the other team. We want you to play the leader of the team that is trying to cheat in 2026. On the basis of your knowledge, what would be your scheme for interventions to sway the result against the will of the people in 2026 if you had to tabletop that exercise?

Richer: Yeah, so we do a fair amount of this, actually, within a number of different election communities, and I always fall back on where I think President Trump is most potent is still in the post-election procedures, still in sowing doubt in the minds of enough Americans that they don’t think the elections are legitimate and, therefore, I don’t know, they don’t have to recognize the new elected officials, or the Congress doesn’t have to seat its new members. That’s certainly a popular theory that’s floating about: that Speaker Mike Johnson, the outgoing speaker, will choose not to seat the new members, because they’re in allegedly disputed elections.

I find that to be much more plausible than, We’re gonna go in, and we’re gonna tip over every single tabulation machine so that those can’t be used, and then there’s just pandemonium because they have to do hand-count auditing. Or: We’re going to try to send the FBI to run the 9,000 different voting jurisdictions in the United States. Our election system is just so disaggregated, so driven by state law, so driven by local nuances, that I think it would be very, very challenging for the federal government to really take over here.

Frum: Well, a lot depends on whether the ’26 elections are close or not close. If we’re in a true wave, and 40 seats are changing hands, and the Senate is changing majority, probably, at that point, if you try to send the FBI to do something, it would be both hopeless, but it would also look obviously illegitimate. But if it’s not 40 seats that are changing hands but just six, and you have an idea in the week before the election which those six are likely to be, could you do something then? Could you send Tulsi Gabbard and the FBI to Charlotte and Tucson and a few chosen jurisdictions and seize machines there? Would that have any positive outcome for them, or is it still hopeless?

Richer: Yeah, so I think that is a scenario that’s been discussed, where you don’t go to every 9,000 voting jurisdictions. You don’t go to all the precincts. You certainly don’t go to all the polling places. But you do go to the competitive swing races for the United States House, and you do something to disrupt them. And perhaps, in that instance, you could present law enforcement on such a significant level that election administrators would just have to throw their hands up and say, We can’t operate in this environment, or We can’t operate without our machinery, such that you can never get a conclusive result. I still don’t know how, at the end of the day, you make the ballot say something different than what they said. But just seizing everything and not even allowing the process to go on, that would be pretty extraordinary, but that would have, obviously, a disruptive effect, and then I guess we would never really know who won those contests.

And I think that this is especially vulnerable in California, where California usually takes about two weeks to complete their count because almost everyone votes by mail, and a large percentage of people either drop off their mail ballot on Election Day or they even mail it, they postmark it, on Election Day and then it doesn’t even arrive until several days later. And so if the administration already knows that it’s gonna come down to just a few swing districts in California, moves in there—California, of course, is already ready to be seen as sort of the liberal boogeyman, and so maybe the narrative writes better there.

Frum: Based on your experience in Arizona, how far down this highway will other Republican officials go? When Donald Trump and the people around him and Kari Lake were saying these crazy things about the elections in your state, did most Republican officeholders sort of shrug wearily, or did they say, Well, it may not be true, but it’s our team that’s saying the thing that is not true, so we have to be full throated?

Richer: Do not underestimate the importance of politics for a politician. David Mayhew said politicians are “single-minded seekers of reelection,” and I learned that when I got into office. And Republicans care about the opinion of Donald Trump because he is uniquely powerful within the Republican Party. And so almost every single Republican that I spoke with after the 2020 election, in terms of elected Republicans, knew that there was very little to Donald Trump’s allegations of a stolen election. At best, they stayed quiet. At worst, they went full-throated along with it because they knew it was a path to political riches, whether higher office or fundraising and so on and so forth. And so I was just consistently disappointed at how few people there were who were willing to stand up and say, No, two plus two still equals four, even if the president doesn’t want it to be so.

Frum: How robust are the state courts and the federal courts in election administration?

Richer: So I do think that this is one thing that we can take some solace in and that was very consistent and strong from 2020 onward, is that—I know that people take issue with courts of appeals and with the United States Supreme Court on some highly politicized issues, but in terms of election denialism, in terms of saying that, for instance, again, that Dominion tabulation was connected to Hugo Chávez, there was not a single state or federal court that indulged those fanciful lies. And so still, I think that if there’s one place where we consistently win because we have all the facts and we have all the law, it’s in the courts. And so I still have put great faith in the courts, I still have a lot of confidence in the courts, and I do think that that is one of the bulwarks against anything that might happen in the 2026 election.

Frum: Can you decode the role? How is it that the director of national intelligence has any role in anything to do with an election?

Richer: Well, I think all the formalities and lines have been blurred quite a bit in the Trump administration, and even this one is a bit confusing because President Trump said that he had no idea why Tulsi Gabbard was there. And then the next day, at the National Prayer Breakfast, he said, Well, Pam—being Pam Bondi, the attorney general—had asked her to be there. And then a number of other people have had shifting analysis as to whether or not she was supposed to be there and what she’s been doing there. But I think Tulsi Gabbard realizes, as many have realized before her, that Donald Trump cares deeply about this and less important than coloring within the lines, or only doing what is within your purview, is showing Donald Trump that you care about this and doing “something about it.” And so I think that, for her positioning within the Trump administration, it was a smart move. Now, will he eventually expect her to produce something? There, I think, she could be in a little more challenging position because I think that most of this is being done by the Justice Department and the FBI, and they would say, maybe, This is our stuff; butt out. But I think being there certainly helped her in Trump world.

Frum: Yeah. The FBI is an institution that is being broken before our eyes as well, and good officers are being driven out; bad officers are being hired. The FBI is being turned into an arm of very, very partisan justice. How much confidence do you have in them? And you’ve seen them in Arizona—what do you think is likely to happen in 2026?

Richer: I have a lot of confidence in the FBI and the Department of Justice as it previously existed, and I still have a lot of confidence in a lot of the people there. These people are amazing. They really believe in the role of the agencies. They believe in doing justice. They’re highly professional. They’re highly skilled. Unfortunately, as you said, those people are leaving. And if you look at The New York Times story, I think, just a day or two ago about what’s going on with the applications to the Department of Justice, it’s very telling. One, the number of applications is way down, and they’re struggling to recruit the same high-quality, high-caliber people that they were previously. And two, as part of the application process, applicants have to answer questions about which parts of the Trump agenda they like most, how they will advance the Trump agenda, and this is just so anathema to anyone who really believed in the Justice Department’s mission and the FBI’s mission that I do think it will have a corrosive effect. I just don’t know how long it will take to get to the tipping point where those are the types of people who are running ops.

Frum: What is the SAVE Act, and why do the Republicans care about it so much?

Richer: Yeah, there’s a few pieces of legislation right now that Republicans are trying to put forward to supposedly close gaps in problems that they see with election administration. One’s the SAVE Act, one’s the SAVE America Act, and one’s the Make Elections Great Again Act.

The SAVE Act is aimed primarily at proof of citizenship when registering to vote. So under the National Voter Registration Act, the NVRA, which was passed in the ’90s, if you wanna vote in elections in the United States under federal law, you just have to attest under penalty of law that you are a United States citizen—you don’t have to show documented proof of citizenship. The Republicans wanna change that such that you have to show either a passport or a birth certificate when registering to vote. Now, I actually think that there’s something to that idea. I don’t think that’s an unduly onerous burden. But the way in which they’ve drafted it is problematic, the way in which they’re trying to impose it is problematic, and there’s also a lot of states’ rights people who say, Well, I actually think that this should be best left to the states.

Frum: And there is also something about this that is a little, like, politicians are older than they used to be—like, not dealing with the present-day America. If the vote were restricted to people who have a valid passport for international travel, wouldn’t that skew the electorate much more toward the Democrats than toward the Republicans? In 1996, having a passport probably did indicate you were a Republican leaner, but not in 2026.

Richer: So I should first say that this is predicated oftentimes on a false notion that there are large numbers of noncitizens who are participating in American elections, and that’s simply not true. It’s not true both by the number of people who have been prosecuted for this, but it’s also not true because a number of states, even in recent weeks, have affirmatively investigated the number of noncitizens on their rolls—I wrote about this in The New York Times—and just, simply, the numbers aren’t there.

And then, secondly, yes, I’m not even sure that the political calculus is right. As you’ve noted before, the demographics of the Republican Party have materially changed, even from where they were in 2016. Republicans are no longer the disproportionately educated, disproportionately affluent country-club party that maybe we once envisioned them [to be], and they are actually potentially less likely to have passports because they’re not living in coastal cities and taking those international trips. And so I do think that that’s another curious wrinkle to the SAVE Act. Now, maybe Republicans would say, Well, that’s not our goal here, and Our goal is just to further secure elections. I would say we need to clean up how it’s being done technically, and I still don’t think that there’s a great justification for it.And a lot of people say, Well, Stephen, voter ID polls really well, and I say, It does—this is not voter ID. Again, voter identification is what you do when you show up to vote, and you take, usually, a driver’s license, and you say, I am the person who is registered to vote. SAVE Act is about, when you first register to vote, whether or not you have proof of citizenship, which might, as David said, be a passport, or it might be a birth certificate.

Frum: So what are the other acts that the Republicans are interested in?

Richer: So the MEGA Act does things like—it’s this whole laundry list of sort of things that the Republicans have talked about in the elections context for a while, stuff like banning ranked-choice voting, stuff like banning states from sending out mail ballots to all registered voters, things like banning states from allowing mail ballots to come back after Election Day if they’ve been postmarked on Election Day. So my complaint against this isn’t necessarily policy item for policy item, but it is very much a federalization of election administration. And if there’s one thing that separates sort of the Trump camp from the [Senator Mitch] McConnell camp is the McConnell camp would say, It was wrong when Democrats tried to do it with H.R. 1 in 2021, it was wrong when I probably looked at this way back earlier in my political career, and it’s wrong now. And the Trump people would say, We want to change election administration. We wanna do it through executive order, even. And if we can’t do it through executive order, then we wanna do it through federal legislation.

Frum: Well, I think there are also Republicans that are in the group of: We remember a world where Republicans were more likely to have a passport than Democrats were, but that was a world of long ago; we’re mad about mail-in ballots because they helped Biden in 2020, because, in 2020, there was a special circumstance where people who took COVID seriously were more likely to vote by mail than people who didn’t take COVID seriously and Democrats were more likely to take COVID seriously than Republicans. But what also seems weird about this, for Republicans to make such a fetish of it now, is in normal times, who is most likely to vote by mail? Active-duty military personnel and older people. So you’d think, Well, gee, if I’m a Republican, why do I wanna make that more difficult?

Richer: Well, this is an irony, and in Arizona, it was the “[John] McCain machine” that we used to call it that really, really got mail voting down to a science for a while. And it was all the people, we like to say, in Sun City or out in Gilbert, which are sort of towns further removed from the central core of Phoenix, who didn’t wanna go into a voting location, who didn’t wanna get out of their 55-plus communities, who wanted to mail in their ballots, and so a lot of these narratives have flipped. It’s interesting to somebody like me, who’s been watching this for a little while. It’s not always rational. But I’m trying to meet it where it is.

Frum: Yeah. These are things—you can debate the SAVE Act, you can debate these other measures, in a way you can’t debate someone who believes that Hugo Chávez, from beyond the grave, is tampering with American voting dials.

Richer: That’s right. And again, my complaint with the SAVE Act is often about the predicate, the false predicate, which is that large numbers of noncitizens are voting in our elections. And that, again, that has been demonstrated time and time again to be false. Now, absolutely, we can have a public-policy debate about what’s the appropriate amount of documentation for proof of citizenship—public-policy debate. But too often in the Trump world in election administration, we’re debating facts that shouldn’t have to be debated.

Frum: Let’s wrap this up with—take us back to what happens on a voting day in most of America. So you show up, you stand in line, you execute your vote however your county does it, and then you leave. And then you don’t think about it until you turn on the TV. What happens after you leave that room?

Richer: So if you vote at a voting location, you’ll either fill in your ballot with a hand mark—you’ll hand mark it with pen, and you’ll fill in the ovals—or you’ll have a touch screen, and then it’ll print a piece of paper. And then you’ll feed it into a tabulator at the voting location.

Frum: Let me pause you right there. So even though you’ve used a machine to generate the ballot, the ballot remains a paper ballot.

Richer: Correct. Again, so 98 percent of Americans have a paper ballot of some form, whether that’s filling it in yourself by hand, or whether that’s touching ovals on a screen and then printing it off and still having a paper ballot.

Frum: Right, and here in my precinct in Washington, that’s what we do: We touch the screen. We get a piece of paper. Then what happens?

Richer: And then you’re going to go, as the voter, and you’re going to make sure that it has all of your selections as you intended. So it would say, For this race, you voted for this person. For this race, you voted for this person. For this race, you voted for that person. And then you’re gonna feed it into a little mini tabulator that is at a voting location. At the end of the night—

Richer: County or city workers who have been trained to do this, who are bipartisan teams. Oftentimes, depending on the jurisdiction, they’ve been offered up by the county Republican Party or the county Democratic Party. But these are almost, in most circumstances, a bipartisan team of paid temporary county or city employees.

Frum: So they’re not full-time city or county employees; they’re people who have been specially recruited for that one-day service.

Richer: Correct. For working a voting location, those are ordinarily temporary workers.

Frum: And there’ll be someone named by the Republicans, someone named by the Democrats.

Frum: Okay. And they’re watching what’s going on.

Richer: That’s right. And there’s a whole bunch of procedures. Usually, you have to document a whole bunch of different things. But at the end of the day, you’re going to take all of the ballots that have been run through that tabulator, and you’re going to take the memory device from the tabulator itself, and you’re gonna wrap that memory device in tamperproof packaging, make sure that it can’t be damaged, make sure that it can’t be tampered with. You’re gonna give it to a bipartisan team, and they’re going to take both those ballots and that memory device to a central count facility—so that will be either within your county or within your city—where all of the different voting locations go into in order to aggregate the results. And when they aggregate the results, not only will they load that memory device into this main server to add to the other votes that have come in, but they’ll make sure that the number of votes that it recorded is the same as the number of ballots that were returned from that voting location, such that if the memory device reads, 1,123 ballots have been read on this, there better be 1,123 ballots that are in the drawer where they went after they were tabulated.

So that’s one component of it. There’s a whole bunch of other components because, obviously, some people vote by mail; some people get a mail ballot, and they drop it off. But an important part of this is we don’t just load those into the elections-management server, print the results, and then say, Well, hope everyone enjoyed their election. There’s always going to be post-election audits that are going to be open to public observation and are gonna be done in a bipartisan manner. So here, we really get to the core of the Hugo Chávez claim, which is that the tabulation equipment itself took votes that were for Donald Trump and it awarded them to Joe Biden. And we know that’s not the case because what we do is we select random batches of ballots, we see what the machine count was on them, and then we give those physical paper ballots to bipartisan teams of Republicans and Democrats, who hand-count them and they make sure the machines got the count right.

Frum: One of the complaints that the Trump people had was they couldn’t bring their bands of enthusiasts into those counting rooms.

Richer: Yeah. So, one, every county differs in terms of how many observers it allows, but in terms of people who actually work the process, we, in Maricopa County, we welcomed all types. If you were somebody who didn’t believe in the validity of elections, that’s fine; we still took you in. But we didn’t just take you and your five buddies and just send you off to one voting location. We take you in, we train you, we talk with you, and then we integrate you into other teams—teams of people from different backgrounds, teams from people of different politics, teams from people who have been doing this different lengths of time—and there is a little bit of that sort of almost watchfulness over each other. And I think one of the really beautiful things about election administration is that, in almost all instances, the people who come in and are part of this process develop a camaraderie with the people that they work with, and they develop a sense of pride in the results, and they develop a sense of defensiveness in that they were part of this process. And so I say to anyone who is still questioning how these things work, either go and get a tour of your elections facility, or better yet, figure out how you can be an observer for your political party, or figure out how you can participate in at least one part of the election process.

Frum: You mean convert cheap cynicism on Twitter into actual civic participation, and maybe not only will you have a better understanding, but you might be a better person at the end of the process.

Richer: Yeah, and there’s some great social-science studies about people who serve on a jury walk away with a better perception of the criminal-justice system. And while this hasn’t been as studied in the election-worker context, from my anecdotal experience, I firmly believe that is true, and it is something that is constructive, and it’s something that’ll actually teach you, rather than just retweeting or resharing the Rumble video or the Truth Social post or the Twitter post.

Frum: In Maricopa County, how many people are involved in the process in a big year, like in a presidential year?

Richer: Yeah, so for the 2024 presidential election, we had about 2.6 million registered voters in Maricopa County, and we had over 3,000 temporary workers helping with that process. That’s everything from the people who are working at a voting location, to people who are driving box trucks, to people who were working in our warehouse, to people doing signature verification, to people who were actually taking the ballots out of their return mail envelopes in bipartisan teams and smoothing them out and making sure there aren’t rips or gum on the ballots before we put them into the tabulators. And so, really, it’s a very time-intensive process, it’s a very redundant process, but it’s a pretty remarkable process, and there are lots of ways to get involved, and I think that you’ll find that, far from being complicit in a grand international scheme that seems fitting for a Mission: Impossible movie, I think that you’ll find that it gets a little boring, tiring after you’ve been doing it for hours and hours and hours. But it’s important because that is how we can affirm the validity of the election.

Frum: So in just your one county, in just Maricopa, we need to get 3,000 people to be involved in the conspiracy.

Richer: And so that is really another reason why our system is hardened against broad-scale attacks because, I mentioned, there are about 9,000 different voting jurisdictions in the United States, and each of those voting jurisdictions, they’re not as big as Maricopa County—Maricopa County is only smaller than Los Angeles County in terms of elections jurisdictions—but they have a number of people working. And so to have a conspiracy, you would have thousands and thousands of people in on it, and my experience with most political secrets is as soon as more than three or four people know about it, it’s probably getting out.

Frum: Stephen, thank you so much for joining me today. I learn so much from you every time we speak. I’m grateful to you for speaking to me today.

Richer: Thanks, David. I really appreciate it.

Frum: Thanks so much to Stephen Richer for joining me today on The David Frum Show.

Now, as I mentioned at the top, this month, February 2026, marks the 250th anniversary of the publication of the first of six volumes of Edward Gibbon’s [The History of the] Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Now, I won’t claim to have read every word of all six volumes, nor have I listened to all 126 hours of the audiobook, as recorded by Charlton Griffin, who is an incredible hero. I’ve listened to a lot of them, and I strongly recommend the audiobook; it is a fascinating way to spend time. But it’s a lot either way, whether you read the six volumes or listen to the 126 hours. But I’ve dug deeply enough into the book to have absorbed its message for our time, and that’s what I wanna talk about today, because this series of books remains not only a tremendous monument of history, not only a great milestone in intellectual development, it continues to shape discourse in our own time in ways that are powerful, but also sometimes a little misleading. So let me explain what I mean, why this book is so relevant and why I’m talking about it today.

Edward Gibbon was a man of the Enlightenment. He was a secularist. He was someone who had what we would call a broadly liberal—the word would not have been used that way in his time—but a broadly liberal view of politics. He was a man of great tolerance. He was an easygoing man, the opposite of a persecutor, the opposite of an advocate of any kind of arbitrary or absolute authority, so in that sense, a very modern figure. But in another way, as an historian, he was quite an old-fashioned figure, a backward-looking figure. His book, begun in 1776—the last volume was published a dozen years later, in 1788—is very much under the imprint of the ideas of Niccolo Machiavelli, who lived 250 years before Edward Gibbon, and through Machiavelli to the classical literary tradition of the Romans and the Greeks.

When Gibbon is explaining the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, he, again, is a very modern man—he uses not only literary evidence; he uses coins and inscriptions and all the techniques that were made available by archaeology as it existed in his time—and many of his ideas, as I say, are very strikingly modern, but his central explanation of what happened to the Roman Empire is backward-looking. It’s the Machiavelli explanation. What he thinks happened was that there was a decline in the civic virtue of the Roman people, and this decline in civic virtue was the key culprit of the collapse of the Roman Empire. What did he mean by civic virtue? What he meant was a kind of self-denying, materially austere commitment to active citizenship, active participation in public life. There was more of that early; there was less of that later. As that civic participation declined, so did the Roman Empire. And many people who read his book, in 1776 and after, took from that reading a message that was, in some ways, very helpful to building modern societies—we all should be active citizens—but also misleading because it created an idea that people are more virtuous at one period, less virtuous at another. It made the story of the success or failure of societies very much a matter of individual behavior and less of institutional success.

Now, again, Gibbon was in no way a naive person; he understood the importance of institutions. One of the big villains of his book is the rise of the Christian Church, which, in his telling, diverts Roman attention from this-worldly to otherworldly activities, from being willing to work on behalf of the commonwealth in the here and now to looking for some kind of reward in heaven, for being less willing to use weapons to serve in the military and more inclined to privatize their life. And there’s obviously some truth to this. Christianity did change the way the Roman civilization worked. But it’s not clear that there was any less involvement in civic life in Roman life in the 400s or 500s than there was in the 100s, when he begins his story. But what he did introduce—and this is really the thing we need to be cautious of—was a kind of biologization of history, an idea of decline and decadence. Decline makes sense when we talk about individual creatures. After a certain point in our lives, we are all on the path of decline, leading to extinction. And he brought concepts from the idea of art and science, the idea of decadence, into history in a way that biologized the development of societies. And this is an idea that, in our time, can lead to some pretty sinister complexes, this hunt for decline and decadence, and this desire to reaffirm society by somehow purging us of the things that make us freer, that give individual life more scope—again, not blaming Gibbon for that, but these are ideas that, through, Gibbon have haunted the discussion of political science and economic development and historical development.

I think, as we return to this mighty work from 250 years ago, there’s a lot to benefit from, including, above all, the extraordinary labor that went into producing this giant work that is still so fascinating to read, still so eminently quotable, in a literary style that resonates to this very day. But the reason the Roman Empire declined and fell was not because the Romans were virtuous at one time and less virtuous at the other. They were met with concrete problems of the here and now, problems of climate change, problems of plague, problems of the faster military development of their neighbors. Romans started with a big organizational advantage over the less-organized societies on their borders. As the Romans developed, as the world developed, those neighbors caught up and equalized the military balance, and the Romans were not up to the task. The Romans also developed problems of succession. They couldn’t provide orderly ways that didn’t involve coups and assassinations and civil wars, of making sure that executive power flowed in continuous ways through bureaucratic systems. Partly, that was because of the material primatism of the time. Partly, that was because of just the scale of distance on which they had to work. But partly, that was an institutional failure that was inherent in the way they organized the world and that we can learn some lessons from.

The world is always old and always new. Human beings age, but societies don’t. And if there’s a lesson to be learned from The [History of the] Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, it is to think less about decline and fall and think more about: How do we preserve and maintain the success of the society that modern-day people have, Americans and people in other democracies? How do you preserve what you have as institutions? How do you keep alive the incentives to maintain the act of citizenship that Gibbon taught as so important?

Anyway, those are my reflections on [the] 250th anniversary of this amazing work. But go read some of it, more of it, all of it if you can, yourself and see what you think.

She wanted to be governor of Arizona. She wanted to be a senator from Arizona. She wanted to run Voice of America, to be MAGA’s broadcaster to the world. Then she wanted to shut down Voice of America, after Donald Trump and Elon Musk turned against it. She wanted to play a big role in the MAGA movement, to live up to the phrase she’s used to describe herself: “Trump in heels.” But Kari Lake has achieved none of those things.

Instead, during her 11 months as the de facto leader of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, Lake has done profound damage to America’s foreign broadcasters, and to America’s ability to communicate with the world. USAGM runs Voice of America and gives grants to, among others, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and the Open Technology Fund, which helps people access information in places including Russia and Iran. During her tenure, Lake has ceded influence to Chinese and Russian state media all over the world, as their broadcasters have taken over slots from canceled U.S. programs. She has hampered the U.S. government’s ability to inform foreign audiences in times of crisis. She blocked RFE/RL from using USAGM’s transmission equipment, which meant that during mass street protests and an internet blackout in Iran recently, the broadcasters’ Persian-language service, Radio Farda, had to rent from commercial contractors. Voice of America’s Spanish-language service, which once reached tens of millions of people in Latin America, was unavailable during the U.S. military’s intervention in Venezuela because it had been shut down months earlier.

Anne Applebaum: The U.S. surrenders in the global information wars

But even while Lake presided over the destruction of an agency vital to U.S. national-security interests and the squandering of taxpayer dollars—more on this later—she often seemed to be focused on other things. Throughout the past year, she has posted on X constantly, sometimes many times a day, about Arizona politics (“Arizona elections are theater. Everyone knows it”); Somali immigration; Ashli Babbitt; Melania Trump’s movie; even former Ohio Governor John Kasich, whom she called “a pussy.” Although head of an agency whose broadcasters are mandated by law to be nonpartisan and editorially independent, she has four photographs of President Trump at the top of her X feed, where she has also pinned a long, wild screed about unspecified electoral fraud (“Why is NO ONE talking about this during a week when a lot of people are TALKING??? I think I know—because there is BIG money in keeping the corrupt, rigged elections going”).

Yet if Lake’s intention is to win Trump’s favor by broadcasting conspiracy theories, she is failing at that too. In October, she was spotted waiting in a White House lobby, hoping to see Trump, according to two GOP operatives. “Kari has been here for hours,” a White House aide told one of the operatives that day. “She’s going to run, and she’s asking for the endorsement.” Lake, who was rumored to be mulling a run for Congress in Arizona, eventually shared her pitch with a low-level aide who conveyed no enthusiasm for a third Lake candidacy, the same person said. The other Republican operative offered a similar account. When asked for comment on the episode, Lake responded in a statement that “every shred of this question is incorrect” and added, “The President has always been very gracious and generous when I have requested time with him.”

Whatever she does next, Lake will leave behind immense damage, as well as a legal quagmire, not least because the legal basis for her current position is peculiar. Because Trump removed most members of the bipartisan, Senate-confirmed board that oversees USAGM, depriving it of a quorum, Lake could not formally be appointed head of VOA. The head of USAGM has to be confirmed by the Senate, but for whatever reason, Trump didn’t want to go through the process. That’s why Lake arrived at USAGM with the title “special adviser.” She was promoted to “deputy CEO”; later she began calling herself the “acting CEO.” During a sworn deposition in two lawsuits brought by fired employees, she admitted that she had no documentation confirming her appointment to the latter position.

Once in place, several current and former staffers told us, Lake made little effort to understand the agency, its mission, or even the point of journalistic independence. A television-news anchor in Phoenix for more than two decades, she had a very limited background in international journalism, and during congressional testimony revealed that she did not know, for example, what language is spoken in Armenia, although VOA had an Armenian service. During her deposition, she could not think of any countries in Asia, other than China, that might not have adequate sources of free information; apparently North Korea did not come to mind.

Although she had no experience working with any of the institutions before, she did not initially consult with senior officials at the broadcasters. Rohit Mahajan, the chief communications officer for RFA, said that leaders of all of the broadcasters had approached Lake, and continue to do so, but to little effect. Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America, said he tried unsuccessfully to engage Lake both directly and through intermediaries. In the end he met her twice, once by accident in a hallway and once when he came to hand her a briefing book prepared by his staff. She took it and indicated she would read it, but he never heard back. (Lake declined to comment on these specific allegations due to ongoing litigation.)

But that was not unusual; she kept her distance from others as well, multiple current and former staffers said. One VOA staffer reckons that she wasn’t in that building “more than a couple of times” in a six-month period. In the deposition, Lake said she primarily spent time at the State Department, where she was eventually given an office. But she didn’t ask many people to meet her there either. In her statement, Lake defended her commitment to the job, saying, “Frankly, most of your ‘sources’ probably wish I didn’t work so hard.”

The VOA staffer also said that new appointees then working with Lake seemed “distrustful of federal employees, as part of the so-called deep state.” Among these appointees were John Zadrozny, an anti-immigration campaigner and DHS official in the first Trump administration; Mora Namdar, who contributed to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025; and Frank Wuco, a former talk-radio host known for promoting birtherism and several other conspiracy theories.

A former USAGM executive nevertheless said some employees were initially hopeful about Lake, given her television experience. Perhaps, some thought, the outlet could have found an on-air role for her, or even created her own show. Another former employee said they had prepared proposals for institutional reform. But whatever plans Lake had originally made for the broadcasters ended in mid-March, when Trump signed an executive order designed to close the entire agency. Lake admitted under oath that this decision caught her by surprise. Nevertheless, perhaps egged on by criticism from the Trump aide Ric Grenell and from Musk—who described the broadcasters, collectively reaching hundreds of millions of people, as “radical left crazy people talking to themselves”—Lake instantly rushed to demolish the institution, even denigrating VOA as “rotten to the core.”

With the help of DOGE, she immediately began trying to cut grants to RFA, RFE/RL, and other agencies, forcing them to make emergency cuts in staff and programming. USAGM also fired about 500 VOA contractors, many of whom were journalists with unique language skills and contacts in difficult parts of the world. Because they are what Abramowitz described as “the guts of the language services,” people with years of experience and deep knowledge of their countries, their departure meant that many VOA programs became impossible to produce. Eventually most were shut down.

In addition, about 800 full-time employees were placed on paid administrative leave. During the following months, Lake and her team repeatedly tried to fire the agency staff, including journalists, editors, and tech support. But because Lake’s authority to discharge employees was uncertain, and because she and her aides did not comply with strict rules about so-called reductions in force in the federal government, Lake’s team kept running into legal hurdles that they seem not to have anticipated.

Even as Russian and Chinese state media were replacing American news reporting, USAGM was obligated to pay salaries and benefits to hundreds of people placed on leave. A minority report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations estimates that from March 15 through July 18 alone, USAGM paid hundreds of people more than $69 million not to work, and that cost has continued to grow. As of August, more than 500 people were still on administrative leave, still receiving salaries and benefits, and still barred from performing their duties. In September, a judge blocked another attempt to fire them. Since then, the federal government has likely paid them about $50 million more—an estimate based on average salary levels at the agency—while still preventing them from doing their jobs. Lake’s statement did not refute these numbers but instead blamed an “activist judge” for obstructing her plans.

Lake has taken the position that she is required by law to maintain merely a statutory minimum service at VOA, something far smaller than the broadcasts previously produced in 49 languages. Lake initially preserved service in only four languages (Mandarin, Dari, Pashto, and Farsi) but later added a few more, including Korean and Kurdish. Yet even as she continues to pay hundreds of experienced journalists and federal workers to remain on administrative leave, sources at VOA and USAGM told us that she is hiring more and more contractors. This may be because, as she has testified, she truly believes USAGM and its broadcasters are “rotten to the core.”

Toluse Olorunnipa: Kari Lake’s attempt to deport her own employees

Regardless, she seems to be replacing some journalists with propagandists. By law, all of the broadcasters are supposed to be nonpartisan, with a firewall between the journalists and the U.S. administration. The State Department puts out the administration’s views; the broadcasters are meant to be reporters, a distinction particularly important in places that don’t have any other independent media. But some of VOA’s newer material doesn’t appear to meet that standard. One recent article, originally published in Chinese, echoed the false claims that Trump likes to make about his own record: “Trump combined his dealmaking ability with diplomacy based on the concept of ‘peace through strength’ to secure agreements halting and restraining eight global conflicts in 2025.” VOA’s Mandarin-language Instagram feed recently began posting heroic, Photoshopped images of Trump with misty American flags and helicopters in the background.

In practice, this is another kind of waste. Trump did not halt or restrain eight global conflicts, and obvious pro-Trump puffery isn’t going to have the same kind of influence among Mandarin-speaking audiences as, say, the extraordinary reporting once done by Radio Free Asia’s Uyghur-language service, which had to be shut down when funding to the broadcaster was cut and only recently reopened with a limited service. In 2017, RFA broke the story of the Chinese government’s mass arrests of Uyghur people in Xinjiang, part of a crackdown that has since forced some 1.8 million people into concentration camps. This story also had an impact on international perceptions of China in a way that fictional tales of Trump’s diplomacy will not.

Lake’s decisions about USAGM property have also taken their toll. Before Trump returned to office, the agency had begun to move into new quarters. Its old building, constructed in 1939 for the Social Security Board, needed expensive renovations; reportedly had ancient, faulty wiring; was far too big; and was generally unsuitable for modern journalism. After an extensive search and a lengthy negotiation, the service contracted to lease a smaller office building on Pennsylvania Avenue. Although the total price tag of the 15-year lease was more than $200 million, a number that looks large, the annual cost was reportedly lower than that of the agency’s former quarters. The owner gave USAGM two years’ free rent, as well as an additional nine months without rent to move into the building; the previous leaseholder threw in office furniture as well. According to USAGM’s previous CEO, the savings from the deal would have come to more than $150 million over the course of the lease. Renovations had begun, and some staff had already moved in.

In March, Lake abruptly canceled the lease. The former USAGM executive and another person with knowledge of the transaction say that she and her team did not follow the specified termination procedures. Lake’s team did not want to reimburse the owner’s costs, which the people close to the deal said initially came to about $16 million. The executive believes that this is because any payment undercut their argument that “it’s cheaper to get rid of these things than to keep them.” Theoretically, the building’s owner could add to the list of lawsuits against Lake, and a court could now hold USAGM, and thus U.S. taxpayers, liable for the entire 15-year lease. (In her statement, Lake maintained that canceling the lease reduced the agency’s costs and will save more than $225 million over 10 years.)

Meanwhile, office leases and other contracts around the world have been canceled, sometimes incurring additional costs, by VOA as well as the other broadcasters, staffers said. Further losses are mounting. USAGM also continues to pay to update and maintain its transmission capabilities in multiple countries around the world, even though they are now being used less often, and even though Lake has prevented some of the services from using them. Lake is also engaged in a series of lawsuits, some of which she appears to have made only minimal effort to fight. RFE/RL has won several cases that have allowed it to remain open. Employees of VOA, RFA, and the Middle East Broadcasting Network have also received favorable court rulings.  One federal judge, Royce Lamberth, a President Ronald Reagan appointee, has pointed out that when Congress appropriated $260 million to VOA for 2025, it did not intend the money to be used to cut programming and keep employees at home. “The legal term for that is ‘waste,’ he said, “and it is precisely what federal appropriation law aims to avoid.”

No one can say Lake lacks enthusiasm for the cause of shutting down the agency. During the course of the year, she has railed against USAGM, baselessly accused Voice of America of taking instruction from the Chinese Communist Party, and canceled visas for the foreign employees of the broadcasters, forcing them to leave the United States immediately and, in the case of some from repressive countries, scramble to find somewhere safe to live. “There was no caretaking to deal with that issue at all,” said Kathryn Neeper, director of strategy at USAGM, now on administrative leave. Lake did take time to make a slick video about the new VOA building whose lease she canceled, describing it as luxurious and overpriced.

More recently, after congressional appropriators began talking about bringing the agency’s funding back, she switched tack. She visited the Miami headquarters of Radio Martí—which is part of the Office of Cuban Broadcasting, beloved by Cuban American politicians, the broadcaster least affected by her purge—and even met staff last week at the main headquarters of RFE/RL in Prague.

She has lauded the work of the skeleton VOA services in Persian and installed a new leader for them—albeit a controversial, seemingly partisan one—even as she continued to prevent RFE/RL’s Radio Farda from accessing transmission services. Lake asserted in her statement that RFE/RL leaders “were putting out a message that was counter to US policy” and that she was helping them “align their messaging with American foreign policy and national security strategy.” But that assertion again reflects a deep misunderstanding of what RFE/RL is supposed to do. According to long-standing statute, the broadcaster has “professional independence,” providing not American messaging but real journalism in places where there are few alternatives.

Lake herself never pretends not to be partisan, keeping up a constant stream of praise and adulation for Trump, the “Trump Kennedy Center,” Charlie Kirk, and other MAGA heroes. But the Lake era at USAGM might look very different, even to Republicans, once the costs and losses of her year in charge are counted. Not only has she wasted money; she hasn’t won many arguments. In recent weeks, Congress rejected Lake’s requests to cut funding to a bare minimum and allotted USAGM something approaching previous levels of funding. Lake will retain the ability to undermine the broadcasters, but her expensive, monthslong, legally dubious attempt to destroy them has so far failed.

The uncertain future of her role might explain why Lake was said to be sitting in a White House waiting room in October, trying to get the president’s endorsement for a congressional race. But even if she had his blessing, a return to Arizona politics will be difficult. The Republican consultant and pollster Paul Bentz told us that MAGA voters in Arizona have moved on from Lake: “MAGA’s got other people that they’ve put at the forefront,” Bentz said. “They’ve got better candidates that they like more.” In October, a “war room” account on X affiliated with her past campaigns accused Fox News and Bret Baier of blacklisting her.

In her statement, Lake did not directly answer a question about whether she would seek a congressional seat, saying only, “If and when I decide to run for office, The Atlantic will be the very last to know.” Soon after allegedly being turned away at the White House, Lake also bought a condo in her native Iowa, according to MS Now, perhaps to try her luck in politics there. She can then explain to Iowa voters how much damage she did to American interests and communications around the world, as well as what happened to the hundreds of millions of dollars she squandered on their behalf.</div>

            <h2>What Happened to the Great American Protest Concert?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/artists-for-aid-gaza-sudan-protest-music/685937/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In early January, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, a concert benefit for Palestine and Sudan conjured all the fury of an acoustic night at the local coffee shop. Musicians played stripped-down songs on a stage decorated with rugs, floor lamps, and couches. Members of the audience, mostly 20-somethings and teens, leaned in and filmed intimate performances by their favorite cult artists.

But the quiet broke late in the evening when a woman with a mane of red curls walked onstage. Shrieks and screams rang out as people recognized the surprise guest: the 27-year-old superstar Chappell Roan.

I’d come to watch precisely because no one of Roan’s stature had been slated to play what have been, to date, the American music world’s only major communal performances in response to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. The concert, titled Artists for Aid, featured a 20-artist lineup of if-you-know-you-know types—such as the buzz band Geese and the TikTok-beloved Ravyn Lenae—plus Shawn Mendes, a recovering pop heartthrob who hasn’t had a hit in years. The previous two installments of Artists for Aid, which took place in 2024 in New Jersey and London, had received scant media attention. I wanted to find out why a war that has sparked intense outrage worldwide had inspired relatively low-wattage and under-the-radar efforts in American music—and whether that might be changing.

Music is the art form most associated with protest, and its history is full of united actions against war and humanitarian crises. Think of Woodstock-era sung-and-spoken condemnations of the Vietnam War, the 1980s megaconcerts and charity singles inspired by famine in Ethiopia and apartheid in South Africa, and the Rock Against Bush compilations that challenged America’s invasion of Iraq. Only a few years ago, pop music overflowed with sloganeering lyrics and concert rallies related to Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, and Donald Trump. But in the 2020s, much of that energy has mellowed—or at least been dispersed into individuals’ scattered statements and social-media posts.

Gaza is a big part of why. The 2023 Hamas attacks that killed some 1,200 people in Israel, including 378 people at the Nova music festival, spurred a military response that has decimated Gaza and resulted in at least 70,000 deaths. Among countries historically allied with Israel—prime among them the U.S.—the fallout has inflamed tensions over free expression. Though polls show that a majority of Americans now have an unfavorable view of Israel—an 11-point increase from before the war—the ensuing protests have faced unusual social and legal consequences. Universities whose students demonstrated against the war have been subject to sweeping government investigations and sanctions justified as efforts against hate speech. Activists have been targeted for deportation on the basis of protests they’ve been involved in or, in at least one case, because of an op-ed they’d written.

A confluence of factors have made Gaza a particularly risky situation to speak out about. One is the clear and rising tide of anti-Semitism worldwide. Defenders of Israel have often argued that a critique of Zionism is an attack on all Jews—thereby collapsing the distinctions among, for example, the bigoted conspiracy theories of Louis Farrakhan, the extremism of fringe activists who cheer for Hamas, and the moral objections levied by mainstream voices for Palestinian rights (many of whom are Jewish themselves). The bloody history of the conflict has made it so that some people interpret the language of Palestinian liberation as a call for the wanton murder of Israelis. These dynamics have been leveraged by lobbyists for Israel and by politicians of both major U.S. parties to subject the broader pro-Palestine movement to a level of scrutiny way beyond what other contemporary causes have been subject to. Cultural institutions and businesses looking to avoid controversy are motivated to embrace that scrutiny.

The music world has learned this a number of times. Last April, the R&B singer Kehlani was disinvited from a concert at Cornell after a pro-Israel student group flagged her history of strident anti-Zionism, including a music video of hers featuring the phrase “Long live the intifada.” Intifada is an Arabic word for “uprising” that many hear as a call for violence against Jews. Her concert in Central Park was later canceled after the office of New York City’s then-Mayor Eric Adams raised concerns about public safety. In a video message prior to the second cancellation, Kehlani called herself “not anti-Semitic” but rather “anti-genocide.” She also alluded to losing other career opportunities because of her criticism of Israel.

Kehlani, a singer known for her queer sex jams and fixation on astrology, hardly fits the stereotype of a militant. Some of music’s most headline-grabbing advocates for Palestine have been more extreme and faced more extreme consequences. The Irish band Kneecap is a rap trio steeped in the history of Irish republicanism—one member wears a balaclava. They had signaled admiration for terrorist groups—“Up Hamas, up Hezbollah,” shouted one member at a November 2024 concert—before controversy erupted over their pro-Palestine statements at Coachella 2025. After U.K. police opened a terrorism investigation (resulting in a charge against one member that was eventually dropped) and the group lost its visa sponsor in the U.S., Kneecap said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah, and that they “condemn all attacks on civilians, always.”

Another example: Last year, the front man of the rap duo Bob Vylan chanted “Death, death to the IDF!” at the Glastonbury Festival in the U.K. Following condemnation from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the revocation of their visas by the U.S. State Department, the band put out a statement saying: “We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people. We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine.” Later, when one of its concert crowds tried to get a “Death to IDF” chant going, Bob Vylan’s vocalist encouraged them to instead say “Free Palestine,” lest the band get in more trouble.

Performers who flirt with murderous rhetoric and ideologies hardly make ideal mascots for the pro-Palestine movement, or for anyone else who advocates to end, not intensify, violence in the Middle East. Even so, these controversies have demonstrated that what artists say about this issue is not treated with the deference that creative expression is traditionally afforded in democracies. Hip-hop, rock and roll, and even country music are full of revolutionary rhetoric and bloodthirsty threats. As First Amendment advocates have had to repeatedly point out lately, a legal distinction exists between making statements and committing or materially supporting violence. When government officials weigh in on what’s acceptable to say onstage, it not only limits the definition of free speech but sends a cautionary message to all kinds of cultural figures: artists, labels, venues.

The music industry wrestled with tensions related to Palestine before October 7. Boycott campaigns against Israel, which have been under way for decades, garnered support from artists including Elvis Costello, Patti Smith, and Questlove. In 2012, pro-Israel forces in the entertainment industry formed the anti-boycott activist group Creative Community for Peace, which was supported by industry figures such as the famous artist manager Scooter Braun and the Atlantic Music Group CEO Elliot Grainge.

Since October 7, many pro-Palestinian artists have said that they feel at odds with prevailing attitudes in their industry. Brian Eno said on Instagram that one of the biggest regrets of his career was that “so many of us have remained silent about Palestine. Often that silence has come from fear—real fear—that speaking out could provoke a backlash, close doors or end a career.” Last year, the trip-hop group Massive Attack formed an alliance intended to support pro-Palestinian artists in the face of “intimidation” from within the industry. More than 1,000 artists and labels have backed a new boycott effort to geo-block their music from being streamed in Israel.

But signing a petition is one thing, and organizing a show is another. The storied benefit shows and protests of music history were logistical undertakings that involved many parties—booking agents, promoters, venues, multiple artists. When it comes to Gaza, pulling off such an effort might be especially complex, given how viewpoints and appetites for blowback will vary from party to party. Nevertheless, Eno helped put on a benefit, Together for Palestine, in London last year. And Artists for Aid has emerged as America’s primary musical response—cautiously.

The Artists for Aid shows are benefits, not protests. They have paired advocacy for Palestine with advocacy for the people of Sudan, where a civil war has raged since 2023 and cost at least 150,000 lives. In Los Angeles, $5.5 million were raised for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund and the Sudanese American Physicians Association. The model Bella Hadid, one of the two hosts (the other was the actor Pedro Pascal), spoke about “families living through unimaginable loss, displacement, hunger, violence.” The Palestinian American poet Noor Hindi and the Sudanese American poet Safia Elhillo described the devastation of their homelands. But none of the speeches named a protagonist—a state, a leader—responsible for the destruction they mourned.

This circumspection was by design. “I’m trying to be really careful about the way that I present these concerts to the world,” Mustafa, the 29-year-old singer-songwriter who’d organized the venture, told me the day after the concert. Although he anticipated that some critics would find Artists for Aid to be too soft-focus, too vague in its objectives, Mustafa intentionally discouraged political callouts from stage. The shows were meant to give musicians an opportunity to “communicate their solidarity through song,” he said. “Because that is the thing they practice their whole life. That is the language that they know.”

The circumstances we met in reminded me that the Palestinian cause isn’t without behind-the-scenes support. Mustafa, formerly known as Mustafa the Poet, was staying at a stunning mansion in Bel Air that a donor had rented in order to house a few of the artists who played the show. Pizza boxes were strewn about from the night before, and a few straggling musicians and associates were puttering around, dipping their feet in the infinity pool. Mustafa’s 2024 debut album, Dunya—a folk memoir about growing up as a devout Muslim in a violent Toronto housing project as the son of immigrants from Sudan—was wildly acclaimed. He’s a pop insider who’s had a birthday dinner thrown for him by Drake and who has helped write songs for Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and the Jonas Brothers.

Despite that industry clout, he told me, he had trouble securing a venue for the benefit. Mustafa said he and his team had approached multiple locations in the Los Angeles area, but most declined the booking without explanation. At one point, after the show had been announced but before a stage had been confirmed, he considered canceling it and releasing “the list of all of the venues that refuse to accept me.” The problem wasn’t demand: The show had sold out within minutes, and scalpers listed tickets online with exorbitant markups. Mustafa had wanted to book an arena that could fit tens of thousands of people. Instead, Artists for Aid ended up in the 6,300-person Shrine Auditorium. “We weren’t in the Shrine by choice,” he said. “Really we were in the Shrine by circumstance.”

Confirming performers wasn’t simple either. According to Mustafa, he secured most of the evening’s lineup himself, coordinating with artists directly via text message, sometimes to the surprise of their managers. But it didn’t seem to be the full bill he’d hoped for. A number of artists who’d signed on to perform backed out just before the show’s announcement, offering what he felt were flimsy excuses. One musician—“I swear to God, one of the bigger artists in the world,” Mustafa said—declined by saying that they didn’t want to invite “the sting of the establishment.”

Still, some of the bigger artists in the world did pop up. Roan had called the singer-songwriter Lucy Dacus, who was on the bill, a few days before the show and asked to duet with her. The two ended up playing a wistful cover of the Magnetic Fields’ wry ballad “The Book of Love.” Backstage, Olivia Rodrigo posed for photos. (A few weeks later, Rodrigo announced that she’d covered that same Magnetic Fields song for a compilation album to raise money for War Child UK, a charity helping kids in conflict zones worldwide.)

The presence of these Gen Z icons seemed to reflect a generational divide when it comes to musical activism. For years, the most famous mainstream benefits have been headlined by a class of musicians associated with the Democratic establishment—Bruce Springsteen, Katy Perry, Alicia Keys. Over the past year, many in that class have continued to work in the familiar mode of anti-Trump resistance, as with Springsteen’s new song about the turmoil in Minneapolis. But Gaza has defied the dynamics of party politics; Roan rejected calls to endorse the Democrats in 2024 because of the party’s support of Israel, among other issues (though she said she voted for Kamala Harris anyway). Artists for Aid was for and largely by the generation that upended American political discourse after October 7 with campus sit-ins, the generation that hardly seems daunted by the crackdowns against them.

Some in the audience wore keffiyehs or T-shirts indicating their activist bona fides. But most just looked like fashionable music fans, flaunting boots and baggy denim while taking selfies. They screamed out wildly for Dacus, Daniel Caesar, Clairo, Faye Webster, and Omar Apollo—young gods of the bedroom-pop pantheon that has flourished in the streaming era. Many of those musicians are among the more than 600 people who’ve signed on to the Artists4Ceasefire effort that began in 2023.

Those artists largely sang their own songs, but certain lyrics and sounds took on a special resonance. The show opened with the Geese front man Cameron Winter, the current It Boy of indie rock and a 23-year-old Jewish person whose music is filled with references to war and God (he played another, smaller Gaza benefit in Ridgewood, Queens, not long after). He sang a gorgeous rendition of an unreleased track called “If You Turn Back Now.” Its fluttering piano runs sent a message: Settle in; focus; feel something.

Is it enough to let the music speak? I’d gone into the concert suspecting it to be a tragically late and modest effort—coming, as it did, after a cease-fire had been brokered and, despite continued violence in the region, a host of other crises had grabbed the public’s attention. And the show itself hardly turned out to be bold in its presentation. But as I watched artist after artist, from a variety of genres, step up, play, and hand the mic on to the next singer—as other performers watched, swaying their heads, from couches around the stage—my cynicism faded. The overlap between an artistic scene, a demographic wave, and a political movement was being made visible and tangible. Many of the musicians and audience members belonged to a generation that’s often stereotyped as languishing in apathy and isolation—but whose indignation about the suffering in Gaza has far outpaced that of other generations. And given all the ambient discouragement against speaking up about this particular cause, solidarity isn’t just a buzzword. It matters that so many of music’s rising guard have gone on the record.

In the weeks since then, I’ve thought back to Artists for Aid’s conscientious approach while a broader thaw has taken place in America regarding protest. The pushback against immigration agents in Minneapolis has been peaceful, coordinated, and focused—and, it seems, has gotten results. At least some of the politicians, celebrities, and business leaders who have fallen into silence or acquiescence during the past year of multifront overreach from the Trump administration are finally saying that something’s amiss in America, if in measured language. Gaza showed how power brokers from the White House on down seem eager for pretexts to punish dissent in ways that create a chilling effect, and that the hottest rhetoric from activists can be exactly that pretext. The effective protest movements to emerge from these circumstances will show wisdom in choosing when to shout and when to communicate by other means.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris arrived at their first Sundance Film Festival feeling worn down. Making their debut feature, Little Miss Sunshine, had taken much longer than they’d anticipated; financing hiccups had forced the pair to spend years rescuing the film from development hell. But by the time Dayton and Faris left Park City, Utah, in January 2006, they were practically rock stars: Little Miss Sunshine, about a scrappy family trying to make it to a children’s beauty pageant, had become a festival darling, prompting an all-night bidding war among distribution companies. Fox Searchlight, the victor, bought the film for a then-record-setting $10.5 million and immediately sent the couple on a tour of more than 20 cities to drum up interest in the movie before its summer release.

In the months following the festival, Dayton and Faris went from theater to theater, watching audiences absorb their work. They participated in Q&A after Q&A. Eventually they wound up at the Oscars, where Little Miss Sunshine was nominated for Best Picture. “It changed our lives, coming here,” Dayton told me when we met at this year’s Sundance.

Faris, sitting next to him, noted that the two didn’t return to the festival in the 20 years since their film’s premiere for a reason. “That experience was so monumental,” she said, “that it was sort of hard to imagine coming back and not having that.”

Throughout its 40-plus years in Park City, Sundance has earned a reputation for offering new filmmakers an unbeatable time. The festival, which spotlights independent films, launched the careers of directors such as Steven Soderbergh, Todd Haynes, and Richard Linklater; more recent alumni include Chloé Zhao, Ryan Coogler, and Celine Song. In the 1990s and 2000s, Sundance was an offbeat destination for Hollywood’s creative talent, rejecting the glitz of European festivals and the solemnity of awards season in favor of strong movies that garnered word-of-mouth interest. (The Sundance Institute, the nonprofit organization behind the festival, also cultivates emerging artists through its series of labs and fellowships.) In 1999, the premiere of The Blair Witch Project ushered in the era of found-footage horror; five years later, Napoleon Dynamite won over festivalgoers, who later helped enter “Vote for Pedro” into the pop-culture lexicon. Sundance could anoint hits, dotting the industry’s creative landscape with unlikely blockbusters.

Yet I had a hard time picturing that version of Sundance while at this year’s festival, which concluded earlier this month. Main Street, without any screenings at the picturesque Egyptian Theater, wasn’t particularly crowded. Nights were tame and quiet for the most part, other than the evening of the afterparty for The Moment (a mockumentary starring Charli XCX), which took place at a hilltop club. Plenty of showings around town were sold out, but few generated feverish headlines about bidding wars during the festival’s run—a worrying development for the filmmakers who come to Sundance in hopes of finding a distributor for their work. Even the weather seemed off: Park City, usually blanketed in snow this time of year, was warm enough for some locals to walk around in just long-sleeved shirts.

Part of the muted atmosphere probably had to do with the fact that this year’s Sundance was the final one held in Park City before the festival’s move to Boulder, Colorado, in 2027—as well as the fact that this was the first edition since the passing of Sundance’s founder, the actor Robert Redford, in September. But the downbeat mood also seemed to reflect the lackluster indie-film business that’s been dogging the festival for years. The box-office success stories of the ’90s and 2000s—The Blair Witch Project, Saw, Four Weddings and a Funeral, (500) Days of Summer—inspired distributors to pour tens of millions into acquiring projects at the festival over the following decade, in the hope of discovering a critical and cultural phenomenon that could also turn a profit. Yet only a few films ever offered a substantial return on the financial investment; the last major box-office hit to break out of Sundance was 2017’s Get Out, which earned nearly $260 million. Last year, only two out of the 10 U.S. competition entries—Sorry, Baby and Twinless—grossed more than $1 million worldwide.

Of course, Sundance has always operated as a microcosm of Hollywood’s wider shifts. This year’s final rodeo in Park City seemed marked by the uncertainty generated by ongoing industry woes—massive studio mergers, job insecurity, and the growing use of AI during production, among others. While at the festival, I spoke with many filmmakers who were bringing their directorial debuts to Sundance. Having their work selected remains an achievement, but traveling to a popular, pricey ski destination such as Park City, many of them told me, feels riskier than ever. The cost of bringing a small movie there hoping to lock down distribution may not pay off, given buyers’ dwindling interest. “Sundance was like that island on the horizon that I could never get to, that I applied to every year, to the labs, and never got in,” Vera Miao, the writer-director of the contemplative ghost story Rock Springs, said. But, she added, “it’s extremely expensive. You know, you want people here, and everyone wants to be here. It’s just an incredible moment of celebration and community, and the tension of that has been a hard one.”

Some films that played in Park City this year arrived with name recognition and instant buzz: a drama starring Channing Tatum, a black comedy from Olivia Wilde. The director John Wilson could also be considered something of a known quantity. As the creator of the irreverent HBO docuseries How to With John Wilson, he has gained a cult audience for his rollicking work built on seemingly prosaic subjects—including, in one notable short film, his own failed efforts to get his work accepted into Sundance. Almost 10 years later, Wilson’s feature directorial debut was selected as one of Sundance’s opening-night films. The History of Concrete, a documentary that captures the director’s attempts to finance a project ostensibly about, yes, concrete, has been well received: The morning of our interview, we had planned to meet at the theater in which the film was being screened, but then had to find another spot—there were too many attendees crowding the cinema.

Several quality documentaries have emerged from Sundance in recent years; all five of this year’s Oscar nominees debuted there. Yet as of this writing, The History of Concrete still hasn’t found a distributor. Wilson, for his part, didn’t seem to spend all of his time in Park City thinking about the film’s chances of landing a buyer. Certainly he’d like to find a distributor, he told me, so he can pay back his collaborators. But as “existentially terrifying” as it is to think about how much steeper the slope has become for indie filmmakers, he said, “doing your best to not consider the market in a certain way is the strongest kind of start you can have.” The movie’s aim, he added, is to remind viewers that “people shouldn’t be afraid to create.”

Wilson isn’t alone in shutting out the noise of the industry’s upheaval. Stephanie Ahn, the director of the tender romance Bedford Park, told me that her film had taken almost 10 years to make—years she spent searching for financing and readjusting her goals depending on the resources available to her. “On the other side of it, the world that your film might encounter might be very different than what you expected,” Ahn said, “and you just have to be okay with that.”

Before being accepted into Sundance with Bedford Park, Ahn said, she had submitted her work what felt like hundreds of times. At the start of her career, she imagined the kind of reception she might get if she made it to Park City, her reveries riffing on the success stories she kept hearing about. (Little Miss Sunshine’s trajectory—the word-of-mouth momentum, the bidding wars, the rock stardom—was once the standard.) “When I was younger and striving to be a filmmaker and striving at Sundance, I fantasized about what it would be like,” she explained. “I think I let go of the fantasy some years ago.” She added, “I think a lot of us have let go of the old way of success.”

Bedford Park turned out to be a festival rarity: The film sold to Sony Pictures Classics, becoming one of just five narrative titles to land a buyer out of Park City so far. That statistic underlines just how hesitant companies have become to acquire indie projects. The internet offers various other distribution channels and ways to promote your film outside of a festival, some of the filmmakers I spoke with said. Sundance’s core value, then, is to offer a venue to showcase work to an invested, film-loving viewership.

Elaine Del Valle, a writer and producer of the visually inventive documentary TheyDream and a director herself, is a Sundance veteran who has begun to rely on grassroots tactics. For her most recent feature, last year’s coming-of-age drama Brownsville Bred, she skipped Sundance and reached out to theater chains before finding a distributor at a smaller film festival. By that point, Del Valle just wanted to share her work with an audience who cared. “It’s not about the money,” she told me. “It’s about the value.” These days, she does as much as she can on her own. “I say to myself, I run a studio,” she said. “What part of my studio needs my attention most today?”

Sundance has long championed that indie sensibility, elevating work produced outside of the studio system off a shoestring budget. But in order to remain a meaningful platform for creative renegades, the festival needs to also take risks. At least, that’s what the filmmaker (and Robert’s daughter) Amy Redford told me when I spoke with her the night before screenings began. “More and more, I think what we will see is people finding a way to get their stories out there on their own terms, because they can,” she said. In some ways, she pointed out, the festival’s forthcoming move to Boulder may offer a chance for a reset. “Sometimes,” Redford said, “you need to change your landscape to understand what you’re made of,” even if that change is as simple—or, as she put it, “exciting and messy and imperfect”—as relocating to a different town.</div>

Yes, we are fucked in the ass. The worst case scenarios are likely if not optimistic.

Is this going to happen before, or after I retire?

They actually found that antarctic ice (as a whole) is increasing due to increased water-vapor in the atmosphere and more snow falling. The boffins didn&#39;t see that one coming.

> One bright spot was last month, when hiring increased by 130,000 roles. This was significantly more than the 55,000 additions that had been expected by economists.

Bet: in six months the BLS will &quot;revise&quot; this figure down to ~55k, at the same time they announce the chocolate ration will be reduced from thirty grams to twenty.

Why is the media still treating this horseshit propaganda like it remotely reflects reality?

I suspect there will be some weasel wording around &quot;gross&quot; versus &quot;net&quot;. A lot of people I know are getting laid off while their companies continue hiring. It&#39;s not even a shift in resources or skillsets, it&#39;s a true revolving door.

&quot;Still, Wednesday’s report also shows that not nearly as many jobs were added in 2025 as thought and last year will go down as the worst year for hiring since 2020, or since 2003 outside of a recession.&quot;

&quot;Preliminary data had indicated that the U.S. economy added 584,000 jobs last year.

None.  Not now, and not ever.  The economic numbers are always cooked, and the people doing the cooking never have your interests in mind.

Imagine honestly believing inflation has only been 3 or 4% per year for the past 15 years.

It really depends on what you&#39;re buying.  Also, 15 years of 3.5% compound interest is not negligible.

Imagine honestly believing inflation has only been 3 or 4% per year for the past 15 years.Average?  Yeah, probably.Description: 2010 / projected 2025 at 4% per year / actual 2025):

While I agree (dogmatically), there are signs around where I am living of workforce expansion.  I can&#39;t tell if it is more people picking up second jobs, working extra hours, or something else, but I notice restaurants expanding hours, construction companies running full crews, and more professional landscape crews around.

I can&#39;t tell if the economy has picked up to match-- my Costco bill is still up 50% a month, and there aren&#39;t obvious signs that people feel like they have more disposable income.  Time wi

&quot;Scientists thought they understood global warming. Then the past three years happened.&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com... [washingtonpost.com]

Yes, we are fucked in the ass.  The worst case scenarios are likely if not optimistic.

It is assumed that BEV costs are essentially equivalent to ICE costs.  Part of this comes from an assumption that all cars of any type are only leased.  However, even with that assumption, this equivalence assumption is certainly not true now and remains to be seen whether it will be true in the future.

It is assumed that the solar-battery home installation is completely free.  This is a huge cost that is completely absent from the analysis.

The solar-battery home installation necessarily assumes that the car owner has a home where the car can be parked and where the solar-battery equipment can be located, which restricts car owners to fairly rich people.

>>It is assumed that the solar-battery home installation is completely free. This is a huge cost that is completely absent from the analysis.

This statement is completely false.  The article actually goes into great detail on the costs of the solar-off-grid (SOG) charging system and includes SOG costs in the total cost of ownership calculations.

&quot;The SOG CAPEX consists of four hard-cost components, the solar PV panel, inverter, stationary lithium-ion battery and balance of system (BOS), and one soft-cos

This statement is completely false.  The article actually goes into great detail on the costs of the solar-off-grid (SOG) charging system and includes SOG costs in the total cost of ownership calculations.And regardless of BEV usage, SOG (or mini-grids) is poised to rapidly expand in Africa (bringing reliable power to remote communities).  If you build it, they will come?

This reminds me of an article I read about non-electric can openers. https://h2g2.com/edited_entry/... [h2g2.com]

Just in case a hurricane, tornado, or nuclear war does ever leave you in need of some serious manual can-opening, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to know how to use one.

Yes. Considering how long people normally own a given vehicle, the take-away almost seems to be &quot;make your next car purchase an ICE because electric wont be cheaper until after you get rid of that one at least&quot;.

The cheapest option will be to buy a US college graduation&#39;s student loan and have him pull a rickshaw until he pays you back.

I&#39;m curious how road conditions will affect this.  EVs are generally far heavier than their combustion-powered counterparts, and road conditions can play hell on cars that are heavy.

On top of that if charging infrastructure is slow to be built-out or if it&#39;s more easily damaged in conflicts, it may be hard to get drivers off of gasoline as a fuel that only requires a jug and a funnel to refuel with out in rural areas.

That&#39;s 15 years from now. Anything the hell can happen by 2040 .. maybe in 2040 the great Ijigwabogajooga will rise up from the giant pit of rhinoceros shit? Why do people make stupid ass predictions?

This also serves as a reminder as to why the separation of powers is a good thing.  The UK puts the legislature in charge of everything, instead of breaking out the court and executive branches.

One American citizen executed in the street by masked men is still one too many

The thing with all of that is that the particular system doesn&#39;t matter too much.

Good people can make bad systems work. Good systems cannot make bad people work.

And the oft touted checks and balances fail when you need them the most.

> the USA has the government executing citizens in the street with impunity.

Absolute propaganda.  The lady that was shot by ICE was resisting arrest after intentionally interfering with federal authorities lawful duties.  She tried to flee by car, pointed it at an agent and accelerated.  The agent shot in self defense and the photos clearly show a gunshot through the front windshield.  Your version is as abhorrent as the &quot;hands up, don&#39;t shoot&quot; lie where a cop shot a person that was beating on the cop as

How can you have an investigation when leftist agitators forced federal agents to withdraw from the scene and where local authorities refuse to act?  Any evidence was compromised by the same people who are crying foul.  In the first case, the video evidence is conclusive on its own.  In the second, events are less clear.  However, even in the second case, you can&#39;t deny that the guy was interfering with the lawful duties of federal agents while armed after previously attacking an ICE vehicle.  That&#39;s a far

Could you expand on how someone was forced to withdraw, what timeline do you have for that?

You know I can see nothing in your comment that makes it ok for federal officers to kill people, there is nothing in there that even comes near the limit for deadly force or force in any matter.

You&#39;d have to believe that its okay to run over law enforcement with your car while fleeing arrest and that it&#39;s perfectly fine to attack agents and their vehicles while armed.  Both instances had an easily demonstrable lethal threat to the federal agents which makes their use of force justifiable.  How far gone do you have to be to think that the actions of either of those activists were in any way lawful or peaceful in nature?

You said lady blah blah blah and then they executed her on the street.  You said man blah blah blah and then they executed him on the street.I think it is allowed in the USA based on watching Robocop

Buddy you better take a look in the mirror.

UK is frustrated with reports on social media arrests.

Every judge in the UK is an active pedophile.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only American that&#39;s willing to host and support The Free Press.

Imagine the political possibilities if we hosted this on American soil on American servers.

When you can rip your own CD? And places like Amazon will sell you physical media and &quot;autorip&quot; much of their catalog (but not all)

For people that only buy one track, it makes sense to drop $1-$2 for a song. And ignore the whole album. That&#39;s perhaps the way popular music works. But for fans of certain bands, we buy the whole album.

I haven&#39;t had a PC with a CD drive in like a decade.

Also, a digital album is often cheaper than a CD.

And tons of shit isn&#39;t even released on albums any more anyway. And singles are WAY more expensive on CD.

Yea. I can&#39;t imagine that singles are selling on CD all that well.

I have a desktop for the massive (but old) graphics card, so having a Blu-ray/dvd/cd-rw in it is relatively cheap compared to the whole system.

Laptop only users seem unlikely to buy an external drive. Even though they are cheap.

There&#39;s nothing stopping you from backing up digital files onto new media.The physical CD can become damaged or degrade, rendering it unreadable. The readers will also fail over time and need to be replaced, and while they&#39;re still being manufactured today there will eventually reach a point where readers are not being manufactured and you have to rely on old stock or refurbishments.

Older media formats are becoming increasingly hard to use these days, even if you still have the physical media and it&#39;s not d

USB CD drives are plentiful and cheap, so far.Ripped files are so durable and so much easier to manipulate for listening that I don&#39;t care what vinyl sounds like.

Floppy drives and blank disks were plentiful and cheap once too, now they&#39;re getting harder to find and a lot of the used units available are in poor condition. It will happen sooner or later.

But yes digital files are easier to manipulate, and you can periodically transfer them to newer storage devices so you don&#39;t get stuck with obsolete and unreadable media.

My PC doesn&#39;t even have external drive bays. However, it does have USB ports, so when I want to rip something it&#39;s not a problem.

Why buy at all? $2 for a song? That sounds expensive. When you compare it to something like paying Spotify for your life:

78 years * 12 months * $12.99 = $12,158.64 lifetime dollars.Spotify library is 100 million songs.

I just looked it up and $12,158.64 turns out to be less than $200,000,000.

I don&#39;t see the advantage of buying physical.

The streaming services have already done multiple rug pulls, rights-stripping acquisitions, and bankruptcies to take away &quot;purchased&quot; streaming rights and force people to pay a second time (and a third, and a fourth...).  But yeah, the people who have CD players with analog outputs and who buy CDs are the dumb ones.

I pay for an Amazon Music subscription and I have yet to not be able to find something that I wanted to listen to.  Music streaming has gotten better in recent years.  Video streaming has gotten worse.  I miss being able to find anything on Netflix.  Now I have to buy a month of Disney+ if I want to watch the new Tron movie.

Simply fix the horrible sound engineering that undermines any rich format and you&#39;ll win.  Records sound better for many people because they are engineered for a crap format that limits them; so while they ARE low quality, the limitation has them better engineered than superior formats.

I&#39;m a Gen Xer who still really values the concept of holding onto my own music. I don&#39;t like paying for subscriptions to music streaming services that can get rid of a given album or even artist at any time, or who is likely to only offer their greatest hits, vs deeper tracks.

But I resorted to ripping my entire CD collection and hosting everything on a file server at home, with a second copy of my music on my Apple Mac.

The physical media takes up a lot of space and is subject to scuffs/scratches -- not to mention a dying popularity of CD players themselves.

I have very little interest in buying music on vinyl at this point in my life. I&#39;ve been there, done that -- and the whole format is just inferior. Records wear out with each play and needles on turntables get dull over time. The format doesn&#39;t lend itself to listening in a moving vehicle either. Just a technological step backwards that&#39;s only popular to be retro and trendy.

But yeah, at this point? I&#39;d buy digital tracks or albums and put them on my server/computer ... copying to thumb-drives for in-car use as needed. I don&#39;t think physical music CD purchases are necessary anymore, really.

I still buy music, on bandcamp and 7digital mostly. The difference in price between digital and CD is a quid or two, but it&#39;s the shipping that&#39;s the killer. I always look to see if I can get the CD somewhere cheaper than digital, which still happens sometimes, especially for older stuff that was popular and is still floating around on eBay.

I&#39;ve slowly been moving my CDs from jewel cases to DiscSox sleeves - I&#39;m not sure why really, as it&#39;s quite pricey, but I can&#39;t yet bring myself jus

That has served as a sort of gravitational center of my music; everything I would seek out to listen to, I already own, so that only leaves &quot;discovery&quot;. And I don&#39;t have mainstream tastes, so consent-manufacturers like Spotify are useless for that. I&#39;m also older and less in to random new music, so I tend to be old-school there, too, and depend on friends for new music.

If a band&#39;s website or YT has a Bandcamp link, I&#39;ll almost check it out and follow or buy something if it seems cool. That&#39;s been my path to discovery.

To be fair, no one has claimed the death of bluray. The article was about the end of the recordable bluray settop box, something that I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever seen in the west, though they apparently existed in Japan.

NO, CDs aren&#39;t making a comeback. Give me a fucking break.

How desperate are journalists to come up with something worth reading that they have to stoop to spewing out filler text like this &#39;article&#39;?

I have been selling used records and CDs at record shows and via the mail since the mid 90&#39;s.  When first I started, LPs were about 20% of the game and CDs 80%. That changed with the advent of Napster (I still remember the Boston record show in September 1999 when the CD dealers all looked at each other and gasped at the crash in demand for CDs from college kids) and from then on LPs became more and more or our business.

Three years ago the percentage was probably 90% vinyl and 10% CDs. Last

Did they take them away to sell more Sirius XM subscriptions?

Sirius XM? Is that like a shit version of Spotify? /sarcasm No CD players disappeared from cars because consumers largely stopped giving a shit about CDs. When every guy on the road connects their phone to their car not only are CD players obsolete, but largely radio is taking a back seat to endless subscription media, podcasts, music streaming, playing files from your phone.

Honestly I stopped listening to CDs in the car in 2000 when I bought a car with an aux jack.

If we are going to rescue a digital physical disc format:

Why not rescue the ones with better audio quality?

Problem with SA-CD is that it uses special players. But DVD-Audio? Come on!

Typos aside. I think higher than CD quality format is an audiophile luxury. I suspect it is difficult to get consumers to pay for the higher mastering costs to make a worthwhile high quality release. It&#39;s mostly because to actually play it with any noticable improvements, you need better equipment at home.Add to that that DVD-Audio is so poorly supported on desktop PCs and requires a little bit of third party software to get working. Seems like a hassle for something that most people don&#39;t seem interested i

Unless you&#39;re talking about surround sound, the only meaningful difference between SACD and CDs is that the formers were usually remastered for production. Even so called &quot;experts&quot; can&#39;t tell a &quot;HD&quot; audio source apart from a CD because ... well.. human ears are just basic.

All you&#39;re paying for with SACD is a lot of additional noise in ultrasonic frequencies that your equipment filters out during playback.

It&#39;s a terrible deal.  The only thing worse is buying a lemon of a gaming laptop and being stuck dealing with the normal short term warranty.  Otherwise, if you even financed at 10-20% interest you would probably be better off.

I hope they at least cover accidental damage.

1. A manacle, chain, and 100 Kiligram ball.

2. Contract of adhesion written on flypaper.

LTT looked at it and it does seem like a shitty deal. The cost isn&#39;t far off buying a new laptop every two years, and of course if you do that you can probably sell your old one.

When you lease something, you end up with ownership. With these HP rentals, there&#39;s zero path at all to ownership. Thus, it&#39;s a subsrciption through and through.

There are lots of leases without a purchase option.

Where I come from, lease basically means you buy something, most probably a vehicle, with a loan. Once you have paid back the loan, you own the thing.

Turns out for most of people it&#39;s just another word for rent. Go figure.

Yea. In colloquial usage there isn&#39;t much difference between lease, rent, subscription, etc.

Leasing a commercial space is like what you think of as rent. It&#39;s a long term contract for the right to use the space. With no permanent transfer of ownership in the agreement. Leasing equipment is also handled this way.

Short term, you can rent a chainsaw, a carpet cleaner, or an apartment. Every month you pay your rent and you get to stay. If you have a long term agreement, then it&#39;s technically a lease.

In these parts all of the leases are structured as ending with ownership. However, most cars are returned to the dealership before that. People either get bored of them and want newer ones, or the smart ones return theirs before they&#39;re due for the first major overhaul. So funnily enough, in practical terms, the lease is a rent.

The dealership gets a discount on any work to be done on the used cars because of the volume and ties to the manufacturer, and they get to sell the car a second time for another prof

A lease gives you the right, but not the obligation, to acquire the good for a small nominal price (for example, E extra monthly payments) at the end of the lease.

HP also offers leases, but for Pro grade PCs, for companies.

I was going to say that might make sense for short term needs.  If you need a better PC for a 6 month job, do this.

But they dissallow the only sensible use for the customer, requiring a year long minimum.

It also illustrates total ignorance of how these kinds of rentals make a profit - people think they want it for 6 months, but end up keeping it for 5 years.

How many people actually end subscriptions when they stop needing them?

There is no other alternative - Margret Thatcher, former UK Prime Minister

Take the time to think about this and let it sink in.

This also may be time to do some thinking about how to live off-grid if this lack of owning anything becomes reality. Become a Slab City refusenik?

How does one 3D print a guillotine. Asking for a friend.

Leasing is a better option, because it gives you the right, but not the obligation, to acquire the good at the end of the lease time.

Renting ceratin things, like GAMING laptops, can also make sense, because laptos have high wear and tear, and because, due to the limits inherent to the form factor, they become obsolete for the intended purpose (gaming) quite quickly

So, in the middle of the RAMpocalypse, with bonker prices, we have another option.

More options are good, if you can do the math to figure out, in

My father, years ago (mid 1990&#39;s) leased Dell desktops for his law office.  He did the 4 year lease they offered at the time.  When it came time to upgrade after 2 (as part of the lease) I had to spend 4 days backing up and clearing drives to make sure nothing private left the office.  That is 4 days down time.  That is 4 days at $50+/hr.  Once the drives were clean we sent the systems back.  Dell wanted them back and promised next day delivery for the new ones.  8 days later they arrived.

Of course, they&#39;re much less upfront about their printer rentals. You can &#39;buy&#39; the printers at the store, yet pay ongoing fees in the form of being locked into buying supplies from HP at inflated prices. Their laptop rental sca.. er, scheme, is at least openly advertised as a rental.

Snarkasm aside, it occurs to me that the market for these laptops might have significant overlap with the market for payday loan services.

First Agilent spun off with the medical stuff, and probably other general stuff (signal generators, for example). Then what was left split into Hewlett-Packard for consumer stuff (printers, laptops, etc) and HP Enterprise (for datacenter gear). Haven&#39;t paid a lot of attention since 2020; they may have split again for all I know.

How does renting a laptop with a GPU compare to renting a server with a GPU?

Hetzner offers a server with a Nvidia RTX 4000 GPU and 64GB RAM + 20GB vRAM for $205/mo + $312 setup fee.  If I want to rent one for a month, to experiment running LLMs, it will cost me $517.  I can rent an HP laptop with a comparable GPU (but with less memory) for just $50.  If I want to rent one indefinitely, the laptop is 4 times cheaper than the server.

Not defending HP&#39;s ludicrous rental scheme but if you&#39;re wanting to play with local LLMs the mobile chip in the laptop is going to be underpowered compared to the full sized chip in the Hetzner server. Despite the name the chip in the laptop will have far fewer compute cores and a fraction of the VRAM. It will also have more thermal throttling. If you want to play with LLMs you&#39;d be better off just doing cloud instances with inference providers. They&#39;re often cheaper than a dedicated monthly server.

Please read the headline and TFS. These are GAMING laptops for rent. Not AI/EDeveloper laptops for rent. If you want to game on your hetzner server, RTT (a.k.a. ping times, latency) can be a issue, depending where you live. No such problems with a rented GAMING laptop.

Will HP charge me a Non-Gaming fee, if I use their gaming laptops for something other than playing games?

You&#39;ve never heard that GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), are often repurposed for AI workloads?

There is a precedence for this line of thinking: NVIDIA Limits RTX 3060 Crypto Speeds As it Introduces Mining Cards  [slashdot.org].  So yes, you have a point.

I wonder if you are allowed to replace the operating system on a rented laptop.

Every tool is a hammer, except for the screwdriver, which is also a chisel.

I&#39;ve been using PCs since 1983, in an academy, or hand-me-downs. The first PC I specked myself was U$D 3000 in 1994 dollars. I would have killed for a rent option at that time... Probably would have diched my 286 a couple of years sooner, and ditched that P90 for a P233MMX sooner...

Renting/leasing is not intrinsically bad, as long as you can do the math to know what option is right in each particular case.

This reminds me of the NZXT Flex subscription which was panned universally by literally everyone who has looked into it as a hyper expensive waste of money.

After months of watching federal agents terrorize communities all across the country in the name of immigration enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security’s top brass sat before Congress on Tuesday to answer questions about the deaths of Renée Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, the detention of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, and the fates of countless others who have been caught in the crosshairs of the president’s mass deportation effort. Though Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, mostly deflected any responsibility and insisted that the agency conducts only targeted arrests, Democrats came prepared with receipts to remind us all just how blatantly racist and out of control the White House’s immigration agenda has been.

“You are only here because public outrage has become so unavoidable,” Rep. LaMonica McIver, of New Jersey, said during the House Homeland Security Committee’s oversight hearing. McIver is being prosecuted by the Trump administration over an incident in New Jersey when she was barred from entering a detention facility. “You are here, Mr. Lyons, because white people are getting shot in the face and chest when the cameras are rolling.”

Lyons remained straight-faced, offering no explanation for his agents’ extreme use of force or denial about his agents’ racial profiling of Americans. That profiling is something the Supreme Court essentially endorsed last year, after the justices issued a decision allowing the federal government to stop Hispanic migrants based on their “apparent ethnicity,” as well as other factors, like if they have an accent or work certain types of jobs. This, predictably, has led ICE to overwhelmingly target Black and brown Americans with excessive force.

Indeed, this was one of the main subtexts of the hearing. New Jersey Rep. Nellie Pou, for example, asked, “Mr. Lyons, I speak Spanish. If I wasn’t wearing my member pin, would me being a Latina and speaking Spanish be enough for ICE agents to harass me or shove me into one of your unmarked cars?”

Lyons answered no, but as Pou and other Democratic representatives pointed out, this has not been borne out by the reality on the ground; even off-duty officers have recently been profiled by ICE. When Rep. Troy Carter, of Louisiana, directly asked Lyons if his agency was arresting or deporting Americans, Lyons denied that it was “arresting” Americans, before quickly adding that it did “detain” Americans. As Carter pointed out, this was a distinction without a difference.

When it came to the way agents currently present themselves to Americans, New York Rep. Tim Kennedy asked whether Lyons would instruct his agents to no longer wear masks and institute a uniform that includes visible identification—one of 10 demands congressional Democrats are requesting in the ongoing negotiations over whether to fund DHS beyond Saturday’s deadline. Lyons immediately retorted, “No.”

And when Rep. Eric Swalwell, of California, asked Lyons if he would apologize for his department calling Good and Pretti “domestic terrorists,” he refused. Lyons also insisted that when his agents arrested Ramos as he made his way home from preschool with his father, “the men and women of ICE took care of him.” Later in the hearing, Lyons also claimed that agents played the boy’s favorite song and got him McDonald’s. Meanwhile, it took the intervention of Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro for a visibly unwell Ramos to be released from detention. The administration immediately tried to detain him again.

This was just one of many moments when administration officials offered what felt like a completely different reality from what people on the ground are experiencing with ICE officers.

Rep. Seth Magaziner, of Rhode Island, brought up the case of federal agents in Chicago, who pepper-sprayed a 1-year-old as she sat in the back seat of her father’s car. “Is it proper procedure to aim pepper spray into the window of a moving vehicle?” Magaziner asked Rodney Scott, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who also testified. “We try to avoid that,” he said.

Magaziner continued to push. “Were any of your agents investigated or disciplined for this?”

“I’ll have to get back to you,” Scott said.

Magaziner then showed a video and zoomed-in photo of an agent firing pepper spray directly into the face of a protester who was pinned to the ground by multiple agents and asked if this was proper procedure for the use of pepper spray. “I cannot respond to that because you’re only showing one piece, and that subject is clearly not compliant,” Scott said, while refusing to confirm whether there was an open investigation into those agents.

“Your agency has been repeatedly caught on tape using violence against civilians, and you can’t even tell me if any of these agents have been investigated or disciplined,” Magaziner said. “You are supposed to be making people safer, and instead your agents are being unnecessarily violent.”

Tuesday’s hearing was the first time ICE leadership has testified before Congress under the second Trump administration, as the White House agreed to the testimony in a clear attempt to contain the fallout from Good’s and Pretti’s deaths. Though it will not immediately solve the current chaos being wreaked by the president and his mass deportation mastermind Stephen Miller, the hearing did serve as a cathartic moment of rage. For a brief period of time, Democrats accurately embodied the feelings of Americans all across the country who are facing ICE in their communities with no real defense.

“Sorry, I don’t mean to interrupt you guys.” The man crunches his way toward us, through this snow-covered field and past rows upon rows of identical wooden tombstones, then gestures back in the direction he came from. “I wanted to make sure you’re aware that there’s ICE right there.”

This is how it happens, I was told the day before. Immigration and Customs Enforcement moves fast in Minneapolis, the way you have to when an entire city is against you. Volunteers call in license plates to volunteers who check those plates against databases created by other volunteers. Once identified, these agents have minutes at best before residents with whistles and horns and furious loud voices gather to alert their neighbors to the threat in their midst. If you’re more than five minutes away from a sighting, odds are you’ll be too late. No, the best way to find ICE in Minneapolis is to stay in one place. Go about your day. Eventually, you’ll see them.

I am standing with two Minneapolis residents who go by Tim and Star, looking out at the Say Their Names memorial. The art installation consists of over 100 tombstones, each with identical black fists and names I remember from 2020. Philandro Castile. Ahmaud Arbery. And, of course, George Floyd, who took his final breath two blocks south of here. Minneapolis is no stranger to tragedy, or to the white-hot spotlight of international media attention, or to banding together in the face of a crisis.

“In some ways, it primed the pump,” Tim told me, referring to the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020. Like everyone I spoke to, Tim and Star ascribe Minneapolis’ successful mobilization to lessons learned during that time.

“We have a lot of media coming in and asking, ‘Oh, what’s your organization? Who are you with?’ And it’s like, we don’t have an organization. We’re not with anyone,” Star told me.

“We’re just neighbors. That’s how we know each other,” Tim confirmed. “We live here.”

Star nodded. “ One of the things that I’m not sure that people are realizing outside of Minneapolis: The headlines say that Alex Pretti was a protester,” they say. “He wasn’t at a protest. He wasn’t at—”

And then we turned to watch the man approaching us through the snow—the man now telling us ICE has pulled up by an apartment building across the field. “We’ve got the block, we’re situated,” he says. “I just want to make sure—in case anybody’s targetable or something like that.”

None of us are targetable. Tim and Star want to help, and I want to see the action.

Just as roadkill summons vultures, so too does human misery summon journalists, who travel across the country to shove cameras and recorders at people enduring things no one should experience. People in Minneapolis broadly understand that documentation is important, that the world needs to know what’s happening, that journalists can help spread the word. But the line between journalism and pornography grows vanishingly thin at times like these. Newsworthy tales of ICE atrocities can easily become violent entertainment for a ravenous national audience; action-movie sequences carried out by caricatures, grief and trauma commodified for mass consumption.

Star offers me a 3D-printed orange whistle and I open my mouth to say that as a journalist I can’t participate—but the words won’t come out. A sudden vision of myself in the future, talking to grand-nieces and -nephews: Yes, I had a chance to warn people about the secret police coming to abduct them, disappear them, or release them into this dangerous cold without a coat or cell phone, but journalistic ethics, you see …

At last, the cars arrive. The bearded man gives us a count: One, two, three …

The noise is deafening: Horns blare, whistles pierce the piercing cold. “ICE OUT!” the residents chant, over and over again. “We are all Minneapolis!” someone shouts. “We are all Minnesota! We are all the motherfucking United States of America!”

The world might breathe a sigh of relief, but Minneapolis can’t afford it. ICE is here, and ICE has killed, and ICE may kill again. Here the city stands: residents with whistles standing against men with guns and flak vests.

The ICE SUV stays put despite the unrelenting noise and a neighborhood now on high alert. I start shivering five minutes in; the man in sweatpants and Crocs appears unbothered. There are over 30 people here now; residents have heeded the call or arrived from rapid-response patrol. A white Toyota stops between the crowd and the SUV and a man with a mustache leans out the passenger window with a camera: no words, no eye contact, just the indifferent glassy eye of a zoom lens and fingers to focus it on people as they do something others have died doing.

Someone has brought a megaphone; residents take turns leading chants. “My grandmother was a sharecropper in Arkansas, and I know that this is the same thing,” a man shouts at one point as whistles shrill and a handheld siren wails. “The same fight that my people fought, the same fight that my grandma fought, is the same fight that we are fighting to protect our undocumented migrant neighbors!”

ICE-watch reports more agents incoming, but the crowd has only grown and no one is going anywhere. Five minutes becomes 10, 10 becomes 15. “All right folks, we’re going to sing ‘We are not afraid!’ ” someone shouts into the megaphone, and so they do; not shouting or chanting but singing, in tune and with one voice:

We are not afraid We are not afraid We are not afraid today

Oh, deep in my heart I do believe That we are not afraid today

And then, to the sound of sporadic laughter, the amplified voice sings a slightly altered version:

ICE will leave ICE will leave Oh, deep in my heart I do believe ICE will leave RIGHT THE FUCK NOW! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MINNEAPOLIS! THIS IS OUR FUCKING STREET!

Laughter and cheers and the handheld siren wails and the man with the megaphone keeps shouting: “The people are not with you! The people are with us! And they want you to get the fuck out of our city!”

A few minutes later, the SUV lurches forward, then drives slowly down the street. The residents cheer and taunt and follow from a safe distance. Whatever the bastards had planned for the apartment complex will have to wait for another day. “That’s the most exciting laundry I’ve ever done,” a man with a gray beard says dryly, then walks back into everyday life, to the extent that everyday life is possible anymore.

Why do people continue to push back, knowing what it might mean? It’s the question I’m here to ask, and so I approach two people and ask it. “ I’d love to know what inspires you to come out here, knowing that people have been killed doing this shit. You can also tell me to fuck off.”

The resident studies me for several seconds. “I’m not going to tell you to fuck off,” she says at last. “But I don’t think I want to answer.”

“It feels like the only way through it is through it,” Tim says when I ask him the same question a few minutes later. “Some of this is—it’s happening to us. And it’s a choice to stand up, but—” He pauses. “We don’t have a lot of options.”

The day before this standoff on 37th and Columbus, I spent all day in a rapid-response chat with dozens of volunteers: people who had to excuse themselves to pick up kids from school, people on their way home willing to spare an hour to keep their community safe. The tone was matter-of-fact, direct, resolute, but moments of fear crept in. I could hear it in the voice of a woman who reported an ICE agent getting out of his car, and in two watchers who declined to follow an agent who drove “aggressively” toward them in his car. “Stay safe,” they told each other by way of goodbye, with the kind of intensity reserved for people who understand that might not be possible.

Later that night, I went to a “Hotel Wide-Awake” demonstration outside the four-star Hilton in downtown Minneapolis where ICE has rented a block of rooms. Hundreds of protesters stood outside in subzero temperatures and made as much noise as possible—banging pots, blowing whistles, drumming on buckets, blowing trombones and trumpets. Police in riot gear stood menacingly in front of the hotel, then eventually dispersed the protest by force around 10 p.m.

“I’m not as afraid as I thought I would be,” a woman who goes by L told me at the Hilton Wide-Awake. She wore a backpack with a piece of paper taped to the back that said “Free Supplies”: first aid, handwarmers, earplugs. “I guess I just feel like I can take it, so I want to put myself as a body here. They can’t hurt all of us if it’s really big, and there are a lot of people who can’t necessarily be out here or don’t want to take the risk. But because I feel like I can accept that risk, I have to.”

In three days, I will drive out of Minneapolis and back to my home in New York City. Tim, and Star, and the man with the beard, and the woman who did not want to answer—these people are already home. No one asked them if they wanted to be on the front lines of the fight against ICE. They did not volunteer for this assignment. The assignment came to them.

“I wish I had the answer for why are we doing it,” Star says. “It’s an act of service. I don’t know. And it’s—so you can’t save everybody, right? And you maybe can’t even save anybody. Like maybe all we do is frustrate. You know, give someone one more day with their daughter or their dad. But if you lost your dad, or you lost your daughter, you would give anything to have one more day with them. And that’s what we can do.”

President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign seemed to hit a horrifying crescendo in the last month, with chaos in the streets of Minneapolis stretching the city’s populace to a near-breaking point. Unfortunately, the situation is about to get worse. On Friday, two far-right judges greenlit the Trump administration’s radical reinterpretation of federal law that would sweep millions more immigrants into mandatory detention, potentially expanding the mass deportation machinery in new and horrifying ways. Their 2–1 decision for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would transform the entire United States into a permanent border zone where unauthorized immigrants can be jailed indefinitely without bond, even years after they arrived. It supercharges the administration’s push to build an archipelago of mass detention centers larger than any existing jail or prison in the country. These mega-warehouses—which are not designed for human habitation—will hold up to 10,000 immigrants each, with little oversight and little recourse for detainees whose rights are violated. Even as public outrage over Trump’s mass deportation campaign intensifies, the legal and physical infrastructure of the plan are rapidly falling into place.

The 5th Circuit’s Friday decision gives new legal muscle to the Stephen Miller–orchestrated mass deportation campaign by endorsing the administration’s audacious rereading of a 1996 immigration law governing the detention of unauthorized migrants. For nearly 30 years, both the executive branch and the federal judiciary have understood this statute to draw a sharp line between migrants “seeking admission” at the border and those already in the country. The former are subject to mandatory detention without bond (with a few narrow exceptions). The latter, by contrast, can seek release on bond. If that request is denied, they can demand a bond hearing before an immigration judge. Most of the roughly 11 million immigrants without permanent legal status in the U.S. today fall into this second, bond-eligible group.

In July, the Trump administration collapsed the long-standing distinction between new arrivals and everyone else. It announced that it had “revisited” its view of the law and concluded that unauthorized immigrants already present in the United States are subject to mandatory detention, just like migrants encountered at the border. To reach that result, the government asserted that anyone who was never legally admitted to the country must, by definition, be “seeking admission” today. Under its theory, an immigrant who has lived here for decades is subject to the same harsh rules as someone who tried to cross the border yesterday. This shift empowered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain exponentially more immigrants without bond, prompting a flood of habeas petitions from those detainees challenging their confinement. Indeed, according to ProPublica, noncitizens have filed more of these petitions in the last 13 months than in the last three administrations combined.

Although the Trump-stacked Board of Immigration Appeals swiftly adopted the administration’s distortion of the statute, federal judges have overwhelmingly rejected it and freed detainees in habeas proceedings. As Kyle Cheney reported in Politico, at least 360 judges have spurned the government’s reasoning in more than 3,000 cases. They’ve done so in increasingly alarmed terms. Last week, Judge Thomas E. Johnston, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote: “It is appalling that the government insists that this Court should redefine or completely disregard the current law as it is clearly written,” deriding the administration’s theory as “dystopian absurdity.”

The problem, as these judges have explained, is that an unauthorized immigrant who’s already present in the country is not “seeking admission” at all; they are seeking to remain here. Yet ICE is detaining them under a statute reserved for new arrivals. By doing so, the agency is flagrantly breaking the law. So judges keep ordering ICE to release detainees—orders the agency has repeatedly flouted, prompting scathing judicial rebukes around the country.

On Friday, however, the administration finally caught a break at the 5th Circuit, the nation’s most reactionary appeals court. Justice Department officials maneuvered to ensure that the court would take up the question as quickly as possible, evidently hoping to notch a win. Two far-right judges, Edith Jones and Kyle Duncan, were happy to oblige: They embraced the administration’s reinterpretation on an expedited schedule, over a furious dissent by Judge Dana Douglas, who warned: “The border is now everywhere.” With this decision in hand, ICE can enforce the mandatory detention policy in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the three states covered by the circuit. (The agency had been funneling migrants from other jurisdictions into these states already, perhaps in anticipation of such a ruling.)

Jones and Duncan’s rush to bless this mandatory detention policy smooths the path for another component of Trump’s mass deportation push: The use of mega-warehouses to detain up to 10,000 noncitizens each and supplement the much smaller facilities that currently house detainees. ICE has been buying up these warehouses over the last few months—reportedly above market value to speed up the transactions—and converting them into makeshift detention camps. More than a quarter of the proposed sites fall within the 5th Circuit. As the American Immigration Council’s Aaron Reichlin-Melnick has pointed out, these detention facilities will house far more people than any jail or prison in the U.S. today.

Reichlin-Melnick told me on Tuesday that the mandatory detention policy now supported by the 5th Circuit is “a key part of the plan to fill these warehouses.” To achieve “the broader project of mass deportation,” Reichlin-Melnick said, “you need both the legal authority and physical space.” The government’s draconian rereading of immigration law “provides the legal authority. Warehouses provide the physical spaces.”

The overarching goal is to condemn as many noncitizens as possible to these sites, then hold them there without bond until they are so desperate and miserable that they agree to be deported. ICE already subjects its detainees to horrific, degrading, and inhumane conditions while blocking attempts at meaningful oversight. The situation may grow even more dire once the agency begins locking hundreds of thousands of noncitizens—many of whom may have lived here for years with pending legal claims to resolve their status—in industrial buildings that were never designed to hold human beings. Those subject to abuse at the hands of ICE officers will have no real mechanism for redress.

Even before the mandatory detention policy, noncitizens faced an uphill battle when seeking bond before an immigration judge. Trump purged many of these judges (who lack tenure) for alleged leniency, replacing them with ideologically aligned substitutes. But release on bond was still a real possibility for those who could show that they did not pose a flight risk or danger to the community. Now the government has shut off that safety valve, and—at least in the 5th Circuit—the machinery of detention can run at full speed. A series of Supreme Court decisions have closed off the possibility of a nationwide injunction or class action that could put a stop to this regime all at once. Immigrants’ only hope is that SCOTUS will swiftly and definitively shoot down the government’s contortion of the statute.

There is some reason for optimism that it will. Just eight years ago, the conservative justices appeared to foreclose the conflation of new arrivals and longer-term residents, acknowledging that the latter group is eligible for bond. But this Supreme Court has repeatedly twisted the law for Trump, particularly in his quest to immiserate noncitizens, and there’s no guarantee it will resist this act of legal vandalism. The administration is proceeding as if it already has the justices in its pocket. Unless and until they intervene, each new warehouse moves the country one step closer to the president’s vision of an American gulag.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta has decided to let Threads users make custom tweaks to its all-important algorithm, but don&#39;t expect your preferences to stick and do expect to bring your best manners.

The social media-cum-metaverse-cum-AI firm formerly known as Facebook announced a new Threads feature called &quot;Dear Algo&quot; on Wednesday, alongside news of plans to build a massive 1 GW AI datacenter in Lebanon, Indiana.

Dear Algo will use some of Meta&#39;s AI magic to tweak the algorithm for Threads users with just a public post, written like a letter directed to the algorithm, asking it to please show them more, or less of, a particular topic. Dear Algo posts can also be reposted by others, which will have the same effect on their account.

Once published, the Dear Algo will tweak a user&#39;s feed per their request – but only for three days due to what Meta says is a desire to keep users &quot;connected to the most current conversations&quot; – or most controversial, whichever makes Meta more money.

Meta didn&#39;t give many examples of the sort of commands users can make of Dear Algo, only mentioning things like telling it to show a person more posts about a current NBA game or something as general as &quot;show me more posts about podcasts.&quot;

The company didn&#39;t say how specific Dear Algo posts are able to get either, so whether a user could prompt it to exclude posts expressing certain viewpoints on a particular topic, or to mute spoilers about a particular television episode while allowing conversation about the show outside spoilers wasn&#39;t made clear.

Meta&#39;s algorithms have been a source of controversy for years, ever since the company eliminated chronologically sorted Facebook feeds in favor of the company deciding how to present content to its users.

Fast-forward more than a decade, and Meta is still taking heat for alleged racial bias in its algorithms, prioritizing content that may radicalize mass shooters, and generally promoting divisive, misery-inducing content.

Personifying its algorithm by letting users write letters to it in a bid to help them get a more tailored experience for a few days may help appease some, but it&#39;s just as possible to leave others wondering what Meta could do to make its platforms more pleasant.

Speaking of which, Meta didn&#39;t announce any plans to bring Dear Algo posts to its other platforms, so Instagram and Facebook users will have to continue to cope with an algorithm that provides what it thinks they want without an AI-powered option to change it.

Meta didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

            <div id="article-text">Banning sales to Chinese-government-affiliated companies, apparently, is not enough. A bipartisan group of American lawmakers this week called on the Trump administration to enact a blanket ban on the sale of equipment used in the production of advanced semiconductors to all of China.

In a letter to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the group of eight members of Congress argued that entity-specific trade restrictions were ineffective and called on the US government and its allies to enact countrywide trade restrictions on chipmaking kit.

&quot;Critical gaps persist in our export control regime. … Certain foreign-produced chokepoint SME (semiconductor manufacturing equipment) is controlled only for certain specific entities in China, rather than on a countrywide basis,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Once equipment crosses the border into China, the US government has extremely limited ability to enforce end-use and end-user restrictions.&quot;

The US has spent the better part of a decade now trying to kneecap China&#39;s domestic semiconductor industry by limiting access to key chipmaking technologies like extreme and deep ultraviolet (EUV / DUV) lithography.

However, US export policy under the past two administrations has largely targeted specific companies like China&#39;s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), rather than blocking sales at a country level.

&quot;Entity-specific controls, while valuable, cannot substitute for countrywide restrictions on the most critical chokepoint tools,&quot; they wrote. &quot;We urge the administration to press allies to implement countrywide controls on key chokepoint semiconductor manufacturing equipment and subcomponents.&quot;

The lawmakers describe “chokepoint” equipment and subcomponents as those China lacks a domestic equivalent for.

However, because the semiconductor supply chain is so diverse, many key components are made outside the US, limiting its ability to police trade. To address this, the lawmakers argue that if US allies do not align on countrywide controls, Washington should be prepared to use US-origin component restrictions to close the gaps itself.

&quot;The United States should be prepared to act to close remaining gaps itself if necessary, including by prohibiting the use of US-origin components in the production of chokepoint tools destined to China,&quot; the letter reads.

Equipment manufactured by the likes of the Netherlands&#39; ASML appears to be of particular concern for the group.

&quot;Dutch sales to China of advanced lithography equipment — the most important chokepoint in the supply chain — doubled from 2022 to 2023 and again from 2023 to 2024,&quot; the lawmakers wrote. &quot;Each chokepoint tool that enters China represents a permanent loss of American leverage.&quot;

In addition to barring sales of chipmaking gear, the lawmakers also want the Trump administration to crack down on companies that continue to service existing equipment now subject to trade restrictions in the region.

The lawmakers also warn that time is of the essence as China is working to build its homegrown chipmaking tech.

&quot;Left unchecked, China could render US and allied export controls irrelevant by replacing foreign chipmaking tools entirely,&quot; they said.

We&#39;ll note that this kind of thing does tend to happen when a nation is cut off from a critical technology, but reading between the lines, the argument seems to be that the US&#39; failure to effectively police foreign chipmaking equipment is buying time for the Chinese to build their own. ®

            <h2>AI spurs employees to work harder, faster, and with fewer breaks, study finds</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/ai_makes_employees_work_harder/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Harvard Business Review study is answering the question ‘what will employees do if AI saves them time at work?’ The answer: more work.

Researchers Aruna Ranganathan and Xingqi Maggie Ye with University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business studied a set of 40 workers at a 200-employee tech company from April to December last year to see whether generative AI had changed work habits in engineering, product, design, research, and operations.

&quot;We found that employees worked at a faster pace, took on a broader scope of tasks, and extended work into more hours of the day, often without being asked to do so,&quot; the researchers wrote. &quot;Importantly, the company did not mandate AI use (though it did offer enterprise subscriptions to commercially available AI tools). On their own initiative, workers did more because AI made &#39;doing more&#39; feel possible, accessible, and in many cases intrinsically rewarding.&quot;

Unfortunately the intensity of the work, the longer hours, and task expansion, led employees to feel stretched too thin, as the added work ate into their personal time.

&quot;That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making,” the researchers satiated. “The productivity surge enjoyed at the beginning can give way to lower quality work, turnover, and other problems.&quot;

During interviews with the employees, researchers found that using generative AI made it easier for employees to begin tasks that may have otherwise been daunting when starting from a blank page. Additionally, they were more willing to take on new responsibilities that had belonged to other roles thanks to a cognitive boost from AI.

But there were also engineering employees who found themselves checking the work of novice coders for errors, coaching vibe coders, and finishing projects that others had started.

Because it was easy to start tasks, the workers in the study began to work during breaks, at night and early in the morning, with fewer natural pauses in their workday.

&quot;What looks like higher productivity in the short run can mask silent workload creep and growing cognitive strain as employees juggle multiple AI-enabled workflows,&quot; researchers said. &quot;Because the extra effort is voluntary and often framed as enjoyable experimentation, it is easy for leaders to overlook how much additional load workers are carrying.&quot;

The fear is that this could impair judgement, increase the likelihood of errors, and mask unsustainable intensity as productivity gains.

&quot;For workers, the cumulative effect is fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,&quot; the paper stated.

Employees have some cause to fear losing their jobs with Forrester’s most recent AI job replacement research estimates that the technology could uproot 6 percent of jobs by 2030, or about 10.4 million, through robotic process automation, business process automation, physical robotics, and generative AI.

However, whether that comes with added productivity is a separate argument. Forrester’s vice president and principal analyst J. P. Gownder recently told The Register he is unconvinced that AI will revolutionize productivity.

The Berkeley researchers suggested developing a set of standards to prevent burnout.

This includes &quot;intentional pauses&quot; to fight back against the blurred boundaries between roles, regulate the tempo of development, and make sure tasks that begin with one purpose don’t meander from the company’s goals.

&quot;For example, a decision pause could require, before a major decision is finalized, one counterargument and one explicit link to organizational goals — widening the attention field just enough to protect against drift,” the researchers wrote. &quot;Incorporating such pauses into everyday workflow is one way organizations can support better decisions, healthier boundaries, and more sustainable forms of productivity in AI-augmented environments.&quot;

They also advise organizations to work on projects in coherent phases and to move forward deliberately rather than at the pace that AI might allow them to move. Make the team lead the AI; don’t let the AI lead the team.

“By regulating the order and timing of work — rather than demanding continuous responsiveness — sequencing can help organizations preserve attention, reduce cognitive overload, and support more thoughtful decision-making in AI-forward workplaces,” they wrote.

Introducing more human interaction can also help prevent the depleting effects of AI-mediated work.

&quot;As AI enables more solo, self-contained work, organizations can benefit from protecting time and space for listening and human connection. Short opportunities to connect with others—whether through brief check-ins, shared reflection moments, or structured dialogue—interrupt continuous solo engagement with AI tools and help restore perspective.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/tmobile_network_ai_translate_live_calls/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">T-Mobile is claiming it&#39;s now the first wireless carrier to integrate generative AI &quot;directly into a wireless network,&quot; and it&#39;s rolling out real-time call translation as the first feature delivered on top of its new AI-filled cellular network.

The self-described &quot;Un-carrier&quot; announced on Wednesday that beta signups were now available for live call translation powered not by an app or device-level capability, but AI that lives directly on the T-Mobile network. Eligible T-Mobile customers using a phone connected to 4G LTE or 5G - from flagship smartphones to bog-standard flip phones - can activate the feature by dialing * 87 *, with only one caller required to be on the carrier&#39;s network. Access is currently limited to customers admitted into the beta.

To add to the convenience factor, live translation only requires one person on a call to be a T-Mobile customer. The telco claims that it&#39;s &quot;instantaneous,&quot; and works in more than 50 languages, from English to Chinese to Welsh to Azerbaijani.

What, exactly, T-Mobile means by &quot;network-native AI&quot; is interesting, too. According to a spokesperson, calls are not being routed to datacenters for translation, there is no new edge hardware installed at cell towers, and all the AI processing happens as calls are transmitted.

&quot;The breakthrough innovation here is that we have actually opened up our IMS network and directly infused an AI agent so that it works on the network,&quot; a T-Mobile spokesperson told us. &quot;Think of this as a software update to the network, there were no hardware upgrades or changes needed.&quot;

The spokesperson told us that there&#39;s no rerouting of calls or additional devices – just a purely on-network use of agentic AI.

According to T-Mobile CEO Srini Gopalan, live translation is just the first AI-powered network-level feature the telco plans to introduce.

&quot;By bringing real-time AI directly into our network, we&#39;re delivering more than connectivity—turning conversations into community, starting with Live Translation,&quot; Gopalan said in the company&#39;s press release. T-Mobile didn&#39;t mention what features may be coming next, and declined to share any of them with The Register.

It&#39;s a convenient bit of tech to be sure, but T-Mobile&#39;s cybersecurity record, along with invasive applications of AI across multiple industries, might raise some privacy hackles.

While its recent history has been positive - T-Mobile touted the fact that it repelled an attacker attempting to break into its network right around the time other telcos were hit by Salt Typhoon - the company has a long rap sheet when it comes to cybersecurity failures.

By our count, T-Mobile has suffered at least seven IT security breaches between 2018 and 2023 that exposed the personal information of millions of customers. In September 2024, the company agreed to pay $31.5 million to settle an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission into multiple breaches and to commit to improved cybersecurity practices.

With that in mind, letting a network-based AI listen in on conversations and provide real-time translation might seem like something of a privacy concern for T-Mobile customers. T-Mobile assured us that&#39;s not the case, telling us that it &quot;adheres to all privacy regulations set by the FCC.&quot;

&quot;We do not save call recordings or transcripts,&quot; a T-Mobile spokesperson told us. &quot;The service is designed to translate conversations in real time and then move on, without storing the content of those calls.&quot;

T-Mobile also told us that it isn&#39;t training its AI models on customer data or call audio, and AI isn&#39;t listening in on calls that aren&#39;t being translated, either. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you&#39;ve seen the viral AI work pic trend where people are asking ChatGPT to &quot;create a caricature of me and my job based on everything you know about me&quot; and sharing it to social, you might think it&#39;s harmless. You&#39;d be wrong.

Forta security analyst Josh Davies says it puts people and their employers at risk of social engineering attacks, LLM account takeovers, and sensitive data theft.

&quot;At the time of writing, this is a hypothetical risk,&quot; Davies told The Register. &quot;But given the scale of participants publicly posting this trend, we believe it is highly likely that some could be exploited in this way with the LLM account takeover. The fact that users are posting this personal work information publicly and using a prompt that said &#39;based on everything you know about me&#39; it is feasible that sensitive information related to their employer could be viewable in the prompt history if takeover is successful.&quot;

As of February 8, Davies says 2.6 million of these images have been added to Instagram with links to users&#39; profiles, including both private and public accounts. &quot;I am currently looking through different posts, and have identified a banker, a water treatment engineer, HR employee, a developer and a doctor in the last 5 posts I viewed,&quot; he said in a Wednesday blog.

Sometimes the model will ask the user for more context before it creates their cartoon image. But even without those extra details, these caricatures signal to an attacker that the person uses an LLM at work - meaning there&#39;s a chance they input company data into a publicly available model.

As The Register has previously reported, many employees use personal chatbot accounts to help them do their jobs, and most companies have no idea how many AI agents and other systems have access to their corporate apps and data.

&quot;Many users do not realise the risks of inputting sensitive data into prompts or may make mistakes when looking to use LLMs to augment their tasks,&quot; Davies wrote. &quot;Even fewer understand that this data is saved in their prompt history and (although unlikely) could even be returned to another user, by accident, or intentionally in responses.&quot;

An attacker could combine the individual&#39;s social media username, profile information, and clues from the LLM-generated image to figure out the person&#39;s email address using search engine queries or open-source intelligence, he explained.

&quot;Account takeover would not require a sophisticated or especially technical actor,&quot; Davies told The Register. &quot;Much of the information [in] the public images will support doxing and spear phishing, which would increase the ease and chances of a successful social engineering attack.&quot;

Once they&#39;ve figured out the user&#39;s email address, the attacker could try to victimize them with a social-engineering attack, sending them a malicious link to a credential harvesting page or using an attacker-in-the-middle scenario to capture the user&#39;s session and take over their account.

This gives the attacker access to prompt history, which they can search for sensitive corporate data to later sell or abuse for fraud and other attacks - or use to extort a ransom payment if it&#39;s sensitive enough.

While LLM account takeover is the most likely risk and requires the technical skill, prompt injection and jailbreaking are also possibilities, although Davies told us those require &quot;a high level of sophistication....While not impossible, it is highly unlikely we would see this.&quot;

To prevent this type of unintentional data leakage, Davies says organizations first need visibility into LLM and AI usage by employees, and then governance policies to identify unapproved apps and limit their access to corporate systems and data.

He also recommends monitoring for compromised credentials. While this example focuses on personal LLM accounts as these are more likely to be used for social media posts, &quot;compromised corporate credentials would be even more damaging,&quot; he noted. ®

            <div id="article-text">Promo AI projects fail at scale not because models don&#39;t work or GPUs lack performance. They fail because data can&#39;t keep pace.

Foundation models work. GPUs deliver. But somewhere between raw data and inference, enterprises hit a wall. GPUs sit underutilized because training pipelines can&#39;t move data fast enough. Real-time inference stalls waiting for distributed data to arrive. And when teams try to scale beyond a handful of use cases, data becomes the constraint that breaks everything.

During GTC week, NVIDIA, Hammerspace, and The Register are hosting an off-the-record executive roundtable with senior infrastructure leaders actually operating AI at scale. This is peer-to-peer dialogue designed to surface what&#39;s actually breaking when scaling AI across hybrid and multi-cloud environments—and what an effective data platform looks like in practice.

Attendees will discuss where AI initiatives break down, how enterprises are enabling real-time inference at scale, and what future-ready data platforms look like. Conducted under Chatham House Rules to encourage candid, unfiltered conversation.

Places are limited. If you&#39;re leading infrastructure, data, or AI initiatives at enterprise scale, register your interest here and we&#39;ll confirm your place.

The company is adding new routes throughout the Southern US, including longer routes that normally require breaks for human drivers.

Aurora, the driverless truck firm founded by former members of Google’s pioneering self-driving car team, is branching out. In advance of its quarterly earnings report today, the company announced that a new software update would enable it to triple its driverless network to a total of 10 routes across the Southern US.

Currently, Aurora has five autonomous trucks without safety monitors driving routes between Dallas, Houston, Fort Worth, and El Paso. The company has issued three previous software updates: the first to authorize driverless trips between Dallas and Houston; the second to authorize driving at night; and the third to expand its network to include routes to El Paso.

With this new update, Aurora will begin operating trips between Fort Worth and Phoenix, which takes more than 15 hours to complete. Legally, human truck drivers are restricted to 11 hours of driving a day, within a 14-hour duty limit, before they are required to take a break. An autonomous truck is not subject to these same restrictions. Additional routes include: Dallas and Houston; Fort Worth and El Paso; El Paso and Phoenix; Fort Worth and Phoenix; and Dallas and Laredo.

The company is also using AI to build new maps for its autonomous driving system, with the goal of shortening the time between testing, validation, and commercial operation. According to Aurora:

After a single manual drive, cloud-based algorithms are able to generate semantic components, which helps to build new maps with little to no human assistance. Map automation significantly reduces the time to map new routes, positioning Aurora to accelerate the rollout of new routes and customer endpoints this year.

Aurora is still operating trucks with safety monitors for several of its clients, including Hirschbach Motor Lines, Detmar Logistics, and “one of the leading carriers in the US from its Phoenix facility.” Aurora CEO Chris Urmson said previously that the company complies with requests from partners to keep safety drivers in the cab as a matter of optics, not an indicator of technological regression. Operationally, it has no bearing on Aurora’s progress.

The company is also adding a new semi truck model to its fleet, based on the International LT, along with its new hardware suite which costs half the current stack. Aurora says it will launch the new truck without a safety monitor in the second quarter of 2026. And the company expects to have 200 driverless trucks in operation by the end of the year.

Lastly, Aurora said its cash position has improved. Previously, Urmson said that Aurora had roughly $1.6 billion in the bank, enough to last until the second half of 2027. Now, the company says it expects to achieve positive free cash flow by 2028, indicating that Aurora will be generating more money from its business operations than it is loses.

The company delayed a more personalized Siri nearly a year ago, but it reportedly still isn’t up to snuff.

Apple had been reportedly pushing to introduce some big changes to Siri with iOS 26.4, but now the company is planning to introduce them in later versions of iOS, including iOS 26.5 and iOS 27, Bloomberg reports.

Nearly a year ago, Apple delayed planned features for Siri that would let it understand your personal context and take action for you based on what’s on your screen. Apple had planned to launch those features with iOS 26.4, which is set to launch in March, but “​​testing uncovered fresh problems with the software,” according to Bloomberg. Apple has apparently told engineers to use iOS 26.5, scheduled for May, to test new Siri features instead.

For iOS 26.5, Apple is also testing a Perplexity-like web search tool and custom image generation, though they’ve been tested with iOS 26.4, too, Bloomberg says.

Apple is also working on an AI chatbot version of Siri that’s slated for launch with iOS 27, iPadOS, and macOS 27, Bloomberg reported in January. The plan is to reveal it in June at the Worldwide Developers Conference ahead of a September launch.

Samsung’s next Unpacked event is happening on February 25th, and we anticipate the company will announce the Galaxy S26 lineup of phones. There may be some new wearables and earbuds announced, too. In addition to the showing off the new hardware, Galaxy AI software is likely to be a big part of the show, since that’s the focus of the Unpacked sizzle reel.

If you’re hyped for the new devices — enough to consider trading in your phone — Samsung is hosting some special trade-in perks, but only if you register interest in a preorder ahead of the event and follow through with a purchase after the unveiling later this month. Registering through Samsung’s site or its Shop Samsung app now will unlock a $30 use-it-or-lose-it credit that can be applied toward accessories at preorder. However, it can’t be used to reduce the cost of the new device.

The company is also offering up to $900 in trade-in value for your phone if you preorder one of its new phones in the same transaction. This amount is higher than its current values, which go up to $700 if you have an S24 Ultra to trade. Regardless of the make or model, your old phone needs to meet some eligibility requirements, including (but not limited to) that it can’t have damage beyond normal wear-and-tear. The anticipated trade-in value will be applied at checkout. Whether you’re set on trading your phone in or not, it might be worth checking out Samsung’s site once preorders launch just to entertain the company’s trade-in offer.

Bad actors could use the flaw to remotely load and execute malicious files on a victim’s computer.

Microsoft has fixed a serious security vulnerability affecting Markdown files in Notepad. In the company’s Tuesday patch notes, Microsoft says a bad actor could carry out a remote code execution attack by tricking users “into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad,” as reported earlier by The Register.

Clicking the link would “launch unverified protocols,” allowing attackers to remotely load and execute malicious files on a victim’s computer, according to the patch notes. Microsoft says there isn’t any evidence of attackers exploiting the Notepad vulnerability (CVE-2026-20841) in the wild, but it issued a fix for the flaw in its Tuesday patch.

Microsoft initially added support for Markdown, a plaintext formatting language, to Notepad on Windows 11 last May. The move contributed to criticism that Microsoft is filling its operating system with bloatware, including by stuffing new features and AI capabilities into apps like Notepad and Paint.

Notepad isn’t the only text editor that has faced security issues recently, as the third-party Notepad++ app disclosed that some users may have downloaded a malicious update linked to Chinese state-sponsored attackers.

Investigators pulled video from ‘residual data’ in Google’s systems — here’s how that was possible and what it means for your privacy.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

FBI Director Kash Patel said yesterday that investigators recovered footage from Savannah Guthrie’s mother’s doorbell camera using “residual data located in backend systems.” This claim has many home security camera users asking an uncomfortable question: Is your data really gone when you hit delete?

When Nancy Guthrie went missing, officials said she had a doorbell camera, but that it had been forcibly removed, and she did not have a subscription. This meant there were no videos stored in the cloud. Ten days later, the FBI released footage from the camera, which was revealed to be a Nest Doorbell, clearly showing the masked suspect.

This is a huge break in the case and highlights the value of security cameras in solving crimes, even if their deterrent effect remains largely unproven. But it raises privacy concerns around how this supposedly “lost” footage was recovered.

How did Google retrieve footage that was deleted and that the user’s account didn’t have access to? Does this mean your deleted footage could be accessed by law enforcement? The answer to the second question, according to a forensic expert I spoke to, is technically yes. Deleted footage stored in the cloud can be recovered, but in this case, it was probably very difficult, and the resources to do so were likely made available only because of the case’s high profile.

I also reached out to Google, but it did not provide any additional information other than confirming that it is “assisting law enforcement with their investigations.”

To understand what likely happened, it helps to know how Google’s Nest cameras work, because they operate differently from most cameras on the market. Most of them only stream live footage unless you either pay for a subscription to the company’s cloud service or use local storage, such as a microSD card or a home hub.

“When you delete something from a server, it doesn’t get overwritten immediately”

Nest cameras, by contrast, can send clips to Google’s servers even without a paid subscription. Google offers a small amount of free cloud storage — older models store clips up to five minutes long for three hours; the latest models store 10-second clips for six hours. That means some footage is uploaded and stored, at least temporarily, whether you pay or not.

Unlike most competitors, Google doesn’t offer true local storage that you can access yourself. Newer Nest cameras do have limited on-device backup storage, but it’s only accessible through Google’s cloud.

All of this means the footage of the suspect went to Google’s servers, even though Nancy Guthrie did not pay for a subscription. If we assume Guthrie did not have the latest Nest Doorbell, which launched last October, then her doorbell would have been capable of recording five-minute clips, and she would have had access to them via the Nest or Google Home app for up to three hours after recording.

The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said the doorbell was disabled at 1:47AM on February 1st, and she was not reported missing until the next morning, more than three hours later. By that time, those recordings were no longer accessible to anyone with access to the account. (It’s possible members of the Guthrie family had access to the app; I know I have access to my elderly parents’ video doorbell app.)

But because it had once been in the cloud, there was a chance it could be retrieved. According to Nick Barreiro, chief forensic analyst with Principle Forensics, deleting footage from the cloud doesn’t necessarily mean it’s immediately gone. “When you delete something from a server, it doesn’t get overwritten immediately — the file system is just told to ignore this data, and this space is now available to be used. But if no new data is written over it, it’s still going to be there, even though you can’t see it.”

While it would be fairly straightforward to retrieve this data from a local server or hard drive, Barreiro said the process to retrieve it from Google’s servers was likely much more complicated.

While Barreiro has no direct knowledge of Google’s processes, he spent a decade in law enforcement focused on recorded evidence before moving to the private sector five years ago. “These video files aren’t necessarily all stored on a single server; they are probably stored in fragments in servers all over the world. It probably gets very complicated with Google’s architecture,” he said.

Footage of the suspect went to Google’s servers, even though Nancy Guthrie did not pay for a subscription

While the basic data recovery process remains the same, finding these files is like searching for a proverbial needle in a haystack. “Because they have been deleted, they aren’t identified by the file system anymore,” he says. “So you’re manually looking for them.”

There may be other reasons it took over a week for the footage to be released. Barreiro says it could be that Google was able to access it immediately, but wouldn’t release the footage without the proper legal process. “Google is notoriously uncooperative with law enforcement; they will comply with search warrants, but in the least helpful way possible and they will fight it,” he says. “It’s possible the delay was just getting through that legal process, properly worded court orders, and Google’s lawyers fighting it.”

However, he says that this seems unlikely, given the high-profile nature of the case. Additionally, reports indicate it took Google’s engineers “several days” to recover the footage.

But it’s an important point for those concerned about their data being accessible after it’s been deleted. While it was technically possible in this case, it’s highly unlikely to happen regularly. Barreiro believes this is “absolutely not something Google would do in a typical case.”

Ring, which also stores its video in the cloud, told me that the concept of “residual data” is not familiar to them. “We have run into this issue when folks have deleted footage and asked us if we can help get it back,” Ring spokesperson Emma Daniels said. “But it’s gone.”

While this case shows recovery is technically possible, it also shows it’s rare, resource-intensive, and reserved for extraordinary circumstances. But if the idea makes you uneasy, you can reduce your risk by using local storage that you control and/or a cloud service that offers end-to-end encryption, which means not even the provider can access your footage.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

That might explain why the first breakthrough LLM personal assistant came not from one of the major AI labs, which have to worry about reputation and liability, but from an independent software engineer, Peter Steinberger. In November of 2025, Steinberger uploaded his tool, now called OpenClaw, to GitHub, and in late January the project went viral.

OpenClaw harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out. The risks posed by OpenClaw are so extensive that it would probably take someone the better part of a week to read all of the security blog posts on it that have cropped up in the past few weeks. The Chinese government took the step of issuing a public warning about OpenClaw’s security vulnerabilities.

In response to these concerns, Steinberger posted on X that nontechnical people should not use the software. (He did not respond to a request for comment for this article.) But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and it’s not limited to people who can run their own software security audits. Any AI companies that hope to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research.

OpenClaw is, in essence, a mecha suit for LLMs. Users can choose any LLM they like to act as the pilot; that LLM then gains access to improved memory capabilities and the ability to set itself tasks that it repeats on a regular cadence. Unlike the agentic offerings from the major AI companies, OpenClaw agents are meant to be on 24-7, and users can communicate with them using WhatsApp or other messaging apps. That means they can act like a superpowered personal assistant who wakes you each morning with a personalized to-do list, plans vacations while you work, and spins up new apps in its spare time.

But all that power has consequences. If you want your AI personal assistant to manage your inbox, then you need to give it access to your email—and all the sensitive information contained there. If you want it to make purchases on your behalf, you need to give it your credit card info. And if you want it to do tasks on your computer, such as writing code, it needs some access to your local files.

There are a few ways this can go wrong. The first is that the AI assistant might make a mistake, as when a user’s Google Antigravity coding agent reportedly wiped his entire hard drive. The second is that someone might gain access to the agent using conventional hacking tools and use it to either extract sensitive data or run malicious code. In the weeks since OpenClaw went viral, security researchers have demonstrated numerous such vulnerabilities that put security-naïve users at risk.

Both of these dangers can be managed: Some users are choosing to run their OpenClaw agents on separate computers or in the cloud, which protects data on their hard drives from being erased, and other vulnerabilities could be fixed using tried-and-true security approaches.

But the experts I spoke to for this article were focused on a much more insidious security risk known as prompt injection. Prompt injection is effectively LLM hijacking: Simply by posting malicious text or images on a website that an LLM might peruse, or sending them to an inbox that an LLM reads, attackers can bend it to their will.

And if that LLM has access to any of its user’s private information, the consequences could be dire. “Using something like OpenClaw is like giving your wallet to a stranger in the street,” says Nicolas Papernot, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Toronto. Whether or not the major AI companies can feel comfortable offering personal assistants may come down to the quality of the defenses that they can muster against such attacks.

It’s important to note here that prompt injection has not yet caused any catastrophes, or at least none that have been publicly reported. But now that there are likely hundreds of thousands of OpenClaw agents buzzing around the internet, prompt injection might start to look like a much more appealing strategy for cybercriminals. “Tools like this are incentivizing malicious actors to attack a much broader population,” Papernot says.

The term “prompt injection” was coined by the popular LLM blogger Simon Willison in 2022, a couple of months before ChatGPT was released. Even back then, it was possible to discern that LLMs would introduce a completely new type of security vulnerability once they came into widespread use. LLMs can’t tell apart the instructions that they receive from users and the data that they use to carry out those instructions, such as emails and web search results—to an LLM, they’re all just text. So if an attacker embeds a few sentences in an email and the LLM mistakes them for an instruction from its user, the attacker can get the LLM to do anything it wants.

Prompt injection is a tough problem, and it doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon. “We don’t really have a silver-bullet defense right now,” says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. But there’s a robust academic community working on the problem, and they’ve come up with strategies that could eventually make AI personal assistants safe.

Technically speaking, it is possible to use OpenClaw today without risking prompt injection: Just don’t connect it to the internet. But restricting OpenClaw from reading your emails, managing your calendar, and doing online research defeats much of the purpose of using an AI assistant. The trick of protecting against prompt injection is to prevent the LLM from responding to hijacking attempts while still giving it room to do its job.

One strategy is to train the LLM to ignore prompt injections. A major part of the LLM development process, called post-training, involves taking a model that knows how to produce realistic text and turning it into a useful assistant by “rewarding” it for answering questions appropriately and “punishing” it when it fails to do so. These rewards and punishments are metaphorical, but the LLM learns from them as an animal would. Using this process, it’s possible to train an LLM not to respond to specific examples of prompt injection.

But there’s a balance: Train an LLM to reject injected commands too enthusiastically, and it might also start to reject legitimate requests from the user. And because there’s a fundamental element of randomness in LLM behavior, even an LLM that has been very effectively trained to resist prompt injection will likely still slip up every once in a while.

Another approach involves halting the prompt injection attack before it ever reaches the LLM. Typically, this involves using a specialized detector LLM to determine whether or not the data being sent to the original LLM contains any prompt injections. In a recent study, however, even the best-performing detector completely failed to pick up on certain categories of prompt injection attack.

The third strategy is more complicated. Rather than controlling the inputs to an LLM by detecting whether or not they contain a prompt injection, the goal is to formulate a policy that guides the LLM’s outputs—i.e., its behaviors—and prevents it from doing anything harmful. Some defenses in this vein are quite simple: If an LLM is allowed to email only a few pre-approved addresses, for example, then it definitely won’t send its user’s credit card information to an attacker. But such a policy would prevent the LLM from completing many useful tasks, such as researching and reaching out to potential professional contacts on behalf of its user.

“The challenge is how to accurately define those policies,” says Neil Gong, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University. “It’s a trade-off between utility and security.”

On a larger scale, the entire agentic world is wrestling with that trade-off: At what point will agents be secure enough to be useful? Experts disagree. Song, whose startup, Virtue AI, makes an agent security platform, says she thinks it’s possible to safely deploy an AI personal assistant now. But Gong says, “We’re not there yet.”

Even if AI agents can’t yet be entirely protected against prompt injection, there are certainly ways to mitigate the risks. And it’s possible that some of those techniques could be implemented in OpenClaw. Last week, at the inaugural ClawCon event in San Francisco, Steinberger announced that he’d brought a security person on board to work on the tool.

As of now, OpenClaw remains vulnerable, though that hasn’t dissuaded its multitude of enthusiastic users. George Pickett, a volunteer maintainer of the OpenGlaw GitHub repository and a fan of the tool, says he’s taken some security measures to keep himself safe while using it: He runs it in the cloud, so that he doesn’t have to worry about accidentally deleting his hard drive, and he’s put mechanisms in place to ensure that no one else can connect to his assistant.

But he hasn’t taken any specific actions to prevent prompt injection. He’s aware of the risk but says he hasn’t yet seen any reports of it happening with OpenClaw. “Maybe my perspective is a stupid way to look at it, but it’s unlikely that I’ll be the first one to be hacked,” he says.

A “QuitGPT” campaign is urging people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions

In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. And while it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, there’s no denying QuitGPT is getting attention. Read the full story.

EVs could be cheaper to own than gas cars in Africa by 2040

Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Read the full story.

“These companies are terrified that no one’s going to notice them.”

—Tom Goodwin, co-founder of business consulting firm All We Have Is Now, tells the Guardian why AI startups are going to increasingly desperate measures to grab would-be customers’ attention.

How AI is changing gymnastics judgingThe 2023 World Championships last October marked the first time an AI judging system was used on every apparatus in a gymnastics competition. There are obvious upsides to using this kind of technology: AI could help take the guesswork out of the judging technicalities. It could even help to eliminate biases, making the sport both more fair and more transparent.At the same time, others fear AI judging will take away something that makes gymnastics special. Gymnastics is a subjective sport, like diving or dressage, and technology could eliminate the judges’ role in crafting a narrative.For better or worse, AI has officially infiltrated the world of gymnastics. The question now is whether it really makes it fairer. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.

There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. As a result some previous analyses have suggested that fossil-fuel vehicles would dominate in Africa through at least 2050.

But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Electric two-wheelers, cars, larger automobiles, and even minibuses could compete in most African countries in just 15 years, according to the new study, published in Nature Energy.

“EVs have serious economic potential in most African countries in the not-so-distant future,” says Bessie Noll, a senior researcher at ETH Zürich and one of the authors of the study.

The study considered the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of a vehicle. That includes the sticker price, financing costs, and the cost of fueling (or charging). The researchers didn’t consider policy-related costs like taxes, import fees, and government subsidies, choosing to focus instead on only the underlying economics.

EVs are getting cheaper every year as battery and vehicle manufacturing improve and production scales, and the researchers found that in most cases and in most places across Africa, EVs are expected to be cheaper than equivalent gas-powered vehicles by 2040. EVs should also be less expensive than vehicles that use synthetic fuels.

For two-wheelers like electric scooters, EVs could be the cheaper option even sooner: with smaller, cheaper batteries, these vehicles will be economically competitive by the end of the decade. On the other hand, one of the most difficult segments for EVs to compete in is small cars, says Christian Moretti, a researcher at ETH Zürich and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.

Because some countries still have limited or unreliable grid access, charging is a major barrier to EV uptake, Noll says. So for EVs, the authors analyzed the cost of buying not only the vehicle but also a solar off-grid charging system. This includes solar panels, batteries, and the inverter required to transform the electricity into a version that can charge an EV. (The additional batteries help the system store energy for charging at times when the sun isn’t shining.)

Mini grids and other standalone systems that include solar panels and energy storage are increasingly common across Africa. It’s possible that this might be a primary way that EV owners in Africa will charge their vehicles in the future, Noll says.

One of the bigger barriers to EVs in Africa is financing costs, she adds. In some cases, the cost of financing can be more than the up-front cost of the vehicle, significantly driving up the cost of ownership.

Today, EVs are more expensive than equivalent gas-powered vehicles in much of the world. But in places where it’s relatively cheap to borrow money, that difference can be spread out across the course of a vehicle’s whole lifetime for little cost. Then, since it’s often cheaper to charge an EV than fuel a gas-powered car, the EV is less expensive over time.

In some African countries, however, political instability and uncertain economic conditions make borrowing money more expensive. To some extent, the high financing costs affect the purchase of any vehicle, regardless of how it’s powered. But EVs are more expensive up front than equivalent gas-powered cars, and that higher up-front cost adds up to more interest paid over time. In some cases, financing an EV can also be more expensive than financing a gas vehicle—the technology is newer, and banks may see the purchase as more of a risk and charge a higher interest rate, says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank.

The picture varies widely depending on the country, too. In South Africa, Mauritius, and Botswana, financing conditions are already close to levels required to allow EVs to reach cost parity, according to the study. In higher-risk countries (the study gives examples including Sudan, which is currently in a civil war, and Ghana, which is recovering from a major economic crisis), financing costs would need to be cut drastically for that to be the case.

Making EVs an affordable option will be a key first step to putting more on the roads in Africa and around the world. “People will start to pick up these technologies when they’re competitive,” says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

Solar-based charging systems, like the ones mentioned in the study, could help make electricity less of a constraint, bringing more EVs to the roads, Nsitem says. But there’s still a need for more charging infrastructure, a major challenge in many countries where the grid needs major upgrades for capacity and reliability, he adds.

Globally, more EVs are hitting the roads every year. “The global trend is unmistakable,” Carlin says. There are questions about how quickly it’s happening in different places, he says, “but the momentum is there.”

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.

The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January.

For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.

QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. Many lamented the performance of GPT-5.2, the latest model. Others shared memes parodying the chatbot’s sycophancy. Some planned a “Mass Cancellation Party” in San Francisco, a sardonic nod to the GPT-4o funeral that an OpenAI employee had floated, poking fun at users who are mourning the model’s impending retirement. Still, others are protesting against what they see as a deepening entanglement between OpenAI and the Trump administration.

OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.

As of December 2025, ChatGPT had nearly 900 million weekly active users, according to The Information. While it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, QuitGPT is getting attention. A recent Instagram post from the campaign has more than 36 million views and 1.3 million likes. And the organizers say that more than 17,000 people have signed up on the campaign’s website, which asks people whether they canceled their subscriptions, will commit to stop using ChatGPT, or will share the campaign on social media.

“There are lots of examples of failed campaigns like this, but we have seen a lot of effectiveness,” says Dana Fisher, a sociologist at American University. A wave of canceled subscriptions rarely sways a company’s behavior, unless it reaches a critical mass, she says. “The place where there’s a pressure point that might work is where the consumer behavior is if enough people actually use their … money to express their political opinions.”

MIT Technology Review reached out to three employees at OpenAI, none of whom said they were familiar with the campaign.

Dozens of left-leaning teens and twentysomethings scattered across the US came together to organize QuitGPT in late January. They range from pro-democracy activists and climate organizers to techies and self-proclaimed cyber libertarians, many of them seasoned grassroots campaigners. They were inspired by a viral video posted by Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University and host of The Prof G Pod. He argued that the best way to stop ICE was to persuade people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions. Denting OpenAI’s subscriber base could ripple through the stock market and threaten an economic downturn that would nudge Trump, he said.

“We make a big enough stink for OpenAI that all of the companies in the whole AI industry have to think about whether they’re going to get away enabling Trump and ICE and authoritarianism,” says an organizer of QuitGPT who requested anonymity because he feared retaliation by OpenAI, citing the company’s recent subpoenas against advocates at nonprofits. OpenAI made for an obvious first target of the movement, he says, but “this is about so much more than just OpenAI.”

Simon Rosenblum-Larson, a labor organizer in Madison, Wisconsin, who organizes movements to regulate the development of data centers, joined the campaign after hearing about it through Signal chats among community activists. “The goal here is to pull away the support pillars of the Trump administration. They’re reliant on many of these tech billionaires for support and for resources,” he says.

QuitGPT’s website points to new campaign finance reports showing that Greg Brockman and his wife each donated $12.5 million to MAGA Inc., making up nearly a quarter of the roughly $102 million it raised over the second half of 2025. The information that ICE uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4 came from an AI inventory published by the Department of Homeland Security in January.

QuitGPT is in the mold of Galloway’s own recently launched campaign, Resist and Unsubscribe. The movement urges consumers to cancel their subscriptions to Big Tech platforms, including ChatGPT, for the month of February, as a protest to companies “driving the markets and enabling our president.”

“A lot of people are feeling real anxiety,” Galloway told MIT Technology Review. “You take enabling a president, proximity to the president, and an unease around AI,” he says, “and now people are starting to take action with their wallets.” Galloway says his campaign’s website can draw more than 200,000 unique visits in a day and that he receives dozens of DMs every hour showing screenshots of canceled subscriptions.

The consumer boycotts follow a growing wave of pressure from inside the companies themselves. In recent weeks, tech workers have been urging their employers to use their political clout to demand that ICE leave US cities, cancel company contracts with the agency, and speak out against the agency’s actions. CEOs have started responding. OpenAI’s Sam Altman wrote in an internal Slack message to employees that ICE is “going too far.” Apple CEO Tim Cook called for a “deescalation” in an internal memo posted on the company’s website for employees. It was a departure from how Big Tech CEOs have courted President Trump with dinners and donations since his inauguration.

Although spurred by a fatal immigration crackdown, these developments signal that a sprawling anti-AI movement is gaining momentum. The campaigns are tapping into simmering anxieties about AI, says Rosenblum-Larson, including the energy costs of data centers, the plague of deepfake porn, the teen mental-health crisis, the job apocalypse, and slop. “It’s a really strange set of coalitions built around the AI movement,” he says.

“Those are the right conditions for a movement to spring up,” says David Karpf, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. Brockman’s donation to Trump’s super PAC caught many users off guard, he says. “In the longer arc, we are going to see users respond and react to Big Tech, deciding that they’re not okay with this.”

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

            <div id="article-text">For families living with neurodegenerative disease, the hardest part is not always the diagnosis. It is the slow erosion that follows: memory fading, personality shifting, independence shrinking.

It unfolds quietly. First, forgotten appointments. Then repeated questions. Then moments when a familiar face no longer feels familiar.

The illness does not isolate itself to one body. It rearranges the lives around it. Partners become caregivers. Children become decision-makers. Conversations grow shorter. Patience grows thinner. Guilt creeps in, for being tired, for wishing things were easier, for missing the person who is still physically there.

Neurodegeneration is rarely a single patient story. It is a family condition, stretching across kitchens, hospital corridors, and years that feel longer than they should.

Dublin-based Aerska has raised $39 million in fresh funding to battle one of the biggest scientific barriers standing between patients and meaningful treatment: getting advanced genetic medicines into the brain.

The round was co-led by EQT Life Sciences and age1, two investors known for backing high-risk, high-impact biotech. Their bet is not just on a platform, but on the possibility that diseases once managed only at the margins could eventually be slowed at their root.

Think of the brain as a house with very strict security at the door. That security system, called the blood-brain barrier, protects us from harmful substances in the blood. The problem is that it is so strict that it also blocks many medicines.

So even if scientists create a smart treatment that can “turn off” a harmful gene linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s, the drug often cannot physically get inside the brain cells where it needs to work.

Aerska is trying to solve that access problem.

Instead of injecting medicine directly into the brain, which is invasive and risky, they are developing a way to send it through the bloodstream like a normal injection. Their technology acts like a special pass that lets the treatment cross the brain’s security gate. Once inside, the medicine can reduce the production of the proteins that drive disease.

In simple terms, the science to switch off bad genes already exists. The hard part is delivery. Aerska is building the delivery vehicle.

The company’s early focus includes genetic drivers of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Both remain incurable. Existing drugs largely manage symptoms rather than altering the course of decline.

RNA interference, by contrast, aims to reduce the production of disease-causing proteins themselves. It is a strategy that addresses biology upstream, not downstream.

Longevity has become the “American dream” in European biotech, yet most serious investors are looking less at life extension and more at healthspan,  years lived with clarity and autonomy.

That is the space Aerska is positioning itself in. The goal is not abstract immortality. It is more time at home, more recognisable faces, and more preserved dignity.

The $39 million will fund preclinical development and early clinical steps. The scientific obsacle remain significant, and neurological drug development has humbled many before. But systemic RNA delivery to the brain, if proven safe and effective, would mark a structural shift in how these diseases are approached.

For now, Aerska represents something simpler: a European biotech choosing to confront one of medicine’s most stubborn frontiers,  not with incremental symptom control, but with the ambition to change the trajectory itself.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We stand at one of history’s most exhilarating crossroads. Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of work, business, and human potential at breathtaking speed. The very capabilities that make us most human, our creativity, our imagination, our ability to dream up what doesn’t yet exist, are becoming our most valuable assets.

This is not a story about humans versus machines. It’s a story about human potential unleashed. It’s about a future where technology handles the tedious so we can focus on the transcendent.

Where the dreamers, the questioners, the bold thinkers who color outside the lines are not just welcomed, they are essential.

Imagine a world where you never again have to spend hours on mind-numbing data entry, formatting documents, or wrestling with spreadsheets, where the repetitive tasks that drain your energy and dull your spirit are handled instantly by AI, freeing you to focus on work that genuinely excites you.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What we are witnessing is not the replacement of human workers; it is the liberation of human potential. AI is taking on the equivalent of heavy lifting, and in doing so, it’s creating space for something extraordinary: a global renaissance of creative thinking.

Think about what becomes possible when you’re freed from the mundane. When a graphic designer no longer spends half their day on production tasks, they can explore ten bold creative directions instead of one safe option.

When a teacher is not buried in administrative work, they can devise innovative ways to spark curiosity in every student. When operational details do not consume an entrepreneur, they can envision entirely new possibilities for serving their customers.

This is the gift AI is giving us: time and mental space to be more fully human, more creative, more imaginative than ever before.

Here is what the smartest organisations are discovering: when everyone has access to the same powerful AI tools, the differentiator is not the technology. It’s the human wielding it.

Two companies can use identical AI platforms. One generates competent but forgettable content. The other creates campaigns that move people to tears, spark movements, and transform markets. The difference? Creative vision. Human imagination. The ability to ask questions that AI would never think to ask.

The most successful people in the AI era won’t be those who compete with machines at what machines do well. They will be those who ask better questions.

The creative thinker who asks “What if we completely reimagined this?” instead of “How can we make this 10% better?” The visionary who wonders “What problem are we not seeing?” instead of “How do we solve this defined problem?” The innovator who questions “Why are we doing this at all?” instead of “How can we do this more efficiently?”

These questions change trajectories. They open new possibilities. They create breakthroughs. And they can only come from curious, creative human minds willing to challenge assumptions and imagine alternatives.

It is true that AI will displace certain positions, as noted by the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report. It projects that 92 million roles will be displaced by 2030, with positions like graphic designers and administrative assistants among those facing decline due to automation and generative AI.

This technological disruption is simultaneously unleashing a creative renaissance. The same WEF report reveals that 170 million new roles will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs, with creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility emerging as some of the fastest-growing skills in demand alongside technical capabilities.

Forbes has noted that innovation and creativity rank among the top skills needed for the future, with employers recognising that while AI may displace 14% of jobs by 2030, the aspects of innovation that revolve around human empathy and deeper consciousness cannot be replicated by machines.

The message is clear: as AI handles the repetitive and predictable, human creativity becomes not just valuable but essential. Organisations are not looking for people who can compete with AI at computational tasks; they are seeking creative thinkers who can imagine entirely new possibilities and ask questions machines would never consider.

The uniquely human qualities of intuition, empathy, and visionary thinking to solve problems that have not even been defined yet.

Here is the beauty about creative thinking: it’s not a single skill or talent. It’s a constellation of capabilities, and each person’s constellation is unique.

Maybe you are brilliant at seeing patterns others miss, connecting dots across completely different domains. Perhaps you have an uncanny ability to understand what people truly need, even when they can’t articulate it themselves.

You might be exceptional at taking a spark of an idea and developing it into something magnificent, or at bringing people together in ways that generate creative breakthroughs.

Some creative thinkers are wildly imaginative, dreaming up possibilities that seem to come from nowhere. Others are integrative, synthesizing diverse ideas into coherent wholes. Some challenge every assumption; others build masterfully on existing foundations. Some think in images, others in systems, still others in stories.

Every version is valuable. Every version is needed.

The AI era does not demand that you become someone you’re not. It invites you to become more fully yourself: to lean into your natural creative strengths and develop them intentionally. Your particular way of thinking creatively is your signature, your competitive advantage, your gift to offer the world.

The creative thinkers of the next decade won’t be lone geniuses toiling in isolation. They will be collaborative creators, working alongside both humans and AI to achieve things neither could accomplish alone.

Imagine participating in creative collaborations where AI handles the analytical heavy lifting while you and your colleagues focus on vision, judgment, and inspiration. Where technology expands what’s possible while human creativity provides direction and meaning.

Where diverse perspectives combine with computational power to solve challenges that once seemed insurmountable.

This is already happening. Architects are using AI to explore thousands of design possibilities, then applying their creative judgment to create buildings that inspire.

Scientists are using AI to identify patterns in vast datasets, then applying creative thinking to formulate revolutionary hypotheses.

Artists are using AI as a creative tool, generating works that express uniquely human perspectives in entirely new ways. You can be part of this creative renaissance. Your ideas, your questions, your unique perspective matter more than ever.

The accelerating pace of change in our world makes creative thinking not just valuable but essential for adaptation and survival. The challenges we face: climate change, resource scarcity, social fragmentation, and emerging technologies with unpredictable consequences don’t have predetermined solutions in any playbook.

They require the kind of flexible, imaginative thinking that can break free from established frameworks and conventional wisdom. Moreover, as the half-life of specific technical skills continues to shrink, the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn ( which is itself a creative process) becomes more important than mastery of any particular tool or technique.

Those who can think creatively can pivot between domains, see opportunities in disruption, and continuously reinvent themselves and their contributions.

Perhaps most importantly, creative thinking will be crucial for maintaining meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated world.

As machines handle more of our productivity, human value will increasingly derive from our capacity for original expression, cultural creation, emotional resonance, and the kind of meaning-making that gives life richness beyond mere efficiency.

The future is not about those who compete with machines at “machine like” tasks, but to those who can amplify their humanity by asking better questions, imagining more beautiful possibilities, and creating connections that matter.

The AI revolution is here, and it’s revealing a profound truth: the most powerful technology humans have ever created still can’t replicate the magic of human creativity. It can’t dream up what doesn’t exist. It can’t make intuitive leaps that defy logic. It can’t feel what matters, imagine what’s possible, or create meaning from chaos.

The next decade will belong to the creative thinkers because they are doing what AI cannot. They will ask better questions and make unexpected connections. Solving problems that have not been defined. Creating experiences that move people. Imagining futures worth building.

The next decade belongs to the creative thinkers. Make sure you are one of them.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/naboo-raises-70m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-headquartered Naboo has raised a $70m in Series B as it accelerates its ambition to become the operating layer for how large companies plan, book, and control corporate events. The round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the same investor that backed Mistral AI in 2023, and lands just a year after Naboo closed a €20m Series A.

Naboo positions itself as an AI-powered procurement platform for corporate events, covering everything from venue booking and travel to supplier coordination and budget control.

Founded in 2022, Naboo built its name on simplifying how companies organise and run corporate events,  from booking venues and catering to logistics and attendee management, using an all-in-one platform that brings speed and transparency to a typically fragmented process.

By folding AI into what is traditionally a fragmented, manual process, the company says it has become Europe’s leading purchasing platform for corporate events, a corner of the broader $400bn global events market that has long resisted software consolidation.

The timing matters. Corporate events sit at the intersection of travel, finance, and operations, yet they are often managed outside standard procurement systems.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Naboo’s pitch is that events should be treated like any other strategic spend, measurable, optimised, and governed through a single platform. That logic has resonated with large enterprises, particularly in the UK, which has become Naboo’s biggest market outside France following the opening of its London office in 2025.

With fresh capital in hand, Naboo is now stepping more decisively onto the global stage. The company is opening a new hub in New York as part of a broader US expansion, betting that multinational clients want a single system to manage events across regions, teams, and currencies.

Within just three years, Naboo has grown into one of the more visible players in the category, helped by enterprises looking for better control over decentralised spending.

The bigger shift, however, goes beyond events. Naboo plans to extend its AI procurement platform into “tail spend”, the long tail of smaller, harder-to-track purchases that typically fall outside core procurement tools.

In enterprise finance, this is often labelled Class C spending, and while each transaction is small, the total adds up fast. Naboo’s goal is to give companies a unified, AI-driven view of this spend, starting with events and branching outward.

The targets are ambitious. Naboo says it aims to triple revenue in 2026 and to exceed $1bn in business volume by 2027.

Whether it gets there will depend on how far enterprises are willing to centralise spending that has historically lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. What’s clear is that Naboo is betting that the next wave of enterprise AI won’t just analyse data, it will quietly reshape how money is spent.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Databricks is having one of those years that most enterprise software companies would quietly envy. The data and AI platform says it has reached a $5.4bn annual revenue run rate, growing 65% year over year, at a time when growth across the sector has cooled noticeably.

For a private company, that pace is rare. And it helps explain why investors have continued to pour money into Databricks, even as funding has become more selective.

The company says it has now raised more than $7bn in total capital, including recent equity funding that values the business at $134bn, alongside a large debt facility to support long-term expansion.

What’s driving the numbers isn’t just classic data analytics. Databricks says around $1.4bn of its revenue run rate now comes from AI-related products, reflecting how quickly companies are trying to turn large datasets into something usable for machine learning and generative AI. Instead of building separate stacks for data and AI, many customers are opting for platforms that combine both.

In practice, that means Databricks is leaning into tools that make complex data systems easier to use. Products like Genie, which lets people query data using plain language, and Lakebase, a new operational database designed for AI-driven applications, are meant to lower the barrier between raw data and real-world use.

While Databricks is still private, its scale increasingly puts it in the same conversation as public cloud giants.

“We’re seeing overwhelming investor interest in our next chapter as we go after two new markets,” said Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks. “With this new capital, we’ll double down on Lakebase so developers can create operational databases built for AI agents. At the same time, we’re investing in Genie to let every employee chat with their data, driving accurate and actionable insights.

Databricks’ numbers also cut through a lot of the noise around enterprise AI. While many companies are still talking about transformation, this growth suggests businesses are already spending on the unglamorous parts, cleaning data, connecting systems, and making AI usable inside real organisations.

If that trend holds, the next phase of AI won’t be defined by new models or flashy demos, but by which platforms quietly become impossible to replace. Databricks is clearly betting it can be one of them.

            <h2>Allonic is rebuilding robotics from the inside out</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/allonic-is-rebuilding-robotics-from-the-inside-out">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Budapest-based robotics company Allonic has raised $7.2 million in a pre-seed round, marking what investors are calling the largest pre-seed funding round in Hungarian startup history.

The raise was led by Visionaries Club with participation from Day One Capital, Prototype, SDAC Ventures, TinyVC, and more than a dozen angels from organisations including OpenAI and Hugging Face.

Allonic’s $7.2m pre-seed matters because it breaks a quiet rule in Europe: that truly hard hardware problems are supposed to wait until later rounds, or later continents. This is early money going into the physical layer of robotics, not the AI wrapper around it, and it’s happening in Budapest, not Silicon Valley or Munich.

This may also send a signal that European investors are starting to back ambition at the source, where things are messy, slow, and expensive to build.

It also shows that Central and Eastern Europe is no longer just a talent pool for outsourced engineering, but a place where original industrial ideas can take shape and attract serious capital.

If this pattern holds, Europe doesn’t just produce smarter robots; it produces the means to actually build them.

Yet, Allonic is building a fundamentally different way to produce robot bodies, addressing a problem that many robotics founders say has been overlooked as AI and autonomy grab headlines.

Today’s robots are typically assembled from scores of individual mechanical parts, bearings, screws, cables, and rigid linkages, a process that is slow, expensive, and hard to scale. Instead, Allonic uses what it calls a 3D Tissue Braiding process, which automatically weaves together fibres, elastics, and embedded wiring over an endoskeleton in a single continuous operation.

Allonic has already completed an initial pilot in electronics manufacturing, and says it is in talks with companies across industrial automation and humanoid robotics. With the fresh capital, the team plans to grow engineering and commercial capabilities and accelerate further pilot deployments.

Investors may see the round as a sign that robotics investment is maturing beyond software and autonomy into the foundational parts of the stack.

In that sense, we can say that Allonic isn’t just a funding story; it’s a small stress test for Europe’s ability to back its own industrial future. If this kind of capital continues to flow into foundational hardware, not just software layers, Europe can move from exporting ideas to shaping the tools that industries run on.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based energy software company Tem has closed a $75 million Series B round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with additional funding from AlbionVC, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Schroders Capital, Voyager Ventures, Allianz, and others.

The round reportedly values the company at more than $300 million and will fund its expansion into the United States and Australia.

Tem builds an AI-native energy platform designed to automate the pricing, matching, and execution of electricity transactions, a market that has long relied on manual processes and legacy infrastructure.

Its core system uses machine learning to forecast supply and demand, match buyers with suppliers, and reduce the layers of intermediaries that typically add cost and complexity.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

According to Tem, more than 2,600 businesses in the UK are already on its platform, with customers reporting energy cost savings of up to 30 per cent compared with traditional procurement approaches.

The startup also handled roughly two terawatt-hours of electricity transactions in 2025, a volume it says demonstrates growing demand for automated energy market infrastructure.

Tem’s approach is often described as bringing modern software-first tools to a sector still dominated by brokers, manual trading desks, and outdated systems. By replacing fragmented legacy workflows with a unified AI-driven engine, the company aims to make energy markets more efficient while giving businesses clearer price signals and lower transaction fees.

With the new funding, Tem plans to accelerate its global footprint, beginning with key energy markets such as Texas in the United States and select regions in Australia, where grid modernisation and renewable integration are creating fresh demand for flexible energy trading tools.
