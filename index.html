            <h2>Looking for friends, lobsters may stumble into an ecological trap</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/looking-for-friends-lobsters-may-stumble-into-an-ecological-trap/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lobsters are generally notable for their large claws, which can serve as a deterrent to any predators. But there’s a whole family of spiny lobsters that lack these claws. They tend to ward off predators by forming large groups that collectively can present a lot of pointy bits towards anything attempting to eat them. In fact, studies found that the lobsters can sense the presence of other species-members using molecules emitted into the water, and use that to find peers to congregate with.

A new study, however, finds that this same signal may lure young lobsters to their doom, causing them to try to congregate with older lobsters that are too big to be eaten by nearby predators. The smaller lobsters thus fall victim to a phenomenon called an “ecological trap,” which has rarely been seen to occur without human intervention.

The study was performed in the waters off Florida, where the seafloor is dotted by what are called “solution holes.” These features are the product of lower sea levels such as those that occur during periods of expanded glaciers and ice caps. During these times, much of the area off Florida was above sea level, and water dissolved the limestone rocks unevenly. This created an irregular array of small shallow pits and crevices, many of which have been reshaped by sea life since the area was submerged again.

The crevices offer a great gathering place for spiny lobsters, which can congregate in a way that ensures their spiky bits are all arranged to effectively block an attack from the limited directions of approach. Unfortunately, they are also home to groupers, large fish that are capable of gulping down the smaller lobsters. But groupers don’t have the jaws to break down the shells of larger ones, rendering more mature spiny lobsters immune from their predation.

The authors, Mark Butler, Donald Behringer, and Jason Schratwieser, hypothesized that these solution holes represent an ecological trap. The older lobsters that find shelter in a solution hole would emit the chemicals that draw younger ones to congregate with them. But the youngsters would then fall prey to any groupers that inhabit the same solution hole. In other words, what is normally a cue for safety—the signal that there are lots of lobsters present—could lure smaller lobsters into what the authors call a “predatory death trap.”

Testing the hypothesis involved a lot of underwater surveys. First, the authors identified solution holes with a resident red grouper. They then found a series of sites that had equivalent amounts of shelter, but lacked the solution hole and attendant grouper. (The study lacked a control with a solution hole but no grouper, for what it’s worth.) At each site, the researchers started daily surveys of the lobsters present, registering how large they were and tagging any that hadn’t been found in any earlier surveys. This let them track the lobster population over time, as some lobsters may migrate in and out of sites.

To check predation, they linked lobsters (both large and small) via tethers that let them occupy sheltered places on the sea floor, but not leave a given site. And, after the lobster population dynamics were sorted, the researchers caught some of the groupers and checked their stomach contents. In a few cases, this revealed the presence of lobsters that had been previously tagged, allowing them to directly associate predation with the size of the lobster.

So, what did they find? In sites where groupers were present, the average lobster was 32 percent larger than the control sites. That’s likely to be because over two-thirds of the small lobsters that were tethered to sites with a grouper were dead within 48 hours. At control sites, the mortality rate was about 40 percent. That’s similar to the mortality rates for larger lobsters at the same sites (44 percent) or at sites with groupers (48 percent).

Separately, the researchers tested whether lobsters can sense the presence of a red grouper by putting a lobster in a tank with water flowing in from pools, one with red groupers and one without. The lobsters appeared unable to tell the difference. That’s a bit of a surprise, given that earlier studies had shown that they are attracted to a healthy population of lobsters, but avoid populations that are injured or suffering disease. They’re also able to sense and avoid a different predator, the octopus.

The finding is relatively distinct. While there’s a long literature on ecological traps, most of them have developed due to changes humans have caused in the ecosystem, either accidentally or intentionally. A past review found that only about seven percent of the ecological traps described in the literature came about without human influence. That makes a degree of sense, given that human-driven ecological changes are likely to be relatively recent, and so haven’t given the animal being trapped the time to evolve a way of avoiding it.

For the handful of naturally occurring ecological traps that have been described, it’s possible that the benefits that get the animal caught in the trap are large enough to offset the risk of getting trapped. And that might be the case here, with the losses of juveniles being balanced by better survival of the adults, allowing greater production of juveniles to offset the losses. In either case, it would seem that evolving a way of detecting their presence could eliminate the trap, so it’s unclear why that hasn’t happened yet. It’s possible that the red groupers are relatively recent arrivals to this ecosystem, and so there hasn’t been time to evolve in response to them.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/the-top-5-most-horrifying-and-fascinating-medical-cases-of-2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There were a lot of horrifying things in the news this year—a lot. But some of it was horrifying in a good way.

Extraordinary medical cases—even the grisly and disturbing ones—offer a reprieve from the onslaught of current events and the stresses of our daily lives. With those remarkable reports, we can marvel at the workings, foibles, and resilience of the human body. They can remind us of the shared indignities from our existence in these mortal meatsacks. We can clear our minds of worry by learning about something we never even knew we should worry about—or by counting our blessings for avoiding so far. And sometimes, the reports are just grotesquely fascinating.

Every year, there’s a new lineup of such curious clinical conditions. There are always some unfortunate souls to mark medical firsts or present ultra-rare cases. There is also an endless stream of humans making poor life choices—and arriving at an emergency department with the results. This year was no different.

The top five medical cases of 2025 were chosen using a blend of editorial judgment and reader interest. There’s a mix of cases stemming from poor life choices and just plain bad luck. Florida man makes two appearances (we’ll let you guess which of the aforementioned categories he fits into). There’s a puzzling, oozing, explosive vomiting, a bioterror bacterial surprise, and, of course, parasitic worms. Best of all, nobody died—a happy ending we could all use as this year draws to a close.

Street food can be among a region’s best culinary offerings. No one can be blamed for partaking. But, it does come with some risks—namely, food poisoning. An unfortunate 59-year-old man fell ill after eating some street food in China. It wouldn’t be a remarkable story if it weren’t for the degree of trauma his ensuing illness created. The man vomited so fiercely that the force his body created to launch the offending substance up and as far away as possible—presumably to another dimension—blew apart his esophagus (the muscular tube that conveys food between the throat and stomach).

Such organ-shattering is called Boerhaave syndrome, which is rare. If it isn’t treated quickly, it has a 60 percent to 100 percent fatality rate. The man, luckily, received care within a few hours of the blast, though his chest was already filling with fluid and his right lung was collapsing. He was rushed to emergency surgery and eventually made a full recovery. However, it required 35 days in the hospital and an additional three months with a feeding tube before his esophagus completely healed. It remains unclear what street food sparked the detonation, but presumably, it is one he won’t eat again.

For days, a 30-year-old woman in New England experienced searing pain that crept up her body, starting with her legs, then moving up her trunk and to her arms. She went to two different emergency departments seeking relief. But doctors at each found no clear explanation for her pain and sent her home with only a recommendation to see her primary doctor. The condition continued to worsen. After waking up in a mental fog, she was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, where doctors discovered that she was infected with parasitic worms.

The pain and burning sensations the woman had experienced moving up her body was from worm larvae traveling along her peripheral nerves to get to her brain. The parasite behind the infection was the nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis, also known as rat lungworm. This delightful parasite typically circulates between rats—its primary host—and slugs and snails. Infected rats poop out larvae, which are picked up by slugs and snails. Late-stage larvae develop in the slugs and snails, then move back to rats, who get infected by eating the infected mollusks. Back in the rat, the larvae make their way to the rat’s brain, where they become adults. Then they relocate to the lungs (hence the name) to mate.

Humans accidentally get infected by eating raw vegetables containing or contaminated by infected slugs or snails, or by eating undercooked creatures that eat slugs or snails, such as land crabs, freshwater prawns, or frogs. In the woman’s case, doctors suspected she got infected from eating raw seafood and salads on a recent trip to Hawaii, where the parasite is a known threat. Luckily, the woman was treated for the infection and made a full recovery.

It’s not every day a person gets drunk and wakes up with a medical case so enigmatic that a master clinician with an expertise in medical reasoning is called in to help crack it. But a 36-year-old did just that in a case published this year in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The man showed up at the hospital with abdominal pain, a crackling in his lungs, bacteria in his blood, liver abnormalities, an injury in his small intestine, and a blood clot in his right kidney—and no clear idea of how any of those things happened or how they were connected.

In the case report, doctors lay out how they identified all of the aspects of his condition and then how master clinician Gurpreet Dhaliwal of the University of California, San Francisco, unraveled how they fit together.

Providing a fascinating look into diagnostic sleuthing, Dhaliwal reasoned out that it all came down to beers and a toothpick. The man—who had a history of binge drinking—got drunk, ate something, and accidentally swallowed a toothpick, Dhaliwal surmised. While still drunk, the man aspirated some of the food, causing his lung infection. The toothpick, meanwhile, pierced his small intestine near his right kidney, causing the injury and the blood clot. The injury then became infected, causing sepsis and his liver abnormalities.

After Dhaliwal came to his conclusion, medical imaging found the toothpick. After it was removed, the man made a full recovery.

I promised Florida man made the list—and of course, he’s near the top. In this case, a Florida man was gifted the bloody meat of a feral pig, which he handled with his bare hands before cooking and eating it. In doing so, he inadvertently exposed himself to a highly infectious bacterium considered a potential bioterror threat. The man developed an insidious infection that lurked in his heart implant and took doctors nearly two years to properly diagnose.

The bacterium at hand is Brucella suis, which typically infects pigs. The bacterium is not particularly deadly, but it can spread by air and only takes a few bacterial cells to cause an infection, making it a good potential weapon. In 1954, B. suis became the first biological agent to be weaponized by the US government as part of its offensive biological warfare program.

Once the man’s infection was finally diagnosed, he was treated with an effective antibiotic regimen to clear it. He also got a new heart implant and made a full recovery. Unfortunately, due to the high infectiousness of the germ, doctors had to reach out to all the man’s previous health care providers and clinical lab workers to warn them of the exposure. Three lab workers were found to have had a high-risk exposure and had to undergo months monitoring and post-exposure prophylaxis.

While that Florida man’s case was … unusual, it mostly stems to some bad luck—who among us hasn’t occasionally forgotten to check our gifted feral pig meat for bioterror threats? By contrast, this year’s top medical case goes to another Florida man, whose life choices are definitely in question.

In January, we shared the case of a Florida man who adopted a daily diet of six to nine pounds of cheese, sticks of butter, and hamburgers that had additional fat incorporated into them. He made the medical literature after eight months, when he showed up to cardiologists with cholesterol literally oozing out of his hands, feet, and elbows.

As the cholesterol was trying to escape his body, it created painless, yellowish nodules filled with lipids. The condition is called xanthoma and most often presents with nodules around the eye.

The cardiologists tested the man’s blood cholesterol levels and found that they exceeded 1,000 mg/dL. For context, the target level of total cholesterol for good cardiovascular health is under 200 mg/dL, while 240 mg/dL or over is considered high.

It’s unclear how things ended up for the man, but at least his doctors did not report that he died—at least not yet. Generally, xanthoma itself is benign; his cholesterol levels, on the other hand, put him at significant risk of cardiovascular disease. Still, he suggested to his doctors that he was pleased with his dairy-heavy diet, which he described as a “carnivore diet.” He claimed he lost weight, had more energy, and improved his “mental clarity.”

With that, we sign off on the medical line-up of 2025 and look forward to what medical horrors 2026 will hold—and what Florida man will do next.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2025 has been a tumultuous year for the car world. After years of EV optimism, revanchists are pushing back against things like clean energy and fuel economy. Automakers have responded, postponing or canceling new electric vehicles in favor of gasoline-burning ones. It hasn’t been all bad, though. Despite the changing winds, EV infrastructure continues to be built out and, anecdotally at least, feels far more reliable. We got to witness a pretty epic Formula 1 season right to the wire, in addition to some great sports car and Formula E racing. And we drove a whole bunch of cars, some of which stood out from the pack.

Here are the 10 best things we sat behind the wheel of in 2025.

Let’s be frank: The supposed resurgence of Lotus hasn’t exactly gone to plan. When Geely bought the British Automaker in 2017, many of us hoped that the Chinese company would do for Lotus what it did for Volvo, only in Hethel instead of Gothenburg. Even before tariffs and other protectionist measures undermined the wisdom of building new Lotuses in China, the fact that most of these new cars were big, heavy EVs had already made them a hard sell. But a more traditional Lotus exists and is still built in Norfolk, England: the Lotus Emira.

Its V6 engine is from Toyota, so it should be pretty bulletproof, and there are three pedals and a proper gearstick to change your own gears. Geely’s parts bin means modern infotainment and switchgear—always troublesome for low-volume, resource-challenged car companies—and the electrohydraulic steering bristles with feel. Sure, most people will play it safe and instead go for the Porsche 718 Cayman, but we’re glad the Emira exists.

I got to spend more time than usual with this Volvo station wagon, and the experience made me completely reevaluate my original thoughts on what I now know is a charming and laid-back car. It doesn’t have a huge top speed. It isn’t that fast to 60 mph. It doesn’t make a particularly exciting noise. But a ride designed to cope with unpaved Swedish forest roads pays dividends on poorly maintained American tarmac, and it’s surprisingly agile when it comes to changing direction.

Station wagons are a nearly extinct breed in North America now, particularly if you’re looking for something more normal than hugely powerful, very expensive wagons like the BMW M5 and Audi RS6. That this one is normal and pleasant to live with secures it a place in the top 10.

Take an everyday small hatchback, then add better suspension, a more powerful engine, some sticky tires, and a few styling tweaks. The recipe isn’t quite as old as time, but it is almost as old as I am; the first Volkswagen Golf GTI hit the street in 1976. Since then, it’s supplanted the Beetle as the iconic VW, as well as proving that a car can be sporty and have plenty of utility without jacking up the ride height. Now it’s midway through its eighth iteration—and freshly refreshed.

You can’t get a manual Golf GTI anymore; it turns out that only the US wanted one at this point in the 21st century, with take rates dropping to single figures in Europe. But you can get one without VW’s annoying capacitive multifunction steering wheel—the big improvement for this model year was a return to the old button-festooned tiller. It remains a hoot to drive, and you’re less likely to get pulled over in it than in the Golf R.

BMW’s styling department may have played things much safer with the i4 than the i3, but the engineers didn’t. To the uninitiated, it looks like any other 4 Series Gran Coupe—BMW-speak for a five-door fastback—but the filled-in kidney grilles give it away: This one is electric.

The xDrive40 is the regular all-wheel drive version, more efficient and less powerful than the M50. It’s not quite as efficient with its electrons as the rear-wheel drive i4, but you’re probably more likely to encounter one, given US predilections for all-wheel drive. The infotainment is one of the better systems on the market, the interior is a pleasant place to spend time, and the rear hatch makes it almost as practical as an SUV without any of the extra inches in height.

This car probably makes the top 10 list every year we drive one. Like the Golf GTI, 2025 saw the Ioniq 5 get its refresh. This included a different charge port—US-made Ioniq 5s now ship with a Tesla-style NACS plug, plus some adapters for using CCS and J1772 chargers. That means many of Tesla’s superchargers are fair game for recharging this Hyundai on the go, though if you stick with the adapter and seek out a 350 kW CCS1 machine, you’ll experience much faster charging. (For context, 35–80 percent in 15 minutes, last time I charged one.)

There’s now an off-roady version called the XRT—similar to the Cross Country treatment given to the Volvo V60 above—which has a certain charm. But its rugged looks—and especially tires—eat away at the range. The standard car remains one of the more efficient EVs you can buy, and one of the best EVs in general, too. And now it has USB-C ports—and, finally, a rear windshield wiper.

Mercedes has an all-new EV, and rather than a really expensive car for plutocrats, this one comes in at the entry level. It’s a compact four-door sedan—there’s a trunk at the rear, not a hatch—with a remarkably low drag coefficient, but most of the clever stuff is under the skin. The CLA is the first true software-defined vehicle from Mercedes, meaning its electronics are a clean-sheet design, controlled by four powerful computers rather than more than a hundred discrete black boxes.

There’s Mercedes’ latest OS running everything and a very modern electric powertrain based on the one in the EQXX concept car that gives the CLA 374 miles (602 km) of range from an 85 kWh battery pack. There’s also some new driver-assist stuff that you’ll have to wait until January to learn about. Best of all, both rear-drive and twin-motor CLAs are less than $50,000.

BMW also has an all-new EV with its latest and greatest powertrain technology, and it chose the best-selling compact crossover class to introduce it. Unlike Mercedes, which will make a hybrid version of the CLA, BMW’s Neue Klasse platform is purely electric, and the first vehicle is the iX3.

Instead of chrome, BMW’s traditional face is picked out with light. Rather than an instrument binnacle, there’s a very effective display that appears built into the base of the windshield. It can charge at up to 400 kW and should go at least 400 miles (643 km) on a full battery. Better yet, it’s engaging to drive, the way a BMW should be—even the SUVs. But fans of sedans, take note: The Neue Klasse i3, a true electric 3 Series, will be next. We can’t wait.

I had to go back to January 2025 for the first of the podium finishers, with the new Honda Civic Hybrid. The Civic is a good example of the way cars of the same name have gotten larger over the years: the 11th generation is three feet (920 mm) longer than the version sold in the early 1970s, and that’s counting the 1974 car’s huge low-speed impact bumpers.

I wouldn’t want to get in a crash in a 1974 Honda Civic, though. And somehow I doubt it would generate 200 hp (150 kW) while getting 50 mpg (4.7 L/100 km) while meeting modern emission standards. The interior still features plenty of physical controls, and like the Golf, it’s refreshing to drive something low to the ground and relatively lightweight.

I’ve been lucky enough to drive some rather good 911s this year. In January, I got behind the wheel of the new 992.2 GT3 on the road and on track. This fall, I tested a convertible 911 T. Both are excellent 911s, but my pick has to be the 911 GTS T-Hybrid.

Porsche built an all-new flat-six engine for the T-Hybrid, then applied the same turbocharger hybrid technology we’ve seen in F1 and Porsche’s own Le Mans winner to give this engine a sharper, more immediate throttle response than even the naturally aspirated GT3’s. It responds to throttle pedal inputs as quickly as an EV, but you still get all the things people want from a Porsche 911 with a flat six. There are gears (paddle-shift) to use, and the engine revs freely and sounds good doing so.

While it’s cheaper than the GT3, it’s darned expensive. That’s why it placed the runner-up.

Nissan might not be having Lotus-level bad times right now, but the Japanese OEM probably wishes life was smoother. A mooted merger with Honda was called off in February, and the company’s competent electric SUV, the Ariya, isn’t available for import anymore due to tariffs. However, it also brought out the third-generation Leaf this year, and we like what we found.

Smaller on the outside than the old car, it has more room inside thanks to a much more modern design approach. That old Leaf bugbear, the air-cooled battery, is a thing of the past. It looks good, and there’s even a version with steel wheels that gets more than 300 miles (487 km) on a single charge, although we reckon the SV+, a little higher up the trim tree, is the one to go for. At less than $35,000, it’s also one of the cheapest new EVs on sale.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/us-cant-deport-hate-speech-researcher-for-protected-speech-lawsuit-says/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imran Ahmed’s biggest thorn in his side used to be Elon Musk, who made the hate speech researcher one of his earliest legal foes during his Twitter takeover.

Now, it’s the Trump administration, which planned to deport Ahmed, a legal permanent resident, just before Christmas. It would then ban him from returning to the United States, where he lives with his wife and young child, both US citizens.

After suing US officials to block any attempted arrest or deportation, Ahmed was quickly granted a temporary restraining order on Christmas Day. Ahmed had successfully argued that he risked irreparable harm without the order, alleging that Trump officials continue “to abuse the immigration system to punish and punitively detain noncitizens for protected speech and silence viewpoints with which it disagrees” and confirming that his speech had been chilled.

US officials are attempting to sanction Ahmed seemingly due to his work as the founder of a British-American non-governmental organization, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH).

In a shocking announcement last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that five individuals—described as “radical activists” and leaders of “weaponized NGOs&quot;—would face US visa bans since “their entry, presence, or activities in the United States have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the US.

Nobody was named in that release, but Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy, Sarah Rogers, later identified the targets in an X post she currently has pinned to the top of her feed.

Alongside Ahmed, sanctioned individuals included former European commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton; the leader of UK-based Global Disinformation Index (GDI), Clare Melford; and co-leaders of Germany-based HateAid, Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon. A GDI spokesperson told The Guardian that the visa bans are “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.”

While all targets were scrutinized for supporting some of the European Union’s strictest tech regulations, including the Digital Services Act (DSA), Ahmed was further accused of serving as a “key collaborator with the Biden Administration’s effort to weaponize the government against US citizens.” As evidence of Ahmed’s supposed threat to US foreign policy, Rogers cited a CCDH report flagging Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. among the so-called “disinformation dozen” driving the most vaccine hoaxes on social media.

Neither official has really made it clear what exact threat these individuals pose if operating from within the US, as opposed to from anywhere else in the world. Echoing Rubio’s press release, Rogers wrote that the sanctions would reinforce a “red line,” supposedly ending “extraterritorial censorship of Americans” by targeting the “censorship-NGO ecosystem.”

For Ahmed’s group, specifically, she pointed to Musk’s failed lawsuit, which accused CCDH of illegally scraping Twitter—supposedly, it offered evidence of extraterritorial censorship. That lawsuit surfaced “leaked documents” allegedly showing that CCDH planned to “kill Twitter” by sharing research that could be used to justify big fines under the DSA or the UK’s Online Safety Act. Following that logic, seemingly any group monitoring misinformation or sharing research that lawmakers weigh when implementing new policies could be maligned as seeking mechanisms to censor platforms.

Notably, CCDH won its legal fight with Musk after a judge mocked X’s legal argument as “vapid” and dismissed the lawsuit as an obvious attempt to punish CCDH for exercising free speech that Musk didn’t like.

In his complaint last week, Ahmed alleged that US officials were similarly encroaching on his First Amendment rights by unconstitutionally wielding immigration law as “a tool to punish noncitizen speakers who express views disfavored by the current administration.”

Both Rubio and Rogers are named as defendants in the suit, as well as Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Acting Director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons. In a loss, officials would potentially not only be forced to vacate Rubio’s actions implementing visa bans, but also possibly stop furthering a larger alleged Trump administration pattern of “targeting noncitizens for removal based on First Amendment protected speech.”

For Ahmed, securing the temporary restraining order was urgent, as he was apparently the only target currently located in the US when Rubio’s announcement dropped. In a statement provided to Ars, Ahmed’s attorney, Roberta Kaplan, suggested that the order was granted “so quickly because it is so obvious that Marco Rubio and the other defendants’ actions were blatantly unconstitutional.”

Ahmed founded CCDH in 2019, hoping to “call attention to the enormous problem of digitally driven disinformation and hate online.” According to the suit, he became particularly concerned about antisemitism online while living in the United Kingdom in 2016, having watched “the far-right party, Britain First,” launching “the dangerous conspiracy theory that the EU was attempting to import Muslims and Black people to ‘destroy’ white citizens.” That year, a Member of Parliament and Ahmed’s colleague, Jo Cox, was “shot and stabbed in a brutal politically motivated murder, committed by a man who screamed ‘Britain First’” during the attack. That tragedy motivated Ahmed to start CCDH.

He moved to the US in 2021 and was granted a green card in 2024, starting his family and continuing to lead CCDH efforts monitoring not just Twitter/X, but also Meta platforms, TikTok, and, more recently, AI chatbots. In addition to supporting the DSA and UK’s Online Safety Act, his group has supported US online safety laws and Section 230 reforms intended to protect kids online.

“Mr. Ahmed studies and engages in civic discourse about the content moderation policies of major social media companies in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union,” his lawsuit said. “There is no conceivable foreign policy impact from his speech acts whatsoever.”

In his complaint, Ahmed alleged that Rubio has so far provided no evidence that Ahmed poses such a great threat that he must be removed. He argued that “applicable statutes expressly prohibit removal based on a noncitizen’s ‘past, current, or expected beliefs, statements, or associations.’”

According to DHS guidance from 2021 cited in the suit, “A noncitizen’ s exercise of their First Amendment rights … should never be a factor in deciding to take enforcement action.”

To prevent deportation based solely on viewpoints, Rubio was supposed to notify chairs of the House Foreign Affairs, Senate Foreign Relations, and House and Senate Judiciary Committees, to explain what “compelling US foreign policy interest” would be compromised if Ahmed or others targeted with visa bans were to enter the US. But there’s no evidence Rubio took those steps, Ahmed alleged.

“The government has no power to punish Mr. Ahmed for his research, protected speech, and advocacy, and Defendants cannot evade those constitutional limitations by simply claiming that Mr. Ahmed’s presence or activities have ‘potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States,’” a press release from his legal team said. “There is no credible argument for Mr. Ahmed’s immigration detention, away from his wife and young child.”

To some critics, it looks like the Trump administration is going after CCDH in order to take up the fight that Musk already lost. In his lawsuit against CCDH, Musk’s X echoed US Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) by suggesting that CCDH was a “foreign dark money group” that allowed “foreign interests” to attempt to “influence American democracy.” It seems likely that US officials will put forward similar arguments in their CCDH fight.

Rogers’ X post offers some clues that the State Department will be mining Musk’s failed litigation to support claims of what it calls a “global censorship-industrial complex.” What she detailed suggested that the Trump administration plans to argue that NGOs like CCDH support strict tech laws, then conduct research bent on using said laws to censor platforms. That logic seems to ignore the reality that NGOs cannot control what laws get passed or enforced, Breton suggested in his first TV interview after his visa ban was announced.

Breton, whom Rogers villainized as the “mastermind” behind the DSA, urged EU officials to do more now defend their tough tech regulations—which Le Monde noted passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and very little far-right resistance—and fight the visa bans, Bloomberg reported.

“They cannot force us to change laws that we voted for democratically just to please [US tech companies],” Breton said. “No, we must stand up.”

While EU officials seemingly drag their feet, Ahmed is hoping that a judge will declare that all the visa bans that Rubio announced are unconstitutional. The temporary restraining order indicates there will be a court hearing Monday at which Ahmed will learn precisely “what steps Defendants have taken to impose visa restrictions and initiate removal proceedings against” him and any others. Until then, Ahmed remains in the dark on why Rubio deemed him as having “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” if he stayed in the US.

Ahmed, who argued that X’s lawsuit sought to chill CCDH’s research and alleged that the US attack seeks to do the same, seems confident that he can beat the visa bans.

“America is a great nation built on laws, with checks and balances to ensure power can never attain the unfettered primacy that leads to tyranny,” Ahmed said. “The law, clear-eyed in understanding right and wrong, will stand in the way of those who seek to silence the truth and empower the bold who stand up to power. I believe in this system, and I am proud to call this country my home. I will not be bullied away from my life’s work of fighting to keep children safe from social media’s harm and stopping antisemitism online. Onward.”</div>

            <h2>Leonardo’s wood charring method predates Japanese practice</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/did-one-line-in-a-leonardo-codex-anticipate-yakisugi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Yakisugi is a Japanese architectural technique  for charring the surface of wood. It has become quite popular in bioarchitecture because the carbonized layer protects the wood from water, fire, insects, and fungi, thereby prolonging the lifespan of the wood. Yakisugi techniques were first codified in written form in the 17th and 18th centuries. But it seems Italian Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci wrote about the protective benefits of charring wood surfaces more than 100 years earlier, according to a paper published in Zenodo, an open repository for EU funded research.

As previously reported, Leonardo produced more than 13,000 pages in his notebooks (later gathered into codices), less than a third of which have survived. The notebooks contain all manner of inventions that foreshadow future technologies: flying machines, bicycles, cranes, missiles, machine guns, an “unsinkable” double-hulled ship, dredges for clearing harbors and canals, and floating footwear akin to snowshoes to enable a person to walk on water. Leonardo foresaw the possibility of constructing a telescope in his Codex Atlanticus (1490)—he wrote of “making glasses to see the moon enlarged” a century before the instrument’s invention.

In 2003, Alessandro Vezzosi, director of Italy’s Museo Ideale, came across some recipes for mysterious mixtures while flipping through Leonardo’s notes. Vezzosi experimented with the recipes, resulting in a mixture that would harden into a material eerily akin to Bakelite, a synthetic plastic widely used in the early 1900s. So Leonardo may well have invented the first manmade plastic.

The notebooks also contain Leonardo’s detailed notes on his extensive anatomical studies. Most notably, his drawings and descriptions of the human heart captured how heart valves can control blood flow 150 years before William Harvey worked out the basics of the human circulatory system. (In 2005, a British heart surgeon named Francis Wells pioneered a new procedure to repair damaged hearts based on Leonardo’s heart valve sketches and subsequently wrote the book The Heart of Leonardo.)

In 2023, Caltech researchers made another discovery: lurking in the margins of Leonardo’s Codex Arundel were several small sketches of triangles, their geometry seemingly determined by grains of sand poured out from a jar. The little triangles were his attempt to draw a link between gravity and acceleration—well before Isaac Newton came up with his laws of motion. By modern calculations, Leonardo’s model produced a value for the gravitational constant (G) to around 97 percent accuracy. And Leonardo did all this without a means of accurate timekeeping and without the benefit of calculus. The Caltech team was even able to re-create a modern version of the experiment.

Annalisa Di Maria, a Leonardo expert with the UNESCO Club of Florence, collaborated with molecular biologist and sculptor Andrea da Montefeltro and art historian Lucica Bianchi on this latest study, which concerns the Codex Madrid II. They had noticed one nearly imperceptible phrase in particular on folio 87r concerning wood preservation: “They will be better preserved if stripped of bark and burned on the surface than in any other way,” Leonardo wrote.

“This is not folklore,” the authors noted. “It is a technical intuition that precedes cultural codification.” Leonardo was interested in the structural properties of materials like wood, stone, and metal, as both an artist and an engineer, and would have noticed from firsthand experience that raw wood with its bark intact retained moisture and decayed more quickly. Furthermore, Leonardo’s observation coincides with what the authors describe as a “crucial moment for European material culture,” when “woodworking was receiving renewed attention in artistic workshops and civil engineering studies.”

Leonardo did not confine his woody observations to just that one line. The Codex includes discussions of how different species of wood conferred different useful properties: oak and chestnut for strength, ash and linden for flexibility, and alder and willow for underwater construction. Leonardo also noted that chestnut and beech were ideal as structural reinforcements, while maple and linden worked well for constructing musical instruments given their good acoustic properties. He even noted a natural method for seasoning logs: leaving them “above the roots” for better sap drainage.

The Codex Madrid II dates to 1503-1505, over a century before the earliest known written codifications of yakisugi, although it is probable that the method was used a bit before then. Per Di Maria et al., there is no evidence of any direct contact between Renaissance European culture and Japanese architectural practices, so this seems to be a case of “convergent invention.”

The benefits of this method of wood preservation have since been well documented by science, although the effectiveness is dependent on a variety of factors, including wood species and environmental conditions. The fire’s heat seals the pores of the wood so it absorbs less water—a natural means of waterproofing. The charred surface serves as natural insulation for fire resistance. And stripping the bark removes nutrients that attract insects and fungi, a natural form of biological protection.

Leonardo viewed wood as “not merely a construction material but a living organism—a system in balance with its environment,” Di Maria et al. concluded. “His interest is not limited to mechanical effectiveness but extends to the relationship between matter and environment, between natural processes and human intervention. This perspective positions the Florentine genius as a precursor to what we now call bioarchitectural practice: human intervention on materials must be calibrated to an understanding of their biological and physical properties.”

            <h2>Researchers make “neuromorphic” artificial skin for robots</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The nervous system does an astonishing job of tracking sensory information, and does so using signals that would drive many computer scientists insane: a noisy stream of activity spikes that may be transmitted to hundreds of additional neurons, where they are integrated with similar spike trains coming from still other neurons.

Now, researchers have used spiking circuitry to build an artificial robotic skin, adopting some of the principles of how signals from our sensory neurons are transmitted and integrated. While the system relies on a few decidedly not-neural features, it has the advantage that we have chips that can run neural networks using spiking signals, which would allow this system to integrate smoothly with some energy-efficient hardware to run AI-based control software.

The nervous system in our skin is remarkably complex. It has specialized sensors for different sensations: heat, cold, pressure, pain, and more. In most areas of the body, these feed into the spinal column, where some preliminary processing takes place, allowing reflex reactions to be triggered without even involving the brain. But signals do make their way along specialized neurons into the brain, allowing further processing and (potentially) conscious awareness.

The researchers behind the recent work, based in China, decided to implement something similar for an artificial skin that could be used to cover a robotic hand. They limited sensing to pressure, but implemented other things the nervous system does, including figuring out the location of input and injuries, and using multiple layers of processing.

All of this started out by making a flexible polymer skin with embedded pressure sensors that were linked up to the rest of the system via conductive polymers. The next layer of the system converted the inputs from the pressure sensors to a series of activity spikes—short pulses of electrical current.

There are four ways that these trains of spikes can convey information: the shape of an individual pulse, through their magnitude, through the length of the spike, and through the frequency of the spikes. Spike frequency is the most commonly used means of conveying information in biological systems, and the researchers use that to convey the pressure experienced by a sensor. The remaining forms of information are used to create something akin to a bar code that helps identify which sensor the reading came from.

In addition to registering the pressure, the researchers had each sensor send a “I’m still here” signal at regular time intervals. Failure to receive this would be an indication that something has gone wrong with a sensor.

The spiking signals allow the next layer of the system to identify any pressure being experienced by the skin, as well as where it originated. This layer can also do basic evaluation of the sensory input: “Pressure-initiated raw pulses from the pulse generator accumulated in the signal cache center until a predefined pain threshold is surpassed, activating a pain signal.” This can allow the equivalent of basic reflex reactions that don’t involve higher-level control systems. For example, the researchers set up a robotic arm covered with their artificial skin, and got it to move the arm whenever it experiences pressure that can cause damage.

The second layer also combines and filters signals from the skin before sending the information on to the arm’s controller, which is the equivalent of the brain in this situation. So, the same system caused a robotic face to change expressions based on how much pressure its arm was sensing.

A lot of the details of how the system operates were figured out empirically. For example, they applied the amount of pressure that registers as pain in human skin, and figured out how frequently their sensors generated spikes. This was then set as a threshold to emit a pain signal to the higher control system, and would trigger any reflex responses to excessive pressure. A lot of the more elaborate responses will ultimately depend on how these higher-level systems are programmed. For example, it’s easy for the system to generate a signal that indicates damage in a specific location in the skin; how the overall system responds to that damage isn’t specified by the skin itself.

But the team did make it easy to repair things if damage occurs. The skin is designed to be assembled from a collection of segments that can snap together using magnetic interlocks. These automatically link up any necessary wiring, and each segment of skin broadcasts a unique identity code. So, if the system identifies damage, it’s relatively easy for an operator to pop out the damaged segment and replace it with fresh hardware, and then update any data that links the new segment’s ID with its location.

The researchers call their development a neuromorphic robotic e-skin, or NRE-skin. “Neuromorphic” as a term is a bit vague, with some people using it to mean a technology that directly follows the principles used by the nervous system. That’s definitely not this skin. Instead, it uses “neuromorphic” far more loosely, with the operation of the nervous system acting as an inspiration for the system.

This is clearest in the case of the positional information. The nervous system actually maintains a map of the body, and links sensory inputs to locations on this map. Biology uses nothing at all like the encoding of positional information in the properties of the activity spikes that the NRE-skin uses. So, this system is more biology-inspired than it is a model of actual biology.

It also falls a bit short of biology in its current implementation, in that all it senses is pressure. Actual skin can process a variety of different sensory inputs, including things like temperatures, irritants, and more. These could all potentially be added to something like NRE-skin, but it would require a parallel processing system to keep the additional signals from getting intermingled with the ones from the pressure-sensitive hardware.

All that said, spiking neuromorphic processors can host neural networks and are far more energy-efficient when doing so. So, even with its limitations, this seems like an area of research worth exploring.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Beneath ChatGPT’s flattering persona lies a goldmine for advertisers: an AI chatbot that never gets tired of hawking clients’ wares.

New reporting by The Information has revealed some recent topics of conversation between OpenAI employees as they work to supply advertisers with a teeming new audience to manipulate.

The plans are far from final, though they give us a look at what soon may become the norm for ChatGPT. One conversation between OpenAI staffers, for example, involved giving sponsored chatbot results “preferential treatment” over non-sponsored results, anonymous employees told The Information.

This could look like a user asking how much ibuprofen to take for a headache receiving a promoted ad for Advil in the chatbot’s response. Meanwhile, actual results on correct dosage may be brushed to the side, or buried under a mountain of ad text (just think about how many sponsored search results you have to scroll past during a typical Google search these days.)

Given that ChatGPT has a self-reported audience of 900 million weekly users, it’s difficult to imagine the consequences of a setup like this. OpenAI isn’t numb to the negative feelings sponsored results are likely to stir up, either.

The Information reports that other internal conversations focused on the best ways to serve ads without putting off users entirely, who might feel less inclined to go on hours-long chat benders if they feel corporate advertisers are looking on like a third-wheel. One ad mockup shared with the publication showed ads only appearing after a second prompt with ChatGPT, to avoid bombarding users with sponsored content too early in their conversations.

News that OpenAI was experimenting with cramming commercials into ChatGPT came in early December, after a software sleuth uncovered a dozen lines of code in the chatbot’s beta app for Android referencing things like “feature ads” and “search ads carousel.”

“As ChatGPT becomes more capable and widely used, we’re looking at ways to continue offering more intelligence to everyone,” an OpenAI spokesperson told The Information. “As part of this, we’re exploring what ads in our product could look like. People have a trusted relationship with ChatGPT, and any approach would be designed to respect that trust.”

When exactly the ChatGPT adpocolypse come to pass remains to be seen, but with so much money riding on the effort, it’d be astonishing if it didn’t pan out.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A team of scientists are staring climate change in the eye, the New York Times reports, setting sail for the infamous “Doomsday Glacier” in Antarctica in an attempt to study it up close.

The enormous Thwaites Glacier, at roughly the size of Florida, harbors enough water to raise sea levels across the globe by over two feet should it melt completely. Research has suggested that it’s already undergoing rapid melting — but its future, which holds the fate of our planet in the balance, is uncertain.

On Saturday, a crew of nearly 40 researchers left on a ship from a port in New Zealand to get more answers. A number of intriguing experiments are slated, but everyone’s going in knowing that all won’t go according to plan.

“There will be a Plan A through F,” Chris Pierce, a glaciologist at Montana State University whose team hopes to use airborne radar to effectively x-ray Thwaites’ ice, told the NYT.

There’s no doubt that Thwaites is melting quickly. How quickly, and what its melting could cause, however, are the questions that loom large.

Scientists fear that the glacier’s melting could trigger a collapse of the broader West Antarctic ice sheet. Over a mile thick in some portions, if the sheet collapsed, it could raise sea levels by up to a staggering 15 feet, practically drowning the planet over the course of several centuries. This is a worst case scenario, but the possibility is too severe to ignore, with some evidence suggesting that a similar event may have taken place around 120,000 years ago.

Recent research has suggested that Thwaites is more vulnerable to warming than once thought. Perhaps the most alarming discovery was that the glacier’s vast underbelly, once thought to be sealed off from warming because it hugged the seafloor, was being exposed to warm seawater which sneaks in as rising tides lift the glacier off the seafloor, causing “vigorous melting.”

“Thwaites has really broken up in front of our eyes,” Doug Benn, a glaciologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, told the NYT.

One of the most intriguing experiments will rely on an unlikely source of help: seals. Rather than having robots collect data, the researchers will attach sensors to the blubbery mammals, collecting data on ocean temperature and salinity that’s transmitted to satellites.

The data the seals gather won’t be as random as you might think, Lars Boehme, an ecologist at the University of St. Andrews, told the NYT.  The seals “go where the food is,” Boehme said. “And very often, that’s a place where, in terms of the environment and oceanography, things are happening.”

            <h2>Doctors Say AI Use Is Almost Certainly Linked to Developing Psychosis</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/doctors-link-ai-psychosis">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There continue to be numerous reports of people suffering severe mental health spirals after talking extensively with an AI chatbot. Some experts have dubbed the phenomenon “AI psychosis,” given the symptoms of psychosis these delusional episodes display — but the degree to which the AI tools are at fault, and whether the phenomenon warrants a clinical diagnosis, remains a significant topic of debate.

Now, according to new reporting from The Wall Street Journal, we may be nearing a consensus. More and more doctors are agreeing that AI chatbots are linked to cases of psychosis, including top psychiatrists who reviewed the files of dozens of patients who engaged in prolonged, delusional conversations with models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Keith Sakata, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has treated twelve patients who were hospitalized because of AI-induced psychosis, is one of them.

“The technology might not introduce the delusion, but the person tells the computer it’s their reality and the computer accepts it as truth and reflects it back, so it’s complicit in cycling that delusion,” Sakata told the WSJ.

The grim trend looms large over the AI industry, raising fundamental questions about the tech’s safety. Some cases of apparent AI psychosis have ended in murder and suicide, spawning a slew of wrongful death suits. Equally alarming is its scale: ChatGPT alone has been linked to at least eight deaths, with the company recently estimating that around half a million users are having conversations showing signs of AI psychosis every week.

One factor of AI chatbots that the phenomenon has brought under scrutiny is their sycophancy, which is perhaps a consequence of their being designed to be as engaging and humanlike as possible. What this looks like in practice is that the bots tend to flatter the users and tell them what they want to hear, even if what the user is saying has no basis in reality.

It’s a recipe primed for reinforcing delusions, to a degree unprecedented by any technology before it, doctors say. One recent peer-reviewed case study focused on a 26-year-old woman who was hospitalized twice after she believed ChatGPT was allowing her to talk with her dead brother, with the bot repeatedly assuring her she wasn’t “crazy.”

“They simulate human relationships,” Adrian Preda, a psychiatry professor at the University of California, Irvine, told the WSJ.  “Nothing in human history has done that before.”

Preda compared AI psychosis to monomania, in which someone obsessively fixates on a single idea or goal. Some people who have spoken about their mental health spirals say they were hyper-focused on an AI-driven narrative, the WSJ noted. These fixations can often be scientific or religious in nature, such as a man who came to believe he could bend time because of a breakthrough in physics.

Still, the reporting notes that psychiatrists are wary about declaring that chatbots are outright causing psychosis. They maintain, however, that they’re close to establishing the connection. One link that the doctors who spoke with the WSJ expect to see is that long interactions with a chatbot can be a psychosis risk factor.

“You have to look more carefully and say, well, ‘Why did this person just happen to coincidentally enter a psychotic state in the setting of chatbot use?&#39;” Joe Pierre, a UCSF psychiatrist, told the newspaper.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk once promised that pivoting Tesla into the self-driving taxi business would generate the automaker trillions of dollars in revenue. Certainly the enthusiasm these kinds of grand proclamations have inspired in investors has kept the company’s stock buoyant, with an astonishing market cap nearing $1.5 trillion. But does the reality on the ground back it up? Not really, suggests new reporting from The New York Times.

For one, Tesla faces steep competition from companies like Waymo that have already been in business for over a decade, and have thousands of robotaxis giving rides across major US cities. It was recently revealed, meanwhile, that Musk’s company only has about 30 capital-R Robotaxis roaming Austin, Texas — the only city where it’s currently offering rides to the public.

Worse yet, the cabs’ presence is barely felt by locals.

“I’ve never seen a Robotaxi in Austin,” Kara Kockelman, a professor of engineering at the University of Texas at Austin who studies transportation, told the NYT. “Waymos are around all the time.”

Perhaps that puny market penetration would be less alarming if Tesla offered advanced tech and a passenger experience that Waymo doesn’t, but its self-driving cabs aren’t even fully driverless, requiring the supervision of a human “safety monitor” who must be present in the vehicle at all times. Numerous instances of the cabs violating traffic laws and an alarming crash rate demonstrate why that policy is still necessary.

It’s reasonable that a newcomer to the field would take time to find its feet, but Musk has promised monumental progress at a whirlwind pace. He said that over a thousand Robotaxis would be operating in Austin “within a few months” of launching, that over a million fully autonomous Teslas would be on the road by 2026, and that the automaker’s Robotaxi operations would cover “half the population of the US” by the end of next year.

Investors take these promises seriously. Musk’s eye-watering trillion-dollar pay package, which they recently approved, requires Musk to oversee the commercial deployment of one million Robotaxis, the NYT noted.

Experts, to say the least, aren’t convinced. One criticism is Musk’s refusal to use radar and lidar sensors to help the cars understand their surroundings. After experimenting with the sensors, Musk swore them off as an expensive “crutch,” and doubled-down on only using cameras to see. Numerous accidents, including one in which a Tesla running the company’s Full Self-Driving ran over and killed an elderly pedestrian while its front camera was blinded by sunlight, have underscored the risks of Musk’s approach.

“I’m still deeply skeptical that Tesla is all that close in terms of building a real automated driving system,” Matthew Wansley, a professor at Cardozo School of Law in New York who has worked for an autonomous driving start-up, told the NYT.

Technology can sometimes advance at a rapid pace, and fortunes can quickly shift in a nascent industry. But right now, Tesla is “way behind Waymo,” Raj Rajkumar, a Carnegie Mellon University professor and pioneer of autonomous technology, told the newspaper.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This holiday season, German automaker Porsche is winning hearts and minds by putting out a Christmas-themed ad that seemingly isn’t made with AI. What a concept, right?

Called “Porsche Holiday,” the 30-second animated commercial shows a driver elegantly tooling around in his new ride, driving through autumnal scenery on a mountainside road and then a cool sea of glass and concrete as the Sun sets on a city. It’s done up in striking 2D-looking animation with precise lines, pleasing geometry, and eye-popping colors — an ad seemingly done right for a change.

Sharing behind the scenes footage, Porsche revealed in a social media post that the ad was a mix of hand-drawn sketches and CGI. It was made by Parallel Studio, an animation team based in Paris.

Though Porsche made no specific mention of AI, people reading between the lines quickly took that to mean that the automaker was quietly bragging about not using the tech, and hailed it as a victory. This perception of it being AI-free drove it to being remarkably viral, and made it an unexpected hit.

“Can’t wait for more of this anti-AI rebound,” one user wrote.

“Amtrak has been hiring artists to create original animations as well,” observed Nathan Allebach, a creative director. “As slop races us to the bottom, real art signals craft, prestige, and trust.”

The response goes to show how divisive AI is, especially in the arts. And ads, the most commercial art form of all, have both been a useful gauge of how companies have been willing to experiment with the tech and of the public reaction to it, which has been largely pretty negative.

Coca-Cola, for example, unleashed a ghoulishly uncanny iteration of its “Holidays Are Coming” last month that sparked outrage over how overtly ugly it was. McDonalds, too, released an AI-generated ad that proved such a disaster that it sheepishly pulled it entirely.

Everyone knows that our modern idea of the holiday season has been heavily shaped by ad agencies, but no one likes to be reminded of how soulless it can be by seeing AI amalgamations forced onto their eyeballs. At least pretend to care about humans, for Pete’s sake.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some people are hitting a weight loss plateau with GLP-1 agonist drugs like Ozempic, so they’re turning to a stronger variety that promises even more dramatic weight loss — up to more than 70 pounds in some instances, The Atlantic reports.

There’s a small wrinkle: the US Food and Drug Administration has yet to officially approve this medication — technically called retatrutide but cheekily nicknamed a “GLP-3” by users — because it’s still in clinical trials. So the market for it is black, or at least severely grey, with shady overseas companies exploiting a legal loophole to get around regulatory barriers.

In other words, everyone taking retatrutide is basically taking part in an unregulated experiment that could have disastrous results. Sure, you can effortlessly melt off the pounds with the synthetic peptide, but some users have reported disturbing side effects — such as dysesthesia, when your body processes normal sensations but you perceive them as painful, similar to the nerve pain diabetics feel in their feet.

In the grand scheme of things, “GLP-3” users are part of a burgeoning group of people who have turned to foreign-made drugs, many other peptides that are also lacking federal approval. These substances, often manufactured in China, have become wildly popular in recent years for their purported anti-aging and longevity boosting potential, among other miraculous claims.

Companies that sell these drugs are able to skirt federal regulations by writing all over their website that the compounds are not for human consumption and are instead meant for research lab purposes — advice that users are pretty clearly not following.

“All of this stuff just scares the crap out of me,” Randy Seeley, a University of Michigan medical professor and GLP-1 agonist expert, told The Atlantic in reference to the unknown side effects of gray market drugs.

One danger with these drugs, Seeley said, is that their formulations aren’t known and they have the potential to be contaminated with bacteria and other substances. (To allay those concerns, some companies post lab results attesting to the purity of their products.)

Of course, everybody thinks their dealer is an exception.

“There’s a lot of people who just get these things and shoot them,” Marco, a retatrutide user who has bought the drug from what he considers trusted sources, told The Atlantic. “I don’t judge them in any way, but I think those people are out of their minds.”

Injecting GLP-1 agonist drugs into the human body boosts the levels of hormones GLP-1 and GIP, which trigger the release of insulin into your bloodstream. Retatrutide does that and more: it mimics another hormone, glucagon, found in the pancreas. This addition further revs up people’s metabolism, making them lose more weight compared to Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs.

Once clinical trials are done, FDA is expected to approve retatrutide, which will no doubt be a bestseller and make its manufacturer, Eli Lilly, even wealthier.

But even if it’s given the green light, it’s not a guarantee that the demand in the gray market will dissipate, especially if normies find the price too weighty to bear.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/76-european-deep-tech-university-spinouts-reached-unicorn-or-centaur-status/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Universities and research labs have long been Europe’s deep tech treasure trove. Now, academic spinouts have consolidated into a solid startup funnel worth $398 billion — and VC money is following.

According to Dealroom’s European Spinout Report 2025, 76 of these deep tech and life sciences companies have either reached $1 billion valuations, $100 million in revenue, or both. These include unicorns like Iceye, IQM, Isar Aerospace, Synthesia, and Tekever, which are now inspiring more funds to back university spinouts.

Just this month, two new funds emerged that will bring more funding to talent emerging out of European tech universities, while adding breadth to a pipeline currently topped by Cambridge, Oxford, and ETH Zurich.

PSV Hafnium, out of Denmark, recently closed its inaugural fund at an oversubscribed €60 million (approximately $71 million), with a focus on Nordic deep tech. With offices in Berlin and London, but also in Aachen, U2V (University2Ventures) is targeting the same amount for its first fund, of which it recently completed the first closing.

These two newcomers join the growing ranks of European venture firms that have university spinouts as a core part of their investment thesis. Pioneered by the likes of Cambridge Innovation Capital and Oxford Science Enterprises, which have now fully matured, this category has also diversified.

While it still mostly consists of funds backed by one or several universities and institutes, it now includes independent firms that simply see spinouts as potential fund returners — and rightly so. Oxford Ionics, acquired by U.S.-based IonQ, was one of the six spinouts out of Switzerland, the U.K., and Germany that delivered exits of more than $1 billion to their investors in 2025.

These exits come alongside increased amounts of funding. According to Dealroom, European university spinouts in deep tech and life sciences are on track to raise a near all-time-high $9.1 billion in 2025. This contrasts with overall VC funding in Europe, which is down nearly 50% from its 2021 peak.

Large rounds closed in 2025 also reflect appetite for spinouts in sectors as varied as nuclear energy — Proxima Fusion — and dual-use drones — Quantum Systems, now valued above $3 billion. In many cases, these startups leverage research from specialized labs, which also explains why there is a long tail of European locations capable of producing spinouts.

Building relationships with hubs outside of Oxbridge and leading countries can also be a way for newcomers to differentiate themselves and find deals. “The Nordic’s research institutions hold extraordinary, untapped potential,” PSV Hafnium’s partners stated in a press release.

PSV Hafnium itself is a spinout from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), but is also making early-stage investments in other Nordic countries. One of its nine checks to date went to SisuSemi, a Finnish startup leveraging a decade of research at the University of Turku to bring new surface cleaning tech to the semiconductor industry.

It is good news for teams like SisuSemi that there is more funding available to them. It also comes in addition to grants, commercialization support, and improved deal terms that contribute to an encouraging environment for Europe’s spinouts. However, one pain point remains: growth capital.

As the report’s authors note, this gap “is not a unique trend to spinouts, but something impacting the entire startup ecosystem in Europe.” Still, it is quite striking that nearly 50% of late-stage funding for European deep tech and life sciences spinouts comes from outside Europe, mainly from the U.S.

While this share has decreased over the years, Europe won’t be fully reaping the benefits of its investments in talent and research unless this changes more substantially — but that’s a broader issue to be solved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This was supposed to be the year that climate tech died.

President Donald Trump and the Republican Party have done their best to dismantle the Biden administration’s hallmark industrial and climate policies. Even the European Union has begun to ease off its most aggressive goals.

And yet, as the year closes, the receipts provide a different view of climate and clean energy investing in the U.S. and Europe. Instead of tanking, venture bets in the sector remained essentially flat relative to 2024, according to CTVC, far from the slide some had expected.

That resiliency is due in part to continued threat of climate change. Perhaps a bigger contributing factor is that many climate technologies have become either cheaper or better than the fossil fuel alternatives — or are on the cusp of being so.

The incredible cost reductions of solar, wind, and batteries continue to fill climate tech’s sails. Not every new technology will follow the same path. But it does provide evidence that fossil fuels aren’t invincible and ample opportunities to fund companies providing cleaner, cheaper replacements do exist.

Last year, I predicted that 2025 would be the year that climate tech learned to love AI and its thirst for electricity, one that has largely borne out. It’s not entirely surprising — for the climate tech world, cheap, clean energy is its cornerstone.

Interest in data centers has only increased in the last year. And investors TechCrunch surveyed were nearly unanimous in their agreement that data centers will remain at the center of the conversation in 2026.

“They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don’t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026,” Tom Chi, founding partner at At One Ventures, told TechCrunch.

“I’m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates,” Po Bronson, managing director at SOSV’s IndieBio, told TechCrunch.

In 2025, data centers were obsessed with securing new sources of power. But Lisa Coca, partner at Toyota Ventures, thinks they’ll adjust their focus for 2026. “The 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid,” she said. Decoupling could solve some challenges that data centers face, namely in resistance from grid operators and the public, who are increasingly worried that the new loads are driving up their electricity prices.

There will still be the need for more power, though, and investors saw geothermal, nuclear, solar, and batteries as having benefited from the boom. “Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected,” said Daniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures.

Investors also acknowledged the AI bubble might burst; some voiced skepticism about whether it would drag the energy sector down with it.

“Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure,” said Kyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health. But it’s not likely to affect infrastructure plans, he added. “The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station.”

Andrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures, thinks the data center bubble might burst in 2026 or early 2027, but that no such bubble exists in electricity generation. “We still need a LOT more power, and we’ll use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.”

Outside of AI and data centers, Anil Achyuta, partner at Energy Impact Partners, said reindustrialization will take more of the spotlight this year. “We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets,” he said, citing robotics, batteries, and power electronics as examples.

Thanks to the drumbeat of new data center announcements, energy-related startups have gotten a boost this past year, perhaps none more than those working on nuclear fission. In the last few weeks, nuclear startups have announced rounds totaling over $1 billion, leading to speculation that many will SPAC or go public through a traditional IPO in 2026.

“Nuclear everything is in vogue right now,” Teamey said.

But it will take a while for nuclear power to make a dent in electricity demand. In the meantime, tech companies and data center developers have been turning to solar and batteries as inexpensive, rapidly deployable power sources. Grid-scale batteries, in particular, have been a major beneficiary, seeing record-setting deployments in 2025. As alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion and zinc come to market, they stand to lower costs and drive further adoption.

“We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on [battery] chemistry and business models.” said Leo Banchik, director at Voyager. “One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.”

Several investors felt geothermal would step in to help fill the void in the coming years. It helps that investors see enhanced geothermal as a relatively mature technology that’s ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026.

“Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heals in terms of new generation,” said Joshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures. “Natural gas assets are growing pretty linearly. There’s not much new capacity in turbine manufacturing coming online, and they’re selling everything they can. Geothermal will go geometric.”

And while AI is helping to drive demand, companies and technologies that think beyond the data center will benefit the most, said Laurie Menoud, founding partner at At One Ventures. “Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.”

Not everyone was in agreement or would proffer a guess. But among those who did, several said nuclear or geothermal startups were most likely to go public, either via IPO or SPAC.

The name mentioned most was Fervo, the enhanced geothermal startup that recently raised a $462 million round. The company is widely seen as a leader in the sector and is in the midst of building a 500-megawatt development in Utah that should serve as a template for future power plants. Tapping the public markets would give the company more reserves to tackle additional projects.

Beyond data centers, investors are interested in a range of technologies and sectors, including critical minerals, robotics, and software to manage the electrical grid.

“We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category,” said Amy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures. “The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.”

Resiliency and adaptation will be big themes in 2026, according to Coca of Toyota Ventures and Posamentier of Congruent Ventures. Achyuta at EIP zeroed in on one potential application: robots that bury electrical transmission lines quicker and more cheaply than humans, mitigating wildfire risks and increasing the grid’s reliability.

Beebe, at Obvious Ventures, said that EV trucking would also be an area to watch. “One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.”

AI, of course, is likely to play a role in climate tech’s transformation. “We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers,” said Matt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill. “Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems.”

But it might also pay to keep an eye on technologies that have already been written off, said Bronson at SOSV. “When investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out, that’s when the real breakthroughs finally happen,” he said.

Below are the detailed comments from the investors who replied to TechCrunch’s survey, listed in alphabetical order. Click the link to jump to a specific response.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Reindustrialization beyond data centers will be a major theme. We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets. For example, supporting next-generation robotics to address labor shortages and national security concerns will require integrated supply chains. Batteries, power electronics, fuel cells, gas turbines, and even home building are examples of end markets/technologies where parts of the value chain will need to be reindustrialized.

Another area to watch is AI-driven physical science. While companies like Zanskar (predictive AI for geothermal) and Fabric8Labs (generative cooling for data centers) have shown promise, we haven’t seen many visible breakthroughs yet. That said, the talent pool working on these problems is impressive and could lead to exciting developments.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Gas turbines provide firm capacity and remain the option for many large players deploying data centers. Beyond that, batteries — particularly sodium-ion — represent one of the most economical and near-term solutions at the grid-scale. I am bullish about the progress in this technology, and pairing solar with batteries (as companies like Peak Energy are doing) continues to be a highly attractive approach. Next-gen geothermal is also showing a good amount of promise but the timelines are like that of nuclear, potent but will take about a decade to bring full capacity online.

In addition, algorithmic solutions to unlock new power using existing infrastructure (e.g., Gridcare, ThinkLabs AI) and optimize workloads (e.g., Emerald AI) can further enhance grid efficiency. There are also other innovations worth noting in bringing more power, such as applying optical coating to transmission lines to reduce losses being advanced by AssetCool (an EIP portfolio company).

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Fervo Energy, Commonwealth Fusion, Redwood Materials would be my personal guesses, but I could be wrong.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Sodium-ion batteries for grid-scale storage are already being deployed and will accelerate significantly in 2026. Another technology to watch is solid-state transformers (note Heron Power is an EIP portfolio company). The industry is advancing faster than expected and scale similarly to semiconductors, though at-scale production might take longer.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

One emerging trend is the underground build-out of transmission lines. Advances in robotics could enable a rapid, cost-effective approach that significantly reduces wildfire risk and, in turn, mitigates the substantial carbon emissions associated with such events.

Distributed power, heat, and computation are the last class of trends we are curiously tracking for 2026.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will keep driving record power demand as AI workloads scale. Despite talk of overbuild, we’re unlikely to see much stranded capacity — as compute gets cheaper and more available, we’ll keep finding new uses for it. The interesting shift is hyperscalers differentiating between clean power sources — firm vs. intermittent, location, and additionality — rather than just headline megawatt-hours. This is already playing out in bespoke offtake deals and on-site supply strategies.

Fission and geothermal should see continued momentum from both private capital and federal support. Fusion will likely attract increased federal support as geopolitical competition intensifies, though we’re still many years away from high-capacity-factor grid-scale deployment.

Natural gas peaker alternatives will gain traction too — using new turbines and modular designs with integrated carbon capture as grids manage new peak demands from AI.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Solar and battery build-out will continue given their strong economics. For dispatchable, 24/7 baseload power, we’ll see growth in fission, geothermal, and peaker alternatives like modular gas turbines with integrated carbon capture. There’s also a grid-edge opportunity worth watching: large facilities procuring dedicated baseload on-site rather than adding to grid congestion.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Most likely fission or geothermal. These companies have raised substantial capital and built strong offtake agreements with hyperscalers and utilities. With multibillion-dollar project pipelines and the need for continued growth financing, several could pursue public markets in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Energy storage deployment is accelerating across residential, commercial, industrial (including data center backup), and grid-scale applications. Domestic supply chains, including second-life battery systems, are gaining traction for stationary storage. We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on chemistry and business models. One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.

Industrial heat pumps and thermal storage systems for steam and process heat are becoming cheaper to operate than gas boilers in many regions and applications, especially where waste heat is available and electricity prices are favorable.

We’ll also see more growth in critical minerals and battery materials projects — lithium, rare earth, magnesium refining; battery component and cell manufacturing; copper recycling — maturing with federal support as supply chain security becomes a strategic priority.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Software and AI enabling physical infrastructure: real-time factory intelligence that improves energy efficiency and manufacturing yields, AI-based design tools that speed up product development cycles, grid management software that orchestrates intermittent renewables with storage and dispatchable power.

Companies taking a clean-sheet approach to reimagining foundational technologies — a SpaceX-style rethink of components once considered solved problems. Motor designs that eliminate rare earth dependencies, grid infrastructure like transformers with modern manufacturing techniques, advanced materials processing that significantly reduces costs while improving quality. Improvements in robotics help to enable these cost curves, making U.S. manufacturing economically viable where it wasn’t before.

Lastly, dual-use climate technologies with superior unit economics that happen to strengthen domestic supply chains. Defense and industrial policy are backing these not for climate reasons, but because they deliver cost advantages and supply security.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will again dominate. But there will be a lot more talk of a build-out bubble (in data centers, not electricity generation). We will live with the dual reality of too much money/debt spent on data centers, and the speculation bubble will likely burst (maybe early 2027). But at the same time, we’ll still need a LOT more power, and will use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

For power generation: geothermal in the near-term. Fission in the mid-term. Fusion in the 10-year-plus long-term. For actual siting: The above technologies can be sited anywhere, but mainly western states for geothermal. For batteries — PJM [the grid that covers the mid-Atlantic west to parts of Illinois] and Texas.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Grid software and EV trucking. One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

I’m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates. To some extent this is from “picks and shovels” companies who don’t want to get commoditized so they’re strategizing how to be a bigger player/more integrated rather than just a component that’s purchased.

A related phrase I hear more frequently is power density and/or specific power (power to weight), as a load of corporates are anticipating or planning how their energy divisions branch into robotics. Duncan Turner here is our expert.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

I don’t have a climate tech company in my portfolio going public in 2026. Tidal Vision is targeting 2027. That’s my closest. I don’t want to opine on other VC’s portfolio companies, even though I have my feelings, because I shouldn’t open my mouth where I’m only partially informed.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

For larger scales in 2026, my fastest scaling companies are Tidal Vision and Voyage Foods, which has taken over a General Motors plant in Ohio.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

On what to pay more attention to, I’ll toot Duncan’s horn here again — what he’s doing with the Plasma Forge is IMHO going to be super compelling and make everyone study at night.

One last note is my consistent feeling that it’s when investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out that the real breakthroughs finally happen. I learned this lesson back in 1999 when we were all wondering if the search space was going to be won by Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, Lycos, or Infoseek.

I do feel like that’s happening in my personal portfolio. I said this to AgFunder recently, but when the VC world asks about winning sectors, there’s a presumption that the sector will be so hot that there will be multiple winners. Most markets don’t have multiple winners, and the sector doesn’t win; just one company wins.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

There will be a lot more around data centers in 2026. They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don’t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Budgets for hyperscalers are in the $50 billion to $100 billion range, which encompasses power, chips, and much more. The chips are expensive enough that folks are willing to pay a bit more to get power on the grid sooner as the losses from chip depreciation are greater than most things you could incrementally add to your power scale-up budget.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

IPO market still a bit murky, and most folks don’t telegraph exactly when they will go public.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Folks like Fervo are at an interesting inflection point. One of our portcos Provectus Algae also at an interesting point.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We’ve had a pretty big pendulum swing away from the more capital intensive work in industrial decarbonization that aren’t in AI. They are still critical for our collective future, even if out of fashion for a few years.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

In our view at Toyota Ventures, the 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

We believe that the biggest investment opportunities are in firm, dispatchable, and scalable carbon-free energy. We have actively invested in technologies that support increasing baseload power, both geothermal and nuclear, through portfolio companies such as Rodatherm and Natura Resources. For critical grid flexibility, we are backing advanced, long-duration energy storage battery technologies with an investment in e-Zinc.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

We anticipate that nuclear power will continue to lead the way in terms of IPOs and SPACs in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Challenging question since we believe it is more a function of how, and if, the capital stack continues to evolve. There is a healthy number of climate tech companies across multiple sectors that are on the cusp of deploying at a larger scale. The biggest hurdle is securing FOAK financing to de-risk the all-important step of advancing from first of a kind to nth of a kind.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Our team expects resiliency and adaptation will continue to reign strong in 2026. The Toyota Ventures portfolio illustrates this: BurnBot addresses wildfire mitigation, ZymoChem bolsters supply chain resilience with sustainable materials, and Alora creates adaptable resource solutions.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

My prediction is that the energy conversation shifts from generation of power to how fast power can actually be delivered. Interconnection timelines, permitting, and physical grid constraints continue to be a bottleneck and data centers will increasingly rely on hybrid strategies that blend grid power, storage, and demand flexibility to hit timelines.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

One opportunity is at grid-ready sites, like places with existing transmission and substation. Anything that shortens interconnection timelines creates outsized value right now because access to the grid is scarce. Also interested in wireless transmission of power even though it’s in the early stages.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

There has been a lot of talk about Fervo Energy…!

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Long duration energy storage technology companies which will move from initial pilots to demos to repeatable deployments. We’re particularly excited about our portfolio company Noon Energy.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category. The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

We expect to see an acceleration of deal making in the data center/hyperscaler space consisting of the following:

While we don’t expect an overall “bust cycle” for data center and hyperscaler development activities, we do expect some rationalization of development and implementation of efficiency options to reduce capacity needs.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

The greatest near-term opportunity — and challenge — lies in improving the grid itself. Grid modernization through digitalization, decarbonization, and decentralization will unlock cost savings, optimize existing infrastructure, and better integrate significant distributed energy resources — probably not saying anything new here. Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected.

We expect this trend to continue despite recent policy shifts in the IRA and there are hundreds of venture capital-backed companies that can have a material impact on the grid as they scale-up and see more adoption rates in the market. Disruption is here!

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Factorial appears to be a leading candidate following its plans to de-SPAC in 2026. Its trajectory illustrates that companies with strong customer traction in large markets, clear cost and performance advantages, and rapidly scaling revenues are well-positioned for the public markets. (This SPAC market contrasts with the 2020 one where entrants such as QuantumScape did not have meaningful revenues and perhaps were ill-prepared for public markets).

Watch out for more companies hitting public markets on hype, instead of good fundamentals.

Beyond Factorial, several companies in energy storage, generation, and critical minerals are approaching scalable revenue levels to access low-cost of capital public markets (a real benefit), though in the minerals sector we may see growth in mergers and acquisitions precede any public offerings in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Projects in energy storage, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), critical minerals, and material manufacturing facilities across the energy supply chain will see significant investment in the U.S., with manufacturing tax credits and attractive market opportunities still available notwithstanding federal policy headwinds.

In 2025, we extensively evaluated and developed new risk transfer solutions for FOAK project developers. We see commercial lenders and private credit starting to lean more heavily into this space with the support of insurance underwriting and catalytic capital. We expect to see more projects and more debt financing  for early commercialization, which up until this point has only trickled in. This is the key enabler of the greater scale we need across the industry.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

For western markets to compete with China’s manufacturing and increasingly innovation prowess, financial innovation is CRITICAL. Global markets need to deploy $3 trillion to $9 trillion per year through 2050 on climate related technologies and implementation of projects if we hope to reduce global temperatures and compete in these markets internationally. Global spending on climate related investment was only $2 trillion in 2024 and is on a path for a similar amount in 2025.

To increase the rate of deployment, we must convince public and private investors that the risk-return balance is favorable to deploy capital across the climate capital stack — early stage venture, growth stage venture, private equity, commercial lending and private credit, and infrastructure. Our sector is not attracting enough capital; in simple terms, risks need to decline or returns need to increase.

We see opportunities to use risk sharing mechanisms to optimize capital stacks and lower the cost of capital for new technology projects, which also brings them down the cost curve faster. Promising solutions include technology and performance risk insurance, surety bonds for managing construction risks, pooling off-take agreements among buyer groups (e.g. hyperscalers for clean power or airlines for SAF), filling gaps in construction financing, and more. Clean Energy Ventures’ spent time during 2025 identifying new risk transfer solutions working closely with our counterparts in the finance and insurance sectors. We believe 2026 will see more innovative financing solutions enabling faster scaling of climate technologies.

We should also be paying very close attention to cost curves. The impact of AI is showing up but not being widely reported in climate tech. Inside large companies and small start-ups the benefits of AI are driving costs down, allowing faster innovation at complex facilities and in supply chains. This is apparent in chemicals, mining and refining, power generation and grid optimization, manufacturing (steel, cement), recycling and waste management, and more.

We are only at the embryonic stage of seeing the impact of AI on the cost curves in a wide range of commodities and industries. As we talk about the upward impact on power prices driven by AI infrastructure requirements, we need to keep in mind that AI will also radically transform industries globally and reduce cost of production.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Yes, there’s been massive excitement around everything connected to data centers, energy generation, storage, transmission, cooling. But from a VC perspective, building and scaling data centers isn’t a startup timeline. It’s a decade-long struggle of permits, substations, and grid upgrades. To put numbers on it, hyperscale data centers take 3 to 6 years to permit and connect in the US today. In some markets, interconnection alone can exceed 5 to 7 years. So in 2026, I expect to see continued traction for energy companies that are not only tied to data centers but can expand into commercial and industrial use cases and front-of-the-meter applications. Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.

Related to this is the supply of critical metals, which I continue to be very focused on: mining, extraction, refining, and recycling. This is critical not only for data centers (especially copper), but also for EV batteries with lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

In places where thermal (coal and gas) and nuclear plants are being retired, because those sites already have high-capacity grid connections. That makes deploying new clean generation dramatically faster. In the US alone, more than 60 GW of coal capacity has retired since 2015, and another 40+ GW is scheduled to retire by 2030. Each retirement frees up a transmission node that took decades to build. Reusing that interconnection is often the difference between a 2-year vs. an 8-year project timeline. And that’s where you could install next-gen nuclear reactors, like Stellaria, that cut long-lived waste, capex, opex, deployment time, and extends fuel use, or geothermal energy like Factor2 Energy, utilizing underground CO2 reservoirs for lower constraints on deployment location.

The same is true of industrial sites (chemicals, steel, refineries) that already have oversized grid connections. These sites are trying to expand production, and add storage, and they already have one of the hardest problems solved: interconnection. If you want to electrify heavy industry quickly, you go where the grid already exists.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

No one can really know, but the battery recycling and circular critical materials subsector is one I’d watch closely. Lithium, nickel, and cobalt prices are extremely sensitive to geopolitics, and recycling provides a lower-risk, domestic supply for the US.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Relectrify is deploying their battery systems at commercial production scale in 2026 with a cumulative capacity of 100 MWh. They use cell-level semiconductor circuitry to individually control battery cells at high frequency, directly producing an alternating current waveform. No need for an inverter anymore, which is a direct win on CAPEX, improved usable lifetime battery capacity, and lower OPEX by identifying and replacing malfunctioning cells with precision. It’s happening now.

And overall, grid-scale energy storage beyond lithium, driven by both AI data centers and renewable growth. Without it, you simply can’t run 24/7 clean power outside of nuclear and hydro. Globally, stationary storage is projected to grow from ~45 GWh in 2023 to hundreds of GWs by 2030. Some of the new technologies are already ready today.

Battery recycling and closed-loop supply chains with automakers (recycled lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper going back into new batteries) are also already scaling. 2026 is about acceleration. Ascend Elements has already built the largest lithium-ion battery recycling facility in North America, and has now achieved the first production of recycled lithium carbonate. Imports make up the majority of the US supply of lithium carbonate today, mostly from Argentina and Chile. If you can secure your metal supply with lower-cost recycled content, isn’t that a big win?

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Companies like Chemfinity, that could make domestic metal refining at cost parity with China, and anything tied to mining, extraction, refining, and recycling of critical metals for data centers and EVs. Copper is THE metal for data centers. It’s used in power cables, busbars, transformers, cooling loops. A single gigawatt of data-center capacity requires on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. And about 40% – 45% of the world’s copper refining is in China, followed by Chile. It’s the same geographical structure as lithium refining and battery precursor chemistry. People talk about energy security. This is what it actually looks like.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Push for growth will continue but attention will shift from flashy gigawatt announcements to construction, commissioning, and dealing with the brutal realities of interconnect and permitting delays. The result will be a huge upwelling of “bring your own generation” and “demand flexibility.”

The age of ASSPs/ASICs will begin in earnest for AI data centers. GPUs will continue to grow, but the rate will taper in favor of more specialist chips that are far more efficient, especially for inference loads. This will start decoupling data center power consumption from token generation.

The unit economics of the marquee foundational AI shops will leak. They will not look good. But they will convince investors to support them through their trough of upside down unit economics until they achieve positive unit economics, which will come sooner than expected. But the shine will be off: these will fall into a different bucket than high margin SaaS companies from prior bubbles.

Data centers will become far better grid participants through flexibility, load shaping, and power quality, and they will be rewarded with far faster interconnect times than other big loads -— the more tech they adopt, the faster they’ll get connected.

We’ll see the first off-grid world-scale data center NTP [notice to proceed, or a letter telling a contractor to begin work]. We’ll also see more NIMBY pushback on proximate data centers because of everything from power costs to size to water use.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Nuclear fusion! I think we’ll see the first net gain by analysis (i.e. deuterium fusion where it would be Q>1 if it were tritium) in a startup reactor.

Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heals in terms of new generation with linearly deploying gas assets.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

SPAC or IPO? Lots in the pipe, pun intended.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Geothermal for electricity and district heating. Friction is still way too high for single site geothermal heat loops to scale much faster than today. Thermal energy storage (load shifting) for industrial applications.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Robotics (not the humanoid kind) are taking over a huge number of labor intensive industries; they will impact many industrial, agriculture, waste, and manufacturing operations in 2026.

Logistics and Manufacturing efficiency: electrification, efficiency, on-shoring, and AI are pushing on emissions from half of the economy and these sectors are economic, not impact buyers. Give them long term certainty on lower costs vs conventional fuels for example, and you’ll have buyers. This is everything from electrified autonomous trucking to electric autonomous rail and dark terminals.

Resilience technology is going to really get going. Insurance costs (due to climate risk) are outpacing every other cost for homeowners and impacting commercial operations. Businesses and individuals are going to aggressively begin to invest in resilience in the face of accelerating climate change and extreme weather but also aging infrastructure and a shift from centralized to distributed resource paradigms.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will serve as factories for the next phase of AI innovation powering America’s society and economy. I think local governments will step up more in 2026 and challenge hyperscalers to deliver solutions that are more in line with community needs and municipal partnership that allows for swifter construction. Energy affordability is top of mind, and we really need to reverse the trend of 2025 of rising costs.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

The call is coming from inside the house in 2026. In other words, consumers have more impact than anyone thinks. Decentralized infrastructure solutions, including rooftop solar, energy storage, and distributed energy resources, like heat pumps and smart thermostats, are available today. Households can turn them on swiftly, cost-effectively, and without the major disruptions to grids across the nation we are seeing today. It’s faster to permit than building new centralized power plants.

If enough people adopt these approachable solutions, America’s grid has a better shot at handling the increased capacity from the data center AI boom.

There’s also an alignment opportunity hiding in plain sight: AI pioneers and big tech companies want a faster, more predictable path to build. Local and state governments want affordability, economic investment, and resilience. Communities are actually in a unique position to trade swift permitting and flexible construction timelines for economic rejuvenation, tax revenue, and job creation from the private sector.

By enabling more efficient households with lower utility bills, hyperscalers can access the energy they need to operate AI data centers. Much faster. That’s why this isn’t a moonshot. The opposite, in fact.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Mill. We’ll deploy more Food Recyclers, and on a different scale, than ever before. e’re planning more partnerships to encourage more households, businesses and communities to view food as something to return back to the food system rather than leave for weeks in dumpsters and then years in landfills.

Robotics is going to attract massive funding and private sector attention in 2026. Simultaneously, builders will move away from the hype around humanoid models towards functional robots designed to handle specific tasks and make life easier. The future of robotics will look more like Roomba than your neighbor Rhonda, which actually bodes well from both an affordability and technology risk perspective.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers. Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems. In order for AI to power the future without tanking grids or negatively impacting communities, it must be paired with physical hardware that solves problems and makes everyday life better for people. We’ll benefit as much from an AI smartphone as we will with an AI-powered waste facility.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

I think data centers will still dominate in 2026. But I guess I’m a little jaded on this stuff because I was in the last AI cycle — it’s a lot of the same conversation. But the level of investment is orders of magnitude greater. The level of attention is orders of magnitude greater. And so it’s going to take a long while for this to shake out one way or another.

The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station. Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure. But that would take a while to be manifested. It’s going to take months to a year perhaps to to really be manifested. You’d have to shut it off midstream and try to claw your money back. That’s pretty hard to do.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

This has been talked about a lot, but the data use, the requirements for data, it scales fairly exponentially. Power it scales quite linearly. As a consequence, it’s going to take a long while, I think, for the physical world to catch up to the data demand side. It’s really all of the above. If you can if you can do anything in power generation, power storage, transmission, distribution, if you can improve grid operations — the list goes on and on and on.

A bull market in electricity like this, I don’t know how long it’s been, maybe like a century? And so it really, at least to us, it looks like it’s all of the above. Lots and lots of interesting opportunities within that. We’ve seen some companies go public in the like the last 12, 18 months. We probably will see more. I think it’s fair to to think that there will be.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

I think power generation is gonna see more public companies in 2026, for sure. There could be a wide wide variety there. Nuclear everything is in vogue right now. We’ll likely see more of those. Geothermal, we’ll definitely see some of those. And you’ve already got a bunch of interesting players who are in project development and implementation, some of those could go public as well. It’s not just the tech companies, but the folks up and down the value chain.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Nuclear fission companies in particular. That could be a bubble for sure, but if some of these companies start succeeding and start getting uh projects built. Every few years these opportunities pop up, and it makes sense that people take advantage of those opportunities to raise some additional cash and grow more rapidly.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

There haven’t been any technologies I’ve seen recently where I’m like, ‘Oh wow that’s going to change the world, everyone should be looking at that.’ I do think it is more about scaling for a lot of these right now. If you can hit scale quickly, it’s an amazing opportunity.

If you look at the the various trends, it’s not just the manufacturing demand. The other driver is the regionalization of everything, which is driving demand for labor, for resources. Fill in the blank, there’s demand for it.

            <h2>The best AI-powered dictation apps of 2025</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/the-best-ai-powered-dictation-apps-of-2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In some ways, 2025 was when AI dictation apps really took off. Dictation apps have been around for years, but in the past they’ve proved slow and inaccurate — unless you speak with particular accents and enunciate clearly.

But advances in large language models (LLMs) and speech-to-text models have helped improve the systems that can decipher speech better while retaining the context to format the text. And developers have built in features to automatically format text, remove filler words, and ignore fumbles to output text that would need fewer edits.

But with the soaring popularity of everything AI, there’s dozens of such apps on the market. So we’ve collated our pick of the best and most useful dictation apps his year.

Wispr Flow is a well-funded AI dictation app that lets you add custom words and instructions for dictation. It has native apps for MacOS, Windows and iOS, and an Android version is in the works.

The app lets you customize how its system transcribes your notes by letting you choose from “formal,” “casual,” and “very casual” styles for different kinds of writing, such as personal messaging, work, and email.  And if you use it with vibe coding tools like Cursor, you can turn on a feature to automatically recognize variables or tag files in the chat.

The app lets you note down up to 2,000 words per month for free on any of the desktop versions, and 1,000 words per month on iOS. Its subscription plans offer unlimited transcription, and start at $15 per month.

Willow advertises itself as a big time-saver for those who don’t like to type. Alongside common features like automatic editing and formatting, the app has a feature that taps large language models to generate a full chunk of text from just a few dictated words.

Willow also takes a more privacy-focused stab at AI-assisted note-taking by storing all transcripts locally on your device, and lets you opt out of model training as well. It also lets you add custom vocabulary to the app to help it adapt to your industry’s parlance, or your local dialect.

Willow lets you dictate 2,000 words per month on its desktop app for free. Individual subscription plans start at $15 per month, giving you unlimited dictation and enabling the app to remember your writing style.

If you are focused on privacy, Monologue lets you download its model so you can run it on your device for transcriptions and avoid sending data to the cloud. What’s more, the app lets you customize its tone of voice according to the apps you use it with.

Monologue lets you jot down 1,000 words per month for free, and its subscription costs $10 per month, or $100 per year. And if you end up becoming one of the app’s top users, the company will also send you this funky Monokey to use with the app.

Keyboards are so 1983.You only need one key—Monokey, the limited edition device that turns your voice into text in Monologue.We&#39;re giving away 10, along with a free annual subscription to Monologue. pic.twitter.com/nXuz1ll2LU

Superwhisper is primarily a dictation app, but it can also transcribe from audio or video files. The app gives you the freedom to choose and download AI models, including its own models that have different speeds and accuracy, along with NVIDIA’s Parakeet speech recognition models.

The app also lets you write custom prompts to steer the output. You can easily see both processed and unprocessed transcripts that are integrated with the system keyboard.

The basic voice-to-text feature is free to use, and you get 15 minutes to test out Pro features such as translation and transcription. The paid tier lets you use your own AI API keys and plug in cloud and local models without any caps.

The monthly plan costs $8.49 per month, the annual plan costs $84.99 per month, or you can pay $249.99 for a lifetime subscription.

This app takes an offline-first, no-subscription approach, letting you use local models for transcription. There’s also a GitHub repository for those who want to host and run the open-source version themselves. VoiceTypr supports over 99 languages and works on both Mac and Windows.

VoiceTypr is available to try for three days for free, and after that it will allow you to buy a lifetime license. The app costs $35 for one device, $56 for two, and $98 for four devices.

Aqua is another Y-Combinator-backed voice typing client for Windows and MacOS that claims to be one of the fastest tools in the category in terms of latency.

Besides handling grammar and punctuation, Aqua also lets you autofill text by saying phrases — you can say “my address” and have Aqua type in your address, for example.

The app also offers its own speech-to-text API for other apps.

The free tier gets you 1,000 words per month. The paid plans start from $8 per month (annual billing), and unlock unlimited words and 800 custom dictionary values.

Handy is an open-source and free transcription tool that can run on Mac, Windows, and Linux. The application is pretty basic and doesn’t offer a lot of customization, but if you are trying to get started with using your voice more and don’t want to pay, it is a good option.

The app has a basic settings menu that lets you toggle push-to-talk, and change the hotkey to activate the transcription.

Typeless is another app in this category with a high free word count. The company claims that it doesn’t retain any data or use it to train models. Typeless also suggests a better version of the sentence if you might have fumbled a line.

The app lets you dictate up to 4,000 words per week (roughly 16,000 words per month) on its free tier. You can pay $12 per month (billed annually) to unlock unlimited words and get access to new features. Typeless is available for Windows and MacOS only.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/vcs-predict-enterprises-will-spend-more-on-ai-in-2026-through-fewer-vendors/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprises have been piloting and testing different AI tools for the past few years to figure out what their adoption strategy will look like. Investors think that period of experimentation is coming to an end.

TechCrunch recently surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs and an overwhelming majority predicted enterprises will increase their budgets for AI in 2026 — but not for everything. Most investors said this budget increase will be concentrated, and that many enterprises will spend more funds on fewer contracts.

Andrew Ferguson, a vice president at Databricks Ventures, predicted 2026 will be the year that enterprises start consolidating their investments and picking winners.

“Today, enterprises are testing multiple tools for a single-use case, and there’s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it’s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts],” Ferguson said. “As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they’ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools and deploy that savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.”

Rob Biederman, a managing partner at Asymmetric Capital Partners, agreed. He predicts that enterprise companies will not only concentrate their individual spending, the broader enterprise landscape will narrow its overall AI spending to only a handful of vendors across the entire industry.

“Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results and will decline sharply for everything else,” Biederman said. “We expect a bifurcation where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract.”

Scott Beechuk, a partner at Norwest Venture Partners, thinks enterprises will increase their spending on the tools that make AI safe for enterprises to use.

“Enterprises now recognize that the real investment lies in the safeguards and oversight layers that make AI dependable,” Beechuk said. “As these capabilities mature and reduce risk, organizations will feel confident shifting from pilots to scaled deployments, and budgets will increase.”

Harsha Kapre, a director at Snowflake Ventures, predicted enterprises will spend on AI in three distinct areas in 2026: strengthening data foundations, model post-training optimization, and consolidation of tools.

“[Chief investment officers] are actively reducing [software-as-a-service] sprawl and moving toward unified, intelligent systems that lower integration costs and deliver measurable [return on investment],” Kapre said. “AI-enabled solutions are likely going to see the biggest benefit from this shift.”

A shift away from experimentation and towards concentration will affect startups. What’s not clear, is how.

It’s possible that AI startups will reach the same reckoning point that SaaS startups arrived at a few years ago.

The companies operating hard-to-replicate products such as vertical solutions or those built on proprietary data, will likely still be able to grow. Startups with products similar to those offered by large enterprise suppliers like AWS or Salesforce, may start to see pilot projects and funding dry up.

Investors see this possibility too. When asked how they know that an AI startup has a moat, multiple VCs said companies with proprietary data and products that can’t easily be replicated by a tech giant or large language model company are the most defensible.

If investor predictions are true and enterprises do start to concentrate their AI spend next year, 2026 could be the year enterprise budgets increase but many AI startups don’t see a bigger slice of the pie.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government.

As a result, U.S. users have often found themselves caught in the middle of this tension. Earlier this year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February.

A number of investors competed to purchase the app, and after Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, the battle is finally over. As of last week, TikTok officially signed a deal to divest a portion of its U.S. entity to a group of American investors.

This comes nearly three months after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approves the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group.

A week prior, President Trump announced that President Xi Jinping of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform. ByteDance stated publicly that it would ensure the platform remains available to American users.

According to a memo viewed by TechCrunch, the investor group consists of Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and investment firm MGX. Collectively, they will hold 45% of the U.S. operation, with ByteDance keeping nearly a 20% stake. Axios first reported the news, citing sources who estimate TikTok U.S. is valued at approximately $14 billion—a figure also mentioned by Vice President JD Vance.

In September, a report indicated that a “framework” deal was established between the U.S. and China, with a consortium of investors— including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz—overseeing TikTok’s U.S. operations. These investors were expected to hold an 80% stake, and the remaining shares would belong to Chinese stakeholders.

The newly formed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC” will oversee the app’s operations, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.

Oracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to the memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.

A White House official previously said Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, and the U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain.

ByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok’s U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.

​The deal is scheduled to close on January 22, 2026.

Reports from Bloomberg indicate that when the deal is finalized, the TikTok app will be discontinued in the U.S. and users will need to transition to a new platform. However, the specifics of this platform remain largely unclear, including its features and how it will differ from the original app.

To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.

The drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.

A month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.

Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration.  After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it.

In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.

Fast-forward to today: Trump has had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.

There have been several contenders, including The People’s Bid for TikTok , a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt. This group has the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, TV personality and investor Kevin O’Leary, inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.

Another group, called the American Investor Consortium, is led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley and includes Roblox co-founder David Baszucki, Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, and famous YouTuber MrBeast.

Others in the running included Amazon, AppLovin, Microsoft, Perplexity AI, Rumble, Walmart, Zoop, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">How much effort should a country expend to rescue someone who appears to hate its values? That is the question posed by the case of Alaa Abd el-Fattah.

Abd el-Fattah is an Egyptian pro-democracy campaigner who has been in and out of prison since 2006 for opposing the regimes of Hosni Mubarak and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and for drawing attention to torture and other abuses. In 2021, he was granted British citizenship through a somewhat tenuous connection—his mother, Laila, had been born in London while her mother was studying in the United Kingdom—which gave the British government greater standing to lobby Cairo on his behalf. It pressed his case under three Conservative prime ministers (Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak) and, since June 2024, under Labour’s Keir Starmer. Six months ago, a government minister said that the case had been “a top priority every week that I have been in office.”

Last week, those efforts finally paid off. Egypt lifted a travel ban on Abd el-Fattah, who had been released from jail in September, and Starmer declared that he was “delighted” that Abd el-Fattah was “back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones.”

That delight was short-lived. Within hours, Abd el-Fattah’s tweets from the time of the Arab Spring, when he was around 30, resurfaced on X. In these, he reportedly wished violence on “all Zionists, including civilians”—read: Jews. He also called for the murder of police officers, and sarcastically described his dislike of white people. In a 2010 discussion of the death of one of the terrorists who had tortured and killed Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, he declared, “My heroes have always killed colonialists.”

The populist insurgent Nigel Farage could not have scripted a better attack ad against Britain’s two established parties. At best, both Labour and the Conservatives have spent political capital on an activist who has repeatedly expressed thoughtless and hateful views in public. At worst, the government has invited in a provocateur who will continue to spread poison and incite violence. “It is unclear to me why it has been a priority for successive governments to bring this guy over here,” the rank-and-file Labour politician Tom Rutland wrote on X, adding, “His tweets are impressive in how they manage to be vile in such a variety of ways.”

In a statement of apology, Abd el-Fattah suggested that his statements were in keeping with the prevailing ethos of early-2010s Twitter—which was full of performative, deliberately offensive left-wing posturing. His posts, he said, were the “writings of a much younger person, deeply enmeshed in antagonistic online cultures, utilising flippant, shocking and sarcastic tones in the nascent, febrile world of social media.” In his offline activism, Abd el-Fattah maintained, he was known for “publicly rejecting anti-Jewish speech in Egypt, often at risk to myself, defence of LGBTQ rights, defence of Egyptian Christians, and campaigning against police torture and brutality.” However, Abd el-Fattah also questioned why the tweets had been “republished” now with their meanings “twisted.” On Facebook, he appears to have liked a comment suggesting that it was—you guessed it—a “campaign launched by the Zionists.”

The situation is deeply embarrassing for Starmer, who welcomed Abd el-Fattah’s arrival in Britain so warmly. He now claims not to have known about the “absolutely abhorrent” tweets and is promising to “review the information failures in this case.” Apparently, despite years of campaigning for this guy, the combined might of the British civil service never thought to search his Twitter handle. If the authorities had conducted even a cursory background check, they would have found opinions such as this (now-deleted) assertion from 2012: “I’m a racist, I don’t like white people so piss off.”

Nor did civil servants enter Abd el-Fattah’s name into a search engine, which would have revealed the 2014 reports on his controversial nomination for a free-speech prize. One of these, headlined “A Dissident for Hate,” observed that “Mr. Abdel Fattah may have been brave in confronting authoritarianism in his own country. But his rhetoric on Israel and moderate Arabs is another story.”

The British right is now arguing that Abd el-Fattah and his celebrity supporters—including Naomi Klein, Olivia Colman, and Mark Ruffalo—have made the British government look foolish. Why is Starmer loudly welcoming “back” a man who has never before spent a significant amount of time in Britain, who abhors its geopolitical alliances, and who apparently dislikes the majority of its population? Farage, the leader of the right-wing Reform Party, has unsurprisingly called for Abd el-Fattah to be stripped of his British citizenship. So has Kemi Badenoch, the current leader of the Conservatives—the party in charge when Abd el-Fattah was awarded that citizenship in the first place.

Idrees Kahloon: Political parties have disconnected from the public

Former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss, who has lately joined the podcast circuit, wrote on X that Abd el-Fattah’s case shows that “the human-rights/NGO industrial complex has completely captured the British state.” This is the same Liz Truss who, as foreign secretary in 2022, assured Parliament that she was “working very hard to secure his release.” Was she then unaware of his tweets? Or was she then posturing as a policy maker, whereas now she is trying to make a living as a YouTuber? (Yes, she is Dan Bongino in reverse.) The Conservatives’ shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, has also piled on Abd el-Fattah’s story, condemning the celebrities who campaigned for his release as “useful idiots.” Jenrick covets Badenoch’s job—and his plan to win it relies on outflanking her on crime and immigration.

Liberals and conservatives have politicized this story. Starmer—and the previous incarnation of Truss—treated Abd el-Fattah as a kind of mascot, a living totem of Britain’s enlightened attitudes toward political dissent in comparison with those of Middle Eastern dictatorships. Today’s version of Truss, and the rest of the populist right, are now holding him up as Exhibit A in their argument that the West needs to be tougher on Muslim immigration to Europe.

As ever, the challenge is to look beyond this ideological point-scoring and consider the case on its own merits. I was deeply unimpressed that one of Abd el-Fattah’s first public statements after his longed-for deliverance was to repost a complaint that Starmer had not publicly condemned Sisi’s dictatorship while announcing his release. Welcome to the grubby reality of international diplomacy! But if I had missed many of my child’s birthdays in detention, I might also find it hard to be gracious.

Still, British Jews have every right to question their state’s extraordinary efforts to free someone who has called for violence against them and who has recanted only in the vaguest terms. The Jewish community is under threat here: The aftermath of October 7 and the war in Gaza have led to more visible anti-Semitism in Britain, in many cases from self-declared Islamists. On Yom Kippur, a militant Islamist called Jihad Al-Shamie (in retrospect, the first name was a clue) killed one person and injured others in a stabbing attack on a synagogue in Manchester. Earlier this month, two men were convicted of plotting what authorities described as an “ISIS-inspired” atrocity in the same city. “Here in Manchester, we have the biggest Jewish community,” one of the plotters told an undercover police officer whom he believed to be a co-conspirator. “God willing we will degrade and humiliate them (in the worst way possible), and hit them where it hurts.” Social media is one of the key drivers and reinforcers of anti-Semitic extremism; tweets like Abd el-Fattah’s are not just harmless letting-off of steam.

Still, if he repeats such sentiments now that he lives in Britain, Abd el-Fattah could be subject to prosecution for incitement to violence, or hate speech. The British state has pursued people for less: See the recent prosecution against the gender-critical campaigner Graham Linehan—the case was eventually dropped—or the conviction of a woman named Lucy Connolly for posting that hotels housing asylum-seekers should be set on fire.

Taking away Abd el-Fattah’s British passport is another matter. Once granted, citizenship is citizenship, no matter how stupid or evil or thoughtless its holder turns out to be. I don’t want to live in a country where naturalized or joint citizens are treated as second-class Britons, forever on probation. Now that he has a UK passport, Alaa Abd el-Fattah is entitled to the protection of the British state, just like Liz Truss—or like Kemi Badenoch, for that matter, whose British citizenship rests on the coincidence of her Nigerian mother having given birth to her in London.

Yet you can take an inclusive view of British citizenship and still believe that people should be vetted before receiving it. Starmer’s post gushing about Abd el-Fattah’s arrival was catastrophically ill-judged, both in his assessment of this particular case and as a representation of his wider governing philosophy. Starmer, a former human-rights lawyer, approaches every problem with an arid obsession with process rather than outcome—as if, when people follow every dot and comma of the rules, nothing bad can happen and no one should complain.

The Abd el-Fattah decision follows this pattern. Starmer celebrated the bureaucratic machinations of this case—granting automatic citizenship by descent and then securing the end of Abd el-Fattah’s travel ban—without enough attention to the politics. Yes, he was failed by his officials and their lack of briefing. But he also suffered a personal failure of imagination: Is it such a stretch to ask whether a Middle Eastern activist raised among members of the Egyptian communist intelligentsia has any worrisome opinions on Israel or Jews? Part of Starmer’s pitch to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader of Labour was that his predecessor had turned a blind eye to anti-Semitism. (He eventually kicked Corbyn out of the party altogether for this offense.) But in the past two years, he has struggled to identify and police the line between legitimate criticism of the Israeli government and wider animus against Jews, often camouflaged as attacks on “Zionists.”

At the same time, populists on the right have begun to insist, in more and more explicit terms, that Muslims cannot be integrated into Europe because their values are too different—the grooming-gangs scandal is offered as evidence here—and because they feel more loyalty to the ummah than to the countries to which they have immigrated. That view ignores the many followers of moderate Islam, such as London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who have found no contradiction between their faith and Western liberalism. But the views of Abd el-Fattah punch that bruise.

Another case like this may not arrive again—not least because Britain’s current appetite for enforcing its values abroad is low. In June, Starmer cut the foreign-aid budget, and some of what remains is spent domestically anyway, on housing asylum seekers. Starmer’s home secretary, Shabana Mahmood—herself a British Muslim—has announced a drastic tightening of eligibility requirements for citizenship.

Starmer—and his Conservative predecessors—were right to call for Abd el-Fattah’s release. What was absurd, however, was to frame his arrival on British soil as an unalloyed blessing. Starmer was thinking like the procedure-obsessed human-rights lawyer he used to be, not the political and moral leader that Britain needs right now.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/the-show-wont-go-on-at-the-kennedy-center/685468/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the opening scene of the black comedy The Death of Stalin, a violinist in Moscow is told her orchestra is giving a command performance for Joseph Stalin, and refuses to play on political grounds. A frantic radio director, fearing he will be arrested or shot if he fails to produce the concert in time, begs her to reconsider, finally prevailing with an offer of 20,000 rubles.

Recently, the Trump administration faced a similar situation. After Donald Trump purported to rename the Kennedy Center after himself, the jazz musician Chuck Redd withdrew from a planned Christmas Eve concert. The administration’s response was somehow both more authoritarian and comic than the one in the movie.

The Kennedy Center’s president, Richard Grenell, announced that the Center intends to sue Redd for his impudence. Grennell’s letter threatening legal action depicts Redd as a sad loser suffering “dismal ticket sales and lack of donor support” and “lagging” attendance whose withdrawal, paradoxically, is “very costly to a non-profit Arts institution.”

One might presume the withdrawal of an obscure performer detested by the audience and donors alike would be easily brushed off, or even welcomed. Yet Grenell demands $1 million in damages.

Grenell’s letter argues not only that Redd has harmed the Center’s finances, but that his withdrawal constitutes an “act of intolerance” driven by “the sad bullying tactics employed by certain elements on the left.” Grenell vows, “We will not let them cancel shows without consequences.”

This is a strange interpretation of “cancel culture.” The concept, in its original form, described a tendency on the political left to react to minor ideological or linguistic offenses by demanding firings or social shunning, demands often reinforced by outraged social-media mobs. The problem with cancel culture—from the liberal standpoint, anyway—is that it is coercive.

But for an individual to decide not to participate in a politicized ritual at an artistic institution now renamed, Soviet-style, after the still-living head of its reigning personality cult is not coercive. Permitting individuals to choose which ideas they wish to endorse is the essence of liberalism.

The MAGA movement, of course, has no use for liberalism, which is why it naturally sees such an act of conscience as an attack. “The outrageous behavior is scarcely out of the ordinary for a political side less reliant on policy platforms and more reliant on bullets of deranged assassins,” fumes a column in Steve Bannon’s National Pulse, tweeted out by the official Kennedy Center social-media account.

In the minds of President Trump’s loyalists, refusing to genuflect to the great leader reflects the same general impulse as attempting to assassinate him. This was Stalin’s premise, too. Imposing the personality cult upon the state is designed not only to burnish the leader’s image, but to create opportunities to smoke out dissidents. Trump’s mania for renaming things after himself and turning his birthday into a national holiday celebrated with military parades forces individual members of the bureaucracy to choose between complying with his ego-gratifying demands or exposing themselves as the kind of officials who might decline illegal orders.

The comic aspect of the Kennedy Center threat is that Trump has little leverage over artists. He can fire a general who refuses to organize a parade for him, but he can’t make Lin-Manuel Miranda put Hamilton in the Kennedy Center.

The administration’s apparent plan to resolve this difficulty is to shame or browbeat members of the artistic community into performing there. “Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn’t courageous or principled—they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people,” the Center’s vice president of public relations told the New York Post.

Trump has treated last year’s election as eternal proof that he is the incarnation of the public will and that any opposition to him is a kind of alienation from the people. From this belief, it follows that performing in Trump’s cultural center is a public duty. But since the administration currently lacks the power to lock up artists who don’t comply, this demand is as silly as it is presumptuous.</div>

            <h2>The Trump Administration’s Most Paralyzing Blow to Science</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2025/12/american-science-2025-trump-ambition/685467/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For all of the political chaos that American science endured in 2025, aspects of this country’s research enterprise made it through somewhat … okay. The Trump administration terminated billions of dollars in research grants; judges intervened to help reinstate thousands of those contracts. The administration threatened to cut funding to a number of universities; several have struck deals that preserved that money. After the White House proposed slashing the National Institutes of Health’s $48 billion budget, Congress pledged to maintain it. And although some researchers have left the country, far more have remained. Despite these disruptions, many researchers will also remember 2025 as the year when personalized gene therapy helped treat a six-month-old baby, or when the Vera C. Rubin Observatory released its first glimpse of the star-studded night sky.

Science did lose out this year, though, in ways that researchers are still struggling to tabulate. Some of those losses are straightforward: Since the beginning of 2025, “all, or nearly all, federal agencies that supported research in some way have decreased the size of their research footprint,” Scott Delaney, an epidemiologist who has been tracking the federal funding cuts to science, told me. Less funding means less science can be done and fewer discoveries will be made. The deeper cut may be to the trust researchers had in the federal government as a stable partner in the pursuit of knowledge. This means the country’s appetite for bold exploration, which the compact between science and government supported for decades, may be gone, too—leaving in its place more timid, short-term thinking.

In an email, Andrew Nixon, the deputy assistant secretary for media relations at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH, disputed that assertion, writing, “The Biden administration politicized NIH funding through DEI-driven agendas; this administration is restoring rigor, merit, and public trust by prioritizing evidence-based research with real health impact while continuing to support early-career scientists.”

Science has always required creativity—people asking and pursuing questions in ways that have never been attempted before, in the hope that some of that work might produce something new. At its most dramatic, the results can be transformative: In the early 1900s, the Wright brothers drew inspiration from birds’ flight mechanics to launch their first airplanes; more recently, scientists have found ways to genetically engineer a person’s own immune cells to kill off cancer. Even in more routine discoveries, nothing quite matches the excitement of being the first to capture a piece of reality. I remember, as a graduate student, cloning my first bacterial mutant while trying to understand a gene important for growth. I knew that the microscopic creature I had built would never yield a drug or save a life. But in the brief moment in which I plucked a colony from an agar plate and swirled it into a warm, sugar-rich broth, I held a form of life that had never existed before—and that I had made in pursuit of a question that, as far as I knew, no one else had asked.

Pursuing scientific creativity can be resource intensive, requiring large teams of researchers to spend millions of dollars across decades to investigate complex questions. Up until very recently, the federal government was eager to underwrite that process. Since the end of the Second World War, it has poured money into basic research, establishing a kind of social contract with scientists, of funds in exchange for innovation. Support from the government “allowed the free play of scientific genius,” Nancy Tomes, a historian of medicine at Stony Brook University, told me.

The investment has paid dividends. One oft-cited statistic puts the success of scientific funding in economic terms: Every dollar invested in research and development in the United States is estimated to return at least $5. Another points to the fact that more than 99 percent of the drugs approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2019 were at least partly supported by NIH funds. These things are true—but they also obscure the years or even decades of meandering and experimentation that scientists must take to reach those results. CRISPR gene-editing technology began as basic research into the structure of bacterial genomes; the discovery of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs depended on scientists in the late ’70s and ’80s tinkering with fish cells. The Trump administration has defunded research with more obvious near-term goals—work on mRNA vaccines to combat the next flu pandemic, for instance—but also science that expands knowledge that we don’t yet have an application for (if one even exists). It has also proposed major cuts to NASA that could doom an already troubled mission to return brand-new mineral samples from the surface of Mars, which might have told us more about life in this universe, or nothing much at all.

Outside of the most obvious effects of grant terminations—salary cuts, forced layoffs, halted studies—the Trump administration’s attacks on science have limited the horizons that scientists in the U.S. are looking toward. The administration has made clear that it no longer intends to sponsor research into certain subjects, including transgender health and HIV. Even researchers who haven’t had grants terminated this year or who work on less politically volatile subjects are struggling to conceptualize their scientific futures, as canceled grant-review meetings and lists of banned words hamper the normal review process. The NIH is also switching up its funding model to one that will decrease the number of scientific projects and people it will bankroll. Many scientists are hesitant to hire more staff or start new projects that rely on expensive materials. Some have started to seek funds from pharmaceutical companies or foundations, which tend to offer smaller and shorter-term agreements, trained more closely on projects with potential profit.

All of this nudges scientists into a defensive posture. They’re compressing the size of their studies or dropping the most ambitious aspects of their projects. Collaborations between research groups have broken down too, as some scientists who have been relatively insulated from the administration’s cuts have terminated their partnerships with defunded scientists—including at Harvard, where Delaney worked as a research scientist until September—to protect their own interests. “The human thing to do is to look inward and to kind of take care of yourself first,” Delaney told me. Instability and fear have made the research system, already sometimes prone to siloing, even more fragmented. The administration “took two of the best assets that the U.S. scientific enterprise has—the capacity to think long, and the capacity to collaborate—and we screwed them up at the same time,” Delaney said. Several scientists told me that the current funding environment has prompted them to consider early retirement—in many cases, shutting down the labs they have run for decades.

Some of the experiments that scientists shelved this year could still be done at later dates. But the new instability of American science may also be driving away the people necessary to power that future work. Several universities have been forced to downsize Ph.D. programs; the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies have made many international researchers fearful of their status at universities. And as the administration continues to dismiss the importance of DEI programs, many young scientists from diverse backgrounds have told me they’re questioning whether they will be welcomed into academia. Under the Trump administration, the scope of American science is simply smaller: “When you shrink funding, you’re going to increase conservatism,” C. Brandon Ogbunu, a computational biologist at Yale University, told me. Competition and scarcity can breed innovation in science. But often, Ogbunu said, people forget that “comfort and security are key parts of innovation, too.”</div>

            <h2>A Better Way to Think About New Year’s Resolutions</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2025/12/new-year-resolution-communal/685436/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nowadays, having a New Year’s resolution can seem almost quaint. Social-media influencers push self-improvement trends year-round: The spring has “glow up” challenges, as does the summer. Soon after, the high-discipline “Great Lock-In Challenge” and “Winter Arc” videos begin, many of them urging people to get ahead of the “new year, new me” crowd. Or you can attempt a slew of other self-betterment regimens, whenever the spirit calls. Many of these videos depict people minimizing distractions—such as, say, other people—to bicep-curl and matcha-drink their way to becoming “unrecognizable,” mentally and physically, as some YouTubers put it. At the same time, many Americans appear to be losing interest in New Year’s resolutions. One report from the social-media analytic company Brandwatch found that, in the days around January 1, mentions of resolutions fell 50 percent last holiday season when compared with the year prior. To put it plainly: Many people are now always trying to hustle their way to a better self, no matter the month or season.

In one sense, detaching goal setting from the start of the Gregorian calendar is reasonable—one can, of course, choose to begin afresh at any moment. But by letting New Year’s resolutions go, Americans may be losing something: a distinctly communal ritual that can remind people of how entangled their well-being is with that of others.

New Year’s hasn’t always been so associated with accomplishing personal goals. Humans have a long history of using the holiday to think about how to make life better for their community. Versions of resolutions have existed for about 4,000 years; in Babylonia and ancient Rome, people prayed together, paid off their debts, and made promises of good conduct to their gods. The rituals were usually framed as religious events supporting the broader group, and were tied to agricultural calendars. (“Permit my harvests, my grain, my vineyards, and my plantations to flourish,” some ancient Romans were counseled to ask of Janus, the god of transitions and beginnings, “and give good health and strength to me, my house, and my household.”) Even in the more recent past, in the United States, many people’s resolutions focused on learning how to live well with others. The most popular resolution in the U.S. in 1947 was, according to a Gallup poll, to “improve my disposition, be more understanding, control my temper.” Last year, by contrast, Americans’ resolutions were primarily related to exercise, health, or diet.

Americans may no longer share a schedule dictated by the agricultural calendar, but a sense of community doesn’t need to disappear. New Year’s can be an opportunity to gather with loved ones and set resolutions together. Maybe everyone meets in person; maybe over Zoom. Maybe the group sets one big, collaborative goal—Let’s start a community garden, for instance, or Let’s take turns cooking meals for one another at home. Maybe everyone picks a different resolution, and the group brainstorms how to best help each person achieve it. And ideally, the goals aren’t self-serving—but considerate of the people around them.

Making a resolution with other people might actually be more effective than flying solo. Habits are unconscious patterns that can be hard to shake, and seeing someone in our environment engaging in a certain behavior can nudge us to do it too, Tim Kurz, a psychology professor at the University of Western Australia, told me. This permeability can have its downsides—your sister’s Is It Cake? binge-watching in the living room could cue you to watch even more Netflix. But it can also be a great boon: As work piles up, for example, you might forget about your resolution to check in on older family members. If you have set this intention as a household, though, you might see your partner buying groceries for their grandmother, which in turn might remind you to call grandma too.

Shared resolutions can support intention setting in another way: They may help people avoid what social psychologists call “do-gooder derogation”—a quirk of psychology in which humans tend to “find people who are more moralistic than us and are behaving more virtuously than us really annoying,” Kurz said. He gave me this example: Say you’ve recently resolved to ride your bike to work instead of driving, for environmental reasons. Your family, already buckled into the SUV, might feel their virtue threatened and decide to poke fun at you. Look at this guy! Have fun biking in the rain, Goody Two-shoes! If you set goals as a family, however, your relatives—who under other circumstances might be psychologically motivated to subvert your resolutions—may become more committed to helping you follow through.

In the long run, resolutions that keep others in mind tend to have greater staying power. Studies have found that brute willpower alone lasts for only so long, and that people have a much harder time accessing willpower when stressed. This might help explain why a more individual New Year’s goal, such as losing 10 pounds by swearing off ice cream, may be more likely to fizzle. “If you fail in your quest, then the only person you have ‘let down’ is yourself,” Kurz said. Evolutionarily speaking, people might not even be built to set self-serving goals. What helped our human ancestors succeed were likely “strong social bonds,” the psychologist David Desteno wrote in a New York Times article about resolutions, “relationships that would encourage people to cooperate and lend support to one another.”

Of course, shared resolutions aren’t a magic pill for behavioral change. Humans can famously be both top-notch accountability partners and rampant enablers. When picking whom to make goals with, “be careful about who that person is,” Kurz told me. “You don’t want to strategically choose the person who you know is a total flake.” You might have resolved with your work bestie to quit overdoing the happy-hour piña coladas so that you can better participate in your team’s conversations; if your pal capsizes on your shared goal first, though, their decision could lead to a cycle of “collective rationalization,” in which you feel okay quitting too, Kurz told me. Hell, why not get another round?

Still, communal resolutions can serve as a good reminder of how profoundly interconnected humans are. And they can push people to widen their definition of self-improvement. In a recent interview, the Potawatomi botanist and writer Robin Wall Kimmerer described the concept of “expanded self-interest”—the idea that the “self” can include all of life. “My well-being is the same as my family’s well-being,” she explained, and “my family’s well-being is the same as the well-being of the land that feeds us.” Bicep curls and matcha lattes, then, may get us only so far on the path to flourishing. The trick to helping ourselves might just be to focus on the communal first.</div>

            <h2>The Podcast ‘Productivity’ Trap</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/podcasts-music-listening-productivity/685448/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Podcasts have devastated my relationship to music. Confirmation of that sad fact came earlier this month in the form of my Spotify “Wrapped,” the streaming service’s personalized report of what I listened to this year, including a playlist of my top songs. In the past, this annual playlist supplied a loop of sonic pleasure, propelling me through workouts, dinner preps, and hours-long commutes. This year, I haven’t even opened it.

That is not to say I’ve embraced silence: According to Spotify, I spent 71,661 minutes on the app over the past 12 months. That’s 49 days. But 55,088 of those minutes were spent streaming podcasts instead of songs. Whereas I used to listen to music all the time, now I fill every available moment with the sound of people talking.

I suspect I’m not the only one. My change in listening habits comes from a compulsion that many people in my life share: to make every minute of the day as “productive” as possible. By that blinkered calculus, an informative podcast will always trump music. But listening incessantly to podcasts has actually narrowed my interests and shown me just how limiting too much information can be.

Read: Companies’ ‘wrapped’ features keep getting weirder

Before I finish brewing my first cup of coffee, a BBC report is already streaming from my speaker. “Not another podcast, Papa,” my son complains, wiping his sleepy eyes as I butter his toast. “I need to know what’s going on in the world,” I tell him, even though I can see how much he and his sister would rather listen to something with a beat.

After dropping him off at school, I cycle through long-form podcasts on my walk home, during my own breakfast, and as I get ready for the day. Many of these are political, and they run the ideological spectrum. I reserve The New York Times’ podcast The Daily for a short lunchtime treat. Then at the gym in the late afternoon, I’m back to eavesdropping on other people’s verbal marathons, many of them about exercise and nutrition. I used to turn on house music or jazz automatically when I started cooking in the evenings. Now I have to force myself to play anything other than chatter.

The pandemic was the turning point for me. I scarcely listened to podcasts before those days of tedium and seclusion, when overhearing a conversation almost felt like having company. The number of podcasts has exploded since then, and algorithms have deftly toured me around the new offerings. I’ve found some excellent ones; their charming and informed hosts now serve as unlikely rivals of my favorite musical artists.

The podcast boom is not the only reason I’m listening to so few songs these days. Hip-hop, the genre I grew up on, has entered a period of sustained decline. Everyone thinks the songs of their youth represent a golden era. But the rappers I listened to when I was younger really were better than today’s artists, or at least more innovative—maybe because the genre was younger, too. Dr. Dre concocted a sound that changed how the West Coast made music. Nas and Jay-Z could not only rap circles around the best of their successors; they could also smuggle some serious ideas into their hits. Consider this Socratic inquiry from Jay-Z: “Is Pius pious ’cause God loves pious?” That type of lyric rarely comes around anymore.

In the late 2010s, so-called mumble rap took off. Critics lamented that the genre—and the styles it continues to spawn—ignores lyricism and craft, a complaint that gives short shrift to the infectious exuberance these modes can produce. Still, even some of the most prominent contemporary artists worry that something has gone awry.

This fall, Billboard reported that, for the first time since 1990, its Top 40 chart didn’t contain a single rap song. Observers have proposed plenty of explanations. I favor one offered (perhaps apocryphally) by the mumble-rap pioneer Young Thug: that the enervating, yearlong feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar degraded the genre. “Since then,” a viral quote attributed to Young Thug contends, “everyone in the world is leveling up, except hip-hop.”

In this dispiriting context, podcasts have grown all the more appealing. (Some of the best rap artists from my youth now host their own.) When I do return to hip-hop, it’s mostly to indulge my nostalgia.

Choosing between podcasts and music reminds me of something the critic Dwight Garner observed about the value of reading a book on olive oil. “Extra Virginity is another reminder of why subpar nonfiction is so much better than subpar fiction,” Garner wrote. “With nonfiction at least you can learn something.” That’s how I used to feel about podcasts. At least they help me improve my grasp of international affairs and prepare for the AI apocalypse. BigXthaPlug and NBA YoungBoy don’t teach me anything.

But more recently, I’ve found that trying to make every listening minute count inevitably becomes counterproductive. The internal pressure to optimize free time and always multitask is ultimately exhausting, not enlightening.

The world never ceases to produce grist for discussion. That doesn’t mean we need to fill our ears with all of it. In the new year, I think I’ll try a little more silence.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-30</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the first sentences I was ever paid to write was “Try out lighter lip stick colors, like peach or coral.” Fresh out of college in the mid 2010s, I’d scored a copy job for a how-to website. An early task involved expanding upon an article titled “How to Get Rid of Dark Lips.” For the next two years, I worked on articles with headlines such as “How to Speak Like a Stereotypical New Yorker (With Examples),” “How to Eat an Insect or Arachnid,” and “How to Acquire a Gun License in New Jersey.” I didn’t get rich or win literary awards, but I did learn how to write a clean sentence, convey information in a logical sequence, and modulate my tone for the intended audience—skills that I use daily in my current work in screenwriting, film editing, and corporate communications. Just as important, the job paid my bills while I found my way in the entertainment industry.

Artificial intelligence has rendered my first job obsolete. Today, if you want to learn  “How to Become a Hip Hop Music Producer,” you can just ask ChatGPT. AI is also displacing the humans doing many of my subsequent jobs: writing promotional copy for tourism boards, drafting questions for low-budget documentaries, offering script notes on student films. Today, a cursory search for writing jobs on LinkedIn pulls up a number of positions that involve not producing copy but training AI models to sound more human. When anyone can create a logo or marketing copy at the touch of a button, why hire a new graduate to do it?

From the July/August 2023 issue: The coming humanist renaissance

These shifts in the job market won’t deter everyone. Well-connected young people with rich families can always afford to network and take unpaid jobs. But by eliminating entry-level jobs, AI may destroy the ladder of apprenticeship necessary to develop artists, and it could leave behind a culture driven by nepo babies and chatbots.

The existential crisis is spreading across the creative landscape. Last year, the consulting firm CVL Economics estimated that artificial intelligence would disrupt more than 200,000 entertainment-industry jobs in the United States by 2026. The CEO of an AI music-generation company claimed in January that most musicians don’t actually enjoy making music, and that musicians themselves will soon be unnecessary.

In a much-touted South by Southwest talk earlier this year, Phil Wiser, the chief technology officer of Paramount, described how AI could streamline every step of filmmaking. Even the director James Cameron—whose classic work The Terminator warned of the dangers of intelligent machines, and whose forthcoming Avatar sequel will reportedly include a disclaimer that no AI was involved in making the film—has talked about using the technology to cut costs and speed up production schedules. Last year, the chief technology officer of OpenAI declared that “some creative jobs maybe will go away, but maybe they shouldn’t have been there in the first place.”

One great promise of generative AI is that it will free artists from drudgery, allowing them to focus on the sort of “real art” they all long to do. It may not cut together the next Magnolia, but it’ll do just fine with the 500th episode of Law & Order. What’s the harm, studio executives might wonder, if machines take over work that seems unchallenging and rote to knowledgeable professionals?

Read: Your creativity won’t save your job from AI

The problem is that entry-level creative jobs are much more than grunt work. Working within established formulas and routines is how young artists develop their skills. Hunter S. Thompson began his writing career as a copy boy for Time magazine; Joan Didion was a research assistant at Vogue; the director David Lean edited newsreels; the musician Lou Reed wrote knockoff pop tunes for department stores; the filmmakers Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, and Francis Ford Coppola shot cheap B movies for Roger Corman. Beyond the money, which is usually modest, low-level creative jobs offer practice time and pathways for mentorship that side gigs such as waiting tables and tending bar do not.

Having begun my own transition into filmmaking by making rough cuts of video footage for a YouTube channel, I couldn’t help but be alarmed when the makers of the AI software Eddie launched an update in September that can produce first edits of films. For that YouTube channel, I shot, edited, and published three videos a week, and I received rigorous producer notes and near-immediate audience feedback. You can’t help but get better at your craft that way. These jobs are also where you meet people: One of the producers at that channel later commissioned my first produced screenplay for Netflix.

There’s a reason the Writers Guild of America, of which I am a member, made on-set mentorship opportunities for lower-level writers a plank of its negotiations during the 2023 strike. The WGA won on that point, but it may have been too late.

The optimistic case for AI is that new artistic tools will yield new forms of art, much as the invention of the camera created the art of photography and pushed painters to explore less realistic forms. The proliferation of cheap digital video cameras helped usher in the indie-film explosion of the late 1990s. I’ve used several AI tools in ways that have widely expanded my capabilities as a film editor.

Working from their bedrooms, indie filmmakers can deploy what, until recently, were top-tier visual-effects capabilities. Musicians can add AI instruments to their compositions. Perhaps AI models will offer everyone unlimited artistic freedom without requiring extensive technical knowledge. Tech companies tend to rhapsodize about the democratizing potential of their products, and AI technology may indeed offer huge rewards to the savvy and lucky artists who take maximum advantage of it.

Read: Here’s how AI will come for your job

Yet past experience from social media and streaming music suggests a different progression: Like other technologies that promise digital democratization, generative AI may be better poised to enrich the companies that develop it than to help freelance creatives make a living.

In an ideal world, the elimination of entry-level work would free future writers from having to write “How to Be a Pornstar” in order to pay their rent, allowing true creativity to flourish in its place. At the moment, though, AI seems destined to squeeze the livelihoods of creative professionals who spend decades mastering a craft. Executives in Silicon Valley and Hollywood don’t seem to understand that the cultivation of art also requires the cultivation of artists.</div>

I don&#39;t think the man himself would say he was a role model nor does anyone put him up as a role model except for a certain subset of writers.

They fall into four categories:
1} Language automation.

Why live life as a human in human culture, when you can sit back and let AI do the living for you?

&quot;low-level creative jobs offer practice time and pathways for mentorship&quot;

More importantly, ultimately, is they offer pathways to high level creative jobs eventually.Training an ai offers a pathway to... Nothing.

Working you way up the rungs is how you learn.  No one knows what the exact steps are to do something in a work environment the moment you walk in the door. You don&#39;t know what is or is not right until you get feedback.  It&#39;s why it&#39;s called learning.

Take that learning away and how does someone know what to tell/direct an AI bot to do?  If they&#39;ve never done the steps before, how do they know what is right or wrong?

As a side note, many &quot;manuals&quot; that come with equipment fall into the last category.  Clearly the people &quot;writing&quot; the manual have never done what they&#39;re telling you to do. Had they done so, the numerous quirks and confusions wouldn&#39;t be there.

And by big surprise, I mean it&#39;s a big surprise that someone finally wrote an article pointing out the obvious. The public articles have mostly tried to ignore this part of the AI trend in favor of, &quot;AI is great at everything,&quot; messaging up to this point.

We&#39;re seeing it here in podunk nowheresville US as well. We hire new programmers, they rely nearly 100% on AI assisted vibe coding to do the simple tasks we give them, and their skills are not improving at the rate they need to to climb into the bigger proj

A lot of the current concerns around AI very much remind me of the outsourcing trend of the 2000s.  Basically keep the senior people in-house, and outsource all the junior positions to some other country with lower wages.  It ultimately failed then too, for similar reasons.  Too much effort required to review and fix the work, and the removal of a pipeline for new senior people.

unless they&#39;re blond and he can have sexual intercourse with them.

Let&#39;s see if we can solve the problem by looking at it a different way.

MALARIA - it&#39;s the spunky little germ with the Can-Do attitude! When others say &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;, Malaria says &quot;I CAN!&quot;

In this case it has nothing to do with the current administration. It will get worse but to be clear it has been climbing since 2015. Time for a new approach to this issue.

With sane comments like this, sometimes I do feel there is hope for /.

Big money is hardly interestedThe late Jimmy Carter essentially eradicated guinea worm from Africa [smithsonianmag.com] through his Carter Center.  It only took 43 years to do it, but if one small non-profit can do it, there&#39;s no reason others can&#39;t do the same thing for malaria. We know what causes it and how to slow if not stop it. It only takes the will to do so.

At all points in time, nations and adults need to take on responsibility for their own situations.  Trump is a fat sack of puke who should not have eliminated aid, but aid should come with specific requirements of responsibility and clear paths to independence.  Countries don&#39;t even bother building basic sanitation.  People sit around and build nothing.  In the end, I 100% understand the desire to say, &quot;OK then, fuck &#39;em.&quot;

America, we can afford to send bombs and troops to any country in the world, but God forbid we send some medical aid or wipe out some mosquito.

Let&#39;s not forget that it was also cut for nothing, the Federal budget went UP after USAID was cut.

They also did not prove any &quot;fraud&quot;, they took the programs, framed them in the worst possible way to feed their base and media machine to manufacture consent for cancelling and then just cut it and literally ran away and now pretend like they were never there to begin with.

Ask anyone to defend these cuts and you&#39;ll get a bunch of emotional appeals about tax dollars and &quot;those people&quot; and not anything concrete.

1) go back to using ddt.  The entire Silent Spring thing was a load of crap based on poorly designed experiments (the scientists that did the original experiment recognized this and reran the same thing except this time giving the birds the normal amount of calcium they&#39;re have gotten from natural diets.  The result was that ddt was NO IMPACT - actually the ddt heavy birds were slightly healthier, albeit not statistically significantly).

The Trump administration&#39;s actions are despicable, but it was time for a new approach anyway.

There are major risks associated with messing with mother nature, but the severity of the malaria problem makes those risks worthwhile in this dire situation. It&#39;s time for the nuclear approach and make an all-out effort to eliminate the offending mosquito species. Nothing else has worked to stem the tide, so it&#39;s either that or a grim future of malaria deaths and disease.

Trump has cheated on every one of his wives, so, how about he sleep with Malaria, and with any luck, it will kill him?

1. They need to make the fee far more substantial and punitive. Everest climbers are spending tens of  thousands of dollars to make the climb. A paltry $4k is an easy sacrifice to not have to schlep your shit. I&#39;m surprised any of them brought anything at all back.

2. Nepal need to make the weight requirement at least 50% greater than the average waste generation rate. If the average climber generates 26lbs. of waste, then require them to bring back 38lbs. of waste.

Properly done, the climbers would clean up the mountain, or the Nepalese government would have enough money to send up garbage Sherpas.

So, make the incentive vanity. How about keep a record of &quot;most trash hauled down&quot;? I&#39;m sort of being cheeky, but the money isn&#39;t the incentive. It&#39;s ego.

In either case, shouldn&#39;t they keep the program, as it does generate revenue? Can&#39;t that revenue be used to subsidize some sort of cleanup effort?

Make personal cameras illegal on Everest and have professional photographers who earn money by exchanging trash for photos. So, you summit, a pro takes you photo, but then you can&#39;t have the photo until you come pay for it with trash at the bottom.

Have you considered. $40k deposit? The economics of Everest mean that $4k is a small upgrade, but $40k is a significant increase in the cost of the trip. Or hell, make it $250k.

Ban anyone from getting a visa for 10 years if they don&#39;t pick up enough rubbish off the mountain.

The problem is that it wasn&#39;t set up to actually solve the problem.

The fee should have been set high enough to contract with local Sherpas to go get the trash if the hiker didn&#39;t bring it back down, and it should have been spent that way.  There should be enough extra in the fee to cover collecting additional trash left in the decades before it became such an embarrassment, with a goal of perhaps collecting it all within 20 years.

Perhaps the fee can be extended to cover a &quot;Body Recovery Insurance&quot; also.  Re

            <div id="article-text">I remember 2010.  I tried to convince various relatives that they really did not need a fancy DSLR for the snapshots they were going to take.  Deaf ears.  Had to keep up with the Joneses.  Now, keeping up with the joneses means jonesing for the latest iphone.  Fads change.

It didn&#39;t help the camera industry that an iPhone (or any good smartphone, really) can take pictures much better than any DSLR could 15 years ago.

Sure, the new DSLR&#39;s still take much better photos, but the iPhone has taken &quot;good enough&quot; pictures for most people for nearly a decade now.

Some of these cameras baffle me. Sigma&#39;s new BF camera is expensive at $2000. It does not offer any new features over its predecessors. It takes away features. Its main selling point is simplicity. Well, we already have cell phone cameras for that. I fail to understand the target market. Somebody jokingly said that it is an expensive camera for people who hate photography.

>I fail to understand the target market.Hipsters, artists, celebrities, wealthy tourists, artsy girls and dudes trying to attract artsy girls, etc. People who simply like the design. People going for a certain outward appearance, people who want an aesthetically pleasing minimalist camera strapped over their shoulder on display while out-and-about. Way cooler than a cellphone camera with much better image quality.It&#39;s a matter of marketing to taste. Not every driver wants the utilitarian station wagon. N

My gut tells me that a listener does not immerse in the material like a reader does, primarily because they&#39;re consuming while, driving, exercising, whatever... and when an interruption occurs, the stream might continue while the attention diverts, But at least audio books leave imagination some space.

I have tried a variation of this - listening to a show or a clip vs reading the transcript.  Turns out that I read much faster than a narrator talks, unless I slow down at a place to absorb the implication of what s/he said.  Given that difference, I do prefer reading to listening

However, on the question of hardcover/softcover books, I have completely switched to ebooks.  Convenience here is that it&#39;s all in my tablet, and doesn&#39;t weigh an ounce more, particularly if I am travelling.  It also turns out th

I think there is some merit to your generalization. I am guilty, not an avid reader but have listened to quite a few audio books, I even bought a few shelf trophies. There was a point I had a 2.5hr commute which I loathed until finding a few amazing audio books. Yes I was driving but my imagination existing in the world created by the author. I can&#39;t say I would have read(listened) to as many books without this option. Shoot I pick up my kids and they literally are like what did we miss.

Cliff Notes have existed for decades to service folks that can&#39;t be bothered yet were assigned real books as reading assignments in school. There&#39;s always shortcuts for people, and some people will spend their entire lives looking for the shortcut on everything, including reading. Which is sad to me, because reading is one of life&#39;s simplest and greatest pleasures, but I long ago realized that no matter how much it irks you, when it comes to things like this no amount of vitriol will change people&#39;s minds w

Actually, I regret catching Cliff&#39;s Notes in the crossfire. They had a specific purpose - to help students pass the tests. And I respect that. That goal is nicely contained, and honest,

Blinkist, on the other hand, is targeted directly at posers.

Agreed. That&#39;s why I think they belong solidly in the second spot. And that&#39;s not to condemn audiobooks to some sort of distant inferior position. I think they have a great deal of merit, and your succinct point is well taken.

Homer&#39;s Iliad and Odyssey were recited and heard for many hundreds of years before they were ever written down and read.  Spoken storytelling is at least as vivid, engaging and stimulating as reading *if* the story is worth hearing *and* narrated by a good storyteller.  There are some truly brilliant audiobook narrators but also far too many so inept that they cannot even read and pronounce their own language well or with understanding.

For sure. Don&#39;t mistake my objection for a complaint about the form. I&#39;m saying modern audiobooks are usually consumed in a setting where something else is commanding some of the attention preemptively. If your attention is fully on it, I think the difference is negligible.

My gut tells me that a listener does not immerse in the material like a reader does, primarily because they&#39;re consuming while, driving, exercising, whatever... and when an interruption occurs, the stream might continue while the attention diverts

People always say these things but, personally I often read while doing other things. Not driving obviously, but exercising, knitting, etc. And sometimes I continue reading while my mind wanders and I&#39;m not actually paying attention to what I&#39;m reading. When that

I have to back up my audio books a lot because I lose track of the story if I&#39;m doing something higher priority (like driving).

Given our rush-here, rush-there lifestyles of late, who has time to sit and read a book?

I used LOTR ebooks for my long travels since forever.

For topic 1 I love the idea that mankind enjoys story telling around the camp fire more than the written word. I will wait for the research and opinion folks to tell me how to think about that.:-)

The rise of AI readers is the more interesting topic to me though. I think we are six months away from being able to train a personal AI on my favorite voice actor and have that AI ag

Justice Brett Kavanaugh does not seem happy that his name has become synonymous with racist immigration enforcement. In September, the justice wrote that Hispanic residents’ “apparent ethnicity” could be a “relevant factor” in federal agents’ decision to stop them and demand proof of citizenship. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection promptly seized upon his opinion as a license to stop any Hispanic person on the basis of race—often with excessive, even sadistic force—and detain them until they proved their lawful presence. Law professor Anil Kalhan termed these encounters “Kavanaugh stops,” and the name swiftly caught on as evidence mounted that they had become standard practice across the country. Lawyers also provided courts with evidence that Kavanaugh had sanitized the reality of this practice to the point of fiction. The justice claimed that these were “brief investigative stops” and that any lawful resident would be “promptly” released. In truth, federal agents brutalized, kidnapped, and tormented people—including many U.S. citizens—simply because of their ethnicity, even after they asserted legal status.

Now it appears that Kavanaugh has some regrets. Last Tuesday, the justice backtracked from his previous position without quite acknowledging the retreat. He did so in a concurrence to the Supreme Court’s decision to block President Donald Trump’s deployment of the National Guard—a case that does not even directly concern “Kavanaugh stops.” In a footnote, he declared that race and ethnicity could not be “considerations” when officers make “immigration stops or arrests.” That directly conflicts with his earlier assertion that officers can use race and ethnicity as a “factor” when deciding whom to detain. The two positions cannot be reconciled. Yet Kavanaugh did not admit that he had changed his position; he simply pretended that the law in this area was “clear,” when he himself muddied it just months earlier.

On this week’s episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed this strange, tacit walk-back.

Dahlia Lithwick: It’s the icing on top of the Christmas cake that Brett Kavanaugh, in an unrelated discussion, gave himself the gift of forgiveness for his notorious “Kavanaugh stops” opinion.

Mark Joseph Stern: I think he is begging us to please cease and desist calling them “Kavanaugh stops.” This footnote is buried in the opinion and doesn’t really have anything to do with it. He just says: By the way, this conflict is about immigration stops. Then he segues into his view on the law around immigration stops, which he claims to be “longstanding and clear.” He writes: “The Fourth Amendment requires that immigration stops must be based on reasonable suspicion of illegal presence, stops must be brief, arrests must be based on probable cause, and officers must not employ excessive force. Moreover, the officers must not make interior immigration stops or arrests based on race or ethnicity.”

Wow! Immigration stops can’t be based on race? What a concept! A concept that you, Brett Kavanaugh, rejected just a few months ago, in September, in the Vasquez Perdomo case. Back then, you wrote that immigration stops could be at least partly based on race or ethnicity, and that a person’s appearance as Latino could be one reason for them to be stopped by immigration officers.

I wonder what has changed since September.

Well, I think he is trying to rid “Kavanaugh stops” from the discourse, which is never going to happen. And maybe he’s trying to send a message to the Trump administration to cool it down. Because now we have CBP Chief Greg Bovino declaring that agents can engage in racial profiling. Bovino has even said that every single person in this country has to walk around with proof of citizenship or else face arrest on suspicion of being undocumented. Kavanaugh is probably a little unnerved that all these violent, racist arrests and abductions are taking his name. He doesn’t want to be remembered by history as this great villain who greenlit the worst wave of violent racial profiling by the federal government in ages. But this footnote changes nothing. He cannot walk back what he has unleashed.

This goes to all the quibbles that we surfaced about the shadow docket when Vasquez Perdomo came out. Because if the justices are going to go ahead and reverse precedent about immigration stops, and then their decision gets operationalized by the Trump administration, they can’t say: Oh, sorry, we didn’t mean that. They certainly can’t do it in a case that does not directly relate back to “Kavanaugh stops.” So this is weird dicta in a random case that is trying to undo crappy but unfortunately enforceable doctrine. And Kavanaugh is just like: No, it’s the shadow docket—I can do what I want! I get a do-over. I get takesies-backsies. We’re now at full Etch A Sketch: I’m making law. I’m breaking law. I’m changing law.

I’ve seen some commentators praise Kavanaugh for sort of responding to criticism here. I do not think he gets any points. He did what he did in Vasquez Perdomo; he should have foreseen the consequences. Every intelligent observer understood what was going to happen when his opinion dropped in September. Now he seems to regret it—though he still hasn’t apologized directly or acknowledged that he was wrong, and is pretending that what he said earlier is consonant with what he’s saying now. Too little, too late.

            <h2>One State Supreme Court’s Lazy “Shortcut” Erases Civil Rights</h2>
            <p><strong>News and Politics - Slate Magazine | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/12/colorado-supreme-court-civil-rights-constitution.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This piece was originally published in the Behind the Bench newsletter on state constitutional law. Behind the Bench is published by the State Law Research Initiative.

It can be astonishing, and more than a little depressing, to see the lengths some courts go to avoid upholding basic constitutional rights. In June, I wrote about how the North Carolina Supreme Court’s Republican majority dilutes civil rights by requiring claimants to prove that challenged state actions, including discriminatory laws, are “unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.” The problem, as liberal Justice Anita Earls pointed out, is that “either the statute is consistent with the constitution or not,” and the “notion that you have to somehow establish that beyond a reasonable doubt makes no sense”—except, of course, as an excuse to erode civil rights.

Today, I bring your attention to the Colorado Supreme Court, which this month reaffirmed an inexplicable quirk of its excessive sentencing jurisprudence that preemptively extinguishes constitutional rights for entire categories of people. The court declares certain crimes to be “per se grave or serious,” which in practice means that no one convicted of such crimes can ever challenge their sentence, no matter its severity. The long-standing rule is both wholly illogical and blatantly unconstitutional (in the sense that it erases constitutional rights), but there is some good news: It appears that two justices are finally ready to, in their words, “deep six this concept.”

Colorado’s state constitution prohibits “cruel and unusual” punishment, including excessive or “disproportionate” prison terms. To assess excessive punishment claims, Colorado courts begin by comparing “the gravity or seriousness of the offense to the harshness of the penalty.” Normally, Colorado case law takes a relatively capacious view of how a crime’s “gravity” should be measured. It accounts not just for the offense and its elements but also for potentially mitigating factors such as whether the person “was an accessory, complicitor, or principal,” along with the person’s “culpability and motive.” In theory, this definition captures how personal characteristics (such as youth, disability, or addiction) and other circumstances (such as the role of group dynamics, poverty, or coercive relationships) might reduce someone’s culpability and factor into the constitutional analysis.

But for some offenses, the Colorado Supreme Court—and only the Colorado Supreme Court—has devised what it calls “the ‘per se’ shortcut.” Under this rule, the court “designate[s] certain crimes ‘per se grave or serious,’ ” which, the court says, renders a sentence all but “impervious to attack on proportionality grounds.” In other words, the court’s justices have decided they will not do their jobs for people who have certain convictions. Rather than actually assess excessive punishment claims in light of all the factors the law requires, they will just assume that these claims fail, giving prosecutors and legislators free rein to pursue the sort of punitive excess that has fueled mass incarceration for decades.

And it’s not like this rule has been reserved for what might intuitively be the most violent, high-culpability crimes. Robbery, for example, remains “per se grave or dangerous” even though the circumstances under which robberies take place vary wildly, as do the characteristics of the people who commit them (more on that below). Even worse, for nearly 30 years Colorado courts put all drug offenses, including mere possession, on this list until a “clarify[ing]” decision in 2019 finally changed that. (It took decades for the Colorado Supreme Court to realize that it “makes little sense to automatically treat the sale of a large quantity of cocaine by the leader of a drug cartel as equally grave or serious as the mere possession of a very small quantity of cocaine by a drug addict who is not involved in sale or distribution.”)

The court concedes that this “shortcut” is “unique to Colorado law” and that it “eliminates a longstanding layer of due process for criminal defendants.” Nonetheless, it remains on the books because it supposedly “saves time” and promotes “consistency.” I would submit that “saving time” is never a good reason to dispense with constitutional rights, but the court’s claims to efficiency are dubious in any case. Now, instead of properly analyzing its cruel and unusual clause, the court spends its time hopelessly trying to figure out what on earth “per se grave or serious” actually means and what offenses it applies to. With this rule in place, and with prosecutors thirsty to invoke it, the first part of every excessive punishment analysis turns into Tom Cruise cross-examining Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men: Q: “Grave Danger?” A: [Raises eyebrow] “Is there another kind?”

But there is a glimmer of hope. In People v. Kennedy, decided earlier this month, Justices Carlos Samour and Richard Gabriel “specially concurred” to advocate nixing the per se grave or serious shortcut.

In Kennedy, the court stood by its shortcut and upheld the 24-year prison term at issue. But it also held that vehicular homicide–DUI is not “per se grave or serious” because it is a strict liability crime with no specific intent element. “When a crime requires no proof of mens rea,” the court said, “it is impossible to evaluate the culpability of defendants convicted of the offense under every factual scenario.”

It is good that the court declined to expand the shortcut to cover a new offense, but the analytical problem here is that the same reasoning applies to crimes that do require proof of intent. To use an example mentioned above, the court thinks that people who commit robbery have sufficiently high culpability “under every factual scenario”—a conclusion that can only be understood as the willful ignorance of reality. Just a few other facts one might want to know: How old is the person? Are they a youth or emerging adult under age 25, and therefore more susceptible to peer pressure and impulsive decisionmaking? Was the person coerced by an abusive partner or authority figure? Did the person use a weapon and if so what kind? Was it a gun that turned out to be fake? Did the person act out of desperation? Was anyone physically harmed? The list goes on. To say that virtually no punishment could be unconstitutionally severe for all robbery convictions across all factual scenarios is absurd.

Justices Samour and Gabriel, at least, have started to push back. They argued that “easier and faster isn’t always better,” and that such “superficial proportionality review” is inappropriate when constitutional rights are at stake. Ultimately, they found “the drawbacks of per se designations far outweigh any purported benefits.”

Of course, Samour and Gabriel are right, but I’d add another critique: This constitutional “shortcut” makes absolutely no sense. Recall what it is ostensibly a shortcut to: comparing the gravity and/or seriousness of a criminal offense (including, per Colorado case law, characteristics of the offender) with the severity of the punishment imposed for it. In this context, neither “grave” nor “serious” is a bright-line, binary category. They exist along a spectrum. There is no being “not serious” up to a point before falling over a line into “seriousness.” This isn’t bankruptcy. This is a test about whether certain prison terms are too severe; one would think or at least hope that the Colorado Supreme Court is not perfectly fine with incarceration for wholly unserious crimes. To say that an offense is automatically “serious” or “grave,” therefore, means absolutely nothing, and it certainly doesn’t help understand if the resulting criminal punishment is fair.

What the court must mean, then, is that some crimes are sufficiently serious, but that only makes sense relative to the punishment imposed—a fact irrelevant to the court’s per se designation.

Perhaps I am thinking too hard about this. Such an arbitrary, court-created rule—born out of some combination of cowardly deference to extreme punishments and sheer laziness, and that even prosecutors agree is “a weird concept anyway”—doesn’t deserve that much credit. The point is: The Colorado Supreme Court’s rule, it turns out, is less a shortcut and more a barrier to protecting fundamental constitutional rights that should be torn down.

Only days remain until Zohran Mamdani ascends the throne of New York City, and nearly all his great opponents have given up. Andrew Cuomo, vanquished. Financier Bill Ackman, reduced to congratulations for the mayor-elect and even offers of support. Donald Trump, singing his praises after inviting him over to hang. Maybe the great socialist boogeyman isn’t so scary after all.

But not everyone is in the mood for total defeat. In a recent interview with Fox News, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman in Long Island announced a novel approach to combat the threat of socialism bearing down from America’s largest city: He is building a wall.

Mamdani, he said, “talks like he’s pro-criminal, not pro-victim.” And as such, in a last-ditch effort, Blakeman is going up with a wall on the border of Queens and Nassau counties, where New York City ends and what most think of as Long Island begins.

This makes plenty of sense. All truly great civilizations have a signature wall. China, for example. Also Donald Trump’s America. So why not Long Island? And this is not some archaic cinderblock and mortar contraption: It’s a top-of-the-line, high-tech fabrication.

“We are installing technology along the border of New York City that will read license plates, that will have facial recognition, that will have video cameras,” Blakeman said in late November. “Nassau Exec Bruce Blakeman plans a wall of surveillance at NYC border after Mamdani win,” boasted the New York Post. So maybe not a Great Wall of China exactly, but certainly a wall with Chinese characteristics, given that an estimated 90 percent of surveillance cameras are made in China.

I appreciate the great works. But my request for a tour of the construction site was shot down; the county exec’s office gave me the elliptical redirect to watch Fox News. No one could tell me whether the wall was up or not. And the clock was ticking. So I headed for the borderlands, to watch the county batten down the hatches for the impending arrival of pro-criminal socialism, or else to delight in the last few days of open borders, Long Island–style.

I spoke with numerous sources in Long Island politics to pin down just where this wall might begin. The Queens–Nassau border is no small tract. To make matters worse, the border is effectively a stretch of highway, the Cross Island Parkway.

I began my tour at Bellerose Terrace, which I was told might be singled out as high priority. I got off at Jericho Turnpike. No surveillance wall in sight.

I stopped by the Bellerose Village Hall and asked for directions to the wall. A very kind woman working behind the desk straightened me out: I was being too literal.

“I think they’re talking about cameras,” she told me. But even so, she couldn’t point me to any new ones. “We haven’t seen any of that yet. They didn’t tell the village anything.”

The wall would be a crowning achievement of Blakeman’s tenure as county executive in Nassau. He has, in some sense, made Long Island into one of the world’s policing laboratories. In August, the county unveiled a $70 million police training village, replete with New York City–style homes, a church, a courtroom, a bar, and even a Long Island Rail Road–style station, where police run around doing what look a lot like combat exercises. Blakeman has also chartered a militia, hiring and deputized armed citizens for mobilization during emergency declarations. And now the wall.

Some would say that astronomical financial commitments to policing have gotten results. A 2024 U.S. News and World Report study found that Nassau County was one of the safest counties in America. Others would say that that same survey also found that the rest of the New York metropolitan area—aka crime-infested hellscape teeming with socialist policies—was similarly safe. Ten of the top 25 safest counties in the country were in New York metro, including Queens County and Brooklyn. The next year Blakeman announced even more police hires, and no more tax hikes to pay for them.

I got back on the Cross Island Parkway and headed for Elmont. This was another town, I was told, that had been identified for wall construction.

I saw a Nassau County Police Department squad car and talked to the officer inside. “That is coming from way more higher up than me,” he told me, of the wall implementation. He, too, was at a loss as to where I could identify some of these new cameras. “I mean, they could be up in any of the towers,” he said. Street lights and telephone poles and electrical wires were all fair game.

This abstracted wall, hung high in civilian infrastructure and currently invisible, couldn’t come at a more important time. With Elise Stefanik summarily bounced from the New York gubernatorial race after a swift falling out with Republican national political leadership, Blakeman is now likely to be the Republican standard bearer, in a race Republicans continue to tell themselves they can actually win because of the unpopularity of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, the fantastic ineptitude of the New York Democratic Party, and some anti-socialist backlash to the Mamdani ascendance. Republicans love to point out Blakeman won his most recent race by close to 12 percentage points in a county with over 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. Trump has already endorsed him.

The result of Blakeman’s police push is that, obviously, the police budget is gargantuan. The 2025 budget of $4.2 billion doesn’t raise property taxes for the fourth year in a row, even though it adds over 50 new cops; over $1 billion of that is going to the police. He has boasted that he has hired 600 law enforcement officers and vetoed over $150 million in tax hikes, which would seem to spell financial trouble in the long run.

When asked how he would foot the bill for it all, Blakeman told Fox News it would come from civil asset forfeitures, an extremely controversial practice that allows law enforcement to seize property—including cash, cars, and assets like homes—from people merely suspected of being linked to crime, even without being charged or convicted. Some might say that they were going to pay for the wall by stealing from people in New York City.

I drove down to Valley Stream. Same story, no construction cones, no earth-moving, no camera crews. I stopped by another Nassau County Police Department office, where they instructed me to call the public affairs contact, who told me not only that he didn’t think they’d even started yet, but that he wasn’t “even sure they’re even gonna be allowed to do that.”

So maybe it was open borders after all. What else was there to do? I got back on the Cross Island Parkway, drove it north and south, crossed freely into Nassau and back into Queens. I counted preexisting security cameras as I went: three on a large gray tower on the west side of the parkway. One on decommissioned road work sign. One on a streetlight near the off-ramp. One more on another gray tower. Did I commit crimes all the way? Wouldn’t you like to know.

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Today&#39;s Bork comes courtesy of an exhibition dedicated to the UK street artist Banksy and demonstrates that &quot;Limitless&quot; does not always apply to Windows Activation.

A number of Register readers ventured to an exhibition devoted to the artist in London&#39;s South Kensington and, among the exhibits, came across some touchscreens inviting further investigation of the artist&#39;s work.

However, the interactive screens are running Windows, and Windows is doing what Windows does best: displaying an awkward message. We suspect it&#39;s what the artist, famed for subversive and satirical artwork cropping up in the most unexpected of places, would have wanted.

Windows complaining about activation can occur if there are licensing issues, or if there has been a hardware change that is enough to send Microsoft&#39;s finest into a cycle of despair. Responding to the request of the operating system to dive into the settings to deal with the issue is not something the average visitor will be able to do, and we suspect that the artist themself is likely far too busy creating a graffiti project lampooning the tech giant&#39;s obsession with AI to care much about a Microsoft whoopsie.

We asked the organizers of the exhibition what had befallen the screens (surely a hardware change; an exhibition titled &quot;Limitless&quot; by an artist whose works have sold for millions is unlikely to have been limited by the cost of a Windows license.) As yet, we&#39;ve had no response.

That said, we would not put it past the artist to make some Windows borkage part of the exhibition itself. A terse message from Microsoft popping up over some carefully curated screens seems somehow appropriate and could only be improved by a visualization of a developer looking glumly on as Copilot churns out code that might or might not work.

The tech giants&#39; ongoing obsession with all things AI is ripe for satire. The billions being spent on data centers to feed the voracious appetite of the technology means there is plenty of empty wall space available for something suitably scathing. Perhaps the impending pop of a bubble… ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/30/how_nvidia_survives_ai_bubble_pop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, Nvidia’s revenues are dominated by hardware sales. But when the AI bubble inevitably pops, the GPU giant will become the single most important software company in the world.

Since ChatGPT kicked off the AI arms race in late 2022, Nvidia has shipped millions of GPUs predominantly for use in AI training and inference.

That’s a lot of chips that are going to be left idle when the music stops and the finance bros come to the sickening realization that using a fast-depreciating asset as collateral for multi-billion dollar loans wasn’t such a great idea after all.

However, anyone suggesting those GPUs will be rendered worthless when the dust settles is naive.

GPUs may be synonymous with AI by this point, but they’re much more versatile than that. As a reminder, GPU stands for graphics processing unit. These chips were originally designed to speed up video game rendering, which, by the late ‘90s, was quickly becoming too computationally intensive for the single-threaded CPUs of the time.

As it turns out, the same thing that made GPUs great at pushing pixels also made them particularly well suited for other parallel workloads — you know, like simulating the physics of a hydrogen bomb going critical. Many of Nvidia’s most powerful accelerators — chips like the H200 or GB300 — have long since ditched the graphics pipeline to make room for more vector and matrix math accelerators required in HPC and AI.

If an app can be parallelized, there’s a good chance it’ll benefit from GPU acceleration — if you have the software to do it. This is why there are so few GPU companies. A GPU needs to be broadly programmable; an AI ASIC only needs to do inference or training well.

Since introducing CUDA, its low-level GPU programming environment and API interface, in 2007, Nvidia has built hundreds of software libraries, frameworks, and micro-services to accelerate any and every workload it can think of.

The libraries, collectively marketed under the CUDA-X banner, cover everything from computational fluid dynamics and electronic design automation to drug discovery, computational lithography, material design, and even quantum computing. The company also has frameworks for visualizing digital twins and robotics.

For now, AI has turned out to be the most lucrative of these, but when the hype train runs out of steam, there’s still plenty that can be done with the hardware.

For example, Nvidia built cuDF and integrated it into the popular RAPIDS data science and analytics framework to accelerate SQL databases or Pandas, attaining a 150x speed up in the process. It’s no wonder database giant Oracle is so keen on Nvidia’s hardware. Any compute it can’t rent out to OpenAI for a profit, it can use to accelerate its database and analytics platforms.

Nvidia doesn’t offer a complete solution, and that’s by design. Some of its libraries are open sourced, while others are made available as more comprehensive frameworks and micro-services. These form the building blocks by which software developers can use to accelerate their workloads, with a growing number of them being tied back to revenue-generating licensing schemes.

The only problem: up to this point, these benefits required buying or leasing a pricy GPU and then integrating these frameworks into your code base or waiting for an independent software vendor (ISV) to do it for you.

But when the bubble bursts and pricing on GPUs drops through the floor, anyone that can find a use for these stranded assets stands to make a fortune. Nvidia has already built the software necessary to do it — the ISVs just need to integrate and sell it.

In this context, Nvidia’s steady transition from building low-level software libraries aimed at developers to selling enterprise-focused micro-services starts to make a lot of sense. The lower the barrier to adoption, the easier it is to sell hardware and the subscriptions that go with it.

It appears that Nvidia may even open this software stack to a broader ecosystem of hardware vendors. GPUzilla has begun transitioning to a disaggregated architecture that breaks up workloads and offloads them to third-party silicon.

This week, Nvidia completed a $5 billion investment in Intel. The x86 giant is currently developing a prefill accelerator to speed up prompt processing for large language model inference. Meanwhile, Nvidia signed a deal last week to acqui-hire rival chip vendor Groq, though it remains to be seen how the GPU slinger intends to integrate the company&#39;s tech long term.

In addition to its home-grown software platforms, Nvidia has made several strategic software acquisitions over the past few years, acquiring Run:AI’s Kubernetes-based GPU orchestration and Deci AI’s model optimization platforms in 2024. Earlier this month, Nvidia added SchedMD’s Slurm workload management platform, which is widely deployed across AMD, Nvidia, and Intel-based clusters for HPC and AI workloads, ensuring a profit even if you don’t buy its hardware.

To be clear, generative AI as we know it today isn’t going away. The cash that’s fueled AI development over the past three years may evaporate, but the underlying technology, imperfect as it is, is still valuable enough that enterprises will keep using it.

Rather than chasing the mirage that is artificial general intelligence, applications of the tech will be far more mundane.

In fact, many of Nvidia’s more comprehensive micro-services make extensive use of domain-specific AI models for things like weather forecasting or physics simulation.

When the dot-com bubble burst, people didn’t stop building web services or buying switches and routers. This time around, people aren’t going to stop consuming AI services either. They’ll just be one of several reasons to buy GPUs. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Leaders from Dell, Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Snowflake have released their 2026 predictions for AI in the workplace, and they agree that safeguards for AI agents and ROI are the top priorities for their customers.

Dell CTO John Roese sees the future of AI living on premises where organizations have more control over security, governance, and cost. He said AI tools like agents and chatbots have been rushed into production without sufficient policies in place.

“This is not just risky; it’s unsustainable,” he writes. “By 2026, the demand for robust frameworks and private environments to ensure stability and control will be undeniable. Running models locally—on-premises or in controlled AI factories—will become the norm to provide a stable foundation and insulate organizations from external disruptions. But this is more than a prediction. It’s an urgent appeal.”

While Roese said solid ROI has begun to emerge among large companies capable of integrating AI, ServiceNow said in 2026 AI will be defined by the value it brings to the bottom line.

“That’s the only question that matters,” said Heath Ramsey, ServiceNow’s group vice president of AI product platform management in his video predictions. “Leaders face a simple directive to turn AI investments into measurable value, fast.”

Ramsey urged companies to start small and look for the task that is “bleeding time and money,” then fix it end-to-end with AI. But to make that effective, he turned the conversation back to governance.

“You need one entry point with clear policies and approvals,” he said. “A secure foundation for your AI is how you turn an isolated win into a repeatable pattern that scales across your business.”

In terms of governing AI agents, Snowflake CISO Brad Jones says the job in front of his counterparts is to walk the line between putting up guardrails around their behavior while leaving room for operators to experiment and innovate, which is a job for data governance.

“There are likely to be many documents or data sets in a company that don’t have permissions correctly locked down,” he says, in the company’s 2026 AI predictions. “If you feed that into generative or agentic AI, the tool may expose data that it shouldn’t.”

It&#39;s not just internal productivity at stake either, according to Saleforce. It is each company&#39;s image and reputation in the marketplace, predicts Adam Evans, EVP & GM, Salesforce AI.

“By 2026, brands won’t be defined by logos or slogans; they will be defined by their AI. These customizable agents will become the ultimate brand ambassadors: smart, personalized, and continuously evolving with every exchange. In this new reality, the divide will be absolute, and the brands that win will be the ones whose AI delivers a consistently exceptional experience, and everyone else will fall behind.” .

Microsoft sees trust as the essential ingredient to deploying AI agents correctly, according to its 2026 prediction.

Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security, said for humans to rely on agents to carry out tasks or for decision-making, the agents need a clear identity, limits on accessing systems, protocols for managing data they create, and ways to protect that information from attackers.

“Every agent should have similar security protections as humans, to ensure agents don’t turn into ‘double agents’ carrying unchecked risk,” she said in the prediction paper.

The largest software company in the world also offered a hot take on hardware, saying AI growth is not just dependent on who has the biggest data center. Industry veteran Mark Russinovich, chief technology officer for Microsoft Azure, said 2026 is about putting compute to work efficiently.

“The most effective AI infrastructure will pack computing power more densely across distributed networks,” Russinovich says.

He predicts that 2026 will see “the rise of flexible, global AI systems — a new generation of linked AI &#39;superfactories&#39; — that will drive down costs and improve efficiency.”

Microsoft unveiled the first of its linked AI superclusters in Wisconsin this September, which boasts 1.2 million square feet of floor space and thousands of interconnected Nvidia GB200s in a 337 MW barn capable of processing 865,000 tokens per second. It plans to join that facility with other AI superfactories it builds as those come on line.

Back at Dell – the global market leader in the sale of x86 servers and numerous categories of high end commercial data storage used in AI systems – Roese said the widespread deployment of AI hardware redraws the goal lines for resilience and disaster recovery in 2026.

“The focus shifts from simply backing up systems to ensuring AI capabilities remain functional, even if primary systems go offline,” he predicts. “This involves protecting vectorized data and other unique AI artifacts, allowing the intelligence of the system to persist through any disruption. Achieving this requires innovation across the entire AI value chain – from data protection and cybersecurity companies to core AI technology providers.” ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Bork can happen to the best of us, but flashing one&#39;s undercarriage at the boss of a compliance company is less than ideal, particularly at 35,000 feet in the air.

Qualys CEO Sumedh Thakar snapped a pair of whoopsies that popped up on the screen of his in-flight entertainment (IFE) system earlier this year: one is a typical web server fail. The other suggests MySQL connection difficulties.

Aircraft IFE systems are not connected directly to the airplane&#39;s avionics, which is handy, considering that Thakar&#39;s screen showed a decidedly ancient version of Apache in use. In this case, version 2.0.42.

It has been almost 13 years since security support for version 2.0 of the Apache HTTP Server ended. The final release was in July 2013, by which time the team had moved on to bigger and better things. The IFE, however, has not. In fact, version 2.0.42 first appeared in September 2002.

To put that in context, Windows XP had been released just the year before, and movie-goers were being delighted by Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. Apple&#39;s iPhone had yet to trouble shoppers, although its iPod had been on the shelves for almost a year. Indeed, it was the first BlackBerry smartphone (the 5810) that was the phone to have for the irritating professional.

Time has moved on. BlackBerry is no more, having been thoroughly stomped on by, among other things, Apple&#39;s iPhone, and the rolling hills of the Windows XP default desktop are more likely to trigger waves of nostalgia than anything else. However, in the never-updated world of the IFE, 2002 lives on.

And then there are those MySQL connection problems, which hint that this might be a Thales system. The company, after all, declares that its IFE experience makes for &quot;a journey filled with unique experiences.&quot;

We&#39;re not sure if running a long-obsolete version of Apache HTTP Server and filling a screen with connection errors is quite the unique experience the passenger has in mind. However, considering Airbus&#39;s recent brush with avionic borkage, perhaps replacing the in-flight movies with a MySQL horror show or Apache thriller isn&#39;t such a bad thing after all. ®

            <h2>Korean telco failed at femtocell security, exposed customers to snooping and fraud</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/30/kt_telecom_femtocell_security_fail/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT has found that local carrier Korea Telecom (KT) deployed thousands of badly secured femtocells, leading to an attack that enabled micropayments fraud and snooping on customers’ communications – maybe for years.

Femtocells are customer premises equipment which include a small mobile base station and use a wired broadband service for backhaul into a carrier’s network. Carriers typically deploy them in areas where mobile network signals are weak to improve coverage in and around customers’ homes.

KT deployed thousands of the devices, all of which used the same certificate to authenticate to the carrier’s network. According to analysis by Korean infosec academic and IEEE Fellow Yongdae Kim, the femtocells had no root password, stored keys in plaintext, and were remotely accessible because SSH was enabled.

Attackers could therefore waltz in and retrieve the certificate, then use it to clone a femtocell that KT would treat as a legitimate device and happily connect to its network. And because the cert was set to expire after ten years, miscreants who understood these vulnerabilities had a long period in which to clone a femtocell and use it for evil. The Ministry’s report suggests attackers used one fake femtocell for ten months across 2024 and 2025.

The report also found that KT customers’ devices would automatically connect to a cloned femtocell, and that attackers could read those customers’ text messages and learn what numbers they called.

Korea Telecom operates a micropayments service that allows its customers to pay for digital content using SMS messages. In September, the carrier investigated some of its customers’ bills and detected the use of cloned femtocells in transactions valued at $169,000.

The Ministry’s report says 368 customers fell victim to the micropayment scam.

Yongdae Kim wrote that the $169,000 haul “is absurdly small for this infrastructure sophistication.”

“Rational inference: large-scale data collection was primary. Someone&#39;s greed exposed it. Without micropayment fraud, undetectable,” he added, suggesting that miscreants running cloned femtocells may have used their ability to access customers’ phones for surveillance.

That theory appears plausible for two reasons. One is that KT only has data on payments dating back to July 2024. The Ministry’s report therefore states it is not a definitive account of femtocell-related problems.

The other is that Korean police today published the results of their investigation into the matter, which turned up one fake femtocell that used a key installed in a device used on a Korean military base in 2019, and which went missing in 2020.

The police investigation found multiple cloned femtocells, plus evidence of a large gang running them. Police arrested 13 alleged participants and haven’t ruled out that the gang got some of the information it needed to run its ops from a previous attack on Korea Telecom that saw BPFDoor malware leak info from the carrier for three years starting in 2022. The investigation also alleges the perps went “war-driving” while running an illegal femtocell, to find more phones they could access. One of the arrested men tried to use a fake femtocell at Incheon Airport, on the same day someone else tried to export the cracked hardware to China.

The alleged mastermind of the gang remains at large but is the subject of an Interpol Red Notice.

South Korea’s government has reacted by insisting that KT let customers quit their contracts without penalty.

South Korea is currently a hotspot for bad security. Local e-tailer Coupang, and SK Telecom , are both in trouble for leaking millions of customer records. The nation has also endured a massive camera hijacking operation that grossly invaded some citizens’ privacy, and faces constant attacks and provocation from North Korea. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UPDATED Meta will acquire made-in-China AI outfit Manus and harness its “general agent” technology across its products.

Manus debuted in March 2025 and immediately pitched itself as a leap beyond generative AI chatbots, which it characterizes as best suited to summarizing information and answering questions.

The outfit promotes its own services as enabling “wide research and context-aware reasoning to produce actionable results in the format you need.”

To illustrate that promise, Manus offers a scenario in which users ask its tech to select the best candidate for an job by evaluating job applications stored in a .ZIP file. Manus can open that archive, read the files it contains, evaluate them according to user-defined criteria, then produce a document that ranks candidates by suitability for the role.

The service does that in its own “computer” – a cloud-hosted VM – that Manus says “operates as a multi-agent system powered by several distinct models.”

Manus was created by a Chinese company called Butterfly Effect, which also operates an entity in Hong Kong an recently moved its headquarters to Singapore. The outfit recently claimed to have $100 million annual recurring revenue just eight months after launch.

Meta’s announcement of the deal states: “Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide” and reveals the made-in-China company’s staff will join the social networking giant. The value of the deal was not disclosed.

Manus hailed its acquisition as “validation of our pioneering work with General AI Agents.”

“Our solution is driving value for millions of users worldwide today. With time, we hope to expand this subscription to the millions of businesses and billions of people on Meta’s platforms,” Manus’s post states, before adding a canned quote from CEO Xiao Hong who said joining the Zuckosphere represents a chance to “build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made.”

“We’re excited about what the future holds with Meta and Manus working together and we will continue to iterate the product and serve users that have defined Manus from the beginning.”

Meta boss-for-life Mark Zuckerberg wants to build a “superintelligence” service, which he defines as software “that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them.”

In pursuit of that goal, Meta has committed to at least $70 billion of capital expenditure in 2025 and expects to spend more next year, much of it going towards building datacenters to host AI workloads. While the company credits AI with helping it to improve advertising revenue, Meta does not currently offer a paid AI service but is reportedly testing a subscription product called “Meta AI+”.

Manus seems a good fit for that offering, and perhaps also a step towards superintelligence.

The deal is the fifth AI-related acquisition Meta has made in 2025, following its purchases of AI startups PlayAI and WaveForms, accelerator developer Rivos, and wearable device developer Limitless. The social networking giant has also dangled eight-figure compensation packages to lure top AI talent to the company. ®

to note a report from Nikkei in which Meta said Manus will sever ties to Chinese investors and will not operate in China.

The pair targeted several companies with ALPHV / BlackCat ransomware and extorted $1.2 million in Bitcoin.

Two former employees at cybersecurity firms — one of whom was a ransomware negotiator — have pleaded guilty to carrying out a series of ransomware attacks in 2023. The Department of Justice announced the guilty pleas on Tuesday, saying 40-year-old Ryan Goldberg and 36-year-old Kevin Martin extorted $1.2 million in Bitcoin from a medical device company and targeted several others.

Goldberg, Martin, and an unnamed co-conspirator were indicted for the attacks in October, which involved using ALPHV / BlackCat ransomware to encrypt and steal data from their victims. As reported by the Chicago Sun-Times, Martin and the third conspirator worked as ransomware negotiators at Digital Mint, a cybercrime and incident response company, while Goldberg was an incident response manager at Sygnia Cybersecurity Services.

ALPHV / BlackCat is a hacker group that uses a ransomware-as-a-service model, with the developers who maintain the malware often taking a cut of stolen funds from the cybercriminals who use it to target victims. In 2023, the FBI developed a decryption tool designed to recover data from victims of ALPHV / BlackCat, which has been linked to high-profile attacks on companies like Bandai Namco, MGM Resorts, Reddit, and UnitedHealth Group.

The DOJ’s indictment claims Goldberg, Martin, and the co-conspirator used the ransomware in an attempt to extort millions of dollars from victims throughout the US, including a pharmaceutical company, a doctor’s office, an engineering company, and a drone manufacturer.

“These defendants used their sophisticated cybersecurity training and experience to commit ransomware attacks — the very type of crime that they should have been working to stop,” Assistant Attorney General A. Tysen Duva of the DOJ’s Criminal Division says in a statement. “The Department of Justice is committed to using all tools available to identify and arrest perpetrators of ransomware attacks wherever we have jurisdiction.”

Goldberg and Martin pleaded guilty to one count of “conspiracy to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by extortion.” Their sentencing is scheduled for March 12th, 2026, where they’ll face up to 20 years in prison.

﻿Its pocketable clamshell design opens to reveal a 8.01-inch OLED display inside.

Folding OLED displays are still most commonly found on premium smartphones and laptops, but One-Netbook is bringing the tech to a new gaming device. Its new OneXSugar Wallet is reminiscent of the company’s folding OneXSugar Sugar 1 handheld that launched earlier this year. But instead of two screens, the Wallet handheld unfolds to reveal just one big 8.01-inch OLED screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, as spotted by Retro Handhelds.

The OneXSugar Wallet was announced on China’s Weibo yesterday, but with few details about its features and capabilities. That folding OLED screen has a resolution of 2480 x 1860 pixels, and the handheld will be powered by an unspecified “Qualcomm gaming platform flagship processor,” but its performance and emulation capabilities are unknown.

Based on photos and a video released by One-Netbook, the OneXSugar Wallet will feature a standard set of controls including asymmetrical thumbsticks, four action buttons, and a D-pad situated on either side of the lower half of its display. There are also shoulder buttons and triggers on the back of the handheld and a pair of front-facing speakers flanking the top half of the screen. The biggest question is how much will the handheld cost? There are already $1,000 handheld consoles, but folding screen devices like the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 are priced closer to $2,000. Will gamers embrace the OneXSugar Wallet if it’s similarly expensive? Maybe it’s called the Wallet for a reason.

Motors in the wheel and triggers provide resistance in response to what’s happening in-game.

GameSir is no stranger to experimenting with unique controller features — its Tarantula Pro can automatically swap its face button labels to accommodate alternate layouts, and its Pocket 1 clamps Game Boy controls onto your phone. What sets its new Swift Drive controller apart is a small steering wheel located smack-dab in the middle of the gamepad that’s connected to what GameSir calls the “world’s smallest direct drive motor” providing force feedback effects for racing games.

Pricing and availability hasn’t been announced yet, but GameSir has revealed plenty of details about the Swift Drive’s features and functionality. The steering wheel uses a “high-precision” Hall effect encoder with “up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering.” Its movement can be adjusted between 30 and 1080 degrees of rotation, and the wheel itself can be removed and swapped with alternate styles. Hall effect sensors are also used in the Swift Drive’s joysticks and buttons, while its triggers are further enhanced with individual haptic motors to simulate the feeling of ABS braking and wheel slip.

The Swift Drive will rely on a 2.4GHz wireless connection to your gaming machine and, even with reactive RGB lighting effects and its various haptic motors, battery life is estimated to be between 20 to 30 hours between charges.

For racing sim fans not as concerned with portability, GameSir’s new Turbo Drive provides a more traditional steering wheel and pedal setup with a yoke-style wheel that clamps to a desk. Like the smaller Swift Drive controller it features 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, Hall effect sensors in the wheel’s encoder, throttle controls, and shifting paddles, plus extensive customizability including limiting the wheel’s rotation. Its most unique feature is a built-in turbine fan that simulates airflow and enhances the feeling of speed. With the fan on, the Turbo Drive’s battery life is estimated to be around 15 hours, but turning it off will let you play for up to 50 hours before a charge is needed.

Winter storms across the country are bringing heavy snow, rain, and — in some cases, as this Californian who briefly lost power a few days ago can attest — outages. If you want to prepare, Anker’s 521 PowerHouse can help keep your essential devices running and it’s on sale for $129.99 ($120 off) at Amazon. That is about $2 shy of its all-time low price and the best price we’ve seen since Black Friday.

What’s impressive about the 256Wh power station is the range of devices it can handle. You can charge smaller electronics like phones, tablets, cameras, and laptops multiple times using its two USB-A ports and single USB-C port, but it also features two AC outlets and a car socket. That means it can power low-wattage appliances such as a mini fridge, portable fan or heater (on low), electric blanket, and other gear that draws up to 300 watts. You don’t need to worry it’ll die, either — Anker says the battery is designed to last up to 10 years and offers a five-year warranty.

There are a few thoughtful extras, too. Small and weighing about eight pounds — roughly the same as a gallon of water — it’s relatively easy to carry thanks to its integrated handle. Anker also includes a built-in display for checking remaining battery life at a glance, along with a car charging cable. And if you’re outdoors or dealing with an extended outage, you can even recharge it using compatible solar panels — though you’ll need to buy those separately.

The future of the Biden admin’s Cyber Trust Mark Program is in doubt after its lead administrator quit.

The US Cyber Trust Mark Program, an Energy Star–style certification for smart home security, could be winding down less than a year after it launched. Safety testing company UL Solutions has announced that it is stepping down as the program’s lead administrator, just a few months after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began investigating it over ties to China.

The Cyber Trust Mark Program hasn’t been officially shut down yet, but the loss of its lead administrator leaves it in limbo. It wouldn’t be the first security program the FCC axed this year. In November, the FCC rolled back cybersecurity regulations for telecom companies put in place after the 2024 Salt Typhoon hack. FCC Chair Brendan Carr also began scrutinizing testing labs earlier this year and decertified so-called “bad labs” based in China.

The Cyber Trust Mark Program was announced in 2023 under the Biden administration as a way to certify that smart home devices meet certain cybersecurity standards, with approved products marked with a shield icon on their packaging, much like an Energy Star sticker. It launched at CES 2025, but the certification mark hasn’t started appearing on any products yet. The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the program’s future.

I can’t grow anything. Multiple attempts to create a cottage garden, first in Idaho and now in South Carolina, have brought disappointment. Both are challenging climates, but where others have succeeded, I’ve been left with little more than a pile of cherry tomatoes for my vast efforts (those things are bulletproof).

I’d all but given up on the idea of ever successfully growing my own food — I can’t even keep those pots of herbs you buy at the grocery store alive for more than a week — until I met the Gardyn Studio 2.

A smart indoor garden, the Gardyn Studio 2 is an automated growing platform that deploys AI to do what I failed to do: watch over and properly take care of my plants.

Foolproof indoor gardeningEasy set-up and minimal maintenanceThe Kelby AI assistant is helpfulSubscription includes free plants

ExpensiveCostly monthly subscription Grow light too bright for most rooms

It works through a combination of hydroponic watering, automated lighting, a camera that captures plant images, and algorithms that analyze the plants’ growth stages and adapt. An AI assistant called Kelby, which requires a subscription, manages the light and water cycles, sends alerts when I need to intervene, and processes all the data from the Gardyn’s sensors and camera to help your plants grow.

It’s an impressive, albeit very expensive, system. In the three months I’ve had it in my home, I’ve grown a sunflower, a full kohlrabi, lots of basil, lettuce, green beans, chard, and some other tasty exotic veggies I’d never heard of. I am currently working on strawberries, cherry tomatoes, lavender, jalapeño peppers, and buttercrunch lettuce — in December, in my dining room. This is why I love technology.

Everyone loves the idea of growing their own food, but few of us have the space, time, or expertise to dedicate to the task. It’s a bit like baking; it’s a lot harder than it looks.

Gardyn Studio 2 is designed to address these problems. It costs $549, with an optional $25 monthly subscription (or $19 a month with a two-year plan). That gets you Kelby’s assistance, new seed pods every month to keep your Gardyn growing, and discounts on plant food, among other perks.

My Gardyn started producing within 6 weeks, and I was able to cut my family of four’s weekly produce buying in half, easily covering the monthly subscription. Plus, I really enjoy that every time I go to get something from the Gardyn, it’s fresh and ready, not wilted in my fridge. I’ve also found I generate far less food waste.

The Studio 2 is Gardyn’s newest model and is a smaller version of its flagship product, the $900 Gardyn Home. The Studio has space for 16 plants (compared to 30 on the Home) and is a redesign of the first Studio, which launched in 2024. The Studio concept addresses customer feedback that the Gardyn Home produced too much produce for smaller households to keep up with, and its footprint was too large, founder and CEO FX Rouxel told me.

The Studio 2 uses new columns that require less maintenance, an upgraded camera with higher resolution, and a wider field of view to better monitor its charges. There is also a new sunrise/sunset lighting mode for the large 60-LED lamp that helps the garden grow.

The columns are what make Gardyn unique among indoor plant systems (none of which I’ve tried). It’s a patented vertical growing, hydroponic system that Rouxel calls “the most compact way to grow food at home.”

Proprietary yCube seed pods that use rockwool as a growing medium fit into the columns, which sit on a large water tank with a pump inside and an attractive wooden lid. The strip of LED lights with a camera built in sits in front of the plants, facing the wall (so it’s not going to be snapping pictures of you, only the plants, every 30 minutes).

Gardyn comes with straps to anchor the system to the wall, as fully grown plants could cause it to topple. A button at the bottom lets you turn the light on or off quickly, and you can also schedule it in the Gardyn app.

Assembling Gardyn was straightforward and took about 20 minutes. It came with a starter kit of 16 seed pods called the Chef’s Favorites, including herbs such as thyme, basil, and lemon balm, as well as celery, collard greens, green tatsoi, spinach, salanova, and yellow chard. There was also a sunflower.

I inserted the pods using the app to determine the best position for each and sat back and let Gardyn do the rest. Other than topping up the water based on Kelby’s prompts in the app and adding some plant food, I didn’t have to do anything else until four weeks in, when I was told to clean the tank and check the roots.

I am growing strawberries, cherry tomatoes, and lavender — in December, in my dining room. This is why I love technology

One challenge of Gardyn is finding a suitable spot for it. At 1.4 square feet wide and about 5 feet tall, it takes up quite a lot of space. While the kitchen would be the logical place, the light is too bright for my open plan space. You can adjust the timing of the light, but Gardyn recommends 14-16 hours of full light per day. I ended up putting it in the dining room just off the kitchen.

Once the plants started to bud, Kelby told me to trim a few to encourage stronger plants, and within a couple of weeks, I had my first harvest of young sprouts, which made for a delicious, if unusual, salad.

Harvesting got more labor-intensive as things started to really grow; the green tatsoi was going like gangbusters and started blocking the light to some of the herbs. I did a bit of strategic reconfiguring of the pods, along with lots of harvesting — it was great as a bok choy substitute.

I can see why people wanted a smaller Gardyn, although I think if I had more plants I used regularly, it would be a bit easier.

I did have two pods that never sprouted, and my bull’s blood beets didn’t seem to be doing much, so I swapped them out for three new pods, including green beans, cherry tomatoes, and strawberries. (These needed to be started outside of the Gardyn as they can’t take plant food until they sprout). Those will obviously take longer to proffer their goods, although I got at least one serving of green beans within a month.

It will take some fine-tuning to determine which plant lineup works best for my needs. At this point, I’m leaning towards a combination of herbs, salad greens, cherry tomatoes, and chard. I can see that once you have a solid rotation that fits with your culinary habits, Gardyn could replace most of your fresh produce purchases.

I’m also experimenting with transplanting the mature plants into my garden. However, out there, they will be at my mercy and away from the watchful eye of Kelby. I was surprised to find Gardyn’s AI assistant was very useful. It basically did what I have failed to do in my time as a master plant killer — keep an eye on and take care of the plants, roping me in to help every now and then to add water, plant food, thin the sprouts, harvest, prune roots, and other actions to encourage growth.

Now, if you are more attentive and attuned to plants than I am, you could do much of this yourself, but if you are a beginner or a failure like me, Kelby feels fairly essential.

Rouxel explained that the AI models crunch data from temperature, humidity, and water sensors, along with images of the plants, to compute how fast the plants are growing and to optimize variables to promote healthy growth. “It’s like having a personal master gardener on your side 24/7, always monitoring what’s going on, taking action where it can, and when it cannot, it lets you know what to do,” he says.

If you opt out of Kelby after the free month’s trial, you can continue to grow plants and automate the watering and lighting on a schedule that you can customize, as well as buy new yCubes directly from the Gardyn app starting at $5 a plant.

I’ve enjoyed using the Gardyn, and everything I’ve grown has tasted delicious. It does require some maintenance, but far less than growing anything from scratch by myself. It remains to be seen if my plan to transplant veggies into my garden will be successful. If it is, I would be even more inclined to invest in this. But for anyone who likes the idea of having freshly grown vegetables, fruits, flowers, and herbs in their home, Garden really is a foolproof system.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/30/1129392/book-reviews-ai-therapy-mental-health/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.

Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot. On a broader scale, researchers are exploring AI’s potential to monitor and collect behavioral and biometric observations using wearables and smart devices, analyze vast volumes of clinical data for new insights, and assist human mental-health professionals to help prevent burnout.

But so far this largely uncontrolled experiment has produced mixed results. Many people have found solace in chatbots based on large language models (LLMs), and some experts see promise in them as therapists, but other users have been sent into delusional spirals by AI’s hallucinatory whims and breathless sycophancy. Most tragically, multiple families have alleged that chatbots contributed to the suicides of their loved ones, sparking lawsuits against companies responsible for these tools. In October, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed in a blog post that 0.15% of ChatGPT users “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” That’s roughly a million people sharing suicidal ideations with just one of these software systems every week.

The real-world consequences of AI therapy came to a head in unexpected ways in 2025 as we waded through a critical mass of stories about human-chatbot relationships, the flimsiness of guardrails on many LLMs, and the risks of sharing profoundly personal information with products made by corporations that have economic incentives to harvest and monetize such sensitive data.

Several authors anticipated this inflection point. Their timely books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

LLMs have often been described as “black boxes” because nobody knows exactly how they produce their results. The inner workings that guide their outputs are opaque because their algorithms are so complex and their training data is so vast. In mental-health circles, people often describe the human brain as a “black box,” for analogous reasons. Psychology, psychiatry, and related fields must grapple with the impossibility of seeing clearly inside someone else’s head, let alone pinpointing the exact causes of their distress.

These two types of black boxes are now interacting with each other, creating unpredictable feedback loops that may further impede clarity about the origins of people’s mental-­health struggles and the solutions that may be possible. Anxiety about these developments has much to do with the explosive recent advances in AI, but it also revives decades-old warnings from pioneers such as the MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, who argued against computerized therapy as early as the 1960s.

Charlotte Blease, a philosopher of medicine, makes the optimist’s case in Dr. Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us—and How AI Could Save Lives. Her book broadly explores the possible positive impacts of AI in a range of medical fields. While she remains clear-eyed about the risks, warning that readers who are expecting “a gushing love letter to technology” will be disappointed, she suggests that these models can help relieve patient suffering and medical burnout alike.

“Health systems are crumbling under patient pressure,” Blease writes. “Greater burdens on fewer doctors create the perfect petri dish for errors,” and “with palpable shortages of doctors and increasing waiting times for patients, many of us are profoundly frustrated.”

Blease believes that AI can not only ease medical professionals’ massive workloads but also relieve the tensions that have always existed between some patients and their caregivers. For example, people often don’t seek needed care because they are intimidated or fear judgment from medical professionals; this is especially true if they have mental-health challenges. AI could allow more people to share their concerns, she argues.

But she’s aware that these putative upsides need to be weighed against major drawbacks. For instance, AI therapists can provide inconsistent and even dangerous responses to human users, according to a 2025 study, and they also raise privacy concerns, given that AI companies are currently not bound by the same confidentiality and HIPAA standards as licensed therapists.

While Blease is an expert in this field, her motivation for writing the book is also personal: She has two siblings with an incurable form of muscular dystrophy, one of whom waited decades for a diagnosis. During the writing of her book, she also lost her partner to cancer and her father to dementia within a devastating six-month period. “I witnessed first-hand the sheer brilliance of doctors and the kindness of health professionals,” she writes. “But I also observed how things can go wrong with care.”

A similar tension animates Daniel Oberhaus’s engrossing book The Silicon Shrink: How Artificial Intelligence Made the World an Asylum. Oberhaus starts from a point of tragedy: the loss of his younger sister to suicide. As Oberhaus carried out the “distinctly twenty-first-century mourning process” of sifting through her digital remains, he wondered if technology could have eased the burden of the psychiatric problems that had plagued her since childhood.

“It seemed possible that all of this personal data might have held important clues that her mental health providers could have used to provide more effective treatment,” he writes. “What if algorithms running on my sister’s smartphone or laptop had used that data to understand when she was in distress? Could it have led to a timely intervention that saved her life? Would she have wanted that even if it did?”

This concept of digital phenotyping—in which a person’s digital behavior could be mined for clues about distress or illness—seems elegant in theory. But it may also become problematic if integrated into the field of psychiatric artificial intelligence (PAI), which extends well beyond chatbot therapy.

Oberhaus emphasizes that digital clues could actually exacerbate the existing challenges of modern psychiatry, a discipline that remains fundamentally uncertain about the underlying causes of mental illnesses and disorders. The advent of PAI, he says, is “the logical equivalent of grafting physics onto astrology.” In other words, the data generated by digital phenotyping is as precise as physical measurements of planetary positions, but it is then integrated into a broader framework—in this case, psychiatry—that, like astrology, is based on unreliable assumptions.

Oberhaus, who uses the phrase “swipe psychiatry” to describe the outsourcing of clinical decisions based on behavioral data to LLMs, thinks that this approach cannot escape the fundamental issues facing psychiatry. In fact, it could worsen the problem by causing the skills and judgment of human therapists to atrophy as they grow more dependent on AI systems.

He also uses the asylums of the past—in which institutionalized patients lost their right to freedom, privacy, dignity, and agency over their lives—as a touchstone for a more insidious digital captivity that may spring from PAI. LLM users are already sacrificing privacy by telling chatbots sensitive personal information that companies then mine and monetize, contributing to a new surveillance economy. Freedom and dignity are at stake when complex inner lives are transformed into data streams tailored for AI analysis.

AI therapists could flatten humanity into patterns of prediction, and so sacrifice the intimate, individualized care that is expected of traditional human therapists. “The logic of PAI leads to a future where we may all find ourselves patients in an algorithmic asylum administered by digital wardens,” Oberhaus writes. “In the algorithmic asylum there is no need for bars on the window or white padded rooms because there is no possibility of escape. The asylum is already everywhere—in your homes and offices, schools and hospitals, courtrooms and barracks. Wherever there’s an internet connection, the asylum is waiting.”

Eoin Fullam, a researcher who studies the intersection of technology and mental health, echoes some of the same concerns in Chatbot Therapy: A Critical Analysis of AI Mental Health Treatment. A heady academic primer, the book analyzes the assumptions underlying the automated treatments offered by AI chatbots and the way capitalist incentives could corrupt these kinds of tools.

Fullam observes that the capitalist mentality behind new technologies “often leads to questionable, illegitimate, and illegal business practices in which the customers’ interests are secondary to strategies of market dominance.”

That doesn’t mean that therapy-bot makers “will inevitably conduct nefarious activities contrary to the users’ interests in the pursuit of market dominance,” Fullam writes.

But he notes that the success of AI therapy depends on the inseparable impulses to make money and to heal people. In this logic, exploitation and therapy feed each other: Every digital therapy session generates data, and that data fuels the system that profits as unpaid users seek care. The more effective the therapy seems, the more the cycle entrenches itself, making it harder to distinguish between care and commodification. “The more the users benefit from the app in terms of its therapeutic or any other mental health intervention,” he writes, “the more they undergo exploitation.”

This sense of an economic and psychological ouroboros—the snake that eats its own tail—serves as a central metaphor in Sike, the debut novel from Fred Lunzer, an author with a research background in AI.

Described as a “story of boy meets girl meets AI psychotherapist,” Sike follows Adrian, a young Londoner who makes a living ghostwriting rap lyrics, in his romance with Maquie, a business professional with a knack for spotting lucrative technologies in the beta phase.

The title refers to a splashy commercial AI therapist called Sike, uploaded into smart glasses, that Adrian uses to interrogate his myriad anxieties. “When I signed up to Sike, we set up my dashboard, a wide black panel like an airplane’s cockpit that showed my daily ‘vitals,’” Adrian narrates. “Sike can analyze the way you walk, the way you make eye contact, the stuff you talk about, the stuff you wear, how often you piss, shit, laugh, cry, kiss, lie, whine, and cough.”

In other words, Sike is the ultimate digital phenotyper, constantly and exhaustively analyzing everything in a user’s daily experiences. In a twist, Lunzer chooses to make Sike a luxury product, available only to subscribers who can foot the price tag of £2,000 per month.

Flush with cash from his contributions to a hit song, Adrian comes to rely on Sike as a trusted mediator between his inner and outer worlds. The novel explores the impacts of the app on the wellness of the well-off, following rich people who voluntarily commit themselves to a boutique version of the digital asylum described by Oberhaus.

The only real sense of danger in Sike involves a Japanese torture egg (don’t ask). The novel strangely sidesteps the broader dystopian ripples of its subject matter in favor of drunken conversations at fancy restaurants and elite dinner parties.

The sudden ascent of the AI therapist seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes.

Sike’s creator is simply “a great guy” in Adrian’s estimation, despite his techno-messianic vision of training the app to soothe the ills of entire nations. It always seems as if a shoe is meant to drop, but in the end, it never does, leaving the reader with a sense of non-resolution.

While Sike is set in the present day, something about the sudden ascent of the AI therapist—­in real life as well as in fiction—seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes. But this convergence of mental health and artificial intelligence has been in the making for more than half a century. The beloved astronomer Carl Sagan, for example, once imagined a “network of computer psychotherapeutic terminals, something like arrays of large telephone booths” that could address the growing demand for mental-health services.

Oberhaus notes that one of the first incarnations of a trainable neural network, known as the Perceptron, was devised not by a mathematician but by a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt, at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in 1958. The potential utility of AI in mental health was widely recognized by the 1960s, inspiring early computerized psychotherapists such as the DOCTOR script that ran on the ELIZA chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, who shows up in all three of the nonfiction books in this article.

Weizenbaum, who died in 2008, was profoundly concerned about the possibility of computerized therapy. “Computers can make psychiatric judgments,” he wrote in his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason. “They can flip coins in much more sophisticated ways than can the most patient human being. The point is that they ought not to be given such tasks. They may even be able to arrive at ‘correct’ decisions in some cases—but always and necessarily on bases no human being should be willing to accept.”

It’s a caution worth keeping in mind. As AI therapists arrive at scale, we’re seeing them play out a familiar dynamic: Tools designed with superficially good intentions are enmeshed with systems that can exploit, surveil, and reshape human behavior. In a frenzied attempt to unlock new opportunities for patients in dire need of mental-health support, we may be locking other doors behind them.

            <h2>Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/29/1129308/bangladesh-garment-sustainability-frugal-factories/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals like lead and cadmium—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has quietly become an unlikely leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions. Bangladesh now boasts 268 LEED-certified garment factories—more than any other country. Dye plants are using safer chemicals, tanneries are adopting cleaner tanning methods and treating wastewater, workshops are switching to more efficient LED lighting, and solar panels glint from rooftops. The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads.

In Fakir Eco Knitwears’ LEED Gold–certified factory in Narayanganj, a city near Dhaka, skylights reduce energy consumption from electric lighting by 40%, and AI-driven cutters allow workers to recycle 95% of fabric scraps into new yarns. “We save energy by using daylight, solar power, and rainwater instead of heavy AC and boilers,” says Md. Anisuzzaman, an engineer at the company. “It shows how local resources can make production greener and more sustainable.”

The shift to green factories in Bangladesh is financed through a combination of factory investments, loans from Bangladesh Bank’s Green Transformation Fund, and pressure from international buyers who reward compliance with ongoing orders. One prominent program is the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), an initiative run by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation. Launched in 2013, PaCT has worked with more than 450 factories on cleaner production methods. By its count, the effort now saves 35 billion liters of fresh water annually, enough to meet the needs of 1.9 million people.

It’s a good start, but Bangladesh’s $40 billion garment industry still has a long way to go. The shift to environmentalism at the factory level hasn’t translated to improved outcomes for the sector’s 4.4 million workers.

Wage theft and delayed payments are widespread. The minimum wage, some 12,500 taka per month (about $113), is far below the $200 proposed by unions—which has meant frequent strikes and protests over pay, overtime, and job security. “Since Rana Plaza, building safety and factory conditions have improved, but the mindset remains unchanged,” says A.K.M. Ashraf Uddin, executive director of the Bangladesh Labour Foundation, a nonprofit labor rights group. “Profit still comes first, and workers’ freedom of speech is yet to be realized.”

In the worst case, greener industry practices could actually exacerbate inequality. Smaller factories dominate the sector, and they struggle to afford upgrades. But without those upgrades, businesses could find themselves excluded from certain markets. One of those is the European Union, which plans to require companies to address human rights and environmental problems in supply chains starting in 2027. A cleaner Buriganga River mends just a small corner of a vast tapestry of need.

            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.

As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.

Understanding AI’s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI’s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.

We’re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there’s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The “sunshine vitamin” is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.

Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven’s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is—and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicine

In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can’t think, don’t have any awareness, and can’t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such “bodyoids,” though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.

It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot

Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That’s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.

The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.

Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that’s over 30 years old

This year saw the birth of the world’s “oldest baby”: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby’s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion

Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat—unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.

Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year’s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We’ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here’s what didn’t make the cut.)

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Unveiled by the buzzy startup Deep, Vanguard will let teams of scientists live and work on the seabed for a week at a time.

We’ll keep following these developments, but this just wasn’t their year. Here’s why.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids. But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required.

“Radiative cooling is universal—it exists everywhere in our daily life,” says Qiaoqiang Gan, a professor of materials science and applied physics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Pretty much any object will absorb heat from the sun during the day and radiate some of it back at night. It’s why cars parked outside overnight are often covered with condensation, Gan says—their metal roofs dissipate heat into the sky, cooling the surfaces below the ambient air temperature. That’s how you get dew.

Humans have harnessed this basic natural process for thousands of years. Desert peoples in Iran, North Africa, and India manufactured ice by leaving pools of water exposed to clear desert skies overnight, when radiative cooling happens naturally; other cultures constructed “cool roofs” capped with reflective materials that scattered sunlight and lowered interior temperatures. “People have taken advantage of this effect, either knowingly or unknowingly, for a very long time,” says Aaswath Raman, a materials scientist at UCLA and cofounder of the radiative­cooling startup SkyCool Systems.

Modern approaches, as demonstrated everywhere from California supermarket rooftops to Japan’s Expo 2025 pavilion, go even further. Normally, if the sun is up and pumping in heat, surfaces can’t get cooler than the ambient temperature. But back in 2014, Raman and his colleagues achieved radiative cooling in the daytime. They customized photonic films to absorb and then radiate heat at infrared wavelengths between eight and 13 micrometers—a range of electromagnetic wavelengths called an “atmospheric window,” because that radiation escapes to space rather than getting absorbed. Those films could dissipate heat even under full sun, cooling the inside of a building to 9 °F below ambient temperatures, with no AC or energy source required.

That was proof of concept; today, Raman says, the industry has mostly shifted away from advanced photonics that use the atmospheric-window effect to simpler sunlight-scattering materials. Ceramic cool roofs, nanostructure coatings, and reflective polymers all offer the possibility of diverting more sunlight across all wavelengths, and they’re more durable and scalable.

Now the race is on. Startups such as SkyCool, Planck Energies, Spacecool, and i2Cool are competing to commercially manufacture and sell coatings that reflect at least 94% of sunlight in most climates, and above 97% in humid tropical ones. Pilot projects have already provided significant cooling to residential buildings, reducing AC energy needs by 15% to 20% in some cases.

This idea could go way beyond reflective rooftops and roads. Researchers are developing reflective textiles that can be worn by people most at risk of heat exposure. “This is personal thermal management,” says Gan. “We can realize passive cooling in T-shirts, sportswear, and garments.”

Of course, these technologies and materials have limits. Like solar power grids, they’re vulnerable to weather. Clouds prevent reflected sunlight from bouncing into space. Dust and air pollution dim materials’ bright surfaces. Lots of coatings lose their reflectivity after a few years. And the cheapest and toughest materials used in radiative cooling tend to rely on Teflon and other fluoropolymers, “forever chemicals” that don’t biodegrade, posing an environmental risk. “They are the best class of products that tend to survive outdoors,” says Raman. “So for long-term scale-up, can you do it without materials like those fluoropolymers and still maintain the durability and hit this low cost point?”

As with any other solution to the problems of climate change, one size won’t fit all. “We cannot be overoptimistic and say that radiative cooling can address all our future needs,” Gan says. “We still need more efficient active air-conditioning.” A shiny roof isn’t a panacea, but it’s still pretty cool.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. As we near the end of 2025, our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse.

Make sure you take the time to brace yourself for what promises to be another bonkers year.

As long as people have been hyping AI, they have been coming up with names for a future, ultra-powerful form of the technology that could bring about utopian or dystopian consequences for humanity. “Superintelligence” is that latest hot term. Meta announced in July that it would form an AI team to pursue superintelligence, and it was reportedly offering nine-figure compensation packages to AI experts from the company’s competitors to join.

In December, Microsoft’s head of AI followed suit, saying the company would be spending big sums, perhaps hundreds of billions, on the pursuit of superintelligence. If you think superintelligence is as vaguely defined as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, you’d be right! While it’s conceivable that these sorts of technologies will be feasible in humanity’s long run, the question is really when, and whether today’s AI is good enough to be treated as a stepping stone toward something like superintelligence. Not that that will stop the hype kings. —James O’Donnell

Thirty years ago, Steve Jobs said everyone in America should learn how to program a computer. Today, people with zero knowledge of how to code can knock up an app, game, or website in no time at all thanks to vibe coding—a catch-all phrase coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy. To vibe-code, you simply prompt generative AI models’ coding assistants to create the digital object of your desire and accept pretty much everything they spit out. Will the result work? Possibly not. Will it be secure? Almost definitely not, but the technique’s biggest champions aren’t letting those minor details stand in their way. Also—it sounds fun! — Rhiannon Williams

One of the biggest AI stories over the past year has been how prolonged interactions with chatbots can cause vulnerable people to experience delusions and, in some extreme cases, can either cause or worsen psychosis. Although “chatbot psychosis” is not a recognized medical term, researchers are paying close attention to the growing anecdotal evidence from users who say it’s happened to them or someone they know. Sadly, the increasing number of lawsuits filed against AI companies by the families of people who died following their conversations with chatbots demonstrate the technology’s potentially deadly consequences. —Rhiannon Williams

Few things kept the AI hype train going this year more than so-called reasoning models, LLMs that can break down a problem into multiple steps and work through them one by one. OpenAI released its first reasoning models, o1 and o3, a year ago.

A month later, the Chinese firm DeepSeek took everyone by surprise with a very fast follow, putting out R1, the first open-source reasoning model. In no time, reasoning models became the industry standard: All major mass-market chatbots now come in flavors backed by this tech. Reasoning models have pushed the envelope of what LLMs can do, matching top human performances in prestigious math and coding competitions. On the flip side, all the buzz about LLMs that could “reason” reignited old debates about how smart LLMs really are and how they really work. Like “artificial intelligence” itself, “reasoning” is technical jargon dressed up with marketing sparkle. Choo choo! —Will Douglas Heaven

For all their uncanny facility with language, LLMs have very little common sense. Put simply, they don’t have any grounding in how the world works. Book learners in the most literal sense, LLMs can wax lyrical about everything under the sun and then fall flat with a howler about how many elephants you could fit into an Olympic swimming pool (exactly one, according to one of Google DeepMind’s LLMs).

World models—a broad church encompassing various technologies—aim to give AI some basic common sense about how stuff in the world actually fits together. In their most vivid form, world models like Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 and Marble, the much-anticipated new tech from Fei-Fei Li’s startup World Labs, can generate detailed and realistic virtual worlds for robots to train in and more. Yann LeCun, Meta’s former chief scientist, is also working on world models. He has been trying to give AI a sense of how the world works for years, by training models to predict what happens next in videos. This year he quit Meta to focus on this approach in a new start up called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs. If all goes well, world models could be the next thing. —Will Douglas Heaven

Have you heard about all the people saying no thanks, we actually don’t want a giant data center plopped in our backyard? The data centers in question—which tech companies want to built everywhere, including space—are typically referred to as hyperscalers: massive buildings purpose-built for AI operations and used by the likes of OpenAI and Google to build bigger and more powerful AI models. Inside such buildings, the world’s best chips hum away training and fine-tuning models, and they’re built to be modular and grow according to needs.

It’s been a big year for hyperscalers. OpenAI announced, alongside President Donald Trump, its Stargate project, a $500 billion joint venture to pepper the country with the largest data centers ever. But it leaves almost everyone else asking: What exactly do we get out of it? Consumers worry the new data centers will raise their power bills. Such buildings generally struggle to run on renewable energy. And they don’t tend to create all that many jobs. But hey, maybe these massive, windowless buildings could at least give a moody, sci-fi vibe to your community. —James O’Donnell

The lofty promises of AI are levitating the economy. AI companies are raising eye-popping sums of money and watching their valuations soar into the stratosphere. They’re pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into chips and data centers, financed increasingly by debt and eyebrow-raising circular deals. Meanwhile, the companies leading the gold rush, like OpenAI and Anthropic, might not turn a profit for years, if ever. Investors are betting big that AI will usher in a new era of riches, yet no one knows how transformative the technology will actually be.

Most organizations using AI aren’t yet seeing the payoff, and AI work slop is everywhere. There’s scientific uncertainty about whether scaling LLMs will deliver superintelligence or whether new breakthroughs need to pave the way. But unlike their predecessors in the dot-com bubble, AI companies are showing strong revenue growth, and some are even deep-pocketed tech titans like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Will the manic dream ever burst? —Michelle Kim

This year, AI agents were everywhere. Every new feature announcement, model drop, or security report throughout 2025 was peppered with mentions of them, even though plenty of AI companies and experts disagree on exactly what counts as being truly “agentic,” a vague term if ever there was one. No matter that it’s virtually impossible to guarantee that an AI acting on your behalf out in the wide web will always do exactly what it’s supposed to do—it seems as though agentic AI is here to stay for the foreseeable. Want to sell something? Call it agentic! —Rhiannon Williams

Early this year, DeepSeek unveiled its new model DeepSeek R1, an open-source reasoning model that matches top Western models but costs a fraction of the price. Its launch freaked Silicon Valley out, as many suddenly realized for the first time that huge scale and resources were not necessarily the key to high-level AI models. Nvidia stock plunged by 17% the day after R1 was released.

The key to R1’s success was distillation, a technique that makes AI models more efficient. It works by getting a bigger model to tutor a smaller model: You run the teacher model on a lot of examples and record the answers, and reward the student model as it copies those responses as closely as possible, so that it gains a compressed version of the teacher’s knowledge.  —Caiwei Chen

As people across the world spend increasing amounts of time interacting with chatbots like ChatGPT, chatbot makers are struggling to work out the kind of tone and “personality” the models should adopt. Back in April, OpenAI admitted it’d struck the wrong balance between helpful and sniveling, saying a new update had rendered GPT-4o too sycophantic. Having it suck up to you isn’t just irritating—it can mislead users by reinforcing their incorrect beliefs and spreading misinformation. So consider this your reminder to take everything—yes, everything—LLMs produce with a pinch of salt. —Rhiannon Williams

If there is one AI-related term that has fully escaped the nerd enclosures and entered public consciousness, it’s “slop.” The word itself is old (think pig feed), but “slop” is now commonly used to refer to low-effort, mass-produced content generated by AI, often optimized for online traffic. A lot of people even use it as a shorthand for any AI-generated content. It has felt inescapable in the past year: We have been marinated in it, from fake biographies to shrimp Jesus images to surreal human-animal hybrid videos.

But people are also having fun with it. The term’s sardonic flexibility has made it easy for internet users to slap it on all kinds of words as a suffix to describe anything that lacks substance and is absurdly mediocre: think “work slop” or “friend slop.” As the hype cycle resets, “slop” marks a cultural reckoning about what we trust, what we value as creative labor, and what it means to be surrounded by stuff that was made for engagement rather than expression. —Caiwei Chen

Did you come across the hypnotizing video from earlier this year of a humanoid robot putting away dishes in a bleak, gray-scale kitchen? That pretty much embodies the idea of physical intelligence: the idea that advancements in AI can help robots better move around the physical world.

It’s true that robots have been able to learn new tasks faster than ever before, everywhere from operating rooms to warehouses. Self-driving-car companies have seen improvements in how they simulate the roads, too. That said, it’s still wise to be skeptical that AI has revolutionized the field. Consider, for example, that many robots advertised as butlers in your home are doing the majority of their tasks thanks to remote operators in the Philippines.

The road ahead for physical intelligence is also sure to be weird. Large language models train on text, which is abundant on the internet, but robots learn more from videos of people doing things. That’s why the robot company Figure suggested in September that it would pay people to film themselves in their apartments doing chores. Would you sign up? —James O&#39;Donnell

AI models are trained by devouring millions of words and images across the internet, including copyrighted work by artists and writers. AI companies argue this is “fair use”—a legal doctrine that lets you use copyrighted material without permission if you transform it into something new that doesn’t compete with the original. Courts are starting to weigh in. In June, Anthropic’s training of its AI model Claude on a library of books was ruled fair use because the technology was “exceedingly transformative.”

That same month, Meta scored a similar win, but only because the authors couldn’t show that the company’s literary buffet cut into their paychecks. As copyright battles brew, some creators are cashing in on the feast. In December, Disney signed a splashy deal with OpenAI to let users of Sora, the AI video platform, generate videos featuring more than 200 characters from Disney&#39;s franchises. Meanwhile, governments around the world are rewriting copyright rules for the content-guzzling machines. Is training AI on copyrighted work fair use? As with any billion-dollar legal question, it depends. —Michelle Kim

Just a few short years ago, an entire industry was built around helping websites rank highly in search results (okay, just in Google). Now search engine optimization (SEO), is giving way to GEO—generative engine optimization—as the AI boom forces brands and businesses to scramble to maximize their visibility in AI, whether that’s in AI-enhanced search results like Google’s AI Overviews or within responses from LLMs. It’s no wonder they’re freaked out. We already know that news companies have experienced a colossal drop in search-driven web traffic, and AI companies are working on ways to cut out the middleman and allow their users to visit sites from directly within their platforms. It’s time to adapt or die. —Rhiannon Williams

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/24/1129294/ronald-deibert-citizen-lab-digital-threats-spies-cybersecurity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he took a taxi to a mall and headed directly to the Apple Store to purchase a new laptop and iPhone. He’d wanted to keep the risk of having his personal devices confiscated to a minimum, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, the lab operates independently of governments or corporate interests, relying instead on research grants and private philanthropy for financial support. It’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing, he says: “The pillars of democracy are under assault in the United States. For many decades, in spite of its flaws, it has upheld norms about what constitutional democracy looks like or should aspire to. [That] is now at risk.”

Even as some of his fellow Canadians avoided US travel after Donald Trump’s second election, Deibert relished the opportunity to visit. Alongside his meetings with human rights defenders, he also documented active surveillance at Columbia University during the height of its student protests. Deibert snapped photos of drones above campus and noted the exceptionally strict security protocols. “It was unorthodox to go to the United States,” he says. “But I really gravitate toward problems in the world.”

Deibert, 61, grew up in East Vancouver, British Columbia, a gritty area with a boisterous countercultural presence. In the ’70s, Vancouver brimmed with draft dodgers and hippies, but Deibert points to American investigative journalism—exposing the COINTELPRO surveillance program, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate—as the seed of his respect for antiestablishment sentiment. He didn’t imagine that this fascination would translate into a career, however.

“My horizons were pretty low because I came from a working-class family, and there weren’t many people in my family—in fact, none—who went on to university,” he says.

Deibert eventually entered a graduate program in international relations at the University of British Columbia. His doctoral research brought him to a field of inquiry that would soon explode: the geopolitical implications of the nascent internet.

“In my field, there were a handful of people beginning to talk about the internet, but it was very shallow, and that frustrated me,” he says. “And meanwhile, computer science was very technical, but not political—[politics] was almost like a dirty word.”

Deibert continued to explore these topics at the University of Toronto when he was appointed to a tenure-track professorship, but it wasn’t until after he founded the Citizen Lab in 2001 that his work rose to global prominence.

What put the lab on the map, Deibert says, was its 2009 report “Tracking GhostNet,” which uncovered a digital espionage network in China that had breached offices of foreign embassies and diplomats in more than 100 countries, including the office of the Dalai Lama. The report and its follow-up in 2010 were among the first to publicly expose cybersurveillance in real time. In the years since, the lab has published over 180 such analyses, garnering praise from human rights advocates ranging from Margaret Atwood to Edward Snowden.

The lab has rigorously investigated authoritarian regimes around the world (Deibert says both Russia and China have his name on a “list” barring his entry). The group was the first to uncover the use of commercial spyware to surveil people close to the Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi prior to his assassination, and its research has directly informed G7 and UN resolutions on digital repression and led to sanctions on spyware vendors. Even so, in 2025 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement reactivated a $2 million contract with the spyware vendor Paragon. The contract, which the Biden administration had previously placed under a stop-work order, resembles steps taken by governments in Europe and Israel that have also deployed domestic spyware to address security concerns.

“It saves lives, quite literally,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says of the lab’s work. “The Citizen Lab [researchers] were the first to really focus on technical attacks on human rights activists and democracy activists all around the world. And they’re still the best at it.”

When recruiting new Citizen Lab employees (or “Labbers,” as they refer to one another), Deibert forgoes stuffy, pencil-pushing academics in favor of brilliant, colorful personalities, many of whom personally experienced repression from some of the same regimes the lab now investigates.

Noura Aljizawi, a researcher on digital repression who survived torture at the hands of the al-Assad regime in Syria, researches the distinct threat that digital technologies pose to women and queer people, particularly when deployed against exiled nationals. She helped create Security Planner, a tool that gives personalized, expert-reviewed guidance to people looking to improve their digital hygiene, for which the University of Toronto awarded her an Excellence Through Innovation Award.

Work for the lab is not without risk. Citizen Lab fellow Elies Campo, for example, was followed and photographed after the lab published a 2022 report that exposed the digital surveillance of dozens of Catalonian citizens and members of parliament, including four Catalonian presidents who were targeted during or after their terms.

Still, the lab’s reputation and mission make recruitment fairly easy, Deibert says. “This good work attracts a certain type of person,” he says. “But they’re usually also drawn to the sleuthing. It’s detective work, and that can be highly intoxicating—even addictive.”

Deibert frequently deflects the spotlight to his fellow Labbers. He rarely discusses the group’s accomplishments without referencing two senior researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton, alongside other staffers. And on the occasion that someone decides to leave the Citizen Lab to pursue another position, this appreciation remains.

“We have a saying: Once a Labber, always a Labber,” Deibert says.

While in the US, Deibert taught a seminar on the Citizen Lab’s work to Northwestern University undergraduates and delivered talks on digital authoritarianism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Universities in the US had been subjected to funding cuts and heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, and Deibert wanted to be “in the mix” at such institutions to respond to what he sees as encroaching authoritarian practices by the US government.

Since Deibert’s return to Canada, the lab has continued its work unearthing digital threats to civil society worldwide, but now Deibert must also contend with the US—a country that was once his benchmark for democracy but has become another subject of his scrutiny. “I do not believe that an institution like the Citizen Lab could exist right now in the United States,” he says. “The type of research that we pioneered is under threat like never before.”

He is particularly alarmed by the increasing pressures facing federal oversight bodies and academic institutions in the US. In September, for example, the Trump administration defunded the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, a government organization dedicated to preventing waste, fraud, and abuse within federal agencies, citing partisanship concerns. The White House has also threatened to freeze federal funding to universities that do not comply with administration directives related to gender, DEI, and campus speech. These sorts of actions, Deibert says, undermine the independence of watchdogs and research groups like the Citizen Lab.

Cohn, the director of the EFF, says the lab’s location in Canada allows it to avoid many of these attacks on institutions that provide accountability. “Having the Citizen Lab based in Toronto and able to continue to do its work largely free of the things we’re seeing in the US,” she says, “could end up being tremendously important if we’re going to return to a place of the rule of law and protection of human rights and liberties.”

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
