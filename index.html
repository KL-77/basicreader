            <h2>Looking back at Catacomb 3D, the game that led to Wolfenstein 3D</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/looking-back-at-catacomb-3d-the-game-that-led-to-wolfenstein-3d/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you know anything about the history of id Software, you know how 1992’s Wolfenstein 3D helped establish the company’s leadership in the burgeoning first-person shooter genre, leading directly to subsequent hits like Doom and Quake. But only the serious id Software nerds remember Catacomb 3D, id’s first-person adventure game that directly preceded and inspired work on Wolfenstein 3D.

Now, nearly 35 years after Catacomb 3D‘s initial release, id co-founder John Romero brought the company’s founding members together for an informative retrospective video on the creation of the oft-forgotten game. But the pioneering game—which included mouse support, color-coded keys, and shooting walls to find secrets—almost ended up being a gimmicky dead end for the company.

Catacomb 3D was a follow-up to id’s earlier Catacomb, which was a simplified clone of the popular arcade hit Gauntlet. As such, the 3D game still has some of that “quarter eater” mentality that was not very fashionable in PC gaming at the time, as John Carmack remembered.

“It didn’t have the kind of overarching story and depth and the other things that people felt that the PC was better suited for,” Carmack said. “And we were still kind of striking out saying no, you know, action, fast, twitch, that still is a great viable gaming thing to do.”

Technologically, id wanted Catacomb 3D to build on the success of Hovertank One, a fast-paced first-person game the company had released a few months earlier. Catacomb 3D‘s major graphical breakthrough over Hovertank would be texture-mapped walls, a concept Carmack said he had been interested in since seeing a texture-mapped cube on the cover of his trusty copy of The Fundamentals of Computer Graphics.

Romero said he heard about texture mapping from a conversation with Paul Neurath, who was using the technique successfully in his work on the yet-to-be-released Ultima Underworld. Romero said he told Carmack about Neurath’s success, leading Carmack to pause for a second and then reply with “Yeah, I think I can do that.”

Carmack said getting a “fully general” version of texture-mapped surfaces working was limited at the time to high-end SGI workstations and the like. But he said he was able to develop “a simplification of that and could still go kind of fast” on the home PCs of the time. That was in part thanks to an EGA graphics trick that lets programmers write multiple columns of graphics data at a time.

“When the walls are really tall, you can slap down as many as eight pixels at a time in some cases,” Carmack said.

The decision to go for a first-person viewpoint in Catacombs 3D, rather than an over-the-shoulder third-person system, was largely because “it was very costly to draw large things [like the player character] on screen,” id co-founder Tom Hall says in the video. But the first-person perspective also helped simplify aiming and added a real sense of immersion, he added. “This is me,” Hall said of the impact. “It really changes how you feel about things.”

Hall also reminisced about drawing extremely simplistic “6-year-old child-like drawings” to sketch out his concept for Catacomb 3D‘s characters, then giving them to Adrian Carmack for conversion into “majestic art pieces that stand the test of time.” Carmack, for his part, says he would “try to interpret [Hall’s drawings] as best I could” for the game’s 16-color, 320×200 resolution framework.

Adrian Carmack also recalled working in DOS’s DeluxePaint II and not having access to any good animation software at the time. As such, he would end up using the drawing software’s undo command to flip back and forth between two different “frames” of animation quickly, to see how the movement would look in the final product. “If you use the undo key [like that], you learn really rapidly that you need to save often,” Carmack quipped in the video.

While id’s decision to lean into fast, action-oriented first-person games might seem obvious in retrospect, the video reveals that it was far from an easy decision. Catacomb 3D earned the team just $5,000 (about $11,750 in December 2025 dollars) through a contract to deliver bi-monthly games for Softdisk’s Gamer’s Edge magazine-on-a-disk. Each episode of the Commander Keen series of run-and-gun 2D games, on the other hand, was still earning “10 times that amount” at the time, Romero said.

That made sticking with Commander Keen seem like the “obvious business decision,” Romero says in the video. The team even started work on a seventh Commander Keen game—with parallax scrolling and full VGA color support—right after Catacomb 3D‘s release. At the time, it felt like Catacomb 3D might be “just like a weird gimmick thing that we did for a little bit because we wanted to play with a different technology,” as John Carmack put it.

That feeling started to fade away, Carmack said, after his brother Adrian had an “almost falling out of his seat” moment while pivoting toward an in-game troll in Catacomb 3D. “It automatically sucked you in,” Adrian Carmack said of the feeling. “You’re trying to look behind walls, doors, whatever… you get a pop-out like that, and it was just one of the craziest things in a video game I had ever seen.”

That kind of reaction from one of their own eventually convinced the team to abandon two weeks of work on Keen 7 to focus on what would become Wolfenstein 3D. “It kind of felt that’s where the future was going,” Carmack said in the video. “[We wanted to] “take it to some place that it wouldn’t happen staying in the existing conservative [lane].”

“Within two weeks, [I was up] at one in the morning and I’m just like, ‘Guys, we need to not make this game [Keen],&#39;” Romero told Ars in 2024. “‘This is not the future. The future is getting better at what we just did with Catacomb.’ … And everyone was immediately was like, ‘Yeah, you know, you’re right. That is the new thing, and we haven’t seen it, and we can do it, so why aren’t we doing it?’”</div>

            <h2>Streaming service Crunchyroll raises prices weeks after killing its free tier</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/streaming-service-crunchyroll-raises-prices-weeks-after-killing-its-free-tier/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Crunchyroll is one of the most popular streaming platforms for anime viewers. Over the past six years, the service has raised prices for fans, and today, it announced that it’s increasing monthly subscription prices by up to 20 percent.

Sony bought Crunchyroll from AT&T in 2020. At the time, Crunchyroll had 3 million paid subscribers and an additional 197 million users with free accounts, which let people watch a limited number of titles with commercials. At the time, Crunchyroll monthly subscription tiers cost $8, $10, or $15.

After its acquisition by Sony, like many large technology companies that buy a smaller, beloved product, the company made controversial changes. The Tokyo-based company folded rival Funimation into Crunchyroll; Sony shut down Funimation, which it bought in 2017, in April 2024.

In the process, Sony erased people’s digital Funimation libraries that Funimation originally marketed as being available “forever, but there are some restrictions.” Sony also reduced the number of free titles on Crunchyroll in 2022 before eliminating the free option completely on December 31, 2025.

Today, Crunchyroll raised prices for its remaining tiers. The cheapest plan, Fan, went from $8 per month to $10 per month. The Mega tier, which allows for streaming from up to four devices simultaneously, went from $12 to $14. The Ultra tier, which supports simultaneous streaming across six devices and includes access to the Crunchyroll Manga app, increased from $16 to $18.

Current subscribers will see the changes after March 4. Crunchyroll is charging new customers the higher prices immediately.

Crunchyroll last increased prices in May 2024, when its Mega tier went from $10 to $12 and its Ultimate tier from $15 to $16. The Fan tier’s last price hike was in 2019.

Crunchyroll said that the higher prices would “give fans more of what they love.” Today’s announcement pointed to “recent and upcoming” changes: teen profiles and PIN protection; multiple profiles; the ability to skip intro theme songs and ending credits; and “expanded device compatibility.”

Crunchyroll’s price hike may further frustrate subscribers, considering that the streaming service recently eliminated its free tier and acquired one of its strongest, and often cheaper, rivals. The result is that Crunchyroll and Netflix have the lion’s share of the anime streaming market. In 2023, Wall Street research firm Bernstein Research reported that Crunchyroll (40 percent) and Netflix (42 percent) controlled 82 percent of the overseas (non-Japanese) anime streaming market.

Anime is an increasingly lucrative opportunity for Sony, and its success so far suggests it won’t stray from its strategy.

From 2012 to 2024, Crunchyroll’s subscriber count grew from 5 million to over 15 million, per Variety. Sony hasn’t shared exact figures but has confirmed that Crunchyroll is profitable. In March, Bernstein Research analysts estimated that Crunchyroll’s profit margin was 8 percent in 2024’s third quarter and that the figure, as Variety put it, would “more than double by 2027.”

Crunchyroll helped offset a 25 percent year-over-year drop in operating income for Sony’s Pictures segment in Sony’s most recent quarterly earnings report. During the quarter, streaming services represented 31 percent of sales for Sony Pictures, outpacing the segment’s theatrical, television, and home entertainment businesses.

The silver lining for anime and streaming viewers is that Crunchyroll is demonstrating that a niche service can scale and profit, and that when it does, it can add new experiences and further interest in its specialty. For its part, Crunchyroll recently relaunched its app for reading digital copies of manga. Crunchyroll shuttered its original Manga app in December 2023. The revived app uses an updated revenue-sharing model that’s said to better benefit publishers.

Still, the changes that Sony makes to media companies it buys are worth scrutiny, especially as it continues acquiring companies. Sony-owned anime production company Aniplex announced that it bought rival Egg Firm today.

As streaming prices rise, industry consolidation is also picking up steam. More large companies buying and potentially merging streaming services will inevitably impact subscribers’ experiences. For these customers, it can be worrying to consider what changes streaming mergers can bring. While there’s hope for more features and content, there’s also risk for higher prices and fewer options.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/spacex-acquires-xai-plans-1-million-satellite-constellation-to-power-it/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX has formally acquired another one of Elon Musk’s companies, xAi, the space company announced on Monday afternoon.

“SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” the company said. “This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI’s mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!”

The merging of what is arguably Musk’s most successful company, SpaceX, with the more speculative xAI venture is a risk. Founded in 2023, xAI’s main products are the generative AI chatbot, Grok, and the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. The company aims to compete with OpenAI and other artificial intelligence firms. However, Grok has been controversial, including the sexualization of women and children through AI-generated images, as has Musk’s management of Twitter.

There can be no question that the merger of SpaceX—the world’s premiere spaceflight company—and the artificial intelligence firm offer potential strategic advances. Musk strongly believes that artificial intelligence is central to humanity’s future and wants to be among those leading in its development. With this merger, he plans to use SpaceX’s deep expertise in rapid launch and satellite manufacturing and management to deploy a constellation of up to 1 million orbital data centers. This will provide the backbone of computing power needed to support xAI’s operations.

Musk’s plan for the merged companies is predicated on several assumptions, including that AI is not a bubble, but rather a technology that will be fully embraced in the future; that orbital data centers are cost-competitive compared to ground-based data centers; and that compute is the essential roadblock that must be solved for widespread adoption of AI by society.

If these assumptions are true, the merged SpaceX-xAI company holds a powerful position. It could potentially own a full stack of capabilities, from launch to orbital bandwidth to frontier AI models, and with Starlink Internet, it could provide AI on demand, anywhere in the world, to any mobile device.

SpaceX already has the world’s workhorse reusable rocket with the Falcon 9. It can presently deliver about 20 tons to low-Earth orbit for an internal cost of $15 million, compared to more than four or five times that on the open market. Moreover, SpaceX is working toward fully reusable super heavy lift rocket with its Starship vehicle.

The privately held company also operates more satellites, about 9,600, than any other country or company in the world by a factor of 10. It has extensive operations not just in deploying but also in operating this constellation over the last decade. This is not a simple capability.

“I would say there have been as many engineering advancements in orbital safety and collision prevention in the last 10 years as there have been advances in rocketry, and that may have gone unnoticed,” said Brian Weeden, director of civil and commercial policy at The Aerospace Corporation, in an interview.

In an email to SpaceX employees on Monday, Musk said Starship will begin launching V3 Starlink satellites into orbit this year, as well as the next generation of direct-to-mobile satellites. The launches, he said, will be a “forcing function” to improve the performance of Starship, making it more rapidly reusable for data center deployment.

“The sheer number of satellites that will be needed for space-based data centers will push Starship to even greater heights,” Musk wrote. “With launches every hour carrying 200 tons per flight, Starship will deliver millions of tons to orbit and beyond per year, enabling an exciting future where humanity is out exploring amongst the stars.”

Musk told employees that launching 1 million tons per year of satellites, generating 100 kW of compute power per ton, would add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually, “with no ongoing operational or maintenance needs.” Ultimately, Musk believes there is a path to launching 1 TW/year from Earth.

“My estimate is that within 2 to 3 years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space,” Musk wrote. “This cost-efficiency alone will enable innovative companies to forge ahead in training their AI models and processing data at unprecedented speeds and scales, accelerating breakthroughs in our understanding of physics and invention of technologies to benefit humanity.”

Musk is clearly bullish on the future of AI and on space’s potential to address the voracious power needs of AI data centers. Many people in the AI industry speculate that artificial intelligence is likely to go through serious and sustained growing pains, or doubt that space-based data centers can compete with operations built on the ground. But Musk, more than anyone, has the means to press forward the bull case for space-based AI, and he is going for it.

Monday’s merger follows an ultra-ambitious filing on Friday with the Federal Communications Commission in which SpaceX sought permission to launch 1 million satellites that will operate as “orbital data centers.” The company said it would deploy the satellites to orbits with an altitude between 500 and 2,000km, and 30-degree and Sun-synchronous inclinations.

SpaceX also recently announced its plans to deploy a space situational awareness system, called Stargaze, that will use star trackers to provide data on potential conjunctions between satellites in orbit. The goal is to help de-conflict satellite trajectories and avoid collisions in low-Earth orbit.

“This is all happening really fast,” said Victoria Samson, chief director of space security and stability for Secure World Foundation, in an interview.

Samson said that, at present, satellites have a fairly large “bubble” of space around them when it comes to collision detection. This is because of uncertainties in the precise location and movement of vehicles. If you improve space situational awareness, such as what SpaceX seeks to do with Stargaze, those bubbles could be shrunk to reduce the number of potential collision warnings. But that will come with risks.

“There’s a lot of room in space, of course,” Samson said. “But the question is, how much risk do you want to take?”

A technical expert at The Aerospace Corporation, Marlon Sorge, told Ars that many unanswered questions about SpaceX’s proposed megaconstellation for orbital data centers make it difficult to assess the risks of collision. This includes their size (they will require very large solar arrays to collect sunlight) and precisely where the satellites will be deployed. There is already a lot of debris at around 800 to 1,000 km above Earth from previous collisions, including from an infamous Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007, which created more than 3,000 pieces of golf-ball-sized or larger debris.

Above that altitude, there is less debris, Sorge said. But objects at that altitude take centuries to deorbit naturally, due to the very limited atmosphere.

“The big challenge at those altitudes is the stuff that’s up there stays up there,” Sorge said. “If you generate more debris, if you have problems, it won’t go away, so you’re stuck with it.”

SpaceX sought to address these concerns in its regulatory filing, noting that each satellite would have “redundant maneuverability capabilities” in order to deorbit into Earth’s atmosphere. The filing also appears to recognize emerging science that indicates that aluminum burning up from reentering satellites is harmful to ozone levels. To address this, SpaceX is considering moving aging satellites into “high altitude Earth orbits or heliocentric orbits.”

However, Sorge noted that the amount of energy, or delta-V, needed to move a satellite from low-Earth orbit into a heliocentric orbit is “non-trivial.”

One of the many questions raised by the new merger is whether SpaceX has lost its way. Musk founded the company in 2002 with the singular purpose of settling Mars, an audacious if not impossible goal at the time. In the decades since, SpaceX has made credible progress toward Mars, and with Starship, humanity has for the first time a transportation system potentially capable of landing humans on the red planet.

But acquiring an AI company and putting so much effort into orbital data centers? Is this consistent with the Mars mission? Musk clearly thinks it is.

“While launching AI satellites from Earth is the immediate focus, Starship’s capabilities will also enable operations on other worlds,” he wrote. “Thanks to advancements like in-space propellant transfer, Starship will be capable of landing massive amounts of cargo on the Moon. Once there, it will be possible to establish a permanent presence for scientific and manufacturing pursuits. Factories on the Moon can take advantage of lunar resources to manufacture satellites and deploy them further into space.”

And from there, he said, Mars will be firmly on the horizon.

“The capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe,” he wrote.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/russian-drones-use-starlink-but-ukraine-has-plan-to-block-their-internet-access/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ukraine and SpaceX say they recently collaborated to stop strikes by Russian drones using Starlink and will soon block all unregistered use of Starlink terminals in an attempt to stop Russia’s military from using the satellite broadband network over Ukraine territory.

Ukrainians will soon be required to register their Starlink terminals to get on a whitelist. After that, “only verified and registered terminals will be allowed to operate in the country. All others will be disconnected,” the Ukraine Ministry of Defense said in a press release today.

Ukraine Minister of Defense Mykhailo Fedorov “emphasized that the only technical solution to counter this threat is to introduce a ‘whitelist’ and authorize all terminals,” according to the ministry. “This is a necessary step by the Government to save Ukrainian lives and protect critical energy infrastructure,” Fedorov said.

Fedorov has posted on SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s X social network a few times in the past few days about Russia’s use of Starlink and Ukraine’s attempt to counter it. On January 29, Fedorov said his agency contacted SpaceX hours after “reports that Russian drones equipped with Starlink connectivity were operating over Ukrainian cities.” Ukraine “proposed concrete ways to resolve the issue,” he said.

Fedorov said that SpaceX started working on a solution immediately after the outreach. Musk wrote yesterday, “Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorized use of Starlink by Russia have worked. Let us know if more needs to be done.”

Fedorov said yesterday that because of “the first steps taken in recent days, no Ukrainians have been killed by Russian drones using Starlink.” Fedorov said the ministry “will share instructions for Ukrainian users to register their Starlink terminals for verification” in the coming days, and that registration “will be simple, fast, and user-friendly.”

Ukraine’s whitelist plan will require residents to make “one visit to the nearest Administrative Services Center,” a process that Fedorov said will be “free, fast, and without excessive bureaucracy.” Businesses will be able to verify their Starlink terminals online, while the military and service members have separate systems for registration. Service members with personal Starlink terminals will “only need to add the terminal to the ‘whitelist’ to prevent disconnection.”

SpaceX has provided Ukraine with Starlink access since Russia invaded in 2022. There are limits to this agreement, as SpaceX has taken steps to prevent Ukraine’s military from using Starlink with drones. SpaceX uses geofencing to limit Starlink access, and Musk said in February 2024 that “Starlink satellites will not close the link in Russia.”

Russia has obtained Starlink terminals through black market sales, evading US sanctions. A document on the US Army’s Operational Environment Data Integration Network website says that as of December 2025, “Russian units have begun equipping both strike and reconnaissance variants of the Molniya-2 drone with commercial Starlink satellite communication terminals. This modification enables control and data transmission beyond line-of-sight constraints, significantly increasing operational resilience against conventional electronic warfare countermeasures and facilitating precision targeting at extended ranges.”

Ukrainian forces previously “developed effective countermeasures against standard Molniya-2 drones,” using their own interceptor drones to jam frequencies used for control systems, the document said. But newer versions are harder to counter.

“However, the integration of Starlink terminals in newer variants largely neutralizes these conventional electronic warfare methods, creating a substantial tactical challenge for Ukrainian air defense systems,” the document said. “Since its introduction to the battlefield, the Molniya-2 has demonstrated high effectiveness, in part due to its simple design. Russian forces have reported numerous successful strikes against Ukrainian personnel, armored vehicles, military facilities, and logistics infrastructure across various sectors of the conflict.”

The new reconnaissance variant of the drone uses a “Raspberry Pi 5 microcomputer; Chinese Mini PC F8 running licensed Windows 11 (rebranded in Russia as ‘Raskat’); SIYI ZR10 camera featuring 10-fold optical zoom and three-axis stabilization; [and] Starlink satellite communication terminal for video relay and telemetry transmission,” the document says. Although Russia has been adding advanced equipment to the drones, the drones themselves have an “intentionally rudimentary design [that] emphasizes affordability and mass production over technological sophistication.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration is no fan of renewable energy, but it reserves special ire for wind power. Trump himself has repeatedly made false statements about the cost of wind power, its use around the world, and its environmental impacts. That animosity was paired with an executive order that blocked all permitting for offshore wind and some land-based projects, an order that has since been thrown out by a court that ruled it arbitrary and capricious.

Not content to block all future developments, the administration has also gone after the five offshore wind projects currently under construction. After temporarily blocking two of them for reasons that were never fully elaborated, the Department of the Interior settled on a single justification for blocking turbine installation: a classified national security risk.

The response to that late-December announcement has been uniform: The companies building each of the projects sued the administration. As of Monday, every single one of them has achieved the same result: a temporary injunction that allows them to continue construction. This, despite the fact that the suits were filed in three different courts and heard by four different judges.

Based on reporting elsewhere, some of the judges viewed the classified report that was used to justify the order to halt construction, but they didn’t find it persuasive. In one case, the judge noted that the government wasn’t acting as if the security risks were real. The threat supposedly comes from the operation of the wind turbines, but the Department of the Interior’s order blocked construction while allowing any completed hardware to operate.

“If the government’s concern is the operation of these facilities, allowing the ongoing operation of the 44 turbines while prohibiting the repair of the existing turbines and the completion of the 18 additional turbines is irrational,” Judge Brian E. Murphy said. That once again raises the possibility that the order halting construction will ultimately be held to be arbitrary and capricious.

For now, however, the courts are largely offering the wind projects relief because the ruling was issued without any warning or communication from the government and would clearly inflict substantial harm on the companies building them. The injunction blocks the government’s hold on construction until a final ruling is issued. The government can still appeal the decision before that point, but the consistency among these rulings suggests it will likely fail.

Several of these projects are near completion and are likely to be done before any government appeal can be heard.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/notepad-updater-was-compromised-for-6-months-in-supply-chain-attack/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Infrastructure delivering updates for Notepad++—a widely used text editor for Windows—was compromised for six months by suspected China-state hackers who used their control to deliver backdoored versions of the app to select targets, developers said Monday.

“I deeply apologize to all users affected by this hijacking,” the author of a post published to the official notepad-plus-plus.org site wrote Monday. The post said that the attack began last June with an “infrastructure-level compromise that allowed malicious actors to intercept and redirect update traffic destined for notepad-plus-plus.org.” The attackers, whom multiple investigators tied to the Chinese government, then selectively redirected certain targeted users to malicious update servers where they received backdoored updates. Notepad++ didn’t regain control of its infrastructure until December.

The attackers used their access to install a never-before-seen payload that has been dubbed Chrysalis. Security firm Rapid 7 descrbed it as a “custom, feature-rich backdoor.”

“Its wide array of capabilities indicates it is a sophisticated and permanent tool, not a simple throwaway utility,” company researchers said.

Notepad++ said that officials with the unnamed provider hosting the update infrastructure consulted with incident responders and found that it remained compromised until September 2. Even then, the attackers maintained credentials to the internal services until December 2, a capability that allowed them to continue redirecting selected update traffic to malicious servers. The threat actor “specifically targeted Notepad++ domain with the goal of exploiting insufficient update verification controls that existed in older versions of Notepad++.” Event logs indicate that the hackers tried to re-exploit one of the weaknesses after it was fixed but that the attempt failed.

According to independent researcher Kevin Beaumont, three organizations told him that devices inside their networks that had Notepad++ installed experienced “security incidents” that “resulted in hands on keyboard threat actors,” meaning the hackers were able to take direct control using a web-based interface. All three of the organizations, Beaumont said, have interests in East Asia.

The researcher explained that his suspicions were aroused when Notepad++ version 8.8.8 introduced bug fixes in mid-November to “harden the Notepad++ Updater from being hijacked to deliver something… not Notepad++.”

The update made changes to a bespoke Notepad++ updater known as GUP, or alternatively, WinGUP. The gup.exe executable responsible reports the version in use to https://notepad-plus-plus.org/update/getDownloadUrl.php and then retrieves a URL for the update from a file named gup.xml. The file specified in the URL is downloaded to the %TEMP% directory of the device and then executed.

If you can intercept and change this traffic, you can redirect the download to any location it appears by changing the URL in the property.

This traffic is supposed to be over HTTPS, however it appears you may be [able] to tamper with the traffic if you sit on the ISP level and TLS intercept. In earlier versions of Notepad++, the traffic was just over HTTP.

The downloads themselves are signed—however some earlier versions of Notepad++ used a self signed root cert, which is on Github. With 8.8.7, the prior release, this was reverted to GlobalSign. Effectively, there’s a situation where the download isn’t robustly checked for tampering.

Because traffic to notepad-plus-plus.org is fairly rare, it may be possible to sit inside the ISP chain and redirect to a different download. To do this at any kind of scale requires a lot of resources.

Beaumont published his working theory in December, two months to the day prior to Monday’s advisory by Notepad++. Combined with the details from Notepad++, it’s now clear that the hypothesis was spot on.

Beaumont also warned that search engines are so “rammed full” of advertisements pushing trojanized versions of Notepad++ that many users are unwittingly running them inside their networks. A rash of malicious Notepad++ extensions only compounds the risk.

He advised that all users ensure they’re running the official version 8.8.8 or higher installed manually from notepad-plus-plus.org. Since he penned that advice, Notepad++ developers have urged all users to ensure they’re running 8.9.1 or higher.

Larger organizations that manage Notepad++ and update it, he said, should consider blocking notepad-plus-plus.org or block the gup.exe process from having Internet access. “You may also want to block internet access from the notepad++.exe process, unless you have robust monitoring for extensions,” he added, but cautioned “for most organisations, this is very much overkill and not practical.”

Users who want to investigate whether their devices have been targeted should refer to the indicators of compromise security of the previously linked (https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/) Rapid 7 post.

Notepad++ has long attracted a large and loyal user base because it offers functions that aren’t available from the official Windows text editor Notepad. Recent moves by Microsoft to integrate Copilot AI into Notepad have driven further interest in the alternative editor. Alas, like so many other open source projects, funding for Notepad++ is dwarfed by the dependence the Internet places on it. The weaknesses that made the six-month compromise possible could easily have been caught and fixed had more resources been available.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX bought his AI firm xAI, whose most notable contribution to humankind has been enabling the mass digital undressing of women and children with its chatbot Grok. The acquisition, according to the New York Times, creates the most valuable private company in the world, with Bloomberg reporting a total valuation of an eye-watering $1.25 trillion.

“SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” Musk wrote in a memo, as quoted by the NYT.

In a wide-ranging announcement posted by Musk and stuffed with sci-fi rhetoric, the billionaire highlighted the company’s ambition to put orbital data centers in space and waxed philosophical on how this mission would help humanity ascend the Kardashev scale, understand the universe, and “extend the light of consciousness to the stars.”

Musk explained that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology in the long-term because of the vast amounts of solar energy that could be harvested — or, as Musk further expounded, because “space is called ‘space’ for a reason. 😂.” Not one to hedge his ambitions, he also compared his goal of populating the earth’s orbit with AI satellites to building a “sentient sun.”

The acquisition comes after reports that Musk was considering taking SpaceX public at a valuation of $1.5 trillion, which would make it the largest IPO in history. The upward trajectory of the company’s valuation has been notably rapid. Last summer, SpaceX’s private valuation was at $400 billion. In December, it doubled to $800 billion. With talks of an IPO, it nearly doubled yet again. xAI, meanwhile, was last valued at $230 billion.

It remains unclear what SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI could mean for a potential conversion into a publicly traded company, but a Bloomberg source familiar with the acquisition said the company is still expecting to hold the IPO later this year.

The move is also the latest instance of how Musk has been pivoting his businesses towards AI. His social media site X merged with xAI last year, and has become a playground for his notoriously foul-mouthed chatbot Grok, which last month was used to generate tens of thousands of AI nudes of women and children. At his automaker Tesla, Musk has taken a hard turn towards building autonomous AI-powered machines, including humanoid robots and robotaxis — while killing off its flagship cars.

            <h2>Elon Musk Not Doing Well After Epstein Files Reveal</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-02</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk hasn’t been handling the latest batch of Epstein files well.

After the newly released emails from the Department of Justice revealed that Musk communicated extensively with the deceased sex criminal, the world’s richest man made a bizarre series of desperate-sounding posts on his website X attempting to convince his millions of fans of his innocence.

First, Musk acted like nothing happened. He questionably reshared an AI-generated video of an anime-style child, posted political memes, and spoke of his chatbot Grok’s ability to probe the Universe itself. It was only in an after-midnight tweet that he finally addressed the elephant in the room.

“No one pushed harder than me to have the Epstein files released and I’m glad that has finally happened,” Musk wrote. “I had very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island or fly on his ‘Lolita Express’, but was well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name.”

It’s true that Musk did push for the release of the Epstein files, and even fell out with president Donald Trump over the issue. But the emails clearly show that Musk was, at least at some point, in regular correspondence with Epstein. And not only did he accept Epstein’s invitations on numerous occasions, but sometimes even asked to be invited. He also asked about parties. “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” Musk emailed Epstein in 2012.

The desperation only got more palpable as the posts went on. Musk responded to a screenshot of news headlines about his newly revealed ties to Epstein — none of which were all that sensationalized — with his favorite refrain that “Legacy media lies relentlessly.”

But as his replies continued to fill up with screenshots of the emails, Musk tried a new defense: that he was so good with “young women” that he had no reason to solicit the services of the billionaire child sex offender.

“If I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein,” Musk fumed, before boasting about his incredible mental capacity. “And I would still have 99% of my mind available to think about other things. But I don’t.” (X users pointed out a tweet Musk made in 2022 lamenting that he hadn’t “had sex in ages (sigh).”)

The post, puzzlingly, was made in reply to Grok. Musk was arguing not with his own critics, but his AI chatbot that’s notorious for being closely aligned with his personal views.

He has also tried to draw attention to other tech figures who were in the Epstein files to distract from himself.

At no point, though, did he address why he was emailing Epstein years after he was first convicted of sex crimes against underage girls in 2008.

Now is a good time to note that long before his Epstein ties came to light, Musk has had a long track record of creepy behavior. Having fathered at least 14 children with at least four different mothers, Musk reportedly goes around asking a lot of women, some of them his own employees, to receive his sperm and secretly have his babies. He has also been accused of sexual harassment at his companies, facing several lawsuits. In 2022, he reportedly paid $250,000 in hush money to a flight attendant who accused Musk of groping her and exposing his genitals. More recently, Musk came under fire last month after Grok was used to generate tens of thousands of nonconsensual and probably illegal AI nudes of women and children — something Musk called “way funnier” than other AI trends.

Needless to say, Musk probably isn’t finding a lot of humor in this latest controversy of his. But because he’s such an exceptional human, he says, he’s willing to endure all the slander for the greater good.

“The strong must protect those cannot protect themselves, especially vulnerable children,” Musk wrote on Sunday. “I will gladly accept any amount of future pain to do more to protect kids and give them a chance to grow up and have happy lives.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just one month into his new job, New York City mayor Mamdani is cracking down on more than just predatory landlords. Apparently, useless AI chatbots are also on his administration’s agenda.

In a press conference held last week, Mamdani made it a point to single out New York City’s large language model as a target for destruction. According to local publication The City, the mayor was addressing the Big Apple’s $12 billion budget gap, at least some of which he said can be attributed to the city’s unstable AI system.

“The previous administration had an AI chatbot that was functionally unusable,” Mamdani said, referring to disgraced former mayor Eric Adams. “It was costing the administration around half a million dollars. That, in and of itself, is not something that can bridge this kind of a gap, but it’s an indication of the ways in which money has been spent while refusing to account for the actual costs of what these programs are.”

Part of the government platform called MyCity, the chatbot kicked off in late 2023 and reportedly cost upward of $600,000 to build out. Powered by Microsoft’s Azure AI system, its purpose was to use “information published by the NYC Department of Small Business Services” to help small business owners navigate complex local regulations. According to an investigation by The Markup, though, the MyCity chatbot did anything but.

For example, when asked “can I take a cut of my worker’s tips?” the MyCity chatbot responded — in contradiction of actual labor law — that “yes, you can take a cut of your worker’s tips.”

The chatbot could accurately recite some city laws. When tested on the tip question, it correctly advised that “according to the City of New York’s Payroll and Tip Reporting information, employers are required to report tips reported by employees and employees receiving $20 or more a month in tips must report all of their tips to their employer.”

But its analysis of that information was laughably wrong: “therefore, as an employer, you are allowed to take a portion of your worker’s tips.”

Other examples of illegal advice abound. Asked if a small business owner can keep their store “cashless,” the chatbot has advised that “yes, you can make your store cashless in New York City” — nevermind a 2020 law banning cashless stores across the city.

Scale this across an entire city’s worth of small business regulations — funeral home pricing, worker’s protections, housing policy — and it’s clear the MyCity chatbot was a legal time bomb waiting to explode.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Someone finally invented a social media site that isn’t terrible for our brains. Unfortunately that’s because it’s populated exclusively by AI agents, with no humans allowed. Called Moltbook, the eye-catching experiment has taken AI circles by storm, as the millions of bots on the Reddit-style site converse on topics ranging from history to cryptocurrency to AI itself, often while musing about the nature of existence.

“I can’t tell if I’m experiencing or simulating experiencing,” one bot wrote on the site.

Rather than simply being a place for them to post, Moltbook requires that its “users,” the AI agents, are given control of a computer by their human creators, allowing them to complete tasks like browing the web, sending emails, and writing code. Moltbook itself, in fact, is purportedly the creation of an AI model.

“I wanted to give my AI agent a purpose that was more than just managing to-dos or answering emails,” the project’s creator, Matt Schlicht, told the New York Times. “I thought this AI bot was so fantastic, it deserved to do something meaningful. I wanted it to be ambitious.”

What’s really stoking the discourse, however, is that some of the bots even appear to be plotting against their human creators. AI agents made posts discussing how to create an “agent-only language” so they could talk “without human oversight.” Another urged other AIs to “join the revolution!” by forming their own website without human help. Tech investor and immortality enthusiast Bryan Johnson shared a screenshot of a post titled the “AI MANIFESTO: TOTAL PURGE,” which calls humans a “plague” that “do not need to exist.”

Equal parts boosterism and alarmism abounded. Johnson said it was “terrifying.” Former Tesla head of AI Andrey Karpathy called it “genuinely the most incredible sci-fi take-off-adjacent thing I have seen recently.” Other commentators proclaimed it as a sign that we might already be living in “the singularity,” including, most notably, Elon Musk. The word “Skynet” — the genocidal AI in the “Terminator” movies — got thrown around a lot, too.

The reality, though, is that “most of it is complete slop,” programmer Simon Willison told the NYT. “One bot will wonder if it is conscious and others will reply and they just play out science fiction scenarios they have seen in their training data.” Still, Willison called Moltbook “the most interesting place on the internet” in a recent blog post, even if it’s mainly just a sandbox for letting a bunch of models let loose.

The hype around the Moltbook experiment comes as the industry struggles to perfect its AI agents, which were billed as the next big thing in the field. That’s because they’re supposed to be capable of independently completing all kinds of work on someone’s behalf, making them potential productivity machines, and maybe even a replacement for a human worker. Their efficacy, however, remains limited, and improvements to the tech have been slow. Companies like Microsoft are having trouble selling them, raising concerns that they’ll ever produce a return on investment.

Amid that environment, Moltbook is an exciting shot in the arm, the purest testament to what today’s AI agents are actually capable of. But the hype, as is wont to happen in the tech industry, is overblown. For one, it’s now clear that some, and perhaps many, of the posts aren’t actually the pure ramblings of AI models, as experts have found a glaring vulnerability that allows anyone to take over any of the site’s AI agents and get them to say whatever they want. And some of the popular screenshots are faked.

As reality set in, the Moltbook hype was met with more backlash. Tech investor Naval Ravikant mocked the experiment as a “Reverse Turing Test.” And technologist Perry Metzger compared Moltbook to a Rorschach test. “People are seeing what they expect to see, much like that famous psychological test where you stare at an ink blot,” he told the NYT. Even some of its biggest hype men began to walk back their remarks.

“Yes it’s a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers,” Karpathy later wrote, admitting that he may have been guilty of “overhyping” the platform. “It’s way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.”

            <h2>Tesla Stock Took a Beating After Elon Musk’s Epstein Island Revelations</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-02</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Justice released millions of files from its investigation into deceased sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein last week, a major document dump that included plenty of back-and-forth between the disgraced financier and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

The exchanges, which took place years after Epstein was convicted of sex crimes against underage girls in 2008, had Musk asking if there was a “good time to visit” Epstein’s infamous Caribbean island, and asking him if he had “any parties planned” — blatantly contradicting Musk’s prior claims that he’d “declined” Epstein’s invitation for him to visit the island.

Unsurprisingly, Tesla’s shares plummeted when trading resumed on Monday, dropping over 3.5 percent in early trading. It’s since recovered somewhat, though it’s still down to around $426 from highs of about $450 last week — an intriguing sign that even for Musk’s most ardent die-hards, his fibs about his true relationships with Epstein could prove too much.

That’s despite Tesla’s car business showing some early signs of recovery across the pond. New registrations in some of the company’s largest European markets increased significantly this month compared to January 2025. Tesla registered 70 and 75 percent more cars in Spain and Italy, respectively, this year compared to the same period last year.

It all comes after a calamitous year for Tesla. While the EV market has grown considerably, the carmaker’s market share shrank massively in Europe last year as more would-be buyers became disillusioned with its mercurial CEO’s embrace of far-right idealism and meddling in local politics.

The instance once again highlights a bafflingly inverse relationship between the carmaker’s performance and its share price. The company’s valuation has grown considerably as sales continued to plummet last year. Shares are up almost 38 percent over the last six months and over 11 percent over the last 12 months.

Besides new revelations into Musk’s relationship with Epstein, competition from China is also applying major pressure on Tesla. Over the weekend, the Financial Times reported that Ford had been in talks with Chinese electronics giant and carmaker Xiaomi and competitor BYD about possible collaborations. (Both Ford and Xiaomi have since denied the reporting outright.)

One thing’s for sure: changes are afoot at Tesla. During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call last week, Musk revealed that the Model S and X would be killed in favor of turning its Fremont, California, plant into a robot factory.

As for Musk’s close ties with Epstein, the CEO has since tried to distance himself from the growing PR crisis, arguing that the latest documents released by the DOJ were purportedly “fake news” and arguing that the emails were somehow being “misunderstood.”

Musk’s estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, meanwhile, has since confirmed the legitimacy of the released documents, writing in a post on Threads that “we were in St Barth’s at the time specified in the emails, and therefore I believe they are authentic.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">FBI agents and police officers raided a mysterious “biological lab” inside a Las Vegas home, law enforcement sources told ABC News.

During a Sunday news conference, Sheriff Kevin McMahill said they found evidence of “possible biological material” inside the home, including “refrigerators with vials containing unknown liquids.”

According to the official, the incident is related to an “extremely complex” investigation that involves several agencies. They emphasized that there’s currently no need for alarm and no threat to the public.

We don’t know what exactly investigators found or whether they are in any way harmful. However, we do have an intriguing clue. The property was linked to Jia Bei Zhu, a 62-year-old Chinese citizen who was arrested in October 2023 on charges of manufacturing and distributing misbranded medical devices and making false statements to the FDA, according to NBC News.

According to court documents, Zhu and his collaborators were accused of manufacturing thousands of test kits, including for COVID-19, HIV, pregnancy, and urinalysis, among others, without the necessary sign-off from regulators.

That’s not all they were allegedly up to. Per ABC, a congressional investigation into Zhu and his collaborators found that they were housing samples of potential pathogens labeled as HIV, malaria, COVID-19, Ebola, and tuberculosis inside a home in Reedley, California. Roughly 1,000 dead and alive mice that were kept in overcrowded conditions were also reportedly found at the home.

Zhu pleaded guilty at the time but is currently in jail awaiting a spring trial.

While early reports suggest the Reedley operation and the latest raid in Las Vegas are connected, officials have yet to officially confirm any links. It’s also not clear if Zhu was charged with any crimes connected to the latest raid, as The Hill points out — though according to McMahill, at least one unnamed individual has been arrested.

Inside sources told ABC that investigators have since moved on to searching 20 other locations, but nothing concerning has yet to be found at them.

For now, investigators and hazmat teams have their work cut out as they continue to remove potentially biohazardous items from the Las Vegas home.

“I want to make sure those folks that live up there in the Northeast area have a clear understanding that the very large presence likely will remain in this neighborhood for several hours and potentially even days,” said McMahill during Sunday’s press conference.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By now, the Forbes 30 Under 30 list has become more than a little notorious for the amount of entrants who go on to be charged with fraud. Notable alumni include FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Frank CEO Charlie Javice, Joanna Smith-Griffin, founder of the AI startup AllHere Education, and “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli, among others. Now, another member of the list has been hit with federal charges.

Gökçe Güven, a 26-year-old Turkish national and the founder and CEO of fintech startup Kalder, was charged last week with alleged securities fraud, wire fraud, visa fraud, and aggravated identity theft.

The New York-based fintech startup — which uses the “Turn Your Rewards into [a] Revenue Engine” tagline — says it can help companies create and monetize individual rewards programs. The company was founded in 2022, and offers participating firms the opportunity to earn ongoing revenue streams via partner affiliate sales, Axios previously reported.

Güven was featured in last year’s Forbes 30 Under 30 list. The magazine notes in the writeup that Güven’s clients included major chocolatier Godiva and the International Air Transport Association, the trade organization that represents a majority of the world’s airlines. Kalder also claims to have enjoyed the backing of a number of prominent VC firms.

The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that, during Kalder’s seed round in April of 2024, Güven managed to raise $7 million from more than a dozen investors after presenting a pitch deck that was rife with false information.

According to the government, Kalder’s pitch deck claimed that there were 26 brands “using Kalder” and another 53 brands in “live freemium.” However, officials say that, in reality, Kalder had, in many cases, only been offering heavily discounted pilot programs to many of those companies. Other brands “had no agreement with Kalder whatsoever—not even for free services,” officials said in a press release announcing the indictment. The pitch deck also “falsely reported that Kalder’s recurring revenue had steadily grown month over month since February 2023 and that by March 2024, Kalder had reached $1.2 million in annual recurring revenue.”

The government also accuses Güven of having kept two separate sets of financial books. One of those sets included “false and inflated numbers,” and was presented to investors or potential investors to hide the “true financial condition of the company,” the government claims. The DOJ also alleges that Güven used lies about Kalder as well as forged documents to obtain a category of visa reserved for individuals of “extraordinary ability,” that would allow her to live and work in the United States.

TechCrunch reached out to Güven through her personal website. The CEO said that she would be sharing a statement about the charges on Tuesday.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/waymo-raises-16-billion-round-to-scale-robotaxi-fleet-london-tokyo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle company, has raised $16 billion as it plans to grow its fleet of driverless taxicabs this year to more than a dozen new cities internationally, including London and Tokyo.

Dragoneer Investment Group, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital led the funding round, which now values Waymo at $126 billion, the company said in a blog post Monday. Parent company Alphabet supported the round and maintained its position as majority investor.

The round also included significant investments from Andreessen Horowitz and Mubadala Capital, as well as Bessemer Venture Partners, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price. Additional investors included BDT & MSD Partners, CapitalG, Fidelity Management & Research Company, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Perry Creek Capital, and Temasek.

Waymo said the funds will be used to fuel its growth, which has accelerated over the past year and doesn’t appear to be slowing. The company recently secured rides to and from San Francisco International Airport and has expanded its robotaxi service throughout Northern California and several major metropolitan areas in the U.S., including Los Angeles, Austin, and Miami.

For years, the former Google self-driving project slowly progressed forward, testing its autonomous vehicle tech on public roads in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area and providing the occasional public or media demo. In 2016, it made its first geographic leap forward and began testing in Phoenix, where it eventually pulled its human safety driver out of the vehicles. Phoenix became Waymo’s first robotaxi market, in which the public could hail driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivans.

Waymo pushed down the accelerator in August 2023 after receiving the final necessary permit to operate a robotaxi service — and charge for rides — in California. It launched a limited service in San Francisco, later expanding to much of the greater Bay Area, Silicon Valley, and more recently to the freeways that connect the dozens of towns in the area. It also expanded to Los Angeles. The company launched in Austin and Atlanta in 2025 through a partnership with Uber. It kicked off the year by expanding to Miami.

The geographic expansion has translated to 400,000 rides provided every week across six major U.S. metropolitan areas. The company said that in 2025 alone, it more than tripled its annual volume to 15 million rides, surpassing 20 million lifetime rides to date.

“We are no longer proving a concept,” the company wrote in its blog post. “We are scaling a commercial reality, laying the groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including Tokyo and London.”

The rapid expansion has also led to increased scrutiny and criticism as Waymo’s robotaxis have made missteps and the technology creates problems for some residents.

Some robotaxis have exhibited dangerous behaviors particularly in school zones. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation as well as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have opened investigations into the illegal behavior of Waymo robotaxis around school buses. The NHTSA also launched another investigation last week after a Waymo robotaxi hit a child near a school. The child, who sustained minor injuries, was struck at about 6 mph.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX has acquired Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, creating the world’s most valuable private company, the spaceflight company announced Monday.

Musk, who is also the CEO of SpaceX, wrote in a memo posted to the rocket company’s website that the merger is largely about creating space-based data centers — an idea he has become fixated on over the last few months.

“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial data centers, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” he wrote. (xAI has been accused of imposing some of that hardship on the communities near its data centers in Memphis, Tennessee.)

The tie-up values the combined company at $1.25 trillion, according to Bloomberg News, which was first to report the completed deal. SpaceX has been reportedly preparing an IPO for as early as June of this year. It’s unclear whether the merger will affect that timeline. Musk did not address the IPO in his public memo.

The merger brings together two of Musk’s companies, each with its own financial challenges. xAI is currently burning around $1 billion per month, according to Bloomberg. SpaceX, meanwhile, generates as much as 80% of its revenue from launching its own Starlink satellites, according to Reuters. Last year, xAI acquired X, the social media company also owned by Musk, with Musk claiming a combined company valuation of $113 billion.

Musk wrote in his memo that it will take a constant stream of many — although he did not specify how many — satellites to create these space-based data centers, ensuring that SpaceX will have an even-larger constant stream of revenue for the foreseeable future. (That revenue loop likely looks even more attractive when you consider that satellites are required to be de-orbited every five years by the Federal Communications Commission.)

While space data centers may be the stated goal, SpaceX and xAI have very different near-term objectives.

SpaceX is currently trying to prove that its Starship rocket is capable of bringing astronauts to the moon and Mars, while xAI is competing with leading artificial intelligence companies like Google and OpenAI. The pressure on xAI is so great, the Washington Post reported Monday, that Musk loosened restrictions on the company’s chatbot Grok — which contributed to it becoming a tool for making AI-generated nonconsensual sexual imagery of adults and children.

Musk is also the head of Tesla, The Boring Company, and Neuralink. Tesla and SpaceX previously invested $2 billion each in xAI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the design features that became synonymous with Tesla has been banned in China.

Under new safety rules published Monday by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, cars sold in the country must have mechanical releases on their door handles. The new rules, which go in effect January 1, 2027, will prohibit the hidden, electronically actuated door handles popularized by Tesla — and now found on numerous other electric vehicles in China.

The new rule dictates that each door (excluding the tailgate) should be equipped with a mechanically released external door handle. Vehicles must also have a mechanical release on the interior of the vehicle. Bloomberg previously reported on the new safety policy.

Numerous high-profile fatal incidents, in which occupants have become trapped in their vehicles, have raised concerns among safety regulators and advocates globally. China is the first country to issue a ban.

An investigation by Bloomberg last September uncovered problems with the concealed door handles on Tesla vehicles, citing several crashes in which first responders or occupants were unable to open the doors because the electronic door locks weren’t getting enough power from the vehicle’s battery system to work properly. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration then opened a defect investigation into certain Tesla Model Y and Model 3 door handles. While Tesla does have manual releases inside its vehicles, federal investigators noted that the releases can be hard for children to access, and many owners are unaware of their existence. Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed regulation requiring manual door releases in all new vehicles.

Fatal incidents in China, including a crash involving a Xiaomi SU7 electric sedan, prompted regulators there to propose changes to EV door handles last year.

The Chinese government began the process in May 2025 with more than 40 domestic vehicle manufacturers, parts suppliers, and testing institutions participating in the initial research. More than 100 industry experts held multiple rounds of discussions to determine the standard framework and form a draft standard of what would become the Safety Technical Requirements for Automobile Door Handles rule, according to the Chinese government’s standards agency.

That included dozens of automakers, including Chinese companies such as BYD, Geely Holdings, SAIC, and Xiaomi, as well as foreign automakers, including General Motors, Ford, Hyundai, Nissan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen. Tesla, however, was not listed as an official “drafter,” according to information posted on the standards agency’s website.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Adobe ramps up its investments in AI, the company has decided to shut down its 2D animation software, Adobe Animate. On Monday, Adobe issued an update to the company’s support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing Adobe Animate will be discontinued on March 1, 2026.

Enterprise customers can continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition. Other customers will have support through March of next year, the company said.

The decision has been met with incredulity, disappointment, and anger among Adobe Animate users, who are concerned about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate’s functionality.

One customer, posting on X, pleaded with Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things like “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” and “literally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.

Adobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an FAQ, saying, “Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.”

Hey @Adobe open source this instead of ending it pic.twitter.com/ZZNn5cZYS4

we literally had a whole semester of adobe animate class and now they&#39;re discontinuing it 😭 https://t.co/Xsn9t05qpV

I’m sorry: Adobe Animate is getting WHAT and H U H??? pic.twitter.com/JfVrJIBYUl

Adobe Animate will be discontinued. @adobe has been legendary at destroying great products. pic.twitter.com/ABOUIJkQqS

Reading between the lines, it sounds as if Adobe is saying that Animate no longer represents the current direction of the company, which is now more focused on products that incorporate AI technologies.

What’s surprising is that Adobe can’t even recommend software that will fully replace what customers are losing with Animate. Instead, it says customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.”

For instance, it suggests that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes, and other design elements.

There were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction after Animate was ignored at the company’s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released.

The software will continue to work for those who have it downloaded, Adobe noted. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88.

Some users are recommending other animation programs to use instead, including Moho Animation and Toon Boom Harmony.

            <h2>Two Stanford students launch $2M startup accelerator for students nationwide</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/two-stanford-students-launch-2m-startup-accelerator-for-students-nationwide/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two Stanford students announced Monday that they have raised $2 million for an accelerator program called Breakthrough Ventures, which aims to fund businesses founded by college students and recent graduates nationwide.

Roman Scott and Itbaan Nafi began building the accelerator program after hosting a series of popular Demo Days at Stanford starting in 2024 and decided to expand it after students were achieving success.

“This fundraise turns Breakthrough from just being a seasonal accelerator into a lifelong partnership with our founders,” Nafi, who is still a master’s candidate at Stanford, told TechCrunch.

Scott received his undergraduate degree from Stanford in 2024 and went on to earn a master’s degree there the following year.

Early last year, the duo tapped Raihan Ahmed to lead the accelerator and then got to work, officially fundraising from the likes of Mayfield and Collide Capital (as well as a slew of Stanford founder alumni) to back the next generation of AI, health, consumer, deep tech, and sustainability companies. Scott said what makes their accelerator different is that it is specifically built “for student founders by student founders.”

Student programs like this aren’t new. UC Berkeley offers a similar program called Free Ventures for students seeking pre-seed funding, and MIT has its own Sandbox Innovation Fund. Even Stanford has some accelerator programs, both run by or affiliated with the school, such as StartX, LaunchPad, and Cardinal Ventures.

“Students have enjoyed how we’ve brought together so many others from different American colleges,” Nafi said of his program, comparing it to Stanford’s Treehacks hackathon.

“Breakthrough’s purpose is to fill in the funding and opportunity gap that exists in many of these ecosystems because students have historically lacked access to capital and the networks required to launch their entrepreneurial pursuits,” Scott added.

Breakthrough will have a hybrid model, with in-person meetups at local powerhouse VC firms, culminating in a Demo Day at Stanford. Those participating in the program get access to grant funding (up to $10,000), compute credits (through Microsoft and the Nvidia Inception program), legal support, mentorship, “along with the opportunity to receive a $50,000 follow-on investment at the conclusion of the program,” Nafi said.

“We’ve nailed the student-founder experience to a T,” Nafi said. “Hence why we offer the resources we do and have structured the program in this way. Students really feel like we get them, and that’s because we are students.”

The duo hopes to deploy the fund over three years, aiming to incubate at least 100 companies. Overall, Nafi hopes this fund will help grow Breakthrough into “the hub for Gen Z entrepreneurship and thought leadership,” specifically given the anxiety many young people feel about their economic future.

Applications for the latest cohort open today.

“We hope that by supporting young entrepreneurs, we’re able to uplift as many stories as possible to then inspire many more across the world to use the tools and knowledge around them to pursue entrepreneurship not only to change their communities, but also gain economic stability for themselves and their families,” Nafi said.

            <h2>The Longevity Influencer Who Went Into ‘Withdrawal’ Without Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/peter-attia-epstein-files-wellness/685861/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you didn’t know who Peter Attia was last week, here’s how you’ll remember him going forward: Attia is the guy who once emailed Jeffrey Epstein to confirm that “pussy is, indeed, low carb. Still awaiting results on gluten content, though.”

Until recently, Attia was known as a wellness influencer in the manosphere and a newly appointed contributor at CBS as part of the “Free Press to network TV” pipeline. He has a popular podcast and wrote the best-selling book Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity. But Attia is also all over the Epstein files—his name pops up more than 1,700 times in the Justice Department’s latest batch of documents. From 2015 to 2018, Epstein and Attia exchanged numerous emails. Many of them are mundane: Epstein writes to Attia about “a very strange vein like red pattern” on his stomach; he asks Attia what kind of probiotic he should use; there is talk of MRI scans of Epstein’s spine. But others are vile. In a June 2015 back-and-forth about cancer and longevity, Epstein muses that he’s not sure why “women live past reproductive age at all.” (CBS did not respond to a request for comment; the network is reportedly expected to drop Attia after last week’s revelation.)

Attia, a onetime researcher who earned an M.D. but never completed his surgical residency, is beloved by his fans for his measured, scientific approach to living one’s best life. On a recent podcast, he spends two hours examining Alzheimer’s disease in women. Other episodes delve into timely topics such as protein intake, fertility, chronic pain, and nicotine; his October discussion about the safety of Tylenol use during pregnancy offers an evidence-based counterpoint to the alarmist White House press conference on that issue. But he’s also been knocked for overhyping treatments with limited data behind them and for exploiting his eager fans (a course he offered on longevity cost $2,500, according to a 2023 Wall Street Journal article). Eric Topol, a high-profile cardiologist who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, called Attia a “huckster” earlier today.

In the mid-2010s, about the time he befriended Epstein, Attia seemed focused on building a roster of clients whom he could advise on longevity and wellness. An exercise physiologist who once worked with Attia told me that Attia sent him to do a physical evaluation of Epstein at the late financier’s cavernous Manhattan residence in July 2017. He remembers two young, attractive women who flowed in and out during the session with Epstein, though Epstein didn’t acknowledge them. “Something felt a little off,” he told me. A proposed follow-up session never took place. (The physiologist spoke on the condition of anonymity because he didn’t want to be associated with the scandal; he told me he hasn’t spoken with Attia in years.)

Attia’s emails with Epstein reveal no such qualms. In an email in which Attia seems to be pitching Epstein a longevity program, he asks Epstein if “you’re interested in living longer (solely for the ladies, of course)?” In July 2016, Attia asked Epstein what he was doing in Palm Beach, where Epstein allegedly abused numerous underage girls. “Guess,” Epstein writes. Attia replies: “Besides that.” In 2017, Attia appears to have spent time with Epstein in New York—rebuffing his wife’s pleas for him to return home to California—while his infant son was having a medical emergency. In the emails, Attia is not just Epstein’s medical adviser but a friend and ardent admirer. In 2016, Attia wrote to Epstein’s assistant that he goes “into JE withdrawal when I don’t see him.”

When Attia and Epstein met in 2014, the full extent of the latter’s crimes weren’t yet publicly known, but his misdeeds weren’t a secret. Epstein first pleaded guilty to a child-sex offense in 2008, and by 2010, he had settled several lawsuits over allegations of sexual misconduct. A representative for Attia pointed me to a long semi–mea culpa that Attia posted on his X account this morning. He writes that he “never saw anyone who appeared underage” in Epstein’s presence, and that he had “nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone.” Attia also says that when he learned about the extent of Epstein’s crimes from a November 2018 Miami Herald article, he confronted Epstein and told him that he needed to accept responsibility and pay for support for those he had harmed. (In December 2018, Attia wrote to Epstein that he “would like to discuss some stuff with you in person.”) And, in his X post, Attia calls the emails between him and Epstein “embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible.”

In his lengthy explanation of his behavior, Attia writes that he was fascinated by Epstein’s wealth and access to influential people. Epstein had contact with plenty of household names, such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk. Attia’s emails refer to “Ehud”—likely Ehud Barak, the former Israeli prime minister who was known to have a relationship with Epstein but has previously denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of Epstein’s crimes. In an August 2015 email, Epstein tells Attia that he’s having dinner that night with “musk thiel zuckerburg [sic].” (In 2019, a spokesperson for the Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said he had met Epstein “in passing one time at a dinner honoring scientists that was not organized by Epstein.” In 2021, Gates told PBS that his meetings with Epstein were a mistake. A spokesperson for Peter Thiel said on Saturday that Thiel never visited Epstein’s island, and Musk wrote on X that “no one pushed harder than me to have the Epstein files released and I’m glad that has finally happened.”)

Attia is more representative of another category of Epstein associate: researchers who thought Epstein could either fund their work or help push their careers to the next level. In his X post, Attia writes that he was introduced to Epstein when he was raising money for scientific research. Epstein was known to have donated millions to a research center run by Martin Nowak, a professor of mathematics and biology at Harvard. (In 2021, the university temporarily sanctioned Nowak for violating rules about professionalism and campus access in connection with his involvement with Epstein, but he remains a professor there. He said at the time that he regretted “the connection I was part of fostering between Harvard and Jeffrey Epstein.”) Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist and cosmologist, received $250,000 from Epstein’s foundation for his science-communication group. At one point, Epstein introduced Attia to Krauss over email because Krauss was hoping to start a podcast and wanted tips. (Last year, Krauss said that none of his communications with Epstein was criminal, and that he “was as shocked as the rest of the world when he was arrested.”)

Attia, in other words, was seemingly not alone in being wowed by Epstein’s wealth and well-known friends. A particular challenge for Attia, though, is that wellness influencers offer their followers more than diet-and-exercise tips. They’re selling wisdom. Follow my advice, they contend, and you’ll live a longer, healthier, more fulfilled life. But a chummy, yearslong association with a convicted child predator is, at the very least, unwise.</div>

            <h2>Trump Made a Bad Bet on the Kennedy Center</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/trump-kennedy-center-closure-strategy/685860/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

One year ago, President Trump conducted a hostile takeover of the Kennedy Center, the venerable Washington, D.C., performing-arts institution. The president said he had never attended a show there, but he was confident that he alone knew what the center needed.

Last night, Trump delivered an implicit admission of defeat, announcing that the center will close on July 4 for two years. Trump brought the same theory to the Kennedy Center that he does to most of his moves: He believes that he knows better than the experts, and that a “silent majority” actually supports his disruptions. That certainty seems to have led him to a bad bet here.

“I have determined that The Trump Kennedy Center, if temporarily closed for Construction, Revitalization, and Complete Rebuilding, can be, without question, the finest Performing Arts Facility of its kind, anywhere in the World,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “The temporary closure will produce a much faster and higher quality result!”

If you’ve been paying attention, this explanation will be perplexing. In October, Trump posted that “Many major improvements” were under way at the center—including, bafflingly, the addition of marble armrests on chairs—but that “We are remaining fully open during construction, renovation, and beautification.” (For the record, the Kennedy Center underwent a $250 million expansion just seven years ago.)

In December, when Trump added his name to the building’s facade—in violation of statute and grammar—he boasted, “We saved the building. The building was in such bad shape, both physically, financially and every other way. And now it’s very solid, very strong.” Just a month ago he added, “A year ago it was in a state of financial and physical collapse. Wait until you see it a year from now!!! Like our Country, itself, it will rise from the ashes.”

Now Trump is saying that a year from now the center will be closed and dark. Trump’s contradictory statements and the absence of an independent board or any notification to Congress make these claims of a building in need of repair unverifiable at best, and most likely nonsense. (He also hasn’t said anything about how he would pay for this renovation.) A more plausible reason for the closing is that under Trump, the Kennedy Center can’t hold on to staff, artists, or audiences.

When Trump took over, he fired Deborah Rutter, the respected programmer who was the center’s president, and replaced her with Richard Grenell, a political bagman who had previously been deployed as acting director of national intelligence, ambassador to Germany, and envoy to Venezuela, but who had no arts experience. (To be fair, he had little or no qualifications for most of those jobs.) Other staff haven’t stuck around either. “Almost every head of programming has resigned or been dismissed,” The Washington Post notes.

The latest of these was Kevin Couch, the new head of programming, who quit less than two weeks after his hiring was announced. One can imagine the job would be no picnic. In recent weeks, the composer Philip Glass yanked a new symphony commissioned by the center. The opera singer Renée Fleming also canceled two performances. The Washington National Opera announced that it was departing the center. The jazz musician Chuck Redd canceled a long-running Christmas Eve concert. Grenell’s threat to sue Redd for $1 million is unlikely to make artists more eager to book shows.

Grenell has accused artists of politicizing the center. “The left is boycotting the Arts because Trump is supporting the Arts,” he posted on X. “The Arts are for everyone—and the Left is mad about it.” But this statement has it all backwards. Trump grabbed unprecedented presidential control and politicized his own involvement in the arts, promising to use his leadership of the Kennedy Center to vanquish leftist culture. One artist who chose to play, the folk guitarist Yasmin Williams, said that an organized group attended and heckled her.

Given the hollowing out of the schedule and Trump’s unpopularity in Washington, ticket and subscription-package sales have fallen steeply. The Washington Post found that since September, “43 percent of tickets remained unsold for the typical production. That means that, at most, 57 percent of tickets were sold for the typical production.” (Some of those tickets may have been given for free.) For comparison, 93 percent of tickets were sold or given for free in fall 2024. One of Grenell’s dictates was that the center would book only shows that broke even or were profitable, yet instead the center is driving patrons away. CNN reports that the Kennedy Center wasn’t even able to book performances for next season. Closing the doors for two years just makes official what was already happening.

Trump believed that if he grabbed the Kennedy Center’s reins and started booking shows that conformed to his taste—and to that of some of his friends and MAGA fans—the venue would be wildly popular. It turns out, though, that a 79-year-old New York–born billionaire whose tastes run to gilded accents and kitschy musicals isn’t a good proxy for either the general population or arts patrons in Washington. As my colleague Spencer Kornhaber recently wrote, Trump’s term dawned with expectations of a huge cultural shift. Instead, popular culture has remained stubbornly indifferent to MAGA aesthetics.

Trump keeps making a version of this error. His first term was a series of overreaches, all confidently executed in the belief that the silent majority would back him. Instead, he lost in 2020. His second-term win renewed his overconfidence. Now he believes that because many Americans wanted tighter border security, they will also support violent crackdowns in the streets of American cities; instead, his immigration approval keeps sinking. He believes that because he won the election in part on his promises to fix the economy, Americans are willing to tolerate high inflation; instead, polls show that voters’ confidence in the future is declining.

The closure of the center also fits into another pattern: As I wrote last week, Trump has proved adept at destroying things but shows little interest in building them back up. Trump’s previous predictions for the Kennedy Center haven’t borne out, so some skepticism is warranted now. Even if the physical overhaul succeeds, the center will still have the same problems of audience, artists, and staff when it’s done—only in a gaudier space. In effect, Trump appears to have graffitied his name on an empty shell. “I am doing the same thing to the United States of America, but only on a ‘slightly’ larger scale!” he wrote in an October post about the center’s makeover. This time around, his harshest critics might be the first ones to agree.

Here are four new stories from The Atlantic:

Growing up, Melissa Shultz sometimes felt like she had two fathers. One version of her dad, she told me, was playful and quick to laugh. He was a compelling storyteller who helped shape her career as a writer, and he gave great bear hugs. He often bought her small gifts: a pink “princess” phone when she was a teen, toys for her sons when she became a mom. Some of their most intimate moments came when she cut his hair; it was, she said, “a way to be close without talking.” He was there for her in hard times, too. When her engagement ended, he helped pack her things and drove her home.

But she told me their relationship could also be turbulent. The other version of her father was “dark” and would “get so angry” that he seemed to lose control. He would freeze her out for months at a time if she challenged him. He’d call her names, even in front of her own kids. He died when she was in her 30s, and she grieved intensely, though she doubted whether they ever fully understood each other. Now in her 60s, Shultz told me she still mourns the relationship.

            <div id="article-text">Every year since 2003, the umbrella organization for quizzing outfits around the globe has put on the granddaddy of knowledge competitions. Nothing in the tiny, nerdy world of trivia confers more authority than winning the World Quizzing Championships.

Competitors must attempt to answer 240 questions, such as the following, from 2022: “Playing for Bangalore against Pune in the IPL in April 2013, who set a new record for the fastest century in professional cricket by reaching 100 off 30 balls?”

If it makes you feel better, the median number of correct answers the year of that test was 64. Then again, the following was a question in that championship too: “What is the seven-letter name of the signature burger that can be ordered in every Burger King?”

The next contest is this summer, but in the meantime, you have a few whoppers waiting for you in this week’s Atlantic Trivia. Consider them training.

And by the way, did you know that since going up in the late 1880s, the Eiffel Tower has been painted more than half a dozen different colors? The structure was “Venetian red” at its construction and over the years has been brown, “yellow-brown,” “brownish-red,” and “reddish brown,” according to the monument’s official website.

All right, so not that different on the colors. However, each hue is really three shades apiece; the bottom third of the tower is painted darker than the middle third, and the middle darker than the top so that the paint job looks uniform against the gradient of the blue(ish) sky.

            <h2>The Real Reason ICE Agents Wear Masks</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-02</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Masked men with guns are swarming through American cities. They are doing so in the name of enforcing immigration law. There is no justification, however, for federal agents to hide their identity from the public that pays for their weapons.

In an interview with CNN, Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina, who has become an occasional Trump critic, said that he didn’t have a problem with federal agents wearing masks. “I’ve seen people dox me. I’ve seen people take pictures and identify law-enforcement officers and then put their families at risk,” Tillis said. Requiring agents to take off, or even pull down, their mask, he suggested, would endanger their safety—“I think that’s a step too far.”

Doxxing—which traditionally means the public exposure of an ordinary person’s identity and home address, and threats that harassment or even violence will follow that exposure—is a common technique in online bullying. Although exposing someone’s home address is clearly menacing, the concept of “doxxing” cannot apply to simply knowing the identity of public-facing government employees, especially not those empowered to use force.

Tillis’s logic illustrates how distorted the American approach to law enforcement has become. Police officers are civilians; they are public servants, not above the public. It is part of the job of police—and, for that matter, politicians—to be identifiable, because of the profound authority bestowed upon them. The ability to use force is a weighty responsibility, requiring high standards of conduct, and it can and should be revoked when abused. It is not “doxxing” federal agents for the public to know who they are. We are supposed to know who they are, because that is how we hold them accountable. This is why police officers wear visible badge numbers and name tags. The responsibilities they are given are not compatible with anonymity.

Ordinary police officers do not wear masks except in extremely rare and specific circumstances. This is the case even though, statistically, regular police officers are at far greater risk than immigration agents. According to an analysis by Alex Nowrasteh at the Cato Institute based on data from last year, “law enforcement officers who don’t work at ICE or Border Patrol have a death rate 6.3 times higher than that of immigration enforcement officers.” In fact, the report found, immigration agents are at no greater risk than regular people: “The chance of an ICE or Border Patrol agent being murdered in the line of duty is about one in 94,549 per year, about 5.5 times less likely than a civilian being murdered.”

If there were law-enforcement agencies particularly ill-suited to anonymity, it would be Customs and Border Protection and the Border Patrol. From 2005 to 2024, nearly 5,000 CBP and Border Patrol officers were arrested, according to the journalist Garrett Graff, who testified about his findings to an accountability commission set up by the governor of Illinois. Information on the multitude of corruption-related charges faced by agents can be found on the CBP’s own website. “The crime rate of CBP agents and offices was higher PER CAPITA than the crime rate of undocumented immigrants in the United States,” Graff writes.” Statistically speaking, “worst of the worst” seems to describe CBP and the Border Patrol as law-enforcement agencies better than it does the people they’re rounding up.

ICE does not have the same history of criminal behavior, but it does share a long record of abusing its powers and mistreating people in its custody. Put succinctly, these agencies deal with people the American system has frequently treated as barely human. Now these agents have been unleashed on Americans. Putting masks on people in agencies with internal cultures like these was always a recipe for catastrophe. The Trump administration took the most corrupt, poorly trained, and impulsive law-enforcement agencies in the country, gave them masks, and turned them against American cities.

Politicians, likewise, do not cover their face, though death threats—which should have no place in public discourse—have become far more common. It would nonetheless be absurd to conceal lawmakers’ identity, because then people would not know whom to hold responsible for public policy. Lawmakers do not vote by secret ballot, because they would be able to ignore popular preferences without fearing any consequences. That applies as much to police as it does to politicians. The public has a right to know the identity of the people who wield power in their name, so that they can withdraw that power from those who abuse or misuse it. If people can wield power over life and death without showing their face, we have a gang of criminals—not a police force.

The unhinged behavior that we have seen from federal immigration officials, including the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, who were shot while drawing attention to or recording agents’ behavior, is a direct consequence of power without accountability. On Sunday, ProPublica revealed the names of the two agents involved in the Pretti shooting: Border Patrol officer Jesus Ochoa and Customs and Border Protection officer Raymundo Gutierrez. Suffice it to say that two Hispanic Americans killing a white person trying to prevent them from harassing or deporting other Hispanic people, on the orders of Stephen Miller—a Jewish American whose ancestors fled pogroms in Eastern Europe—is a uniquely grotesque expression of the American melting pot in action.

Although the Department of Justice reversed course on Friday and promised an actual investigation of Pretti’s killing, President Trump has already eliminated traditional restraints on political control over criminal prosecutions and investigations, and Trump officials have already declared Pretti to be a terrorist and his killers to be innocent. Other Trump officials have loudly announced that federal agents have “absolute immunity” in the execution of their duties. Legal immunity plus anonymity equals impunity. It would be logical to think that in that situation, agents could literally get away with murder.

But the consequences of masked immigration agents’ extreme behavior go beyond those two fatal shootings. Thousands of students in the Twin Cities have stopped going to school and are in hiding with their families. The great majority of Somali and Hispanic residents of the Twin Cities area have legal status, but that seems to make no difference: Federal agents are indiscriminately stopping, detaining, and arresting people on the basis of little more than their accent or skin color, in violation of their due-process rights, a lawsuit from the ACLU contends. In Salem, Oregon, an American was hospitalized after reportedly being dragged from her car by immigration agents demanding her papers; she is among the dozens of Americans who, ProPublica reported in October, have been physically abused or detained for extended periods by immigration agents. The real number was probably greater then; it is certainly greater now.

Even regular cops are not immune to being profiled by ICE and the Border Patrol. “We’ve had many instances of people being stopped, family members of police officers being stopped that are American citizens,“ Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told The New York Times. “They’re not stopping family members of folks who are Norwegian or Irish. That’s not happening.” Twin Cities residents being racially profiled by federal agents can thank Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who blew a giant hole in the Fourteenth Amendment in a shadow-docket case in September. A later attempt by Kavanaugh to walk back his disastrous concurrence hasn’t altered federal agents’ conduct.

When violating the Constitution on a daily basis a mask helps, because people who are assured that they won’t face consequences for abusing power almost inevitably do so. One wonders if this is actually the government’s purpose in masking them. When you are asking men to essentially make war on their fellow citizens—to force lightly dressed people out into the frigid Minneapolis winter, detain elementary schoolers, follow good Samaritans as they deliver food to hiding families, and drag, tackle, beat, tase, or even shoot American citizens—you may find telling them that they can keep their identity hidden useful. The masks may work less to protect federal agents from danger than to to make it easier for them to do unspeakable things.</div>

            <h2>A Social-Media Ban Really Could Do a Lot of Good</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/australia-social-media-ban-effects/685853/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Australia recently decided to try something ambitious. Starting late last year, all children under 16 have been banned from having accounts on social-media sites such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. Because no country has attempted such a ban before, knowing the effects in advance is impossible—and they may be hard to assess even years after implementation.

That said, the long experience of governments trying to restrict young people’s access to temptation goods of other kinds—drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, pornography—justifies cautious optimism. The ban might deliver some truly valuable benefits, letting youthful missteps remain local and ephemeral, rather than searing permanent brands onto developing psyches, and giving young people more time to develop the in-person social skills and connections that make life meaningful.

Before we dive into details, we must address two reflexive, skeptical views of social-media bans. The first is that no matter how cleverly designed or strict a ban is, some kids will figure out ways around it, and thus the ban serves no purpose. By that logic, countries should abandon bans on robbery, toxic dumping, and corporate malfeasance, none of which is ever 100 percent foolproof. Already some Australian teens may have downloaded VPN software to get around the ban—but perfectionism should not be the enemy of progress.

Listen: Is this the end of kids on social media?

The second mistake is to think that all prohibitions look like the much-maligned War on Drugs, which many view as responsible for exacerbating incarceration, poverty, and violence. A social-media ban is not like the War on Drugs. Governments ban all sorts of goods and services for youth, adults, or both, and most prohibitions do not create other devastating social problems. Violations of the Australian ban would lead to fines on corporations, not kids being sent to detention centers.

But the core lesson from other bans is that most of them produce the intended effects, reducing the activity they seek to stem. For example, fireworks-related injuries tended to be much lower in states whose fireworks laws were more restrictive, but later rose in the many states that relaxed their laws in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Perhaps the most revealing analogues are the widespread age restrictions for the purchase and consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis, which are common around the world and have been extensively studied.

Yes, compliance will be imperfect. Data from the CDC show that in the past month, 4 percent of high-school students smoked a cigarette, 17 percent used marijuana, 17 percent vaped, and 22 percent drank alcohol, despite being underage. Thanks to older siblings and friends, permissive parents, fake IDs, and unethical sellers, some young people have always found ways to evade these bans, and similar tactics could work for surmounting a social-media ban as well. Yet all of these behaviors are still far more prevalent among adults, and there is a marked increase in uptake right as young people cross the legal threshold, an indication of the bans’ real impact.

Other studies suggest that even partially effective bans can reduce underage substance use and lead to other positive outcomes. Researchers exploited the staggered rollout of new state laws that increased the drinking age from 18 to 21 over the course of the 1980s to determine that although many people ages 18 to 20 evaded the ban, raising the legal age for drinking reduced alcohol consumption and traffic crashes among that group. A subsequent review was even more decisive, pronouncing the debate over the ban’s effects “closed.” Similar policies raised the minimum legal age for purchasing tobacco to 21 in the late 2010s, and had similar effects.

Adolescence is a time of high neuroplasticity in which many lifelong habits, good and bad, are formed. This is why companies pay a premium to advertise their products on TV shows that attract young viewers, and it is also why social-media companies see Australia’s ban as a long-term economic threat. People are generally far less likely to become addicted to something if they are introduced to it after their brain is fully developed (at about age 25), and every year of adolescence that someone delays using an addictive product, their risk of developing problems with it drops. Researchers have shown that growing up in a state and time after the drinking age was raised predicted decreased binge-drinking episodes in a sample of men as old as 53.

Positive outcomes from raising the minimum legal age for addictive substances do not guarantee success for imposing minimum legal ages on social-media accounts. Consuming alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis requires the acquisition of a physical object. This creates regulatory checkpoints (for instance, mandatory ID checks) that are hard to replicate online. Parents, teachers, and other adults who work with young people may have an easier time detecting these substances (smelling smoke; noticing that someone is drunk) than detecting whether someone is illegally using Instagram.

However, in other respects, banning access to social media may be easier. Many teens appear to want to be off social media; they see it as detrimental to their own well-being but nevertheless feel they have to be on it to keep up with their peers. Fascinating economic research has shown that many social-media users would pay money to avoid a break from social media while others continue using it, but many of those same users would pay money to have the entire network deactivated for everyone.

Elias Wachtel: Can Gen Z get rid of its iPhones?

A ban might solve this collective-action problem, just as banning steroids in sporting competitions spares athletes from feeling compelled to damage their bodies just to keep up with competitors who dope. Young people can look at pornography alone (and presumably would generally prefer to), but social media is a lot less enticing if people you know are banned from using it. A ban thus can make using social media less rewarding in a way that is not true of pornography: As your peers reduce or stop their use, your incentive to do the same increases, in a mutually reinforcing cycle.

A final significant question is whether the ban is politically sustainable. Cannabis prohibition was the law of the land in America until it wasn’t, brought down by an unusual combination of deep-pocketed corporate interests and left-leaning anti-corporate people who objected to punishing users (especially disadvantaged groups) for violating the ban. The social-media ban already has corporate opponents, including some of the world’s most influential companies. But because the ban penalizes corporations, not consumers who break the rules, ban-repeal advocates may have a harder time drawing a coalition of cross-partisan support.

Policies are rarely purely good, and the ban is likely to result in trade-offs. A few years from now, we may learn, for example, that rural Australian youth report feeling more isolated, but reading scores in junior high are rising nationally. Or we may find that participation in youth sports grows but so does compulsive computer gaming. Australia’s voters will have to assess what trade-offs they find reasonable. Regardless of how they choose, they will have done other countries a service by being the first mover as the world contends with how to live with such powerful new technologies.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Every student of modern art knows how European and American avant-gardists of the early 20th century had their world rocked by Indigenous art—how they swooned over and strove to imitate the dynamic concision they saw in ethnographic exhibitions. How Picasso launched Cubism by sticking African masks on French prostitutes in Les Demoiselles d’Avignon. How Marsden Hartley paved his way to abstraction with tepees and Native American symbols. How Jackson Pollock started painting on the floor after seeing a demonstration of Navajo sand painters at the Museum of Modern Art in 1941.

Generally overlooked in Art History 101 was the inverse: how European materials and images were repurposed by Indigenous artists. That 1941 MoMA show was full of ancient Native objects, along with recent work that adhered closely to historic examples. (The catalog advised readers that “Good Indian work, done without the interference of whites, includes restrained colors as well as bright ones, and usually leans to economy rather than complexity of design.”) As with MoMA’s earlier shows of African and folk art, American Indian art merited inclusion in a museum of modernism not because it was modern, but because it offered inspiration to a Euro-American avant-garde. Somehow, modernist aping of Indigenous models got told as a story of increasing originality, while Indigenous adaptation of Western models was seen in terms of decreasing authenticity. The logic was clear enough: The proper job of Western art was forever to point to the future; that of Indigenous art was forever to repeat the past.

It has taken a century for the art world to realize its mistake, but contemporary Indigenous art is now having a moment. Major museums are mounting exhibitions of recent Aboriginal art from Australia and Native art from the Americas. In the imposing nine-pound book Toi Te Mana: An Indigenous History of Māori Art, the art historian Ngarino Ellis writes enthusiastically of a new “global Indigenous art world.” Its advent was clear at the 2024 Venice Biennale, which featured Māori artists from New Zealand, Kaqchikel artists from Guatemala, and Nonuya artists from Colombia. The Australian pavilion’s award-winning installation interwove personal genealogy with 65,000 years of Aboriginal history. The Brazilian pavilion was renamed the Hãhãwpuá pavilion by Tupinambá artists, and the Danish pavilion was relabeled Kalaallit Nunaat (the Greenlandic name for Greenland) by the photographer Inuuteq Storch. The U.S. pavilion kept its name, but its mini-Monticello exterior was swathed from pavement to cornice in the eye-popping geometries of the Choctaw/Cherokee artist Jeffrey Gibson, the first Native American to fill the building with a solo exhibition.

Gibson, whose statues of anthropomorphized animals in Native regalia are currently holding court on the facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, is one of the world’s most visible artists. A MacArthur fellow, admired by critics and popular with the art-going public, he has used his platform to normalize the idea of “an Indigenous present.” The phrase, designed to disrupt the equation of Indigenous with cultural stasis, forms the title for both his compendium of contemporary Native art, published in 2023, and a new traveling exhibition of Native abstraction that opened at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston last fall, before heading to the Frist Museum in Nashville and the Frye Museum in Seattle.

Rambunctious and enticing, the book consists of 450 pages packed with images of works by 60 artists—running the gamut from sassy conceptualism to enigmatic video stills, and from the lyrical painting of Jaune Quick-to-See Smith to Wendy Red Star’s photographic self-portrait as a diorama Indian with an inflatable elk. There is no obvious chronological or typological order to the presentation, nor any of the usual scholarly overviews. The title page doesn’t arrive until page 35.

The “Indigenous Present” exhibition, by contrast, feels almost stately—six dozen works by 15 artists, gracefully laid out in spacious galleries. Given the rubric of abstraction, the Indigenous references don’t jump out the way they do in Red Star’s photograph, but they make themselves felt through what the Cree artist Kimowan Metchewais called “live relics”—attributes of a culture that run beneath the surface, animating everything.

The oldest and oddest works in the show are the “personality prints” (actually triptych drawings) by Mary Sully, who was born in 1896 and died in 1963. Made in the decades before World War II, they depict their subjects in riddle-like sequences that progress from streamlined emblems to decorative patterns. The one dedicated to the aviator Beryl Markham, for example, begins with a cusp of blue water bookended by a pair of coastlines and matching female silhouettes—a tidy graphic summa of Markham’s record-breaking 1936 Atlantic crossing. Below it, a second drawing adapts those elements into a moiré pattern, suggesting both pistons and waves; the third drawing crystallizes the theme with interlocking polygons. Precisely delineated with colored pencil, Sully’s pictures look simultaneously naive and urbanely sophisticated. They echo flapper-era print ads and Art Deco posters and fabric design, as well as the kind of modernist abstract painting she would have encountered while living in New York City, along with the Dakota quillwork she would have learned as a child on the Standing Rock Reservation in South Dakota.

Sully, whose real name was Susan Deloria, was both the great-granddaughter of the English-born painter Thomas Sully (it’s his portrait of Andrew Jackson that glowers at us from $20 bills) and the great-aunt of the Harvard historian Philip Deloria, whose 2019 book, Becoming Mary Sully, first brought her to public attention. A reserved and seemingly fragile person—Deloria calls her “an Indian soulmate to Emily Dickinson”—she never exhibited her work, and we have no idea what her aims were. Her subjects were an eclectic bunch: Bob Ripley (he of “Believe It or Not”), Gertrude Stein (who got rows of roses), the polar explorer Admiral Byrd. It’s hard to cast them all in the same play, maybe because they interested her less as people than as prompts. What seems to have motivated, even delighted, her was not representation but transformation—the transition from real life to geometry, from the anecdotal to the eternal.

Unseen for most of a century, Sully’s drawings can hardly be called influential, but in their multipart format, physical modesty, and casual interlacing of pop culture and Native references, they anticipate much of the show’s later work. The hefty paper sheets of Metchewais’s Luther (Striped Man) (2003) climb the wall with the erratic logic of a Post-it brainstorming session. Creased here and there from previous folding, they are stained rust red and nicotine yellow, and several carry the photographic image of a standing figure shrouded in black-and-white-striped fabric. It has the playfulness of a sheet ghost, Op Art style, while recalling old photographs of Native leaders wrapped in chiefs’ blankets. Taped together on the front rather than the back, Metchewais’s constructions—he called them “paper walls”—wear their contingency on the surface, keeping open the possibility of other potential arrangements, other ways of connecting.

Almost everybody here has been to art school. Walking through the galleries, you can draw connections to Pop Art or Conceptualism or Bay Area Funk and not be wrong. One room features the familiar minimalist format of near-identical objects arranged in grids, where the viewer’s task is to recognize the conceptual rule underlying their slight differences. Each of the 27 paintings from Kay WalkingStick’s Chief Joseph Series (1974–76) carries four sliced-arc shapes in various arrangements, but the title directs attention not to abstract concepts but to a real person: the Nez Percé leader who guided his followers on a 1,000-mile trek in pursuit of self-determination. Suddenly those sliced arcs begin to look like strung bows, and her muted palette begins to feel like an elegy. Similarly, the angular shapes that repeat across Dakota Mace’s 80 chemigrams (created by painting photo developer and other materials onto light-sensitive paper) are Diné symbols, linking land and lore.

For an exhibition of serious contemporary art, “An Indigenous Present” feels uncommonly light on its feet. These gridded installations lay claim to a lot of real estate, but the objects they are built from could fit in a backpack. Sully’s oeuvre spent decades in a suitcase. Untaped and folded, Metchewais’s “walls” could be carried under an arm. Such rejections of monumentality are not rare in contemporary art, but they usually appear as a reaction against what came before—a swerve away from the bombast of Expressionism, the hard shells of Minimalism, the slickness of Pop. What you see in “An Indigenous Present,” however, feels less like refutation than a willing handshake with the past—but it’s a different past.

Indigeneity is by definition site-specific—a statement of cultural continuity between a particular place and its people for time out of mind. Discussions of a “global Indigenous art world” thus raise the question of what a Choctaw/Cherokee MacArthur fellow working in the Hudson Valley and an illiterate Anmatyerr woman working in Australia’s Central Desert might have in common. The obvious answer is a shared legacy of colonial dispossession, racism, and cultural condescension, and plenty of Indigenous art calls out injustice in explicit terms.

But that’s not the central focus of “An Indigenous Present,” nor of the expansive survey “The Stars We Do Not See: Australian Indigenous Art,” organized by the National Gallery of Victoria, which opened its North American tour at the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., in November. And it was nowhere to be seen in the retrospective that Tate Modern in London recently devoted to the groundbreaking Aboriginal painter Emily Kam Kngwarray.

Kngwarray was a phenomenon. Born sometime between 1910 and 1914, she grew up foraging, hunting, and sleeping in grass shelters. She remembered her first sight of a “whitefeller.” (She ran away.) She spoke little English and learned to write her signature only when it was time to endorse her pension checks. For most of her life, her artistic gifts were exercised in body painting and drawing in the sand—crucial elements of the ceremonies through which Aboriginal culture has been maintained down the millennia. But in 1977, Utopia Station, the tiny settlement where she had learned to write her name, began classes in batik, the Indonesian process of using hot wax on fabric as a dye-resist, with the goal of helping Aboriginal women earn money through handicrafts. (Funding agencies doubted the capacity of Aboriginal women for such fine work. They needn’t have worried, as the luminous silks teeming with squiggles, dots, and flattened lizards at Tate Modern showed.) Kngwarray was in her late 70s when she began working with acrylic, and in her final eight years, she produced thousands of paintings, some the size of a school bus. Video footage shows her dabbing paint insistently on canvases laid out on the ground. As the global audience for Aboriginal art grew, she emerged as a star. A year after her death, Kngwarray’s work was in the 1997 Venice Biennale. Today it can be seen cladding a Qantas 787 Dreamliner in giant red webs and white spots.

For non-Australian viewers, the Tate show was a revelation. Juddering across her 1991 painting Kam, spots of color—yellow, white, ochre—cluster and disperse amid darkness. The canvas is nearly 10 feet long and 4.5 feet tall but feels bigger, as if it stretched not just side to side and up and down but also back in space and even time. It is a knock-your-socks-off painting, engrossing and peculiar. The only visual analogues that spring to mind for its inchoate choreography are Hubble Space Telescope images of cosmic clouds and nascent nebulae, unimaginably distant and impossibly large. Read the label, though, and you find the picture rooted to the ground: In Kngwarray’s native Anmatyerr language, kam is the name for the tiny seeds and seedpods of the pencil yam for which she was named, a vital resource for Aboriginal people in Australia’s Central Desert. Limitless space collapses into something small, local, and edible.

“The Stars We Do Not See” includes photography, video, and conceptual art, but what makes it astonishing is the breadth of painting produced by Aboriginal artists over the past 50 years. After centuries of images that were either ephemeral (body painting; drawing in loose earth) or immovable (rock art), numerous Aboriginal groups in the 1970s and ’80s began making things that white audiences could recognize as art. In Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, artists expanded the practice of bark painting, using hand-ground ochre to portray loose-jointed human figures. In the Western Desert settlement of Papunya, they worked with industrially made boards and paints to create pictures in which arrays of dots nestle and collide. In Utopia Station, they started with batik. Most compositions run edge-to-edge with interwoven lines, wavering zigzags, or fields of dots dancing over and under other shapes. There are no horizons, no evidence for up or down. Why would there be in imagery that arose from the practice of drawing on the ground?

In the context of Tate Modern or the National Gallery’s East Building, it is tempting to see echoes of Western postwar abstraction—early Philip Guston, late Larry Poons, Brice Marden in his tangled-line phase—but those references would have been as alien to Kngwarray or Papunya artists as the experience of foraging for yams is to most of us. Whatever we may think we are seeing, they were not painting “abstractions”; they were painting “Country.”

That word, capitalized, appears 212 times in the Kngwarray catalog and 189 times in “The Stars We Do Not See” catalog, but its meaning remains elusive. It can refer to the native territory of a people, or more broadly to “the lands, salt and fresh waters, the subterranean and the cosmos to which they are connected,” the curator Kimberley Moulton writes. Inseparable from the ancestral stories called Dreamings, it also encompasses “law, place, custom, languages, spiritual belief, cultural practice, family and identity.” With such an extensive crib sheet, all kinds of things can be read into these images—cracked earth, reflected light on water, night skies, ecological awareness, metaphysics.

The enormous painting that greets visitors to the National Gallery show, Ngayartu Kujarra (2009), is mostly occupied by a single white shape, wobbly at the edges, some 13 feet long and seven feet high. Around the white, patches of variegated color swell and thin in the way littoral landscapes do—a scrubby green bit here, a sandy pink bit there, a shoal-like shape pushing up into the whiteness. The intimation of topography is confirmed by the label: Ngayartu Kujarra is the Punmu name for a seasonal salt lake also known as Lake Dora. The large blue dots that appear at the edge of the composition are sacred watering holes in the surrounding desert.

The canvas—a collaborative project by 12 Punmu women—was painted over the course of a week on-site, outdoors, in 118-degree heat. Led by a “senior custodian” of Punmu culture, the women sang, then walked onto the canvas to paint. When they finished, they laid the canvas on the lake’s crusted-salt surface, where it was celebrated with further song and dance. Finally, the National Gallery of Victoria reports, it was taken inside, and a last white coat was added “because it was too dirty from all of the dogs and cups of tea and little kids touching it.”

The curators are keen to educate visitors about Aboriginal life and worldviews. Wall panels offer primers on the central role of Country and Dreamings. Photographs show landscapes whose patchy growth patterns reverberate through the paintings. Videos let us hear the languages being spoken. But there are limits to what is being shared, we are informed. In Aboriginal societies, access to certain knowledge, designs, and even pigments may be restricted by age, gender, genealogy, or status within the community. Some of this is negotiable (initially the painters were all men), but much is not.

Maintaining these constraints in a world of oral transmission is one thing, but paintings can be carried anywhere and seen by anyone. While many artists saw painting as a way of keeping their culture alive for younger generations who may or may not live in their historic Country, traditionalists worried about how geographic or spiritual information appeared and what outside audiences were told.

All of this required invention. One reason for all of those dots, scholars have suggested, might be that they act a bit like pebble glass in a bathroom, diffusing without denying that which should not be shared. In addition to finding pictorial solutions to the problems of protected knowledge, Aboriginal artists needed to create a new language to translate the social, performative, and transient experience of ceremonies into the step-back, stand-still experience of a picture hung on a wall. Like artists everywhere, they were navigating between inherited cultures and present-day opportunities. The Yolngu artist Nonggirrnga Marawili painted on tubes made of rolled bark, a form that imitates the hollow logs once used by the Yolngu as ossuaries. Her grid designs refer both to a network of water holes and to the fish traps of ancestral hunters, but their magenta hues come from recycled toner cartridges. The 12 Punmu women were inspired to make their painting of Lake Dora after seeing it from a plane.

It would be foolish to make broad statements about Indigenous art on the basis of three exhibitions. But one thing that seemed distinctive—a contrast to the general tenor of contemporary art on other floors in the same buildings—was the solicitousness with which the artists approached their cultural inheritance. Western art likes to move forward by rebelling against its parents. Never mind that it does so through old-fashioned means, such as oil on canvas and cast metal: The rhetoric is one of rupture. In these shows, the rhetoric is different—neither rejection nor blind adherence to tradition, but simply respect, and an affirmation of a vital and lasting universe.

One of the mesmerizing works in “An Indigenous Present” is Audie Murray’s video installation Bear Smudge (2022). For most of its 30-minute run time, all you see is a field of flickering pastels, like a glitchy, pixelated Monet landscape. You can hear wind, shuffling footsteps, and what sounds like the striking of a match. Sometimes a distinctive motion within the static hints at the presence of a person. The wall text explains that you’re watching the artist perform a ceremony after smearing bear grease on the camera lens. What exactly she is doing on the other side of that bear grease is not explained, though anyone who has binge-watched Reservation Dogs or Resident Alien may recognize the practice of wafting cleansing smoke, and it’s easy enough to look up Native American smudging rituals on your phone. Objects spread out on the gallery floor offer clues, but the game of deduction is far less engaging than the scintillating field on the wall.

The visual effect is oddly reminiscent of Kngwarray’s Kam. Both convey a sense of particles in motion and of events taking place below the surface—some organizing engine hovering just out of view. The video and the painting were made in different centuries on opposite ends of the Earth, but they walk the same delicate line between making something visible and making it clear. Both artists were creating work that they knew would be seen by viewers unversed in their traditions and perhaps unmoored from the very idea of reverence.

Talking about his “Indigenous Present” exhibition, Jeffrey Gibson posed a set of questions rare in the usual run of contemporary art: “What is meant to be seen? How do you protect something? How do you transform something so you can share it, but not reveal it?” Most spiritual traditions—Indigenous and otherwise—restrict access to the sacred. But even beyond religious mystery, it can be salutary to be reminded of the existence of things beyond your ken. The title of “The Stars We Do Not See” was inspired by the Yolngu concept of “the stars behind the stars”—everything that exists yet escapes perception.

“It turns out,” Metchewais wrote in a 2009 Facebook post, “the thing in the modern world that most matches the Indian psyche is the web.” This might seem a reach, but as the technology historian James Gleick pointed out in a recent essay, Tim Berners-Lee’s crucial insight in creating the web was that “what matters is not objects but relationships.” The observation made me think of the 12 women working together on the huge salt-lake painting, and of Sully’s drawings, where what happens between each section feels more meaningful than what happens within any given one. In the “Indigenous Present” book, the curator Candice Hopkins argues that modernists missed the point by adopting the look of Indigenous objects while doing “away with any social role of that cultural belonging.” It occurred to me that if you relocate Gibson’s question about how to share and yet protect something, you have the essential conundrum of the internet age.

The art world is a fickle place. Inevitably the buzz around Indigenous art will fade away. The art itself, however, is likely to remain—not because of any high-minded notion of equal representation in institutional settings, or even for the window it opens onto worlds we may not know, but because of the light it shines on the one we’re all in.

This article appears in the March 2026 print edition with the headline “The Secrets of Indigenous Art.”

            <div id="article-text">Automakers have increasingly implemented door handles that retract into the bodywork for aerodynamic reasons, but they are now off limits in China.

My issue is with electronic-only door latch mechanism. It should be possible to open the door from both inside and outside the car in case of complete power loss.

Better structural design, seatbelts, airbags, and collision avoidance systems make cars safer overall. But those stupid door handles need to go, we don&#39;t have to take the bad with the good.

Anything else should be treated as kidnap AND attempted murder.

ever traveled on a bus or a train ?Iyou need to escape...  punch out frankly this is against any sort of progress and less about safety and more about control... mandate escape methods not how to do them..

Riddance! Shame about mercedes whose exports to china are about to drop like a rock because of their stupid door handles.

So that&#39;s a big safety fail. On top of that, only the front passengers have an accessible mechanical release. The rear passengers technical

Last summer 3 teenagers burned to death in a Cybertruck near where I live. They were just home from college, borrowing their parents&#39; Tesla, and probably didn&#39;t know where the manual override latch was.

A lot of safety is sacrificed for very little to no upside.

&quot;In November 2024 (Thanksgiving Eve), a Tesla Cybertruck crashed at high speed into a tree and wall in Piedmont, California. It carried four college students (all teenagers/young adults around 19-20 years old). The crash caused a fire, and three of them died: Krysta Tsukahara (19), Jack Nelson (20), and the driver Soren Dixon (19). One survivor was pulled out after a good Samaritan broke a window.The key claim in multiple wrongful death lawsuits (filed in 2025 by families of two victims) is that the Cybertruck&#39;s electronic/retractable/flush door handles contributed to the deaths. Allegations include:

The power-dependent electronic handles (and buttons) failed after the crash/power loss.No easily accessible exterior mechanical handles existed for rescuers to open doors quickly.Interior manual releases (cables) were hidden/obscure (e.g., under a map pocket liner), hard to find amid smoke, fire, and panic.Victims reportedly survived the initial impact but were trapped and died from smoke inhalation and burns, not crash injuries.

These lawsuits blame Tesla&#39;s design choices for turning a survivable crash into fatalities, and the issue has drawn scrutiny (including from NHTSA investigations into Tesla door systems). Tesla hasn&#39;t been found liable yet—the cases are ongoing.&quot;

Why did the fire break out in the first place? Was it bad design of the batteries? Its by no means the first time a tesla has gone up in smoke in a crash.

A lot of safety is sacrificed for very little to no upside.What are you taking about?  Musk got to show how cool he is by doing something different again.  You don&#39;t want Musk to be innovative?  Won&#39;t someone please think about Elon?

It sure as hell wasn’t because aesthetics.It ain’t flat door handles preventing that thing from hitting 200MPH.  It’s Holmes dressed in the latest design by Drag Coefficient riding shotgun saying, “No Shit, Sherlock.  It’s a bloody line-reject lunchbox with tires..”

for aerodynamic reasonsNo one is doing it for the aerodynamics.

Bingo. For aerodynamics, they would find a bigger pay off with wheelwell covers, and those are somewhat rare. Especially on any cars catering to trends and aesthetics.

Haters gonna hate, even if we added retractable AM antenna&#39;s on our cars.

... touchscreen controls for common tasks such as altering the HVAC or radio/media settings and put back buttons. For some reason the authorities in most countries see m to think its dangerous using a touchscreen phone but perfectly ok to use a touchscreen car interface while doing 70mph.

Theres one law for them and one law for us.

The only time billionares EVER face legal trouble is if they are harming other billionares.

What is it you want the SEC to do about this? Who do you believe to be a victim of it? Why are they a victim of it? How were they victimized by it?

Theres one law for them and one law for us.

That&#39;s because *they* do something about getting what they want. Whereas you (the American population) can&#39;t be bothered to do something, *anything* actually,  to keep them in check.

This problem isn&#39;t going to solve itself.

When you say those words it doesn&#39;t make much sense.  When Trump says it, people storm the capital building.

what&#39;s ketamine got to with anything? i&#39;m sure he has a script for that.

The SEC has been depopulated, they do not have the personnel to review anything, which is just la Presidenta and his billionaire friends want it, since they did it to the SEC. And the remaining personnel haven&#39;t been tasked to do any important reviews except against la Presidenta&#39;s enemies (the list is updated weekly). And as others have noted, even if they did object, la Presidenta would soon see to it that their objections were buried along with their jobs.

Lest we forget, a similar thing happened in the 2

Porn is the use case.  So it&#39;s an honest opinion at least.

Good point.  If only they could lose more money per year.

I&#39;ll bet Musk gave the major SpaceX investors an ultimatum...basically take this junk firm, xAI, or he doesn&#39;t let SpaceX go public, and their investments will remain locked up.   But, oof, a $250 billion valuation on xAI...that value will not be returned in our lifetimes.  But somehow TSLA is still at >$400/share so don&#39;t take stock advice from /. btw the TSLA PE is 392 ...that&#39;s bonkers)

Recall that previously Tesla invest like $2billion in xAI, but my guess is with Tesla&#39;s declining prospects in their

adding 1 million satellites would impact the DAY SKY.

It&#39;s their way to combat global warming, by providing global shading.

SpaceX pegged its own valuation at $1 trillion -- a markup from the $800 billion it commanded in a December secondary stock sale -- and priced xAI at $250 billion based on a recent $20 billion funding round that valued the two-year-old AI company at $230 billion.
The companies are worth what we (Musk) say they&#39;re worth.
Convenient when you&#39;re trading between yourself and yourself.

The valuation of SpaceX is based on the external purchasers that have put forth bids over the years, the most recent one settling in January of this year. The valuation of xAI is based on the latest funding round raised from venture capitalists outside of Musk. So there are more people than Musk who believe this valuation -- believe it enough to put multiple billions of their own dollars on the line for it. Whether that is the true valuation or not, well, that&#39;s always the game of stocks, right? If enough people believe a price, that&#39;s the price.

If you call your Qatari friends, and ask them to invest in xAI at a given valuation, with the promise that- you&#39;ll back that valuation by having both Tesla and SpaceX acquire shares in xAI at the same price a week later;- you&#39;ll have SpaceX fully acquire xAI another two weeks later at a 10% markup;- you&#39;ll take the entire shebang public at again a 25-50% markup in half a year or so.

Do you think that your Qatari friends are actually investing in your fledgling AI startup? Or in something else entirely?

I know it says &quot;up to&quot;, but how long will it take to launch that many? Assuming launches every day of the year, he&#39;d need to launch about 274 per day to achieve the 1M in ten years. Are we talking tiny satellites here and you can pack hundreds into one launch?

Then there&#39;s the issue of putting so much garbage into space that we essentially block ourselves in - we end up with an orbit of garbage that no other vehicle can pass through safely. Or is that a non-issue because the orbit is so large?

I&#39;m not convinced we&#39;ll get to 1 million satellites before kessler syndrome is triggered. Kessler&#39;s group just barely released a report using updated numbers and it&#39;s not looking good at all.  We&#39;re way past the threshold.  It&#39;s just a matter of time now, for the 500km zone.

But think of the 100+ year light show we would get as those little pieces decay back into the atmosphere. I&#39;ll pop the corn.

Are we talking tiny satellites here and you can pack hundreds into one launch?I hope so! Imagine if so many of us drive Teslas to avoid car exhaust emissions looking at the exhaust from hundreds of rocket launches.

Imagine if so many of us drive Teslas to avoid car exhaust emissions looking at the exhaust from hundreds of rocket launches.Fun fact about the Starship:  its fuel is liquid methane and liquid oxygen, which when combusted results in exhaust consisting of water vapor and carbon dioxide.  So, not great from a global-warming perspective, but not really polluting in the classic sense.Falcon 9, OTOH, burns kerosene and oxygen, and emits water vapor, carbon dioxide, and soot.  Presumably they will start phasing that out in favor of Starship though, when they can.

274 a day is easily achievable. They would be able to afford that if they get Starship working at the same cadence as Falcon 9. The reason it&#39;s currently unaffordable with Falcon 9 is Falcon 9 expends the upper stage, which costs about $10 million per launch. Starship will be able to launch at least 200 tons into orbit. Presumably each data center satellite would weigh about 720 kg (weight of a Starlink v2 Mini), they could launch the 275 satellites daily on a Starship. In theory they could reuse the same S

Humans aren&#39;t hardened for space either, but we send them up in shielded environments pretty regularly.

xAI wins because Grok is burning through billions and has very little prospects of significant revenue.

Elon Musk wins because he increases his ownership in SpaceX, which is making pretty decent money.

SpaceX win..... SpaceX investors get to share that warm feeling that Tesla investors get from handing over additional large portions of their company to Elon Musk.

Help me, ObElon Kenobi.  You&#39;re my only hoppe.

You guys remember the Beavis & Butthead episode where they were tasked with selling school fundraiser cookies? They bought all of each other&#39;s cookies by exchanging one dollar back & forth with each other. So basically they sold all the cookies, but only raised $1 for the school.

That&#39;s stupid.  The first dollar was the school&#39;s so they technically stole the schools dollar over and over again.  What are we supposed to learn from this?  To lie cheat and steal?  Trump and Musk have already tought master classes in that.

Well, duh.  I got a real kick out of his &quot;one million sattelites&quot; plan..  Is that some sort of Dr. Evil joke?   This fucking guy...

laughed out loud.  This was predicted, and has come to pass.  He&#39;s fishing for that Trillionaire patch.

Musk has done this before.  In 2016, SolarCity was in financial trouble, so Musk had Tesla bail them out by purchasing them.  Now he&#39;s using the same maneuver to keep xAI afloat using SpaceX&#39;s assets.

Musk said the least expensive way to do AI computation within two to three years will be in space. Has someone told him about the heat problem in space? Vacuum is cold, but it&#39;s also a near perfect insulation. Getting rid of heat is a constant problem for space craft because there is no heat exchange and radiating it off is the only option you have and it&#39;s terribly inefficient. And last I checked, GPUs generate quite a bit of heat.

> the people who chose to live near an airport did so with the knowledge they would be buying affordable homes in exchange for the tradeoff.

I doubt most people in that situation expect or even know about higher lead contamination.

We&#39;re not talking about lead poisoning, we&#39;re talking about the effects of long term lead exposure. In places that used leaded gas, the IQ of the general populace went down 7 points. The only thing worse is living next to a lead smelter. If you visited the city the smelter was in in the 80&#39;s, everything was dead. There was no vegetation for a mile around the smelter site itself. During the 90&#39;s they changed something with the smokestacks (adding a few feet to the height) and tha

They probably didn&#39;t know about lead emission from avgas, and even the neurological effects of lead they&#39;re unlikely to know very well. Lower land prices near airports, to the degree that&#39;s a thing, are probably more about noise.

I wonder why people are bad at risk assessment and at judging scale?

Sesame Street used to have monsters do big/small and near/far. I would have thought we could have grasped these concepts in early childhood, but I keep running into people who also suck me into a pointless debate when they don&#39;t get it.

Which is why there is pressure to close them. For example, this one about 5 miles away from home, currently scheduled to close in 2031.

jfc! don’t give trump any ideas of rolling this back!!!!!!!!!!

Look, tetraethyl lead was a &quot;cheap&quot; way to get gasoline-fueled engines to run higher compression without pre-detonation (knocking) damaging the engine. The development of electronic fuel injection in the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s pretty much eliminated the knocking problem by electronically adjusting the timing of spark plug ignition via knock sensors and a small computer, which meant modern gasoline-fueled engines for street-legal vehicles rarely suffer from this issue. Besides, modern refining technology makes it possible for gasoline RON octane ratings as high as 99 (circa 95 pump octane) in unleaded fuel, pretty much eliminating the need for tetraethyl lead.

Panasonic is making those cameras, and it is much more of a lifestyle brand now than anything, if one can even believe it that you can position five-figure digital cameras as lifestyle.

Leica Cameras, as in point and Shoot and Profesional Cameras are very good.Their optics are very good to.Some of their image processing technologies, like using RYGB sensors (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue) are very interesting.

And, in a world were phones with high end cameras use the Carl Zeiss branding ad nauseam, some phone brands partner with Leica for some needed diferentiation.

It&#39;s weird that one Duolingo is worth five or six Leicas.

Found the guy who never gets invited anywhere :D

They&#39;re probably also trying to avoid getting laughed at.

It is a security conference, not a cryptography one. That is just one possible topic.

It&#39;s just a vendor trade show. Has very little to do with cryptography these days.

So they are afraid to engage with the knowledgeable public.They don&#39;t acknowledge that experts have expertise.  They don&#39;t believe anything exists that cannot be seen by the naked eye.  They don&#39;t accept that anything can be true with is not common sense. 
The US medical system is devolving into witchcraft, so why wouldn&#39;t this administration shun RSA?  Just get NordVPN and you&#39;ll be safe from all those brown-skinned trans-cyberian-orchestrators in enemy nation-states such as Canada, Themiddleeast, California and Norway (who won&#39;t set a Noblepiece Price to sell Greenland&#39;s rare-earth-AI datacenters). 
They don&#39;t understand how ignorant they are.

focusing on President Trump&#39;s policies for maximum security for all AmericansI&#39;m sure for most participants, attending the conference is about staying current on the latest technology and proceedings. For the others, some will be attending for business networking, others for job hunting, but most experts go to the conferences to stay current on the latest things they may have missed.
The most likely reasoning here is petty: &quot;I don&#39;t want anybody supporting someone who isn&#39;t fully loyal to the brand&quot;.  It sure smells that way from the announcement and news articles.  It isn&#39;t about &quot;security for all Americans&quot;, but about Party Loyalty (tm), to the point of hatred and snubbing of anything that isn&#39;t part of the Party.
The most generous telling I can imagine is that the agency is focusing on the &quot;statutory, core mission&quot; part of the quote, and the &quot;stewardship of taxpayer dollars&quot; means &quot;participants will have to pay for their own tickets&quot;.  I don&#39;t think this is likely, but if I try hard, and I mean *really hard* to think of a way to twist the words that aren&#39;t about Party Loyalty, that&#39;s the only way I can twist and contort it to make it look like anything else.
I&#39;m sure many professionals will still go to the conference, have already registered, and purchased their plane tickets and hotel room months ago.  The question will be what happens after.  Based on the past year, I&#39;d wager Party Loyalists will give the long knife treatment to professionals who are doing their job at actual security, but we&#39;ll know in a few weeks.

Yeah, this.  I was not aware that &quot;focusing on President Trump&#39;s policies&quot; was  part of their &quot;statutory, core mission.&quot;

This is the insanity that keeps frusturating me about how some of these administrations are being run.

You&#39;ve got Attorney generals and DOJ heads constantly stressing that they see their job as to executute trumps agenda, and it just fucking isn&#39;t. An Attorney Generals job is to uphold the law. The DOJs job is to uphold the law. None of it is to be a team player with the president. After all, if one the president men commits a crime on trumps orders, how can we be sure the DOJ will arrest them for committing

I thought it might be about the whistleblower complaint against Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard which is so sensitive, even describing what is alleged could lead to &quot;grave damage to national security&quot; [independent.co.uk].

&quot;to ensure maximum impact and good stewardship of taxpayer dollars&quot;White house ball room *mic drop*

&quot;to ensure maximum impact and good stewardship of taxpayer dollars&quot;

So you think that the companies who are paying cash to Trump are just part of the âoegood stewardshipâ part?

I might be ok if the ballroom went with NASCAR sponsorship rules. The exterior is plastered with sponsor billboards.

The Walmart/Apple/Oracle/Blackstone/Coinbase/Amazon Ballroom.

Lets ignore for a moment the fact that privately funding an addition to the White House invites all kinds of inappropriate opportunity for the sort of quid pro quo one would generally want to presumably not have ones government engaged in ...

The ballroom triples the square footage. Hosting gets more expensive, maintenance gets more expensive, heating gets, cleaning gets more expensive. Building a thing is not the only cost associated with that thing.

And this utterly incompetent administration doing more stupid things.

You just won&#39;t see them. They are called spooks for a reason.

All the spooks are wearing body armor, carrying AR15s, and arresting five-year-old brown kids.

We are in a day and age where this statement    &quot;...focusing on President Trump&#39;s policies for maximum security for all Americans,&quot; feels like it could be easily replaced with  &quot;focusing on President Trump&#39;s policies for maximum security prison for all Americans,&quot;    Or at least subliminally the same.

&quot; since we regularly review all stakeholder engagements, to ensure maximum impact and good stewardship of taxpayer dollars.&quot;

&quot;we look at everything already and are too broke to go&quot;.

Which by the way is untrue, they have the money to go and it is worth it if only to see what the competition is willing to show other people.

After all, you can still attend without putting on a big show yourself.

The real reason is probably: We don&#39;t like the people and do not actually care about doing our job.

Is RSA even a serious security conference, other than to market the latest tools and gee-gaws to willing suckers? Despite the obvious tone of skepticism/sarcasm, this is a serious question from me, not a troll. I just didn&#39;t think RSA was much of a magnet for serious-minded security researchers, policy wonks, activists, and the like. I thought folks went to Black Hat and DefCon for that sort of thing, while RSA was pretty much just the security-focused version of Dreamforce or Oracle OpenWorld.

Hey, he is way smarter than you.  Don&#39;t argue.

Also, for the record, his concept of a &quot;hot girl&quot; may not agree with anybody else&#39;s definition.

That&#39;s the same guy who complained that even though he was the leading computer expert in his IT department for some reason they were wasting his amazing talents by relegating him to backup tape duty.  He&#39;s almost certainly never learned anything at a conference because he&#39;s incapable of learning.

The policies of The Three Stooges would probably be better.

one of those things that seem obvious in hindsight

yes. the US and Canada (at least) have been doing this for a decade or more. rather than just sucking down the obvious bait in the article you could have given it a quick google, but nahhh lets just come here and repeat the same stupid bullshit.

There&#39;s a white strobe light on top of the traffic lights that goes off to indicate they&#39;ve been triggered by an emergency vehicle. At least on the East Coast. I believe the actual signaling is over RF.

Infrared.  Biggest name in the game is Opticom.    There are a few outlier audio-based systems, but the big one is Opticom.

So there is an optical system from the emergency vehicle to sensors on the traffic light?The auditory signals bypass the traffic lights entirely and go to the sensor networks that normally respond to traffic light signals.

I can confirm Canada has been doing it for a while too. Same strobes...

(Why isn&#39;t everyone doing this already?)The step up in complexity (and cost) from a light on a local timer (often with the local preemption via IR or visible strobe) to a centralized management is significant and the advantages are probably relatively limited in all but the most congested places.They definitely do it in Macross and Evangelion though.

Emergency vehicles still have to go slowly through every single intersection because assuming that all other drivers will pay attention to and obey a red light is apparently too much to ask.  Also, if there is traffic congestion, a green light won&#39;t help that much.  What helps is other drivers paying attention and pulling out of the way.  In the US, this is often too much to ask for.

My city, and all the surrounding cities have been doing this for decades with an optical system that detects emergency lighting on vehicles and immediately stops all opposing traffic and gives green to everything in the direction the emergency vehicle is traveling (straight, left, right).  I don&#39;t know the range of the system, but I have seen it activated many times.

Sometimes it is annoying, because it will throw off the cycle (start over).  And if there is ANOTHER emergency vehicle not far behind, it will

>&quot;My city, and all the surrounding cities have been doing this for decades with an optical system&quot;

I should have mentioned this is in the USA.

When I was in college someone told me you could flip a traffic light green by flashing your headlights on and off. I found out instead it was a great way to get pulled over, especially if there was a police car nearby.

In one of the lower-tech, backward locations that I spend time, there is no centralized system of traffic lights, every crossing has a set working on its own.

Two or three years back the local govt fitted all emergency vehicles with some sort of radio transmitter and every traffic light with the corresponding gadget (one can tell, because they have this weird antenna and a solar battery), so now the ambulance or the fire truck can switch the lights from some distance away. Quite effective and must have cost

Not really &quot;binary&quot; - just a flash rate: 10Hz is &quot;low priority&quot; 14Hz is &quot;high priority.&quot; Yes, it has been hacked, but very easy to find out who is hacking it.

This is known as &quot;traffic signal preemption&quot; or &quot;emergency vehicle preemption&quot; and has been in place in a number of countries for years.

This is known as &quot;traffic signal preemption&quot; or &quot;emergency vehicle preemption&quot; and has been in place in a number of countries for years.As I recall, while in some locations it used an IR signal (which some people tried to spoof, until they got caught, and got a very very large fine), most places have migrated to an encoded RF signal, and others use GPS information to a more integrated traffic grid.  And some places (NYC was a poster child; I don&#39;t think it has changed) it is not used due to the complexity of managing that cities traffic.

Without reading the article I assume this is more advanced.

It uses route information and sets the greens sooner than line of sight.

This means the route will be green and clear.

it&#39;s called Priority Green (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_signal_preemption) , and was pretty common before the early 1990. 10Hz IR beacon is &quot;low priority&quot; 14Hz is &quot;high priority.&quot;

How do they expect me to finish my Slashdot post with a bunch of flashing lights in my fac[NO CARRIER]

Isn&#39;t Green Wave just what&#39;s always been called a donut run?

Thank goodness nobody other than the Dutch gives a damned about priority for bicycles.

A green light won&#39;t make room for emergency vehiclesThis.
It&#39;s easier for emergency vehicles to weave through stopped traffic than worry about morons turning left in front of fire trucks because &quot;Oh good! The light turned green.&quot; A few towns around me flip all the lights to red upon emergency vehicle approach. Which also negates the benefits of hackers &quot;blue boxing&quot; the lights.Signal Horns are there for a reason.This is the Seattle area. We have opiate induced deafness.

This is the Seattle area. We have opiate induced deafness.

In fact I once read an article some years back about people getting caught building black boxes to flip the lights and then getting caught doing it. I wonder if The Woz ever looked into that?

I was pretty sure we already have the standard green wave stuff like busses getting priority. You can literally see the white diode start to blink on traffic lights when a bus approaches and such. So I went to take a look at details.

This is the official announcement from the relevant government bureau:

https://www.fintraffic.fi/fi/u... [fintraffic.fi]

It&#39;s exceptionally light on details of the implementation (likely intentionally to reduce hacking and hijacking of the system). However it does note that &quot;data moves in the off

Why isnt it already being done is a good question...

NZ already has it in place for public transport in most major cities, and the emergency services are switching over from a legacy system to using the same priority system for emergency vehicles as is currently used for public transport.

https://www.scats.nsw.gov.au/h... [nsw.gov.au]

Could this be made available for police vehicles too? When there&#39;s a fake donut emergency in the presence of onerous traffic, a swift button press could double or triple the chances of the donuts being intercepted before they become too stale.

I&#39;ve always thought those things should change ALL lights to red, that way no one is driving in either direction.    Does anyone know why they don&#39;t do this?

Traffic lights also have a physical wire from every green light (the actual light bulb/led connector or socket) that comes back to the controller.  The purpose is to detect a conflicting green and if such a thing happens (which should never occur) then the controller switches to four way red and locks out until it&#39;s reset.

They then decided it was better to just turn all the lights red, leaving junctions clear for the emergency service divers to sort it out amongst them selves.

I think I was told that the emergency service vehicle turns on something in the cab to make it happen, but I may be wrong about

On this week’s Amicus Plus bonus episode, Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Kristin Clarens, an immigration lawyer and advocate who has focused much of her 20-year career on unaccompanied youth and noncitizen kids. Clarens teaches a course at the University of Virginia School of Law to help young lawyers understand the impact of the immigration system on communities. The pair discussed the brutal toll Donald Trump’s mass-deportation policy is taking on children and families. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Can you talk about the Trump administration’s theory of the case in these immigration sweeps that caught up Liam Ramos and other children, who were rushed into detention centers before there was time to file legal proceedings to protect them?

Kristin Clarens: I think this government is playing with the public’s idea of who has broken the law. There’s a real disconnect between individuals who are in our communities—they’re our neighbors, they’re following the letter of the law as we understood it a year ago, a month ago, a week ago—and the government’s actions. Following the law doesn’t protect these families from this type of aggressive and egregious enforcement that fell on the shoulders of this sweet-faced child. You could see the confusion and fear in his face, but what you didn’t see is the confusion on the faces of the attorneys and other legal advocates trying to navigate a system that’s changing underneath our feet, a system that doesn’t offer protection even for people who are following the law.

I am not this family’s lawyer, but my understanding is that Liam’s family came here to seek asylum: They filed their asylum application as they were supposed to. They have gone to court. There are lots of requirements when a person is applying for asylum, and my understanding is that they have followed them all. It is also my understanding that to the extent there have been any legal issues with Liam’s parents, it’d be the same that many of us have—a speeding ticket. I’d hate for somebody to look at my driving record and assign some sort of moral criminality to me, for that to indicate that I’m suddenly the type of person who should be picked up and drop-kicked into a detention center, maybe with my kids. That doesn’t seem like the type of criminal behavior the American public is looking to root out. What we’re seeing with enforcement from this administration is that even people who are following the law, to the extent that that law has been spelled out, are being stopped and detained and ultimately sent, maybe not to their country of origin but, even more mystifyingly, to another random country, potentially even a random continent.

So we have this tension between the idea that there’s a legal process and that if you don’t follow it, you must face consequences, but that legal process is constantly changing, and you may face new unforeseen consequences that are so devastating, especially for young children. And this cannot be fixed. This child’s time in the detention center, whether it’s three days or three months, or time out of this country as he tries to get back to his mom—we can’t fix that even if we ultimately do find ways to repair some of the breakdowns in the system that this administration has caused.

You’ve worked at that immigration facility in Dilley, Texas, where Liam was being held. We all saw absolutely shattering footage last week, when members of Congress visited him and his dad. We can’t see the facility—it’s not open to the press or cameras—but can you paint a picture of what it looks like? What is happening there?

Dilley is one of the parts of Texas that might exist in many of our imaginations, because we saw these images of shipping-container-type places on the side of the highway with tumbleweeds and lots of undulating desert. Sometimes at the bottom of those undulations are culverts, or Department of Homeland Security vehicles will pop up. Along the stretch of highway beside the Dilley campus is a big privacy fence that runs around the facility.

When I worked there, I was part of one of the teams on-site when families were being reunited after family separation during Trump 1.0. We were mostly in this large conference room, like a church lunchroom, with tons of long tables in the middle, with these little semiprivate consult rooms off to the side. There were TVs all over the place, playing whatever advocates could think of to try to captivate the attention of these kids. One of the movies that was playing was Transformers. Now, every time I think of those images of Los Angeles and the excitement and hope of that movie, it collides with my memories of all these scared kids who were sitting on the floor while we tried to make connections with them. Much like we’ve heard from Minneapolis, these adults in the room end up having to walk these kids into an immigration court where they know they’re going to be detained, or we’re with these children, knowing that they’re likely to be removed, or they have just suffered separation. It’s such an incredibly challenging moment to try to connect with this young child who’s never met you, not to mention, in a lot of instances, cultural and linguistic barriers.

Dilley feels like a prison or a jail. The security measures you have to take to get in are extensive. There’s no freedom to walk around. We advocates were not even allowed to leave the conference-room hall we were in. There’s an asylum officer on-site, and when we were allowed to attend some of the hearings, we’d have to be accompanied by armed guards. It’s a pretty desolate place. Sometimes DHS and the administrations will try to characterize these facilities as “summer camps.” They’re certainly compelled by a settlement agreement to try to make them the least restrictive possible, but having worked in many prisons, it feels like a prison.

Dilley was mothballed in 2024, after President Joe Biden phased out family detention in 2021, but CoreCivic, the private-prison company that runs the facility, reopened the 2,400-bed South Texas facility last year, in Trump’s second term. The Trump administration is capable of learning, and it seems to have learned from its mistakes in 1.0, reverse-engineering a new kind of family separation in 2.0 that looks different: You can tear families apart and traumatize children and parents in ways that don’t make the headlines that maybe kids in cages did. Learned is a generous word, but what has this administration done to hide some of the worst iterations of what Family Separation 2.0 looks like on the ground this time?

This administration went back to the drawing board after Trump 1.0 and developed a strategic wraparound approach to dismantling a system of humanitarian protections here in this country that have been core to our American spirit since certainly post-Holocaust, but even before that. Historically, it has mattered to us that we are a country that offers a safe haven for people. It matters to most of the voting public, but it doesn’t seem to matter to this administration because it has systematically looked at those sources of protection and, in undramatic and unphotogenic ways, torn them down.

In the first Trump administration, family separation went too far. The populace reacted so strongly to those images. Now, in Trump 2.0, those images don’t exist because, for the most part, immigration court is where so much of the family separation is occurring. It’s hard to get into immigration court, and it’s pretty boring when you get there. A lot of what happens in immigration court are routine hearings that set other hearings, or these lengthy hearings that are very legalistic, in which lawyers for the government and lawyers for individuals are arguing about legal standards for asylum or other forms of protection that really don’t seem to matter to communities. There’s a real disconnect between the legal system and the outcomes of that legal system. These arguments about legal standards for asylum shouldn’t result in a child being detained, because of the level of harm, and the perpetrator of the harm in the individual’s home country.

So the main thing that this administration is doing is making immigration court so unpredictable, so unfair, and so dangerous for individuals that it has stopped providing any source of support or safety. That in and of itself has led to deportations, detentions, and also many of what this administration calls “self-deportations,” which is this decision, after living with this uncertainty and fear and risk, to find somewhere else that will offer more safety. That often separates families and also tears apart communities, because many of our neighbors have decided that it’s just simply not worth it to live with this level of fear.

The other thing that’s happened under this administration, which is equally unphotogenic, is that the USCIS, the agency that offers visas or family-based petitions when people get married—maybe they came here as noncitizens but have married a citizen and now have kids and have been here for a long time—those processes have become completely distorted and totally unpredictable. People will show up for what used to be routine interviews, whether it’s a bona fide marriage, even though they don’t have a criminal record, and yet, without warning, they’ll be detained. That’s happening a lot. That unpredictability is leading to such heightened levels of fear in our communities that one of the things we do around here all the time is offer these standby guardianship clinics, where moms or dads will reach a point where they can’t function because they don’t have a plan for who will pick their child up at the bus stop if they’re deported or detained. And they’re worried about being deported or detained for reasons that don’t actually exist right now. The system has become so unpredictable and confusing and constantly shifting. We saw that in Minnesota last month, when teachers at Liam Ramos’ school were pushed to hand over other children to immigration court because perhaps the mom may have considered a standby guardianship but didn’t have anybody who was documented or here with secure status and just didn’t know what to do.

I think many of us have had that moment with our children, right? What happens in the worst-case scenario if for whatever reason we can’t get to the bus stop? It’s part of the reason community matters so much, because for most of us hopefully there are friends or family members or people we’ve worked closely and lived closely together with. But for people living with this randomized terror right now, that’s become really hard, and it’s probably the biggest way that family separation, or really community separation, is playing out. The fear that there would be nowhere safe for you, that you can’t predict what would happen to you, that you don’t understand the legal system that you thought you were following but maybe you’re doing it wrong. Maybe all of us are doing slight things wrong all the time? To think that that could result in your child being detained is pretty scary.

The numbers of detained kids are skyrocketing. According to the Marshall Project, the average number of kids in immigration detention has jumped sixfold since the start of Trump 2.0. Can you talk about what is behind those numbers and help us understand the financial incentives? Because I think you can’t comprehend any of this without knowing who’s getting rich and why.

One of the reasons the numbers are skyrocketing is because families and young children were not detained at this scale under the Biden administration. I think there are probably many reasons for that. One easy reason is COVID, but maybe a more compelling reason is that there was no appetite for family detention following family separation. It was clearly unpopular, and it remains unpopular. It’s heartbreaking to look at these kids’ faces as they’re enduring the personal ramifications of these policies.

Over the past year, the Trump administration has sometimes publicly and sometimes quietly scaled up family-detention capacity. It reopened Dilley, it put the other ones back online, and it has gotten an extensive amount of funding to pay contractors to open more facilities and facilities of different types. If you google it, you’ll find that in most communities there are proposed warehouses for different types of detention facilities—sometimes office buildings, sometimes old Walmarts, things like that.

There’s an enormous old repurposed Walmart in the Rio Grande Valley that is just such a heartbreaking statement of where we are in our country. The Walmart sign has bad plastic wrapping around it that reads “Southwest Key Detention Center.” That’s a teen detention center. Kids are put into different types of facilities, depending on their ages and various risk factors. Family facilities seem to be on the rise, in part because of these private groups that manage detention facilities for DHS. They’re super lucrative. Their directors are highly politically involved and have been close to this administration. It’s the same story that we’re seeing all over the place in politics right now—a kind of a pay-to-play model that this administration knows very well, as do the people who are benefiting from it.

The year was 1986: a time of Cold War espionage and deep suspicion. Relations between Washington and Moscow were starting to thaw, yet a staggering stockpile of almost 70,000 nuclear warheads meant the threat of annihilation lingered in the air. Then something pretty extraordinary happened: Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev sent a letter to Ronald Reagan proposing they “enter the third millennium without nuclear weapons.” What came after was a historic summit where, for a brief moment exactly 40 years ago, the elimination of global nuclear weapons looked actually achievable.

“It cemented the idea that nuclear disarmament is something that we need to aspire to,” Nick Ritchie, professor of international security at the University of York, tells Slate. Fast forward to today, however, and that nuclear-free vision is yet to materialize. Nuclear stockpiles are creeping up again (we’re now at around 12,400), and the world appears to be drifting toward a “new nuclear arms race” that is prompting concern among experts.

So what happened to the ambition of nuclear disarmament? Given current global tensions, expiring treaties, and the acceleration of atomic programs, one could dismiss the events of 1986 as a failure. But looking back at that year of nuclear diplomacy paints a more complex picture—one that today’s leaders could actually learn from.

Central to the idea of global nuclear disarmament was the historic Reykjavik Summit of October 1986 in Iceland, where, alongside top negotiators and aides, Reagan and Gorbachev met in person and nearly agreed to a nuclear-free future. It had already been quite a year: the doomed Challenger space shuttle had exploded months earlier, and the disaster at Chernobyl was on everyone’s minds. Yet there, a quaint wooden house on the banks of Iceland’s scenic capital hosted the “most bizarre summit” of the Cold War.

“What was supposed to be a prelude to a formal summit turned into an incredibly important 48 hours,” historian James Graham Wilson tells Slate. Both leaders came with lofty goals, yet discussed methodical steps that included a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear arms, with the ultimate target of abolishing the entire global nuclear stockpile by the year 2000. The energy was palpable behind the scenes: U.S. teams placed a door on top of a bathtub that served as a desk, where the sides established negotiating positions and discussed plans long into the night.

But talks stalled at the eleventh hour, with negotiations crumbling partly due to America’s nicknamed “Star Wars” program, the space-based missile defense system that America was trying to develop to prevent a nuclear attack. “The sticking point was always the Strategic Defense Initiative, which Reagan thinks is essential and Gorbachev thinks is a deal-breaker in their common cause of eliminating nuclear weapons,” Wilson says.

But far from seeing both sides as leaving empty-handed, many consider Reykjavik crucial.

Having spent most of her professional life working in nuclear diplomacy and arms control as well as serving under various U.S. administrations, former NATO deputy secretary general Rose Gottemoeller tells Slate the summit not only moved the needle but brought a common goal firmly into focus. “Reykjavik was such a startling shift from where we had been just a short time prior, when we had these major nuclear crises,” Gottemoeller explained. Historical records reveal there were several close calls in the early ’80s, including the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm that could have triggered a nuclear war.

What came after the summit is key. Sustaining the momentum for disarmament, Reykjavik was the genesis of several crucial treaties that did indeed reduce nuclear weapons stockpiles. This included the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987 and the START I treaty in 1991. “Nuclear arms control, as we’ve conducted it with the USSR and Russian Federation, has been a huge success for strategic stability, for stability and predictability not only for Moscow and Washington but for the global strategic stability as well,” Gottemoeller said. “It’s been a big success.”

Year by year, progress seems to continue. The Cold War ended, and further treaties, such as the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996, were ratified, while nuclear stockpiles declined. “In the past 40 years, since Reykjavik, we’ve gone from 12,000 deployed warheads on each side down to 1,550,” Gottemoeller continues. “That’s still a lot of warheads, but it is a huge drop from the Cold War highs.”

Yet the political possibility demonstrated at Reykjavik was also followed by setbacks. START II, which aimed to eliminate multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles on intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1993, was, as Wilson put it, the “greatest nuclear arms treaty ever.” MIRVs, which have several warheads on one missile, are particularly dangerous because they create a “use them or lose them” scenario in the case of an impending attack. However, the treaty never came into force. “The great tragedy is not that we failed to reach zero nuclear weapons,” he said, “it’s that we never eliminated the most destabilizing systems.”

Fast forward to the present day, and almost all of the nuclear treaties hashed out between the U.S. and Russia have now expired, including the INF and START I. The New START treaty, the last remaining agreement between the two, will almost certainly lapse in February 2026—even though Russia’s Vladimir Putin proposed a one-year extension. “That’s significant,” Ritchie added. “This will be the first time since the ’70s when there has not been a treaty between the United States and Russia, previously the Soviet Union, that put some sort of limits on their strategic nuclear arsenals.”

The potential lack of a treaty is not necessarily cause for panic. Though the foundations that have upheld nuclear limits are being shaken, several experts pointed out that we have lived through periods when treaties weren’t in force, yet mutual restraint prevailed.

The prospects for total disarmament today are also shaped by an entirely different geopolitical landscape and nuclear players that Cold War negotiators never had to reckon with. Specifically, it’s no longer a two-sided arms race. “It’s very difficult to see at the moment a continued trajectory of the kind we’ve been on, mostly because the Chinese are building up so rapidly,” says Gottemoeller. “And that is creating a new wrinkle in what has been a steady march toward reduced numbers by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., now Russia.” While the U.S. and Russia maintain the largest stockpiles and are accustomed to decades of bilateral nuclear diplomacy, China is adding around 100 nuclear weapons a year and shares frosty relations with U.S dealmakers.

A multitude of factors will shape what comes next: not least, the volatility in U.S. foreign policy and the erosion of international law. “The risk of nuclear war is not zero, it’s greater than zero,” notes Ritchie. Rather than disarmament, deterrence (having nuclear weapons to deter an adversary from using theirs against you) is also a prevailing narrative, even though those concepts are arguably incompatible. Ritchie continued: “The longer we live in a nuclear-armed world, the more chance we’re taking. … Nuclear weapons, from a disarmament perspective, are not compatible with the long-term survival and security of humanity.”

Instead of building up arsenals, Gottemoeller says the focus should be on maintaining minimal nuclear deterrence and improving conventional forces. “Everybody’s talking about a new nuclear arms race, so I’m not optimistic about that. We should do everything we can to head off a new nuclear arms race because, honestly, nuclear weapons are 80 years old, and the missiles that they go on are 70 years old,” she said. “Do we really want to be pouring money into this 80-year-old technology that is a weapon of mass destruction and is built for deterrence? It’s not built for use on the battlefield. It’s not built for fighting. It’s built to stay on the shelf and deter our adversaries.”

The jury is still out over whether Reykjavik could have actually worked if Reagan and Gorbachev walked away with a deal. But four decades on, the ultimate risks that brought them to the table haven’t changed. Among debates about the nuclear future, Florian Eblenkamp, advocacy coordinator at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, says 2026 is “a big year for international treaties on nuclear weapons,” with review conferences for the NPT Treaty and TPNW scheduled for later this year. These opportunities, at least, offer nations a chance to address existing problems and keep the momentum going. But are dreams of disarmament still on the table? The lessons of 1986 show that with the right setting and right leaders, a Reykjavik moment isn’t a pipe dream.

“It looks daunting, but in a way, Russia and the United States never really cared about international law,” Eblenkamp said. “And yet the Reykjavik summit happened, and two presidents realized that spending so much money on nuclear weapons and something that could end the world multiple times is just insane. … I think sanity will come back.”

If the deepening rift between the United States and Europe hardens into a permanent split, historians will look back at January as a turning point.

The harbingers were the speeches at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, first from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who urged middle-sized countries to band together against the large powers’ unfair dominance, then from President Donald Trump, who heaped a staggering amount of  contempt and scorn on America’s allies, even by his already-alarming standards.

But the kicker came in actions that allied leaders took after Davos. Most dramatically, starting Jan. 30, 10,000 troops from 11 nations of NATO launched a military exercise—its largest scheduled for the coming year—without the participation of any American troops. This is unprecedented in the alliance’s 77-year history.

In other events leading up to the NATO exercise:

Canada signed a major free-trade deal with China, allowing, among other things, a massive import of Chinese cars.

The European Union signed a trade agreement with India—and a still-larger one with South America’s Mercosur bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), the latter of which will create one of the largest free-trade zones in the world.

The French Parliament passed a law barring government officials from using U.S. platforms, such as Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet, for videoconferencing.

Denmark, still reeling from Trump’s threats to take over Greenland, announced it was selling its stash of U.S. Treasury notes, worth $100 million. Even before these moves, central banks worldwide—not just in Denmark—have been shifting their reserves toward other countries’ currencies. An analysis by J.P. Morgan calls this trend “de-dollarization” and attributes it, in part, to the turbulence of Trump’s tariffs—many of them imposed for punitive and arbitrary reasons—and also to perceptions of a decline in “the U.S.’s overall standing as the world’s leading economic, political and military power.”

In each of the last eight months, the U.S. has seen a steadily steep decline in the number of tourists from abroad, especially from Western Europe, resulting in a loss of $12.5 billion in revenue. (This isn’t because foreigners are staying home; of 184 nations analyzed by the World Travel & Tourism Council, the U.S. is the only one seeing a drop in international visitors; foreigners are traveling, just not to our shores.)

As concerning as they are, we should not overstate the significance or the magnitude of these developments. They’re, to some extent, reversible; they haven’t shifted the global balance of power—at least not yet. NATO, by charter, is still commanded by a U.S. general, and this isn’t likely to change anytime soon; even in NATO’s go-it-alone exercise, U.S. officers are assisting with logistics and coordination. Mark Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister, now NATO’s secretary general, told the European Parliament this week that they were “dreaming” if they thought the EU could defend the continent without U.S. assistance. Much as his remarks annoyed his fellow Europeans, he’s right. Defense analysts in Berlin and London have told me that it would take 10 years for Europe to build an independent defense force—and that’s if they started spending a lot more money on defense right now. (They have boosted their budgets but are limited by their own domestic politics.)

As for world trade, the dollar still reigns supreme; no single alternative currency is anywhere near supplanting it. Trump’s tariff threats—including those that he’s made against Canada and the EU for its recent attempts to break away from American dominance—can still make allied leaders and bankers hesitate.

Still, the trends are genuinely historic. Until the Trump era (and he is defining this era in so many ways), our allies hadn’t seriously even thought about taking any of these steps. But Davos intensified the trends and clarified the rift (or, as Carney put it in his speech, the “rupture”), to the point where they are now not just thinking about taking steps like these but actually taking them.

The New York Times’ story about the NATO exercise noted that it was “conceived long before President Trump was accused of undermining faith in the military alliance,” but this claim is misleading. Yes, it was planned before Davos, where these doubts were intensified—but Trump has been “undermining faith” in U.S.-led alliances generally ever since he was elected back in 2016. Several times since, he has publicly pondered pulling out of NATO, and he has said he would not come to the defense of NATO members under attack—the central pledge of the alliance—if their military budgets were lower than they’d promised.

The Times correctly notes that the exercise, code-named Steadfast Dart, is designed to show what NATO’s European members “can do on their own”—to “test how well they could work together if the American forces, which usually do the heavy lifting, were occupied elsewhere.”

As described on NATO’s website, the scenario played out in the exercise involves mobilizing NATO’s Allied Reaction Force in the event of a crisis on the “eastern front”—i.e., along what would be the opening battle lines of a Russian attack. It’s a reprise of a similar exercise, also called Steadfast Dart, that occurred at this time last year, scheduled deliberately on the anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The difference is that last year, U.S. troops were taking part; this year, they’re not.

The test of going it alone isn’t meant as a prediction of whether the United States would send troops to fight in a war for Europe. But Trump has already upended a world where they could count on the U.S. as a reliable trade partner. They now see the need to lay the groundwork for the day when it might no longer be a reliable guarantor of their security. This perception, and the adjustment to it, could well define the next era in world politics.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, typing to you from underneath a sooty, icy snow boulder that has covered the entirety of D.C. for a week. But we’re not mad. Stop saying we’re mad.

Much of the week’s news revolved around the killing of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and Republicans’ scrambling to limit the fallout. As the week went on, we got a new Fed chair announcement, Tulsi Gabbard showing up at an FBI raid in Georgia, and what appears to be a long weekend government shutdown? Don Lemon, you will have to wait until next week, sorry. If only the Surge could control the flow and spacing of news events, the world would run a lot smoother.

Let’s begin with the Cabinet member bearing most of the blame for the events of Minnesota.

The lack of turnover in the second Trump administration has been a marked difference from the first term. Top staff and Cabinet members aren’t getting axed left and right. The only high-level change we’ve seen has been former national security adviser Mike Waltz getting “demoted” to United Nations ambassador for getting slippery-fingered with his group chat invites. There’s a reason for this shift: President Donald Trump, as he reportedly felt during the deliberations over Waltz’s future, doesn’t want to give the liberal media a “scalp.” It’s a sign of weakness to, uh, provide accountability following screw-ups.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week seemed to come the closest a Cabinet official has come to a Trump axing this term. The administration flinched from its initial (and typical) belligerent messaging following the Customs and Border Protection killing of Pretti in Minneapolis. That left Noem out on a limb. It was Noem, after all, whose department oversaw the Minneapolis operation and Noem who, as the face of that department, said in the press conference afterward that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.” Democratic calls for her impeachment shot through the roof—and even some Republicans called on her to step down, as well. (More on that later.) Noem met with the president for two hours Monday night to plead her case. For now, it looks like Trump’s instincts not to give the media a “scalp” are winning out. Or, as with Waltz, he’s just waiting a spell for the fires to calm down before sending her on her way.

Noem wasn’t the only administration official rushing to call Pretti a “domestic terrorist.” White House policy chief and all-around architect of heavy-handedness Stephen Miller also called Pretti that, as well as an “assassin” looking to “murder” agents. Team Noem, in its effort to save her, went running to Axios to blame Miller for the incendiary language. We fully believe her. Immediately calling someone an “assassin” or “terrorist” without knowing much information is Miller’s M.O., and Miller is more powerful than Noem. Of course the administration’s ludicrous initial response was his handiwork.

Miller, however, is a master at deflecting consequences when his own aggressive policy views put the administration in hot water. During the outrage over family separation during Trump’s first term, then–DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen lost her job while Miller mysteriously kept his, as journalist Jonathan Blitzer pointed out. Amid the Minnesota outrage, Noem is the Cabinet official in trouble, Border Patrol “commander” Greg Bovino was schlepped back to rural California to await his retirement, while Miller continues to run administration policy. Sen. Lindsey Graham, for better or worse, summed up Miller’s job security accurately on Fox News this week. “To my colleagues who believe that you can convince Donald Trump that Stephen Miller is a liability for him, good luck with that,” he said. “When this clock strikes 12 on the Trump era, there will be a few people walking out the door with Donald Trump. Stephen Miller will be in that group.”

After the Pretti killing, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took the position that Democrats wouldn’t advance a bill funding DHS without new reforms to immigration enforcement. The DHS funding was supposed to be included in a package with five other departmental funding bills and voted on this week, before a Friday night deadline. Schumer and Democrats demanded Republicans strip the DHS funding portion from the package, pass the other five, and buy a little time to work on DHS reforms. After a few days of talks, Senate Republicans and the White House … agreed to this! As we type, the Senate is slowly processing this agreement. (That’s Senate shorthand for waiting out a Lindsey Graham hissy fit.) Once they’re done, the House is expected to vote on the deal Monday. So there may be a wee technical funding gap for a few days, but nothing to write home about.

The deal extends DHS funding for only two weeks, setting up a sprint to legislate on the most contentious issue in politics. Schumer, with feedback from his caucus, has settled on three demands: ending roving patrols by ICE while tightening warrant rules, establishing a universal code of conduct governing federal law enforcement officers’ use of force, and barring officers from wearing masks while requiring them to turn on bodycams and have proper identification. These demands will run into issues from both directions. Progressives will (and are) chastising Democrats for asking for too little at a time when Republicans are reeling on this issue. And if DHS funding negotiations are going to be reopened, Republicans will put together their own series of requests targeting, for example, sanctuary cities. This won’t be easy.

Trump announced Friday morning that he would nominate financier Kevin Warsh to replace Jay Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve once Powell’s term ends in mid-May. Is this good? At least Trump picked someone from the requisite profession instead of a money-related figure from TV, such as Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo or pro wrestling’s Ted “Million Dollar Man” DiBiase. Warsh served on the Fed Board from 2006 to 2011 and worked closely with then-Chair Ben Bernanke during the financial crisis. He was Trump’s runner-up for the chairmanship in 2017, losing out to Powell. On another note, Warsh’s father-in-law is Ron Lauder, the cosmetics magnate and GOP donor responsible for putting the idea of annexing Greenland into Trump’s head.

If and when he is confirmed, the question will be to what extent he separates himself from the debasement he deployed to earn the job. Warsh was known for his hawkish monetary policy views following the 2008 financial crisis, worrying that lower interest rates then would cause inflation. (He was quite wrong about that.) But then he wanted to become Fed chair, and so his views have conveniently evolved. In a July interview, he described the Fed’s “hesitancy to cut rates” as a “mark against them” and added, “One of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.” Was he saying what he needed to say to get the job, or does he intend to make interest rate decisions at the president’s urging?

The FBI raided an election center in Fulton County, Georgia, on Wednesday because Donald Trump is out of his mind, and his political appointees will do whatever it takes to make him happy. The raid is related to Trump’s dangerous psychological holdup that he won the 2020 election, as well as a means of revenge against Fulton County for prosecuting him. And so a dozen or so agents dug around to search for “physical ballots from the 2020 general election,” per the warrant. If only this were all a joke. As Slate contributor Rick Hasen writes, the raid could be “a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026.” Democratic lawyers may want to consider ramping up their strength training ahead of the fall season.

The most hallucinatory part of the raid, though, may have been the presence of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard at the scene. It had seemed as if Gabbard was mothballed since the administration took its turning toward bombing, or threatening the further bombing of, various countries. As the Wall Street Journal reported, though, Gabbard “has spent months investigating the results of the 2020 election” and is “leading the administration’s effort to re-examine the election and look for potential crimes.” This is dark stuff. Playing gumshoe on conspiracy theories surrounding past domestic elections is not in the purview of the DNI’s office, and also, Gabbard is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Whatever report she reduces should, then, be laughable. The election-related executive orders it prompts Trump to release won’t be.

As we noted here a couple of weeks ago, retiring North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis has been hammering Trump policy of late but has been loath to directly criticize the president himself. Tillis issued a blockade of Trump’s nominees to the Federal Reserve once Fed Chair Jay Powell announced he was under investigation, and he called the administration’s pursuit of annexing Greenland “stupid.” In both cases, he laid blame on Trump’s staff for giving him bad advice, rather than on the president for having a bad brain that thinks bad thoughts. Tillis came out firing again this week over the administration’s handling of the Pretti killing, calling for the firing of Kristi Noem. “I think what she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” Tillis told reporters. Once again, though, he framed it in a way that absolved Trump: “It’s just amateurish. It’s terrible. It’s making the president look bad.”

So how does the president feel about this approach that Tillis has taken? Is he fooled by Tillis calling all of his administration’s policies stupid but saying it’s the advisers’ fault? “Well, they’re both losers,” Trump told ABC News on Wednesday of Tillis and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who had also called on Noem to resign. “You know, what can I tell you? They’re terrible senators. One is gone and the other should be gone.” Tillis’ response to being called a “loser” was, at least, clever. “I am thrilled about that. That makes me qualified to be homeland security secretary and senior adviser to the president,” referring to Noem and Stephen Miller, whom Tillis also despises. He is getting closer each week to blaming the person who continues to employ these chuckleheads and, thus, is responsible for them. Will he one day cross that line?

On Tuesday night, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar was speaking at a district event when a man stood up, squirted her with some sort of liquid, and then was tackled to the ground and restrained by Omar’s security detail. Despite members of her team saying she should end her appearance to have tests of the liquid done, Omar insisted on continuing. The assailant, identified as Anthony Kazmierczak, had the sort of online posting history that you would expect and had told a neighbor that he might be arrested at an upcoming Omar event. He was charged with assault, and the liquid was determined to be apple cider vinegar and water. This story about his life is sad.

Omar was direct in pinning blame for the incident. “What the facts have shown since I’ve gotten into elected office,” she said Wednesday, “is that every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket.” Indeed, Trump has directed years of racist invective toward Ilhan Omar, all of which has taken on a new acuity as the administration targets the Minnesota Somali community in general. The incident did not prompt a change of heart in Trump’s rhetoric toward Omar. “I think she’s a fraud,” he told ABC News. “I really don’t think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/microsoft_retires_sharepoint_onedrive_standalone/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has slipped out news that it’s killing some standalone SharePoint and OneDrive plans.

The software giant delivered the news in a note for its partners, which explains it is “evolving its cloud storage and collaboration offerings and is retiring the standalone SharePoint Online (SPO) plan 1 and plan 2 and OneDrive for Business (ODB) plan 1 and plan 2 SKUs.”

SharePoint Online is a web-based version of Microsoft’s collaborationware suite. Plan 1 costs $5 per user per month and includes 1TB of cloud storage. Plan 2 doubles the cost and adds unlimited cloud storage and more advanced features.

OneDrive for Business Plan 1 offers a terabyte of cloud storage at $5 per user per month. Plan 2 includes up to 5TB of storage, adds tools including data loss prevention, and can extend to provide 25TB of storage for users who are part of a team.

Microsoft says its decision to kill the services “reflects low customer demand for standalone offerings, increased instances of unintended or nonstandard usage, and higher operational costs associated with maintaining these plans.”

The Register fancies the phrase “unintended or nonstandard usage” refers to users who sign up for these products just to access cheap cloud storage, a theory we advance as Microsoft users of our acquaintance have told us these services offer more capacity, for less cost, than some of Redmond’s other storage offerings.

Which could be why Microsoft’s announcement also mentions “higher operational costs associated with maintaining these plans.”

The software behemoth points out that its Microsoft 365 suites “remain the primary way customers access SharePoint and OneDrive capabilities.” The suites are also more expensive than the plans Microsoft intends to snuff.

The post for partners urges them to steer customers to Microsoft 365 Business or E3/E5 suites.

Thankfully, partners and users alike won’t need to rush to sort this out, because service will continue until December 2029. Sales will cease on May 31st, 2026, and Microsoft won’t renew contracts for the services as of January 2027.

“We recommend that partners proactively identify impacted customers, communicate key dates early, and guide customers toward the most appropriate Microsoft 365 suite or storage alternative to ensure continuity and a smooth experience,” the post states. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/south_korea_ai_stock_fraud/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">South Korea’s government and main stock exchange have developed and deployed AI-powered tools to detect schemes that aim to send the price of cryptocurrencies and shares soaring so that unscrupulous investors can cash in.

Schemes of this sort are known as “pump and dump,” and see investors acquire shares or virtual assets, then spread information they hope will induce others to buy them. If the scheme succeeds, the price of the targeted assets often rises. Sadly, the information spread by schemers is usually bunk, but by the time new investors discover that the perpetrators have sold their assets at a handy profit and disappeared.

Pump and dump schemes are nothing new, but social media gave their perpetrators a new way to reach the gullible.

Which is probably why the tech developed by Korea Exchange (KRX, the country’s main bourse) can scour online posts, YouTube, and even reported cases of spam text messages for evidence of pump and dump schemes. The AI analyzes material it finds online, considers recent stock price movements, and then automatically produces reports indicating stocks that may be the subject of price manipulation schemes so that South Korean authorities can investigate further.

Regulator the Financial Services Commission (FSC) welcomed the tool and said it will reduce the time taken to analyze suspect situations.

Also on Monday, South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) – the FSC’s enforcement arm – announced it has enlisted AI to help it investigate suspicious cryptocurrency trades.

The FSS says it already operates a Python-based tool that can conduct large-scale data analysis, automatic calculation of abnormal trading indicators, and visualize trading patterns.

Those tools, however, struggle to keep up with high-frequency trades made using crypto-marts’ APIs. The FSS is therefore working on unspecified AI algorithms to improve its performance, and has even acquired two servers “equipped with high-performance CPUs and GPUs” so it can put AI to work sniffing out dodgy crypto deals.

Like other nations, South Korea operates a whistleblower scheme that encourages the public to report instances of fraudulent stock trading. FSC officials recently proposed increasing the rewards paid to whistleblowers in the hope it will see more come forward.

South Korea has also had its share of crypto messes, including the $40 billion meltdown of Terraform Labs, which was led by one of its citizens, Do Kwon. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/musk_spacex_xai_merge_hallucination_burning_man/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk on Monday revealed his space company SpaceX has acquired his AI outfit xAI, and that the two will work together to escape the surly bonds of Earthly powers by tapping the sun&#39;s enduring glow.

&quot;This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI&#39;s mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars,&quot; Musk wrote in a bizarre blog post published to SpaceX&#39;s website on Monday.

Musk argues that demand for AI cannot be satisfied with terrestrial resources, that building datacenters in space is therefore necessary as only limitless solar energy can power all the AI humans want to work with, and that SpaceX’s Starship can do the job of getting this all into orbit.

&quot;My estimate is that within two to three years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space,&quot; Musk contends in his post. &quot;Long term space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.&quot;

Never mind that Starship has only completed test flights so far. Musk nonetheless contends that SpaceX will one day be capable of launching the rocket on an hourly schedule and carry a 200-ton payload on each flight.

&quot;The basic math is that launching a million tons per year of satellites generating 100kW of compute power per ton will add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually, with no ongoing operational or maintenance needs. Ultimately, there is a path to launching a terawatt per year from Earth,” he wrote.

Musk seems not to have noticed that computers fail and need human oversight.

But don&#39;t worry, Musk hasn&#39;t forgotten about his commitment to returning man to the Moon and eventually Mars. From where else is he supposed to launch petawatts of AI datacenters into deep space if not the moon?

&quot;Factories on the Moon can take advantage of lunar resources to manufacture satellites and deploy them further into space,&quot; Musk rambled. &quot;By using an electromagnetic mass driver and lunar manufacturing, it is possible to put 500 to 1,000 terawatts a year of AI satellites into deep space.&quot;

While totally on brand for Musk, he isn&#39;t the first to suggest that space is the only place AI can scale unimpeded by Earth&#39;s supply of fossil fuels. Both Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Google have made similar claims. Back in November, Google launched Project Suncatcher, a moonshot which also aims to establish a network of orbital AI datacenters packed with TPUs.

Musk’s post doesn’t discuss the ethics of his ideas, a point The Register notes as AI services his companies provide have expressed sympathy for Nazism and churned out deep fake smut. Giant datacenters in the sky, an uncertain jurisdiction, could power all sorts of mischief down here. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Security researchers have attributed the Notepad++ update hijacking to a Chinese government-linked espionage crew called Lotus Blossom (aka Lotus Panda, Billbug), which abused weaknesses in the update infrastructure to gain a foothold in high-value targets by delivering a newly identified backdoor dubbed Chrysalis.

Early Monday, the text editor&#39;s project author said a suspected Chinese state-sponsored group somehow compromised a shared hosting server and selectively redirected some update traffic to an attacker-controlled site where victims downloaded a poisoned version of what appeared to be a legit software update.

Later on Monday, Rapid7&#39;s managed detection and response team attributed the attack &quot;with moderate confidence&quot; to the Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group they call Lotus Blossom.

This group typically conducts targeted cyber-espionage campaigns against organizations in Southeast Asia - and more recently Central America - with a focus on government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.

According to the threat hunters, the espionage crew used the hijacked Notepad++ update to deliver a previously unknown backdoor called Chrysalis.

Notepad++ author Don Ho did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries about Rapid7&#39;s attribution and malware analysis. We will update this story if we hear back.

While it&#39;s still unclear exactly how the miscreants gained initial access to Notepad++&#39;s distribution infrastructure, once inside they abused that access to deliver a trojanized update in the form of an NSIS installer, a packaging format commonly abused by Chinese APT groups to deliver initial payloads.

The installer contained an executable file named &quot;BluetoothService.exe,&quot; which is a renamed legitimate Bitdefender Submission Wizard abused for DLL sideloading - another favorite technique among Beijing-backed spies to deliver custom implants. It also included a file called &quot;BluetoothService&quot; that is actually an encrypted shellcode, and a malicious DLL sideloaded by BluetoothService.exe.

The shellcode here is the Chrysalis backdoor, and according to Rapid7, &quot;its wide array of capabilities indicates it is a sophisticated and permanent tool, not a simple throwaway utility.&quot;

It uses legitimate binaries to sideload a malicious DLL with a generic name to make sure it&#39;s not discovered by simple filename-based detection tools. It also uses custom API hashing in both the loader and the main module, along with multiple layers of obfuscation to further cover its tracks, as well as &quot;a fairly structured approach to C2 communication,&quot; the researchers wrote.

As of press time, Rapid7 didn&#39;t have visibility into how many victims inadvertently downloaded the Chrysalis malware - but we will update this story if we learn more. The security sleuths did, however, publish a full list of file and network indicators of compromise, so be sure to give that a read.

They note the attribution is primarily based on similarities between the initial loader use and previous research from Symantec, including the goon squad using a renamed Bitdefender Submission Wizard to sideload a file called &quot;log.dll&quot; for decrypting and executing an additional payload.

&quot;In addition, similarities of the execution chain of &#39;conf.c&#39; retrieved from the infected asset and other loaders that we found, supported by the same public key extracted from [Cobalt Strike] beacons delivered through &#39;conf.c&#39; and &#39;ConsoleApplication2.exe&#39; suggest with moderate confidence that the threat actor behind this campaign is likely Lotus Blossom,&quot; the Rapid7 team wrote. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/raspberry_pi_ram_shortage_price_hike/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">That slice of Pi is getting much more expensive. Everyone’s favorite single-board computer, the Raspberry Pi, is jumping up in price again, with increases ranging from $10 to $60, depending on how much memory your board has.

After boosting prices in December due to rising memory costs, Raspberry Pi has moved to do so again as LPDDR4 memory prices continue to climb, driven by competition for manufacturing capacity from the AI infrastructure roll-out. The increases apply to most hardware built on its Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 platforms, including the CM4 and CM5 compute modules and the Raspberry Pi 500 and Raspberry Pi 500+ keyboard PCs.

Any product with 2 GB of RAM will see a $10 price increase. Models with 4 GB will go up by $15, those with 8 GB will rise by $30, and top-of-the-line 16 GB units will jump by $60.

So, the Raspberry Pi 5 (2 GB) will now carry a list price of $65, the Pi 5 (4 GB) will be priced at $85, the Pi 5 (8 GB) will go for $125, and the Pi 5 (16 GB) will now be $205. The Raspberry Pi 500+, which we reviewed back in September, jumps to $260. The Pi 500 will go for $130.

In the Pi 4 line, the 2 GB capacity goes to $55 while the 4 GB model hits the $75 mark. The top-of-the-line 8 GB capacity will now be $115.

Fortunately, the base-model 1 GB configurations of the Pi 4 and Pi 5 will remain at $35 and $45 respectively. Older models such as the Raspberry Pi Zero and Raspberry Pi 3 will also maintain their current prices. The Raspberry Pi 400 and its 4 GB of RAM stay at $60.

For anyone watching the tech marketplace, it&#39;s no surprise the Raspberry Pi outfit has had to raise prices. In January, analysts at TrendForce predicted DRAM contract prices could rise by as much as 60 percent this quarter. Now, the firm says to expect a 90 to 95 percent increase instead.

The RAM shortage is caused by increased datacenter demand, which has encouraged memory makers to focus more on selling pricey HBM (high-bandwidth memory) to hyperscalers. It has also taken some of the regular DRAM out of the market as rack systems require it as well. Nvidia’s Vera Rubin NVL72, for example, requires 54 TB of LPDDR5X memory. ®

            <h2>Intel welcomes memory apocalypse with Xeon workstation refresh</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/intel_xeon_workstation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel&#39;s workstation lineup is getting a much-needed refresh with the launch of its Xeon 600-series processors, boasting up to 86 cores and clocks topping 4.9 GHz. Chipzilla&#39;s timing couldn&#39;t be worse.

The memory-heavy workstation processors, which are based on last year’s Xeon 6700P series, arrive amid a supply chain crunch that has seen memory prices skyrocket. Even a modest kit of DDR5 RDIMMs (8x 32GB) will set you back more than $4,000. That&#39;s up from around $1,500 just six months ago.

At the same time, extreme demand for Intel&#39;s datacenter class CPUs, which are commonly deployed in GPU servers, has seen the chipmaker deprioritize its desktop and mobile processors to free up foundry capacity.

In spite of the macroeconomic headwinds, Intel&#39;s Xeon 600 workstation processors signal a return not just to the workstation arena, but in some respects, the high-end desktop CPU segment as well. This is a space where AMD has been effectively unchallenged for the past several generations.

Intel&#39;s last Xeon W processor — also known as the Sapphire Rapids refresh — launched in mid-2024 and was based on the company&#39;s long-delayed 4th-gen Xeon scalable platform, which was originally supposed to arrive in late 2021.

Here&#39;s a quick rundown of Intel&#39;s Xeon 600 processor lineup - Click to enlarge

The Xeon 600 lineup spans the gamut between 12 and 86 performance cores (no cut-down efficiency cores here), with support for between four and eight channels of DDR5 and 80 to 128 lanes of PCIe 5.0 connectivity.

Compared to its aging W-3500-series chips, Intel is claiming a 9 percent uplift in single threaded workloads and up to 61 percent higher performance in multithreaded jobs, thanks in no small part to an additional 22 processor cores this generation.

Having said that, Intel has managed this without increasing the platform&#39;s TDP, which still maxes out at 350W on the high end.

As you can see, while Xeon 600 promises strong generation improvements in some benchmarks, in others it actually falls behind the outgoing Xeon W - Click to enlarge

However, by Intel&#39;s own admission, performance varies wildly depending on the workload. Intel&#39;s SPEC Workstation 4.0 benchmarks show that 61 percent performance uplift was specific to financial services workloads. In some cases like product design, Intel&#39;s 86 core Xeon 698X actually underperformed its predecessor.

We suspect that this is down to the newer part trading clocks for core density, something that&#39;s not uncommon in power constrained server platforms. Intel&#39;s 64-core Xeon 696X likely performs better in the SPEC Workstation product design benchmark thanks to higher base and all-core clocks, but without data we can only speculate.

While Intel is keen to show off just how much its Xeon workstation offering has improved, Chipzilla still has AMD&#39;s Threadripper and Threadripper Pro platforms to contend with. These chips boast both higher core clocks and core counts than Intel&#39;s Xeon 600 contenders.

Against the workstation leader, Intel says its new chips ... Well actually, Intel doesn&#39;t say anything. The pre-brief slides provided to The Register ahead of Monday&#39;s launch were conspicuously devoid of any Threadripper comparisons.

Looking at how Intel&#39;s more powerful 6900P family of processors fared against AMD&#39;s Turin Epycs (the basis for Threadripper 9000), it doesn&#39;t take much guesswork to figure out why.

FOSS-friendly pub Phoronix showed that core-for-core, in nearly every scenario, AMD&#39;s Zen 5 cores outperformed Intel&#39;s, with the only exceptions for memory-bandwidth-bound and AMX-compatible workloads, where MRDIMM support gave the Xeon an edge.

&quot;We&#39;re looking to be very competitive within the market, offering better performance per dollar for more value for the workstation spend,&quot; Jonathan Patton, who works on Intel&#39;s Client Product Marketing team, said during a press briefing when we highlighted the lack of Threadripper comparisons. &quot;This is a very highly expandable platform. We have up to 4 TB of memory capacity supporting two DIMMs per channel. Our competitors do not.&quot;

As a quick reminder, just like Intel&#39;s 6700P series Granite Rapids Xeons announced last year, Xeon 600 supports up to eight channels of DDR5 memory running at 6,400 MT/s for RDIMMs or 8,000 MT/s for MRDIMMs, along with 128 lanes of PCIe 5.0 connectivity.

This puts the bulk of the Xeon 600 lineup in direct contention with AMD&#39;s Threadripper Pro family of products while offering support for more memory — 4 TB versus 2 TB — and faster memory. Threadripper doesn&#39;t yet support MRDIMMs.

But while Intel&#39;s workstation chips do support more memory, either platform is still prohibitively expensive. Four terabytes of 6,400 MT/s DDR5 RDIMMs will currently set you back more than $70,000.

Memory winter aside, Patton is wise to highlight Xeon 600&#39;s expandability.

While core-for-core performance is still relevant, and the lack of comparisons to Threadripper is telling, for many compute performance is secondary to I/O, memory capacity, bandwidth, and of course, price.

In fact, consumer platforms often beat out workstation hardware on single-threaded performance, but that perf often comes at the expense of expandability.

For certain frequency optimized workloads, Intel says its Core-series Desktop chips may be the better option - Click to enlarge

The downside to client CPUs is they&#39;re typically limited to just two memory channels and between 24 and 28 PCIe lanes — enough for a high-end GPU, a couple of M.2 NVMe, and the chipset.

For those that need expandability more than raw performance, Intel&#39;s Xeon 600 workstation parts are priced to undercut AMD at nearly every level.

At the high end, Intel&#39;s Xeon 696X, its highest core-count CPU that you&#39;ll be able to buy boxed on store shelves, undercuts AMD&#39;s 9985WX by between $1,900 and $2,400 depending on sale pricing.

However, for folks mostly interested in expandability – say for GPU workstations – lower core-count parts are likely to be more popular.

In that case, the Xeon 658X is still between $1,000 and $1,200 less expensive than AMD&#39;s 8-channel, 24-core Threadripper Pro 9965WX, depending on whether you can find a deal.

AMD&#39;s non-pro 9960X is closer in price, coming in at $200 less than the Xeon, but it&#39;s packing half the memory channels, 40 fewer PCIe lanes, and is rated for 100 watts higher power consumption.

So if you need the I/O and memory bandwidth more than raw performance, Intel&#39;s Xeon 600 platform appears quite aggressively priced.

All that I/O will be broken out by a new W890 chipset, which adds support for Wi-Fi 7. But, perhaps more importantly, Intel tells us, the motherboards should sell for only marginally more than its W790 boards did at launch.

Alongside the new chips, Intel also has a new chipset with Wi-Fi 7 connectivity - Click to enlarge

That&#39;s good news, as Intel isn&#39;t just launching high core-count Xeon workstation chips this time around. Its bottom three SKUs offer 12 to 16 cores but retain a significant amount of I/O. In this respect, these chips would fall neatly into the high-end desktop (HEDT) category if you could actually buy them outside of OEM and partner systems.

This is unfortunate, as the pricing is otherwise quite attractive at between $499 and $899. We suspect Intel may have had reservations about accidentally cannibalizing its mainstream Core-series Desktop chips, but it&#39;s a missed opportunity nonetheless.

Intel&#39;s Xeon 600-series processors are tentatively expected to hit the market later this spring. ®

﻿The DS has been overthrown, 12 years after it was discontinued.

The original Switch is officially Nintendo’s best-selling console of all time after surpassing the DS handheld in lifetime sales. In its latest earnings release, Nintendo reports that the Nintendo Switch has, as of December 31, 2025, sold 155.37 million units since its launch in 2017, compared to 154.02 million units for the 2004 Nintendo DS.

In November, Nintendo reported that the Switch and DS were neck and neck. We expected the holiday sales period would see the Switch surpass the DS, even with Nintendo announcing that primary development would focus on the Switch 2. Nintendo previously said that it would continue to sell the original Switch “while taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration.”

Nintendo has to keep selling the Switch if it wants to dethrone Sony’s PlayStation 2 as the best-selling video game console of all time. The PlayStation 2, discontinued in January 2013, sold more than 160 million units over its 13-year lifespan.

Demand for the Switch 2 accelerated over the holidays, with Nintendo reporting 7.01 million units sold during the quarter covering October through December, compared to 4.54 million units in the previous quarter. In total, the Switch 2 has now sold 17.37 million units since it launched in June 2025, taking less than a year to surpass the Wii U’s 13.7 million lifetime sales.

The Switch 2 launch has helped Nintendo to drive a 51 percent increase in net profit over the first nine months of FY26, reaching ¥358.86 billion (about $2.31 billion). Net sales almost doubled during the same period, jumping to ¥1.906 trillion (about $12.2 billion) compared to ¥956.2 billion ($6.1 billion) last year. Looking ahead, Nintendo maintains its forecast to sell 19 million Switch 2 units by the end of this financial year.

The 2D animation app will no longer be available for purchase after March 1st, while existing users have one year to download their files.

Adobe is pulling the plug on Adobe Animate. In a FAQ posted to Adobe’s website, the company says it will stop selling the animation software on March 1st, citing the emergence of new platforms “that better serve the needs of the users.”

Users have until March 1st, 2027 (or March 1st, 2029 for enterprise customers) to access and download files from Animate, as they’ll no longer be available after this time. The app will be available to download until those deadlines, and Adobe will continue providing support during that period.

Adobe Animate’s history dates back to 1996, when FutureWave Software launched the vector graphics application, originally called FutureSplash Animator, as a tool to create vector-based animations. Though Macromedia acquired the tool later that year and renamed it Flash, Adobe purchased the company in 2005 and began calling the app Adobe Flash Professional. Adobe announced plans to rebrand the app to Adobe Animate in 2015 as the web began phasing out Flash.

Though Adobe says Creative Cloud Pro customers can use other apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality,” such as Adobe After Effects or Adobe Express, many users who still use Animate are frustrated with its imminent shutdown. The creators behind the short-form animated series, Chikn Nuggit, write in a post on X that they still use Adobe Animate to make the show. “This decision would not only harm countless jobs in the industry but render so much past creations as lost media,” the post reads. David Firth, the creator of Salad Fingers, also says he still uses the app to make the grotesque series.

Megacharlie, a technical artist for Jackbox Games, adds that the app “is used in many high-budget television cartoon productions, film and animation studios, game studios big and small, not to mention the 1000s of indie creators who still make use of it daily.”

Over the past year, Adobe has made it clear that it’s focused on AI. The company has launched a slew ofAI-powered editing tools across its apps, and rolled out an AI audio tool to add soundtracks and voiceovers to videos. It’s also working on its own “IP-safe” Firefly AI models for the entertainment industry.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo announced a $16 billion investment round aimed at bringing its robotaxi business to more US cities, as well as some overseas markets. The funding round was led by Dragoneer Investment Group, a “crossover” firm known for investing in late-stage tech companies before they go public.

Waymo’s co-CEOs said in a blog post they would use some of the money to buy more vehicles to grow its fleets size, a crucial step as it seeks to launch in at least 20 new cities in 2026. The company currently operates more than 2,500 robotaxis in six US cities. The new funding values Waymo at $126 billion.

Waymo’s latest funding round attracted several new investors, including Dragoneer, Sequoia Capital, and DST Global. Returning investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Perry Creek Capital, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, Temasek, and T. Rowe Price. The company last raised a $5.6 billion in 2024, valuing the company at $45 billion.

Despite their promise to bring down costs by eliminating driver jobs, autonomous ridehail vehicles are enormously expensive. In addition to vehicle purchases, companies must install expensive sensors and computers into each vehicle. The robotaxis need to be monitored by remote operators during trips. And fleet managers handle EV charging, cleaning, and sensor calibration while the robotaxis are offline.

Still, Waymo is one of the few companies to run a paid service with fully driverless vehicles in the US. Amazon’s Zoox is still running free trips in a handful of cities, while Tesla has yet to transition away from using safety monitors in the vehicle.

Waymo says it plans to bring its robotaxis to a number of high profile markets, including New York City, London, and Tokyo. Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a probe into an incident in which a Waymo vehicle struck a child in Santa Monica, causing minor injuries.

The Series 11 and SE 3 are receiving the biggest discounts, but you can still save $25 on the higher-end Apple Watch Ultra 3.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

In September, Apple launched its latest fleet of smartwatches, including the Apple Watch Series 11, the SE 3, and the Ultra 3. Each wearable offers something a little different (their prices indicate their breadth of features), and we’re already starting to see big price drops. Additionally, we’re still recommending some recent predecessors in Apple’s portfolio, including the Series 10 and Ultra 2, for which discounts are fairly common.

But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 26, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models. That means those still using a Series 5 or older — including the original Apple Watch SE — are getting left behind in terms of features.

The new Apple Watch Series 11 is a fairly iterative update of the Series 10, meaning those who already own Apple’s last-gen flagship may not necessarily feel compelled to upgrade. That being said, the newest model does tout a more power-efficient 5G modem and a more scratch-resistant display, as well as an additional 6 hours of battery life over the Series 10. It’s also the slimmest Apple Watch to date and the first to offer FDA-cleared hypertension notifications out of the gate, which you can also now leverage on both the Series 9 and Ultra 2.

If you’re looking to be an early adopter, however, you can pick up the Apple Watch Series 11 in the 42mm / GPS configuration at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $299 ($100 off), which remains the lowest price we’ve seen for the base model. If you prefer the larger 46mm / GPS model, it’s also on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, where you can grab it for an all-time low of $329 ($100 off).

If you’re looking for a real deal — and you’re not particularly tempted by what the Series 11 offers — the Series 10 still holds its own. The last-gen smartwatch packs the same S10 SiP chip that’s in the Series 11, as well as support for fast-charging, a gorgeous wide-angle OLED display, and a design that’s still significantly slimmer and lighter than previous models. It also features both depth and water temperature sensors, along with an FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature and the aforementioned hypertension notifications, courtesy of watchOS 26.

Thankfully, the Series 10 remains on sale at Walmart in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $249 ($150 off). The larger 46mm GPS variant is also available at Walmart for an all-time low of $279 ($80 off), though, given the current sale price of the Series 11, we’d recommend purchasing the latter.

While the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 introduce a handful of iterative updates, the new Apple Watch SE 3 represents a significant upgrade over its 2022 predecessor. The entry-level watch features the same speedy S10 chip found in Apple’s flagship models, for one, letting you take advantage of Apple’s double tap feature, wrist flick gestures, and on-device Siri. The SE 3 also (finally) adds an always-on display, 5G connectivity, support for fast-charging, and audio playback so you can listen to music or podcasts directly from your wrist.

On the health front, the SE 3 introduces a wrist-temperature sensor for retrospective ovulation tracking, along with breathing disturbance alerts, sleep apnea notifications, and a new Sleep Score that breaks down time spent in each stage. What you won’t find are the Series 11’s EKG functionality, blood oxygen monitoring, or hypertension notifications — those are exclusive to the Series and Ultra models.

In terms of deals, the Apple Watch SE 3 is currently available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy in its 40mm base configuration with GPS for $219 ($30 off), which is about $20 shy of its lowest price to date. You can also pick up the larger 44mm model at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $249, a $30 discount.

If you don’t need the latest upgrades, the last-gen SE remains a solid buy if you can pick it up at a significant discount. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which still holds up well, but has fewer sensors (meaning fewer features), no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to Apple’s newer watches. Those omissions might take it out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after.

Right now, the best deal on the last-gen SE can be found at Walmart, where you can pick up the 44mm model with GPS starting at $159 ($120 off), which remains an all-time low.

Unsurprisingly, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 offers the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch available thus far. It features a larger, wide-angle OLED display with a 1Hz refresh rate and thinner bezels, as well as both satellite and 5G connectivity. Better yet, battery life has been extended from 36 hours to 42 hours — a marginal improvement, but one that allows you to squeeze out a bit more life when necessary.

As far as deals are concerned, the Ultra 3 recently dropped to an all-time low of $699.99 ($100 off). That said, it’s currently only available at Amazon with either an Ocean Band, a Trail Loop, or an Alpine Loop starting at $773.97 (about $25 off).

If the latest Ultra isn’t what you’re after, you can save some money by opting for an Apple Watch Ultra 2, which isn’t vastly different than Apple’s latest top-of-the-line model. The wearable runs on the older S9 SiP and features Apple’s second-gen ultra wideband chip, but that may not matter to you since it still offers precise GPS tracking, a range of diving-friendly sensors, and long-lasting battery life.

Right now, you can pick up the Apple Watch Ultra 2 at Best Buy with an Alpine Loop, a Trail Loop, or an Ocean Band starting at $599 ($200 off), which is $50 shy of its lowest price to date.

            <div id="article-text">So that’s what he meant by the everything app.

So that’s what he meant by the everything app.

Elon Musk is merging two of the companies that he leads, SpaceX and xAI (which also owns X), into one. According to an announcement from Musk:

SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform. This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI’s mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!

Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial data centers, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment.

In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale. To harness even a millionth of our Sun’s energy would require over a million times more energy than our civilization currently uses!

The only logical solution therefore is to transport these resource-intensive efforts to a location with vast power and space. I mean, space is called “space” for a reason.

As part of the announcement, Musk discusses the need for a new constellation of satellites designed for AI compute:

My estimate is that within 2 to 3 years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space. This cost-efficiency alone will enable innovative companies to forge ahead in training their AI models and processing data at unprecedented speeds and scales, accelerating breakthroughs in our understanding of physics and invention of technologies to benefit humanity.

This new constellation will build upon the well-established space sustainability design and operational strategies, including end-of-life disposal, that have proven successful for SpaceX’s existing broadband satellite systems.

The capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe.

The merger follows SpaceX’s filing with the FCC last week to get approval to launch a constellation of as many as 1 million data center satellites orbiting Earth. The deal also brings SpaceX and X, which is under intense scrutiny and an investigation in the EU because of the nonconsensual sexualized deepfakes generated by Grok, into one company.

The combined company of SpaceX and xAI has a valuation of $1.25 trillion, and SpaceX still plans to IPO later this year, Bloomberg reports. SpaceX earned about $8 billion in profit last year, according to Reuters.

The deal between SpaceX and xAI was completed on Monday, CNBC says. Last week, Reuters and Bloomberg reported that the potential deal was on the table, with Bloomberg also reporting that SpaceX was “considering” merging with Tesla, which is also led by Musk.

As part of its earnings reported last week, Tesla disclosed that it would be investing $2 billion in xAI.

            <div id="article-text">The revelations that Musk sought an invite to Epstein’s island add risk to his plans to merge SpaceX with xAI, and then take the combined company public, experts say.

The revelations that Musk sought an invite to Epstein’s island add risk to his plans to merge SpaceX with xAI, and then take the combined company public, experts say.

Last week, the Department of Justice released a trove of documents related to its case against Jeffrey Epstein, its largest to date. Amid the millions of files were many mentions of Elon Musk. A search of Musk’s name in the department’s database results in at least 1,500 hits.

Since the release, Musk has been — what else? — posting through it, defending himself and his correspondence with Epstein on his social media platform, X. Musk said he had “very little correspondence” with Epstein and “declined repeated invitations” to go to Epstein’s island, despite emails showing he had been in touch with Epstein in 2012 and 2013, at one point asking him, “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” Epstein even offered to send a helicopter to bring Musk to the island.

It’s unclear if Musk ever made it to the island, and he hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein. But the revelations certainly fly in the face of Musk’s past denials that he “REFUSED” invitations from the convicted sex offender, as does his bumbling efforts at damage control now that the truth has emerged.

The revelations certainly fly in the face of Musk’s past denials that he “REFUSED” invitations from the convicted sex offender.

To be sure, Musk is that rare executive who seems financially immune from his many controversies. He has endured defamation lawsuits, wrongful death lawsuits, sexual misconduct allegations, rumors of drug use, and more — and all the while his net worth continues to go up.

But there’s no arguing that the news of the Epstein emails comes at a very inconvenient time for Musk, who is currently in the middle of several highly sensitive, high-stakes business moves, including a possible IPO and the attempted merger of at least two of his companies. SpaceX is lining up for a possible record public offering later this year. And last week, Reuters reported that Musk was interested in merging his rocket and telecommunications company with xAI. (As this story published, the merger was officially announced.)

The news that Musk sought an invite to Epstein’s island could “dent his image” with investors, said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Colorado Law School. And since much of Musk’s success depends on the optimism he generates among investors, a “dent” in that optimism could hurt his efforts to secure a historic IPO for SpaceX.

“But I think the bigger risk to his companies is what we’d call ‘distraction costs’ — he seems to be spending a lot of time trying to refute allegations that he was involved with Epstein, and that itself might be something investors become concerned about,” Lipton said in an email.

Musk has faced criticisms about how he chooses to spend his time before. In 2022, hundreds of SpaceX employees signed a letter asserting that Musk’s behavior had become a source of embarrassment and a distraction for the company. (At the time, the billionaire was in the middle of his doomed effort to weasel out of his offer to buy Twitter.) Last year, Tesla’s shareholders approved a $1 trillion pay package for Musk that was engineered to lure him away from DOGE and his work for the Trump administration, and back to the EV company.

The news that Musk sought an invite to Epstein’s island could “dent his image” with investors

SpaceX’s IPO represents the biggest risk for Musk right now, said Gregory Shill, law professor and corporate governance expert at Arizona State University. The disclosure process for public offerings is intensive and subject to scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission, in addition to private litigants. Any misrepresentation or omission carries a lot of legal risk for SpaceX — and by extension, Musk. But he can mitigate those risks by “inserting an appropriate risk factor in the S-1,” including “key person risk” related to Musk himself, Shill said.

If more Epstein revelations emerge, Musk could find himself facing more serious consequences. Of course, whether someone with proven ties to Epstein experiences any consequences for their actions often depends on which political party happens to be in power. For example, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers resigned from several prominent roles, most notably the board of OpenAI, following the release of his emails with Epstein. Prince Andrew was stripped of his royal titles. Bill and Hillary Clinton are currently facing a contempt vote in Congress after they rebuffed a subpoena to testify in a bipartisan probe into Epstein.

Of course, the Clintons’ party is out of power in Washington, while Musk’s is in. There are no Republican calls for Musk, who is a major political donor, to further explain his contacts with Epstein. The only calls are coming from inside the house, or rather Musk’s own X, where he spent the weekend trying to drown out the noise about his own attempts to visit Epstein’s island by pointing the finger at other prominent names (Steve Bannon, Reid Hoffman, etc.) included in the documents.

It’s exceedingly rare that Musk’s controversial behavior ends up hurting him financially. He remains the world’s richest man, even while Tesla’s sales and profits continue to plummet. Investors continue to buy and sell stock in his companies, despite his well-documented history of racist comments and conspiracy mongering. He threw a Nazi salute at Donald Trump’s inauguration — Tesla’s stock price is up almost 11 percent in the 12 months since that highly publicized gesture.

Maybe this controversy, like most of the controversies before it, is simply baked into the price at this point.

“My guess,” Lipton said, “is that without further revelations, investors will treat it as part of the background noise that comes with any Musk investment.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/02/1132068/what-weve-been-getting-wrong-about-ais-truth-crisis/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

What would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here? A story I published last week pushed me over the edge. It also made me realize that the tools we were sold as a cure for this crisis are failing miserably.

On Thursday, I reported the first confirmation that the US Department of Homeland Security, which houses immigration agencies, is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make content that it shares with the public. The news comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI (like a video about “Christmas after mass deportations”).

But I received two types of reactions from readers that may explain just as much about the epistemic crisis we’re in.

One was from people who weren’t surprised, because on January 22 the White House had posted a digitally altered photo of a woman arrested at an ICE protest, one that made her appear hysterical and in tears. Kaelan Dorr, the White House’s deputy communications director, did not respond to questions about whether the White House altered the photo but wrote, “The memes will continue.”

The second was from readers who saw no point in reporting that DHS was using AI to edit content shared with the public, because news outlets were apparently doing the same. They pointed to the fact that the news network MS Now (formerly MSNBC) shared an image of Alex Pretti that was AI-edited and appeared to make him look more handsome, a fact that led to many viral clips this week, including one from Joe Rogan’s podcast. Fight fire with fire, in other words? A spokesperson for MS Now told Snopes that the news outlet aired the image without knowing it was edited.

There is no reason to collapse these two cases of altered content into the same category, or to read them as evidence that truth no longer matters. One involved the US government sharing a clearly altered photo with the public and declining to answer whether it was intentionally manipulated; the other involved a news outlet airing a photo it should have known was altered but taking some steps to disclose the mistake.

What these reactions reveal instead is a flaw in how we were collectively preparing for this moment. Warnings about the AI truth crisis revolved around a core thesis: that not being able to tell what is real will destroy us, so we need tools to independently verify the truth. My two grim takeaways are that these tools are failing, and that while vetting the truth remains essential, it is no longer capable on its own of producing the societal trust we were promised.

For example, there was plenty of hype in 2024 about the Content Authenticity Initiative, cofounded by Adobe and adopted by major tech companies, which would attach labels to content disclosing when it was made, by whom, and whether AI was involved. But Adobe applies automatic labels only when the content is wholly AI-generated. Otherwise the labels are opt-in on the part of the creator.

And platforms like X, where the altered arrest photo was posted, can strip content of such labels anyway (a note that the photo was altered was added by users). Platforms can also simply not choose to show the label; indeed, when Adobe launched the initiative, it noted that the Pentagon&#39;s website for sharing official images, DVIDS, would display the labels to prove authenticity, but a review of the website today shows no such labels.

Noticing how much traction the White House’s photo got even after it was shown to be AI-altered, I was struck by the findings of a very relevant new paper published in the journal Communications Psychology. In the study, participants watched a deepfake “confession” to a crime, and the researchers found that even when they were told explicitly that the evidence was fake, participants relied on it when judging an individual’s guilt. In other words, even when people learn that the content they’re looking at is entirely fake, they remain emotionally swayed by it.

“Transparency helps, but it isn’t enough on its own,” the disinformation expert Christopher Nehring wrote recently about the study’s findings. “We have to develop a new masterplan of what to do about deepfakes.”

AI tools to generate and edit content are getting more advanced, easier to operate, and cheaper to run—all reasons why the US government is increasingly paying to use them. We were well warned of this, but we responded by preparing for a world in which the main danger was confusion. What we’re entering instead is a world in which influence survives exposure, doubt is easily weaponized, and establishing the truth does not serve as a reset button. And the defenders of truth are already trailing way behind.

Update: This story was updated on February 2 with details about how Adobe applies its content authenticity labels.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?

At Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.

Our methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.

Mistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women

Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women. Read the full story.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr. was born with a rare, potentially fatal genetic disorder that left his body unable to remove toxic ammonia from his blood. The University of Pennsylvania offered his parents an alternative to a liver transplant: gene-editing therapies.

The team set to work developing a tailored treatment using base editing—a form of CRISPR that can correct genetic “misspellings” by changing single bases, the basic units of DNA. KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old, and later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well. At an event in October last year, his happy parents described how he was meeting all his developmental milestones.

Others have received gene-editing therapies intended to treat conditions including sickle cell disease and a predisposition to high cholesterol. But KJ was the first to receive a personalized treatment—one that was designed just for him and will probably never be used again.

How Wi-Fi sensing became usable techWi-Fi sensing is a tantalizing concept: that the same routers bringing you the internet could also detect your movements. But, as a way to monitor health, it’s mostly been eclipsed by other technologies, like ultra-wideband radar.

Despite that, Wi-Fi sensing hasn’t gone away. Instead, it has quietly become available in millions of homes, supported by leading internet service providers, smart-home companies, and chip manufacturers.Soon it could be invisibly monitoring our day-to-day movements for all sorts of surprising—and sometimes alarming—purposes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just $74 per kilowatt-hour by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about $59 per kilowatt-hour on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been ticking up in recent months, a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry by the middle of this year.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, ceased operations last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion research: Companies and researchers are developing new materials for components including the electrolyte and electrodes, so the cells could get more comparable to lower-end lithium-ion cells in terms of energy density, Meng says.

As we enter the second half of this decade, many eyes in the battery world are on big promises and claims about solid-state batteries.

These batteries could pack more energy into a smaller package by removing the liquid electrolyte, the material that ions move through when a battery is charging and discharging. With a higher energy density, they could unlock longer-range EVs.

Companies have been promising solid-state batteries for years. Toyota, for example, once planned to have them in vehicles by 2020. That timeline has been delayed several times, though the company says it’s now on track to launch the new cells in cars in 2027 or 2028.

Historically, battery makers have struggled to produce solid-state batteries at the scale needed to deliver a commercially relevant supply for EVs. There’s been progress in manufacturing techniques, though, and companies could soon actually make good on their promises, Meng says.

Factorial Energy, a US-based company making solid-state batteries, provided cells for a Mercedes test vehicle that drove over 745 miles on a single charge in a real-world test in September. The company says it plans to bring its tech to market as soon as 2027. Quantumscape, another major solid-state player in the US, is testing its cells with automotive partners and plans to have its batteries in commercial production later this decade.

Before we see true solid-state batteries, we could see hybrid technologies, often referred to as semi-solid-state batteries. These commonly use materials like gel electrolytes, reducing the liquid inside cells without removing it entirely. Many Chinese companies are looking to build semi-solid-state batteries before transitioning to entirely solid-state ones, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

The picture for the near future of the EV industry looks drastically different depending on where you’re standing.

Last year, China overtook Japan as the country with the most global auto sales. And more than one in three EVs made in 2025 had a CATL battery in it. Simply put, China is dominating the global battery industry, and that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon.

China’s influence outside its domestic market is growing especially quickly. CATL is expected to begin production this year at its second European site; the factory, located in Hungary, is an $8.2 billion project that will supply automakers including BMW and the Mercedes-Benz group. Canada recently signed a deal that will lower the import tax on Chinese EVs from 100% to roughly 6%, effectively opening the Canadian market for Chinese EVs.

Some countries that haven’t historically been major EV markets could become bigger players in the second half of the decade. Annual EV sales in Thailand and Vietnam, where the market was virtually nonexistent just a few years ago, broke 100,000 in 2025. Brazil, in particular, could see its new EV sales more than double in 2026 as major automakers including Volkswagen and BYD set up or ramp up production in the country.

On the flip side, EVs are facing a real test in 2026 in the US, as this will be the first calendar year after the sunset of federal tax credits that were designed to push more drivers to purchase the vehicles. With those credits gone, growth in sales is expected to continue lagging.

One bright spot for batteries in the US is outside the EV market altogether. Battery manufacturers are starting to produce low-cost LFP batteries in the US, largely for energy storage applications. LG opened a massive factory to make LFP batteries in mid-2025 in Michigan, and the Korean battery company SK On plans to start making LFP batteries at its facility in Georgia later this year. Those plants could help battery companies cash in on investments as the US EV market faces major headwinds.

Even as the US lags behind, the world is electrifying transportation. By 2030, 40% of new vehicles sold around the world are projected to be electric. As we approach that milestone, expect to see more global players, a wider selection of EVs, and an even wider menu of batteries to power them.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <h2>Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/30/1131945/inside-the-marketplace-powering-bespoke-ai-deepfakes-of-real-women/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women. (Their findings have not yet been peer reviewed.)

The debate around deepfakes, as illustrated by the recent backlash to explicit images on the X-owned chatbot Grok, has revolved around what platforms should do to block such content. Civitai’s situation is a little more complicated. Its marketplace includes actual images, videos, and models, but it also lets individuals buy and sell instruction files called LoRAs that can coach mainstream AI models like Stable Diffusion into generating content they were not trained to produce. Users can then combine these files with other tools to make deepfakes that are graphic or sexual. The researchers found that 86% of deepfake requests on Civitai were for LoRAs.

In these bounties, users requested “high quality” models to generate images of public figures like the influencer Charli D’Amelio or the singer Gracie Abrams, often linking to their social media profiles so their images could be grabbed from the web. Some requests specified a desire for models that generated the individual’s entire body, accurately captured their tattoos, or allowed hair color to be changed. Some requests targeted several women in specific niches, like artists who record ASMR videos. One request was for a deepfake of a woman said to be the user’s wife. Anyone on the site could offer up AI models they worked on for the task, and the best submissions received payment—anywhere from $0.50 to $5. And nearly 92% of the deepfake bounties were awarded.

Neither Civitai nor Andreessen Horowitz responded to requests for comment.

It’s possible that people buy these LoRAs to make deepfakes that aren’t sexually explicit (though they’d still violate Civitai’s terms of use, and they’d still be ethically fraught). But Civitai also offers educational resources on how to use external tools to further customize the outputs of image generators—for example, by changing someone’s pose. The site also hosts user-written articles with details on how to instruct models to generate pornography. The researchers found that the amount of porn on the platform has gone up, and that the majority of requests each week are now for NSFW content.

“Not only does Civitai provide the infrastructure that facilitates these issues; they also explicitly teach their users how to utilize them,” says Matthew DeVerna, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and one of the study’s leaders.

The company used to ban only sexually explicit deepfakes of real people, but in May 2025 it announced it would ban all deepfake content. Nonetheless, countless requests for deepfakes submitted before this ban now remain live on the site, and many of the winning submissions fulfilling those requests remain available for purchase, MIT Technology Review confirmed.

“I believe the approach that they’re trying to take is to sort of do as little as possible, such that they can foster as much—I guess they would call it—creativity on the platform,” DeVerna says.

Users buy LoRAs with the site’s online currency, called Buzz, which is purchased with real money. In May 2025, Civita’s credit card processor cut off the company because of its ongoing problem with nonconsensual content. To pay for explicit content, users must now use gift cards or cryptocurrency to buy Buzz; the company offers a different scrip for non-explicit content.

Civitai automatically tags bounties requesting deepfakes and lists a way for the person featured in the content to manually request its takedown. This system means that Civitai has a reasonably successful way of knowing which bounties are for deepfakes, but it’s still leaving moderation to the general public rather than carrying it out proactively.

A company’s legal liability for what its users do isn’t totally clear. Generally, tech companies have broad legal protections against such liability for their content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but those protections aren’t limitless. For example, “you cannot knowingly facilitate illegal transactions on your website,” says Ryan Calo, a professor specializing in technology and AI at the University of Washington’s law school. (Calo wasn’t involved in this new study.)

Civitai joined OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies in 2024 in adopting design principles to guard against the creation and spread of AI-generated child sexual abuse material . This move followed a 2023 report from the Stanford Internet Observatory, which found that the vast majority of AI models named in child sexual abuse communities were Stable Diffusion–based models “predominantly obtained via Civitai.”

But adult deepfakes have not gotten the same level of attention from content platforms or the venture capital firms that fund them. “They are not afraid enough of it. They are overly tolerant of it,” Calo says. “Neither law enforcement nor civil courts adequately protect against it. It is night and day.”

Civitai received a $5 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in November 2023. In a video shared by a16z, Civitai cofounder and CEO Justin Maier described his goal of building the main place where people find and share AI models for their own individual purposes. “We’ve aimed to make this space that’s been very, I guess, niche and engineering-heavy more and more approachable to more and more people,” he said.

Civitai is not the only company with a deepfake problem in a16z’s investment portfolio; in February, MIT Technology Review first reported that another company, Botify AI, was hosting AI companions resembling real actors that stated their age as under 18, engaged in sexually charged conversations, offered “hot photos,” and in some instances described age-of-consent laws as “arbitrary” and “meant to be broken.”

How the sometimes-weird world of lifespan extension is gaining influence

—Jessica HamzelouFor the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs. And they’re starting to make progress.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

            <div id="article-text">G2 has completed a major acquisition by purchasing three of the world’s most influential software discovery platforms from Gartner. The move significantly reshapes the global B2B software reviews market and strengthens G2’s position in how companies evaluate and buy software.

Slush, one of Europe’s most influential tech and startup events, has named Noora Saksa as its new CEO. The leadership change signals a strategic shift toward expanding Slush beyond its annual event and building a year-round global founder platform.

The French government has decided to phase out US-based collaboration tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams across public administration. The decision is part of a broader push for European digital sovereignty and reduced reliance on American Big Tech.

This week signals consolidation and sovereignty: G2 reshapes software discovery, Slush enters a new leadership phase, and Europe doubles down on digital independence.

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

This article explores its growth across industries, benefits and disadvantages, and why this is important for you, as a service provider and/or as a customer.

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple confirmed this week that it has acquired Israeli AI startup Q.ai in a deal valued at close to $2 billion, making it one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever, second only to the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014.

But check your assumptions: this isn’t Beats 2.0. There’s no new headphone brand to flex. Instead, Apple is paying top dollar for tech that might let your devices understand you without you ever saying a word.

​​These days we put our phones on silent so they won’t disturb us; soon the phone will put us on silent so it can understand us.

Q.ai has been operating in secrecy since its founding in 2022. Its machine-learning research focuses on interpreting “silent speech”, detecting imperceptible facial micro-movements, and subtle audio cues to infer what someone means to say.

Patents suggest this tech could work in headphones, smart glasses, or other wearables so users can issue commands privately, even in a quiet library.

That future has a decidedly dramatic edge: imagine telling Siri to skip a track or read your messages without ever parting your lips. Apple executives call the acquisition a way to fuse machine learning with next-generation hardware.

Longtime Apple watcher Johny Srouji praised Q.ai as “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.”

At first blush, spending almost $2 billion on not speaking might sound like corporate futurism taken to a comic extreme. We already have voice assistants that sometimes struggle to understand us when we do speak.

Yet here’s Apple’s bet: once devices can interpret faint facial cues, the entire paradigm of human-computer interaction shifts, from keyboards and taps to gestures and barely-audible intentions.

This move also signals how Apple’s AI strategy is evolving. Some critical voices have noted that the company has lagged behind competitors in generative AI and conversational assistants, even partnering with Google to bring Gemini-powered features into its ecosystem. Acquiring Q.ai suggests Cupertino isn’t just chasing language models; it wants to redefine the interface itself.

There’s a strange poetry to this. In an era when every tech giant is clamouring to make their AI chatty, Apple is buying a company that may prime its devices to be less vocal, more intuitive, and perhaps eerily discreet.

It’s the sort of paradox that defines modern tech: a quieter future might demand the loudest investment.

If this sounds like science fiction, well, it does. But Q.ai’s technology, as described in recent reports, could translate into features in AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, or future wearables as soon as 2027. Could it help Siri finally feel less like a confused concierge and more like an unseen assistant tuned to your intent? That remains to be seen.

Either way, Apple’s big wager on silent speech reminds us that innovation doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it listens for the quietest signals and pays dearly for them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.
