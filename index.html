            <div id="article-text">A decade is a long time for a TV series; no single iteration of Star Trek has made it that far.

But “a Star Trek podcast by two guys just a little bit embarrassed to have a Star Trek podcast” has now passed the milestone. January 25, 2026, marks a full decade since The Greatest Generation, my favorite podcast, debuted. Like a bottle of Château Picard, the show has only improved with age. (I interviewed the guys behind the show back in 2016 when they were just getting started.)

The podcast helped me rediscover, and appreciate more fully, Star Trek: The Next Generation—which is also my favorite TV show. The Greatest Generation continues to delight with its irreverent humor, its celebration of the most minor of characters, and its technical fascination with how a given episode was made.

Over the last decade, hosts Ben Harrison and Adam Pranica have both moved to Los Angeles and become full-time podcasters. They have completed an episode-by-episode recap of all of The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager, and they’re now nearing the end of Enterprise. When finished, they’re threatening/promising to start over again.

The podcast has spawned its own (sometimes NSFW!) lexicon (a “friend of DeSoto” means a listener to and fan of The Greatest Generation), its own recurring and hilarious segments (“Drunk Shimoda,” “Bad Bit Moment,” and “Polo? Polo? Or Pollo?”), and most importantly, its own delightful fandom. It’s the coolest and dorkiest secret club that I will ever be a part of.

In 2016, the podcast was folded into the Maximum Fun organization. Harrison and Pranica formed their own company, Uxbridge-Shimoda LLC, that takes its name from two obscure TNG-era characters.

Like the original Star Trek, the podcast even spawned its own 2017 spinoff—now called The Greatest Trek—entirely devoted to the newer series in the Star Trek universe.

Harrison and Pranica also produce two irregularly released, members-only podcasts called Santa Monica Mountains (about the 1980s and 1990s TV show Baywatch) and Factory Seconds (where they eat at various Cheesecake Factory restaurants). Last year, they also started—in conjunction with YouTube cooking star Adam Ragusea—yet another podcast, called Wholesome, which is only available to Patreon subscribers.

In a world replete with chaos and awfulness, I’m just here for the hang.

(This interview, which was conducted earlier this month, has been lightly edited for clarity and flow.)

Ars: When I first spoke to you guys back in 2016, Adam was living in Seattle. Ben, I believe you were living in New York. You guys were still working in film production. As best as I could tell, this was just a fun little side project. Who knew how long it would run?

Ben: I think that us talking to you has a lot to do with it taking over our lives.

Ars: Sorry, not sorry? I don’t know! [laughs]

Adam: Your Ars article was one of the reasons we catapulted into the sort of audience we got afterward. It’s an audience that has meant we’ve been able to do the show professionally for 10 years.

Ben: Yeah. And when we meet people—all the time—people will say: “Oh, I’ve been listening to you guys since the beginning. Like, I was on at episode five because of that Ars Technica article.”

Ars: Do you feel like you are over it? It’s been a decade now. Is Greatest Gen as we know it going to continue?

Adam: I think the thing that’s changed is that in the beginning, it felt like a fun hobby. But when you professionalize a thing and you hire employees and you are depended on for the thing that you make in a way that you’ve never been before, it’s serious business.

This is the best job I’ve ever had, but it’s also the most seriously I’ve ever taken a job because it means so much to our well-being, but also the folks who appreciate what we do.

Ben: Yeah, one thing that Adam has said many times is we’re going to die in these chairs.

And I think also, as we come toward the end of Enterprise and have sort of run out of the well of Old Trek, as it were, I have been thinking about [what] if I hadn’t had this show? I would still be about ready to start my next TNG rewatch.

Loving Star Trek is a lot about watching it over again, you know? In the same way that I’ll put on an old rerun of The Simpsons or Seinfeld. And I love rewatching those shows. I love rewatching Star Trek.

I think Adam and I have grown as both a comedy duo but also as observers of Star Trek and what it means on an ongoing basis. So I feel like it would be unfair for us not to go back and start painting the bridge from the beginning.

Adam: I think one of the things that we’ve learned from doing the show, especially live in front of people, is that we are told by the people who enjoy this show that it’s about Star Trek, sure, but that’s not the thing that people love the most about the show.

And I think that’s what makes a return to the beginning of it make so much sense in the way Ben’s describing. It’s about the hang and your life as it relates to a Star Trek rerun that you’re watching in that moment.

Ars: I have watched zero minutes of Baywatch in my life. But I have listened to every single episode of the Santa Monica Mountains. I enjoy hearing you guys talk about it.

I think you’ve hit on a format: “Let’s talk about a thing in the way that we like to talk about it and make jokes in the way that we like to make jokes about it.” Which for me really resonates more than the format of a podcast that’s like: “Let’s get comedians to talk about a thing.”

Adam: Or let’s get celebrities in a room to talk about anything and have that be good enough.

Ben: The format that our shows tend to follow is something that I think just kind of was an emergent property of the way Adam and I talked to each other, much more so than it was us attempting to create a show that was our version of anything else.

I don’t really listen to other recap podcasts. It’s kind of a funny thing, but we weren’t really inspired by any recap podcasts in particular. I guess the Flop House a little bit for me, but what they do is so different and such its own thing.

It’s hard to feel like we are connected to the universe of recap podcasts. Like when we go to add our show to a podcast service like iTunes or Apple Podcasts, you have to pick the category that you’re going to be in, and we’ve always picked comedy.

Properly, I guess we probably would be in the television recap podcast section. We just never really thought of ourselves as being that. We were just doing what we wanted to do.

You know, we’re just making a show that makes us laugh. Making each other laugh has always been the primary goal of the show.  So it’s very funny to me that we’re in a category that we’ve never really aspired to be in or compared ourselves to in any way.

Ars: Any favorite moments, perhaps at live shows, that have happened to you over the last 10 years?

Ben: Getting to do live shows at all has been a total shock to me. When we talked to you for that first article, we barely knew what we were doing as entertainers. And I’ve taken improv classes and stuff but never really had any personal aspirations to be someone who gets up on a stage and does something. And I found that I fucking love it!

I really love doing the show in front of an audience! And we just have had so many amazing adventures getting to go all over the country doing that.

And all over the world—we’ve done the show in Canada and London now. That was a total surprise to me.

Like, if you grabbed me on the street 15 years ago and said, “Hey, you’re going to have a show that you get to travel around and do in front of audiences of 300 people someday!” I would have said, “Get the hell out of here! That’s not possible. That’s not something I am working toward in any way.”

Adam: There’s an unexpected quality to the type of—I mean, barf, right? I’m going to say the word “celebrity.” But David Letterman said that when you achieve a certain amount of notoriety, the world becomes a neighborhood to you.

A week ago, I was at a bar with friends, and a stranger came up and told me that they really like our show and they thanked me for making it. And that is something that happens in my life in a way that I never could have anticipated at all.

It’s those little moments that you have with people. Those perfect interactions where it’s just like: “I like what you do and thanks for doing it.”

That makes my life seem meaningful in a way that any previous job did not create the conditions for, you know? You do the work and you think it matters and it’s important, and largely it is in its own way, in its own ecosystem.

But to have a broad interest from folks in what you do and that it matters to them and what they do in their lives? That’s the very best part of this entire thing: knowing that the times that I can make Ben laugh are also the times that I can make 500 people laugh in a room or 25,000 people laugh on a Monday when the episode drops, you know?

That’s really powerful stuff! And it keeps me on my best behavior when I’m out in public in case an FOD is out there watching what I’m doing.

Ben: Oh, yeah. You don’t want to see all the videos of Adam on Worldstar.

Ars: You try really hard to make the show sound great, which it does. It is well-engineered. It is well mixed. You guys put a lot of care into the production of the show.

But also, to my knowledge, you have never missed a show’s publish date. I’m curious about how you balance all of that with whatever else is going on in your lives. Ben, you have two young kids. I know Adam has martinis to drink and golf to play.

Ben: I think the best thing that has happened to us as a duo over the years has been all of the people who have been here to help us along the way.

You know, for a while, we were working with a producer named Rob Schulte, who was really great. And we’re now very fortunate to have a full-time producer named Wynde Priddy, who is so good at anticipating things that are coming up and keeping our minds on what we need to be prepping for the future. And also taking all of the stuff off of our plate that involves the day-in, day-out of editing and producing the shows.

So when it’s all running as it should be, which is most of the time—Adam and I get to focus on prepping, sitting down and recording, and then listening back to basically finished episodes. At that point, we’re just pitching jokes. Like: “Hey, we could add a little audio here to illustrate this point or whatever.” But 90 percent of the time we listen to an episode that’s pretty much ready to go and are just signing off on it for Wynde.

I think that the logistics of making this are complex in some ways. But at its core, it’s just me and Adam having to watch a TV show and then talk to each other about it. And that period of the day, that period of the week where I’m talking to my buddy about a thing we both really love is still the best part of my week.

Adam: We’ve been doing this for 10 years. If you need to take some time off, we know about it usually a month before, and we prepare for it. We know that we record two or three or four episodes a week, every week.

We know that if one of us gets sick, we will have to record more than that in a given week. And I think part of it is if you know that’s what your life is, it’s not stressful or disappointing when that’s your responsibility. That’s just what it takes.

We were both in alignment right away initially that you cannot miss a week doing this because people depend on it for the rhythm of their own weeks. But also, be a fucking professional! Are you telling me you don’t have an afternoon in a given week to do the thing that you’re doing professionally? Get out of here. Of course you do! Find a way.

And this is why, when people over the years have told us, “I really want to do a podcast,” the first advice is: “The same time, the same day, every week. Forever.” And that’s the only advice I give because if you can do that for a year and you ask me what else you need to do, then we can have that conversation.

But if you’re not willing to be a pro like that, good luck. I doubt your ability to get traction with an audience, because I think so much depends on that.

Ben: The podcasts that I listen to throughout the week are something I really look forward to—those shows being there at that time when I do the thing that I do when I listen to them. And so we’ve been very lucky to burrow under the skin of a lot of people—

Adam: I wonder if that’s how we know, Ben? Like, we’re not just the president of Hair Club, we’re also the clients? I think we know what’s meaningful to a podcast listener because we are them ourselves. In a way, I feel like nouveau podcasting right now is often made up of hosts who are doing it because it’s lucrative in their niche, you know?

Ben: Wait, this can be lucrative? Shit, what have we been doing?

Ars:  I’m at a place in my life right now—and maybe you guys are, too—where I find it very hard to emotionally engage with the news. I find myself turning off the news on the radio, on my phone, in ways that I didn’t three years ago, five years ago. I used to be hyper-on: all the news, all the things, all the time. And I just can’t now. I just want to hear some guys talk about martinis.

Ben, you mentioned earlier that this is a show about the hang, and it’s sort of loosely anchored around the thing that you love, Star Trek.

Do you have that same feeling when it’s chatting with Adam Pranica about Baywatch? Does the subject for you, both of you, matter at all? Or does Star Trek have a particular emotional resonance in a way that, you know, lawns don’t?

Ben: I think that the Trek of it all is still really important to the show. And I think that we’re in an era where the news is devastating and exhausting in equal measure, and, you know, Trek has a lot of politics in it.

Adam and I share a lot of politics, but we also, I think, are pretty conscious of this being a place where the horrors of the world aren’t the center of attention.

So we’ve been pretty intentional about trying to make a thing that is a refuge and not a giant bummer.

And I think in its own way, that is an act of defiance. Still being able to have the hang despite all of the horrific shit going on is a sort of powerful statement—no, we’re not going to be ground into bummer pulp.

Adam: Yeah, I agree. I mean, I’m not interested in introducing that into our programs at all. I think a person’s politics is largely their behavior, and I don’t want to compare the things that I’m watching to the things that are happening in the real world generally.

But I think I might take a different side than Ben, about how Star Trek-located the project needs to be for it to be—I don’t know—fun or enriching.

I think those other projects, whether they’re about Baywatch or food or whatever—I’m interested in interesting conversations that are challenging or comedically interesting to me. It largely doesn’t matter what the subject is at its core. I want to be the sort of person that could make anything funny in conversation and through our various other types of shows, that’s become the truth, I hope.

Ben: That’s very fair. I still sort of think it’s the on-ramp for a lot of people. Like, oh, yeah, I like Star Trek. I’ll give that a try. And then it becomes about more than that.

Ultimately, I couldn’t make a show with Adam Pranica and Adam Ragusea if I wasn’t delighted by their perspective on things on an ongoing basis. The thing that’s amazing about this is we’ve made 600-something episodes of The Greatest Generation and 300-something episodes of Greatest Trek and dozens and dozens of episodes of Wholesome, and Adam says stuff every single time we sit down that surprises and delights me. That’s a complete magic trick.

Adam: You can’t do this for 10 years if it’s a bummer-hate show with a bunch of politics in it. That would have been exhausting nine years ago, you know? I don’t listen to any news or politics podcasts. Why would you? Look for the light where you can find it.

Ars: Going back to our original interview, you guys didn’t have very much in the way of established bits and jokes in the way that you do now.

I’m looking here at the Wikia and there’s a long list of bits and phrases: 50-year-old Ensign. Anybody Canyon. Bangers. Ball-kicking machine. Big Rod. McLaughlin Group. Miriam. Mount Armis. Natural Yeager.

Do you feel like any bits are played out? As I read through this, I’m like, “Oh yeah, I totally forgot about ‘Fuck Bokai.’ That’s pretty funny!”

Ben: Oh man, Fuck Bokai. That may have been the high-water mark! I think that one of the cool things about some of these is that they sort of ebb and flow depending on what we’re covering, you know?

There were things that were kind of jokes that stayed within the confines of Deep Space Nine or Voyager that sometimes you get an idea and you can pull one out of the cold storage.

But often the group of active working runners is very influenced by what we are actively covering. I think it’ll be very interesting to see how that long list of old inside jokes interacts with the show when we start going back through the second time.

Because I’m kind of tempted to not reference any of that stuff. I don’t know. I will have to see what happens when we start doing it.

Adam: I feel the same way, Ben. I think we don’t do a bit just because it’s “time to do the bit.” I have felt for a long time that it’s not funny if you’re trying to be funny. If we choose to turn it around and go back from the beginning—these are going to be new experiences for the time that we record them.

And they’re going to feel brand new. I wouldn’t expect a retread of much of anything. Because that doesn’t sound funny to me.

Ben: Well, also 10 years older. Our lives are different. Our world is different.

We will see new things in the show. And that’s one of the things that’s so cool about Star Trek: I feel like I experience it in new ways each time I watch it. So I think it’s kind of inevitable that it will get something that is really different and novel. And maybe some of those old runners will find their way back because they happen to be the funny thing at that moment.

But generally speaking, I’m really excited for crumpling up the paper and throwing it away and writing something fresh, you know?

Adam: Cyrus, you mentioned the Wiki, and I just want to say, one of the best things that’s happened to us over the 10 years of making the show has been the community that formed around it to do things, like making the wiki, making the Discord, that have formed groups where they watch movies together and date each other and marry each other and whatever.

This is a thing that we didn’t intend—imagine doing a thing so important that a large audience would enjoy it—but this large audience has their own lives, and they’re enjoying this thing that we do completely separate from us in their own way.

In a way, that’s great. Neither Ben nor I have the time or the inclination to make a wiki about our show, for example. And yet the folks that put in the effort here to make the experience of listening to the show better for everyone—that’s selfless and good and appreciated.

Ars: Given that there’s such a large body of work that you guys have produced, do you ever get people asking: “You guys have done a thousand episodes. Where do I start?”

I’ll give my answer first. I always tell people who are Star Trek fans but who have maybe not listened to Greatest Gen, “Choose a Star Trek episode that you love or that is memorable to you in some way and listen to the podcast episode about that episode.”

Ben: I like that, too. I also get the question “Oh, you know a lot about Star Trek. I want to get my kid into it. Where should we start?” And I don’t really think that there’s a right answer to that kind of question. Like, going back to the beginning doesn’t necessarily work for me or doesn’t necessarily work as an answer for everybody.

So I like the suggestion to jump in somewhere where you feel like you’ve got some fluency, but I also think it’s totally cool to jump in midstream on the show now or, you know, start at the beginning of one of the series that you really like or jump around. We hear from people that do it all different kinds of ways.

We’ve heard from people who got into the Greatest Generation because of Greatest Trek. We’ve heard from people who started listening to the Greatest Generation and were like: “Well, there’s a lot of references to old stuff in here. So I better go back and listen from the beginning.”

And then they binge the entire thing in three months. And I’m concerned that there may be some kind of exposure toxicity!

Adam: It’s an interesting quality to consider because a lot of the podcasts I listen to are about sports, and the sports that just happened over the weekend. No one listens to that show a month after it comes out.

But 10 years of our conversations are still being listened to in a way that I feel [isn’t the case] if you’re podcasting about the football game.

Ben: As many things as we’ve done in the past of the show, they stay in the present for a lot of people—I think more than half of our downloads in a given week are old episodes.

So that is a place where people hang out, and I think a lot of people that have jobs where they’re working with their hands but they don’t need to be processing language—[they] love podcasts. So we hear from a lot of graphic designers and truckers who like the show.

And that huge back catalog is such a boon to them because by the time you’re on your second listen through, you’re not going to remember exactly how the bit went from episode 324. So the comedy works again for that person.

Ars: I presume you guys have received screeners for Starfleet Academy. How are you feeling about Starfleet Academy as a show? And how are you guys feeling about doing it for your own show?

Ben: I’ve watched two episodes now. And I remain pretty optimistic about Starfleet Academy as a show. I think that there is some melancholy to it being the only one that’s actively being made now of any of the shows. I think they’ve wrapped on Strange New Worlds, even though they haven’t released season four. And none of the others are, like, in production at this point.

Adam: I’m also two episodes in—two very long episodes. I think that one of the qualities to Starfleet Academy that’s been surprising is the hour-long nature of it.

I think many years ago I coined the phrase “Star Trek is a place.” And what that means definitionally is that it’s not a ship or a particular captain or a planet or a federation. It’s a place to tell stories.

That’s just my way of saying that Starfleet Academy at this point, two episodes in, feels like the expression of that idea. Like, Starfleet Academy exists in a place that is Star Trek.

So I don’t hate it because they put out a cheesy poster. I don’t hate it at all! I am enjoying what I’ve seen so far. It’s interesting and new. I think the feeling that I have about it is something that Ben touched on a little bit there, which was like, are we getting near the end of it? Are we going to go back into the desert of ten years without Star Trek?

I hope not because I think my preference is going to always be that I would rather have Star Trek even if it’s difficult or disliked by folks or whatever, than to go without it at all because it provokes thought. I mean, even when it’s not your Star Trek, I think it’s still fun to talk about.

Ars: One of your greatest wishes—maybe the greatest wish of your lives—is to be blown out of an airlock in a new episode of Star Trek. How close are we to seeing that on screen?

Ars: Have you actually pitched this to somebody who could make it happen?

Ben: There are people inside the walled garden that are aware that a lot of people are invested in this idea. And yeah, it’s happened in comics, it’s happened in fan productions several times now.

We leap at every opportunity we have to get blown out of an airlock. If and when the call comes from inside the Star Trek house, it will be the thrill of a lifetime. That remains the overarching goal of the show, I would say.

We’ve gone so far as to say that if the offer is made, we will fly ourselves to Toronto. If [Paramount is] obligated by some kind of agreement with the union to pay us, we will donate that money to a charity.

This is not about fame or fortune for us. It is about getting blown out of an airlock, which…

Adam: It’s about finally experiencing the sweet, sweet peace of death.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/wiper-malware-targeted-poland-energy-grid-but-failed-to-knock-out-electricity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers on Friday said that Poland’s electric grid was targeted by wiper malware, likely unleashed by Russia state hackers, in an attempt to disrupt electricity delivery operations.

A cyberattack, Reuters reported, occurred during the last week of December. The news organization said it was aimed at disrupting communications between renewable installations and the power distribution operators but failed for reasons not explained.

On Friday, security firm ESET said the malware responsible was a wiper, a type of malware that permanently erases code and data stored on servers with the goal of destroying operations completely. After studying the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attack, company researchers said the wiper was likely the work of a Russian government hacker group tracked under the name Sandworm.

“Based on our analysis of the malware and associated TTPs, we attribute the attack to the Russia-aligned Sandworm APT with medium confidence due to a strong overlap with numerous previous Sandworm wiper activity we analyzed,” said ESET researchers. “We’re not aware of any successful disruption occurring as a result of this attack.”

Sandworm has a long history of destructive attacks waged on behalf of the Kremlin and aimed at adversaries. Most notable was one in Ukraine in December 2015. It left roughly  230,000 people without electricity for about six hours during one of the coldest months of the year. The hackers used general purpose malware known as BlackEnergy to penetrate power companies’ supervisory control and data acquisition systems and, from there, activate legitimate functionality to stop electricity distribution. The incident was the first known malware-facilitated blackout.

ESET said the attack targeting Poland occurred on the 10th anniversary of that event. The security firm provided few other details about the attack other than the malware used has been dubbed DynoWiper.

Custom Wipers have long been a preferred tool for Russian hackers. In 2022, government attackers used wiper malware dubbed AcidRain to knock out 270,000 satellite modems in Ukraine in an attempt to disrupt communications. At the time, it was the seventh wiper Russia had used against since invading the neighboring country. ESET said last year that Sandworm had unleashed multiple wipers on universities and critical infrastructure in Ukraine.

The best known case of Russia’s use of wipers came in 2017 with the release of NotPetya. The destructive worm was intended to target only Ukraine, but quickly spread around the world and wreaked havoc as it disrupted computer operations. The event is estimated to have cost governments and businesses $10 billion, making it likely the most expensive computer intrusion in history.

There is no indication how or why DynoWiper failed to take out power. It’s possible Russia planned it to do so in an attempt to send a message without provoking Polish allies. Another possibility is that cyber defenses prevented the wiper from working as intended.</div>

            <h2>Did Edison accidentally make graphene in 1879?</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/did-edison-accidentally-make-graphene-in-1879/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Graphene is the thinnest material yet known, composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. That structure gives it many unusual properties that hold great promise for real-world applications: batteries, super capacitors, antennas, water filters, transistors, solar cells, and touchscreens, just to name a few. The physicists who first synthesized graphene in the lab won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics. But 19th century inventor Thomas Edison may have unknowingly created graphene as a byproduct of his original experiments on incandescent bulbs over a century earlier, according to a new paper published in the journal ACS Nano.

“To reproduce what Thomas Edison did, with the tools and knowledge we have now, is very exciting,” said co-author James Tour, a chemist at Rice University. “Finding that he could have produced graphene inspires curiosity about what other information lies buried in historical experiments. What questions would our scientific forefathers ask if they could join us in the lab today? What questions can we answer when we revisit their work through a modern lens?”

Edison didn’t invent the concept of incandescent lamps; there were several versions predating his efforts. However, they generally had a a very short life span and required high electric current, so they weren’t well suited to Edison’s vision of large-scale commercialization. He experimented with different filament materials starting with carbonized cardboard and compressed lampblack. This, too, quickly burnt out, as did filaments made with various grasses and canes, like hemp and palmetto. Eventually Edison discovered that carbonized bamboo made for the best filament, with life spans over 1200 hours using a 110 volt power source.

Lucas Eddy, Tour’s  grad student at Rice, was trying to figure out ways to mass produce graphene using the smallest, easiest equipment he could manage, with materials that were both affordable and readily available. He considered such options as arc welders and natural phenomena like lightning striking trees—both of which he admitted were “complete dead ends.” Edison’s light bulb, Eddy decided, would be ideal, since unlike other early light bulbs, Edison’s version was able to achieve the critical 2000 degree C temperatures required for flash Joule heating—the best method for making so-called turbostratic graphene.

Plus, Eddy had access to Edison’s original 1879 patent describing the invention process. Eddy recreated Edison’s experiment, attaching light bulbs to a 110-volt power source and switching it on for 20 seconds at a time to rapidly heat the carbon-based material to between 2000 to 3000 degrees C. (Switch it on for any longer and you get graphite rather than graphene.) Then he examined the results using a modern optical microscope.

His first attempt didn’t work out because the bulbs he bought turned out to use tungsten rather than carbon filaments. “You can’t fool a chemist,” said Eddy. “But I finally found a small art store in New York City selling artisan Edison-style light bulbs.” Those artisan bulbs used bamboo filaments, with diameters a mere 5 micrometers larger than Edison’s original filaments.

This time, Eddy noticed that the carbon filament turned to a “lustrous silver.” Raman spectroscopy revealed that parts of the filament had turned into turbostratic graphene. The team also took before and after images using transmission electron microscopy. Eddy and his co-authors acknowledge that this is not definitive proof that Edison produced graphene. The inventor lacked the means to detect it even if he had been aware that such a material existed. And even if one were to analyze Edison’s original bulb, any graphene would have long since turned into graphite.

The authors concluded by noting the research potential of revisiting other early technologies using the tools of modern materials science, such as vacuum tubes, arc lamps, and early X-ray tubes. These also may have accidentally produced unusual materials or reactions that weren’t analyzed or even noticed at the time. “Innovation can emerge from reinterpreting the past with fresh tools and new questions,” they wrote. “In the case of ‘Edison graphene,’ a 140-year-old invention continues to shed light not just literally but scientifically.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/a-weird-itchy-rash-is-linked-to-the-keto-diet-but-no-one-knows-why/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A 20-year old man in Taiwan went to a dermatology clinic for a strange rash that had developed across his shoulders and chest. The raised, red, and itchy condition had been bothering him for a full month. By this point, he had also developed patches of pigmented skin interlaced with the red rash.

According to a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine, a skin biopsy showed swelling between his skin cells and inflammation around blood vessels, but testing came up negative for other common signs of skin conditions, leaving doctors with few leads. The doctors ultimately came to a diagnosis not by analyzing his skin further but by hearing about his diet.

The man told doctors that two months prior to his clinic appointment—a month before his rash developed—he had switched to a ketogenic diet, which is a high-fat but very low-carbohydrate eating pattern. This diet forces the body to shift from using glucose (sugar derived from carbohydrates) as an energy source to fat instead.

When this happens, the body can go into ketosis. This starts with fat tissue breaking down, leading to the release of free fatty acids. These fatty acids are transported to the liver, where they’re metabolized to acetyl-CoA. Excessive amounts of this molecule gum up metabolic processes and lead to the formation of ketone bodies, primarily acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. (A ketone is a specific chemical structure that includes a single bond to two CH3 or R groups with a double bond to an oxygen molecule.) Ketone bodies made in the liver can enter the circulatory system and be used as a source of energy for tissues around the body, particularly the brain.

Ketogenic diets have clinical uses—they’ve proven useful for managing drug-resistant epilepsy and some rare genetic metabolic diseases. Studies have looked at them as possible ways to manage obesity and type 2 diabetes, and there’s interest in their use in cancer metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.

Otherwise, the keto diet is popular among people trying to lose weight, particularly those trying to lose visceral fat, like the man in the case study. Anecdotal reports promote the keto diet as being effective at helping people slim down relatively quickly while also improving stamina and mental clarity. But robust clinical data supporting these claims are lacking, and medical experts have raised concerns about long-term cardiovascular health, among other things.

There are also clear downsides to the diet. Ketones are acidic, and if they build up too much in the blood, they can be toxic, causing ketoacidosis. This is a particular concern for people with type 1 diabetes and for people with chronic alcohol abuse. For everyone else, there’s a list of common side effects, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, bad breath, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. Ketogenic diets are also linked to high cholesterol and kidney stones.

But there’s one side effect that’s well established but little known and still puzzling to doctors: the “keto rash” or prurigo pigmentosa. This rash fits the man’s case perfectly—red, raised, itchy bumps on the neck, chest, and back, with areas of hyperpigmentation also developing.

The rash was first identified in Japan in 1971, where it was mostly seen in women. While it has been consistently linked to metabolic disorders and dietary changes, experts still don’t understand what causes it. It’s seen not only in people on a keto diet but also in people with diabetes and those who have had bariatric surgery or are fasting.

In a review this month, researchers in Saudi Arabia noted that a leading hypothesis is that the high levels of ketones in the blood trigger inflammation around blood vessels driven by a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, and this inflammation is what causes the rash, which develops in different stages.

While the condition remains poorly understood, effective treatments have at least been worked out. The most common treatment is to get the person out of ketosis and give them an antibiotic in the tetracycline class. Antibiotics are designed to treat bacterial infections (which this is not), but they can also dampen inflammation signals and thwart the activity of neutrophils.

In the man’s case, doctors gave him a two-week course of doxycycline and told him to ditch his keto diet. A week later, the rash was gone.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/tr-49-is-interactive-fiction-for-fans-of-deep-research-rabbit-holes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve ever fallen down a Wikipedia rabbit hole or spent a pleasant evening digging through college library stacks, you know the joy of a good research puzzle. Every new source and cross-reference you find unlocks an incremental understanding of a previously unknown world, forming a piecemeal tapestry of knowledge that you can eventually look back at as a cohesive and well-known whole.

TR-49 takes this research process and operationalizes it into an engrossing and novel piece of heavily non-linear interactive fiction. Researching the myriad sources contained in the game’s mysterious computer slowly reveals a tale that’s part mystery, part sci-fi allegory, part family drama, and all-compelling alternate academic history.

The entirety of TR-49 takes place from a first-person perspective as you sit in front of a kind of Steampunk-infused computer terminal. An unseen narrator asks you to operate the machine but is initially cagey about how or why or what you’re even looking for. There’s a creepy vibe to the under-explained circumstances that brought you to this situation, but the game never descends into the jump scares or horror tropes of so many other modern titles.

Your only real form of interaction with the world of TR-49 is through a sepia-toned tube display on the left and a four-character split-flap on the right that serves as the computer’s only input. You quickly discover that entering specific sequences—each with two letters followed by two numbers, as suggested by the game’s name—brings up library catalog-style entries referring to a vast web of literary works that form the core of the game’s wider fiction.

While the catalog contains short excerpts from each of these discovered works, it’s the additional notes added to each entry by subsequent researchers that place each title in its full context. You’ll end up poring through these research notes for clues about the existence and chronology of other authors and works. Picking out specific names and years points to the codes and titles needed to unlock even more reference pages in the computer, pushing you further down the rabbit hole. Picture something like Her Story, but replace the cinéma vérité surveillance video clips with a library card catalog.

You’ll slowly start to unravel and understand how the game world’s myriad authors are influencing each other with their cross-pollinating writings. The treatises, novels, pamphlets, and journals discussed in this database are full of academic sniping, intellectual intrigue, and interpersonal co-mingling across multiple generations of work. It all ends up circling a long-running search for a metaphysical key to life itself, which most of the authors manage to approach but never quite reach a full understanding.

As you explore, you also start to learn more about the personal affairs of the researchers who collected and cataloged all this reference material and the vaguely defined temporal capabilities of the information-synthesis engine in the computer you’ve all worked on. Eventually, you’ll stumble on the existence of core commands that can unlock hidden parts of the computer or alter the massive research database itself, which becomes key to your eventual final goal.

Through it all, there’s a slowly unfolding parallel narrative involving Liam, the unseen voice guiding you through the research process itself. Through occasional voice clips, Liam eventually hints at the existence of a powerful and quickly encroaching threat that wants to stop your progress by any means necessary, adding a bit of dramatic tension to your academic pursuits.

I’m being intentionally vague about the specifics here because I think TR-49‘s subtle and well-crafted sci-fi world-building is best experienced by exploring the game for yourself. There’s a real satisfaction in staring at a once impenetrably obtuse research note, recalling a bit of information from a recent cross-reference, and feeling your understanding suddenly click into place. And while the vocal performances can verge on cheesy, the writing captures the monomaniacal intensity of truly obsessive academics to a tee.

One of the game’s best features is a “Notes” sub-menu, which automatically outlines relevant facts (and potential facts) about various authors, groups, and publications as you discover them. This means you don’t have to take page after page of hand-written notes to keep track of the game’s complex connections (and potential connections), as you do in games like Blue Prince or Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. It makes for a much smoother puzzle-solving experience, even if the automatic notes sometimes pick up on things you may have missed while skimming.

TR-49 also benefits from being relatively compact compared to some other narrative deduction games. A diligent investigator can reach a conclusion in four or five hours, depending on how thorough they want to be. That makes it relatively easy to keep the broad outlines of the game’s dense but parsable world in your head over a couple of evening play sessions.

There are bound to be some people who see TR-49 as akin to a homework simulator, with painful flashbacks to all-nighters spent desperately researching a last-minute college term paper. For anyone who knows the inherent appeal of diving deep into a previously unknown world, though, TR-49 is an engrossing work of world-building fiction presented in a truly memorable way.</div>

            <h2>Demand for Intel's processors is apparently there, but the supply is not</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/core-ultra-series-3-launch-may-be-hampered-by-chip-shortages-says-intel/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel reported its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2025 yesterday, and the news both for the quarter and for the year was mixed: year-over-year revenue was down nearly imperceptibly, from $53.1 billion to $52.9 billion, while revenue for the quarter was down about four percent, from $14.3 billion last year to $13.7 billion this year. (That number was, nevertheless, on the high end of Intel’s guidance for the quarter, which ranged from $12.8 to $13.8 billion.)

Diving deeper into the numbers makes it clear exactly where money is being made and lost: Intel’s data center and AI products were up 9 percent for the quarter and 5 percent for the year, while its client computing group (which sells Core processors, Arc GPUs, and other consumer products) was down 7 percent for the quarter and 3 percent for the year.

That knowledge makes it slightly easier to understand the bind that company executives talked about on Intel’s earnings call (as transcribed by Investing.com). In short, Intel is having trouble making (and buying) enough chips to meet demand, and it makes more sense to allocate the chips it can make to the divisions that are actually making money—which means that we could see shortages of or higher prices for consumer processors, just as Intel is gearing up to launch the promising Core Ultra Series 3 processors (codenamed Panther Lake).

Intel CFO David Zinsner indicated that Intel is “prioritizing [its] internal wafer supply to data center” and having more of its consumer chips made externally. Substantial portions of the Core Ultra Series 3 processors are manufactured at Intel, after the company primarily used TSMC’s chip factories for the Core Ultra Series 2 designs.

“We can’t completely vacate the client market,” said Zinsner, but Intel is “shifting as much as we can over to data center to meet the high demand.”

Compounding this is that yields for the new 18A process—that is, the number of chips in a wafer with no defects that can work as designed—are still improving. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said that “while yields are in line with our internal plans, they are still below what I want them to be.”

Yields are currently improving by 7 or 8 percent every month, according to Intel. But that could be building on pretty low initial yields—reporting from last summer suggested that just 10 percent of the chips coming off of the 18A production lines were meeting Intel’s requirements at the time. Intel predicts that its supply will have ramped up enough within the next few months to help alleviate shortages.

“I do believe that the first quarter is the trough,” said Zinsner. “We will improve supply in the second quarter.”

When Intel can start making enough chips to meet its demand, it ought to help brighten the company’s earnings reports.

“We delivered [our Q4 2025] results despite supply constraints, which meaningfully limited our ability to capture all of the strengths in our underwriting markets,” said Tan. “We are working aggressively to address this and better support our customers’ needs going forward.”

Intel has been signaling for a while now that it was selling essentially all of the chips it could get its hands on. Intel investor relations VP John Pitzer said last month that Intel would be selling more of both its Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake Core Ultra Series 2 chips for consumers, as well as its Granite Rapids chips for data centers, if it could get more of them.

As Intel seeks to improve its position in the short term, the company also says that it’s still making progress on its future manufacturing nodes, including different versions of the 18A process and the upcoming 14A process. Intel is working to engage “potential external customers” who would use the 14A process to make their own chips. If these third parties decide to use Intel’s manufacturing facilities, Intel expects to know about it “starting in the second half of this year and extending into the first half of 2027,” and then it expects to build out manufacturing capacity based on the number of external customers it finds.

On the chip design side, Intel also expects to have its first next-generation Nova Lake chips ready “at the end of 2026.” We don’t know much about Nova Lake yet, but it should be Intel’s next architecture to cover both desktop and laptop processors, while Panther Lake chips are intended mainly for laptops. At least part of the chip will also be manufactured using the 18A process.</div>

            <h2>Children Starting School Are Trying to Swipe Books Like They’re Phones</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An alarming proportion of kids just starting school are baffled by how books work.

In a new survey of primary, or elementary, school staff conducted by the UK charity Kindred Squared, the teachers estimated that nearly a third of students in reception class — the equivalent of pre-school in the US — did not know how to correctly use books. At times, some children even tried to swipe or tap the pages like a smartphone, reported Sky News.

It’s sounds incredible, but it’s not the first that we’ve heard of the bizarre phenomenon. The Kindred researchers define “using” books separately from literacy, and instead focus on a child’s ability to intuit turning the pages, rather than trying to interact with them like a touchscreen. Even though 44 percent of parents believe this is something a child should be able to do, the reality according to the 1,000 surveyed teachers is that 28 percent of them can’t. Teachers in the survey, which focused on other aspects of school readiness beyond reading, also said that around a quarter of children weren’t toilet trained and couldn’t eat and drink on their own.

The findings are a grim reflection of how smartphones have taken over our lives and will add to the concerns over screen time’s impact on a child’s development. Parents are themselves addicted to their devices and pass their bad habits along, spawning whole generations of “iPad babies.”

A strong link between screen time and diagnoses of ADHD, for example, was documented in a study that followed tweens over the course of four years. For children four years old and younger, a 2023 study found that those that spent several hours a day watching screens were more likely to miss key development goals, including those related to language, social, and fine motor skills.

Another linked touchscreen use by toddlers to long term problems related to regulating their emotions. And further underscoring the danger of thrusting the devices into extremely youthful minds, a study of kids 12 and younger found that the younger they were when they received a smartphone, the higher the risk they were at of obesity, sleep deprivation, and depression.

All the while, AI — which tech giants are spending millions of dollars to push into schools — is adding a whole new dimension of risk to these already addictive devices, as many children and teens form relationships with their AI companions. Meanwhile, some parents are even placating their kids by letting them talk to an AI chatbot’s voice mode for hours at a time.

These concerns have spurred some schools to ban smartphones entirely. And while teachers say these measures have already lifted the mood at schools, they can’t control how parents are letting their children use these devices at home, as evidenced by the new survey.

            <h2>Waymo’s School Bus Situation Just Got Way Worse</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If Waymo thought regulators would get off its back for its robotaxis blowing past stopped school buses, it thought wrong.

On Friday, the National Transportation Safety Board announced it opened an investigation into the self-driving company over the alarming incidents, and specifically the more than 20 instances reported in Austin, Texas.

“Investigators will travel to Austin to gather information on a series of incidents in which the automated vehicles failed to stop for loading or unloading students,” the NTSB said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.

The probe makes the NTSB the second regulator to investigate Waymo over the behavior of its robotaxis around school buses after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched its own probe last October.

So far, most of the reports have come from Austin, but at least six were reported in Atlanta, Georgia, as well. The Waymos ignored the buses’ flashing lights and extended stop arm, an infraction that can bring major penalties for human drivers. No serious collisions or injuries have been reported, but in at least one incident, a Waymo drove right by the students who were disembarking from the bus.

In December, Waymo issued a voluntary software recall for over 3,000 of its 5th-generation vehicles to address the issue, and Waymo claimed that all the affected vehicles had received the patch in November, before the recall officially went out. But an Austin school district claimed that it had reported at least one violation after the patch had been applied, suggesting it didn’t fully address the issue.

Waymo’s own data suggests that its robotaxis are vastly safer drivers than humans. Nonetheless, numerous incidents beyond the school bus violations show that the driverless cabs are still far from perfect. The cars have been spotted driving on the wrong side of the road, getting stuck in roundabouts, blowing through police standoffs, and driving on light rail tracks as if it were actually a railcar. It also stoked intense community backlash when one of its robotaxis ran over and killed a beloved bodega cat.

But the company’s biggest snafu came last month, when seemingly its entire San Francisco fleet suddenly forgot how to drive after the city experienced a power outage, causing the cars to stop in the middle of roads and clog up busy intersections.

Waymo sounds optimistic about the case. Pointing to its safety track record, chief safety officer Mauricio Peña maintains that the company has done its due diligence and emphasized that none of the incidents resulted in collisions.

“We are confident that our safety performance around school buses is superior to human drivers,” Peña said in a statement, via TechCrunch. “We see this as an opportunity to provide the NTSB with transparent insights into our safety-first approach,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Three months ago, the Trump administration broke ground on its highly controversial plans to add a sprawling ballroom to the White House’s East Wing.

The State Department-funded buildout attracted plenty of scrutiny from congressional inquiries, lawsuits, and the press. Just this week, a US District judge will be weighing a bid by a preservation group to grind the $400 million plans to a halt.

Meanwhile, as CNN reports, a far more discreet plan is in the works. An existing bunker, called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, which was built in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, had to make way for the ballroom.

Plans to rebuild an underground shelter that could once again provide protection for key White House officials have been shrouded in plenty of secrecy. And given the country’s current precarious state of unrest — in large part the result of the Trump administration’s controversial actions — that’s not particularly surprising.

It sounds like a formidable installation. A source with knowledge of the matter told CNN that the new bunker will be “replaced with new technology to counter evolving threats.”

White House director of management and administration Joshua Fisher told reporters that the administration is making “necessary security enhancements,” and delivering “resilient, adaptive infrastructure aligned with future mission needs” with its plans for the ballroom.

“There are some things regarding this project that are, frankly, of top-secret nature that we are currently working on,” he added, as quoted by CNN. “That does not preclude us from changing the above-grade structure, but that work needed to be considered when doing this project, which was not part of the [National Capital Planning Commission] process.”

The Presidential Emergency Operations Center was designed to protect officials from major attacks, including a potential nuclear explosion.

Former vice president Dick Cheney fled to the facility in the moments ahead of the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon, for instance. Trump also reportedly used the bunker during the 2020 George Floyd protests.

The complex was a “very complicated submarine that was built in the 1940s — a self-contained unit, [with] separate power backups, separate water backups, separate air filtration,” a source told CNN. “But all the infrastructure is 1940s infrastructure.”

A separate source confirmed to the broadcaster that “all of the subterranean structures,” including the bunker, have been gutted as well.

How much all of this will cost, and whether all of the associated expenses will actually be picked up by private donors, as president Donald Trump has assured, remains unclear.

“If you think about trying to mitigate the threats today and the threats for tomorrow, you’re really talking about emerging technologies, emerging infrastructure — stuff that may not be commercially available,” risk management executive and former US Secret Service agent Jonathan Wackrow told CNN. “We’re never going to get the line of sight on how much that costs.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In today’s complex financial environment, governments need to juggle any number of security threats while keeping the global markets functioning smoothly. From AI attacks to widespread civil war, nothing seems too improbable for government fiscal watchdogs to rule out.

Now, one retired financial security analyst is warning of yet another eyebrow-raising risk to financial markets: first contact with alien life.

Helen McCaw, a former senior analyst at the Bank of England — the UK’s central bank — warns that the institution must prepare for a financial crisis triggered by confirmation of alien life. According to London publication The Times, McCaw has approached BoE governor Andrew Bailey in order to urge him to prepare financial contingencies for crises like civil unrest and the collapse of commercial financial institutions.

Though McCaw’s main concern is the UK, her worry stems from recent UFO mania coming from across the pond.

“The United States government appears to be partway through a multi-year process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs),” McCaw told The Times. “If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions.”

McCaw said she’s particularly concerned with market volatility in the wake of an alien announcement. The revelation that we are not alone in the universe could cause stock prices to swing rapidly “due to catastrophizing or euphoria,” or even a total “collapse in confidence” if traders lose hope in the future of human financial markets.

“If there is an official announcement and we get presented with very clear evidence that nobody is going to dispute, I would say that in a matter of hours, you are going to have total financial instability,” McCaw said. “If banks start failing, the payment system will collapse, and you’ll have rioting on the streets because people can’t fill their cars up with fuel or buy food in the supermarket.”

Basically, there’s no telling what alien life could do to our collective psyche, the former analyst seems to insist, so we might as well be prepared for anything.

“Even if you feel it’s very unlikely,” McCaw concluded, “it’s madness not to consider it and plan accordingly.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just over three years ago, OpenAI opened the floodgates with the launch of ChatGPT. The frantic industry-wide race that followed has resulted in soaring valuations for AI companies, tens of billions of dollars invested in data center infrastructure — and plenty of skepticism as well.

For one, experts have pointed out that OpenAI’s business fundamentals are inherently different from those of its competitors like Google. These legacy businesses can tap existing revenue sources to bankroll their major AI capital expenditures.

The Sam Altman-led OpenAI, however, has raised record amounts of cash and has vowed to spend well over $1 trillion before the end of the decade without the advantage of an existing business that generates ongoing revenue. (The company’s recent announcement that it’s stuffing ads into ChatGPT is likely a bid to shift that reality.)

The gap between the AI industry’s promises of a human-level AI-driven future and reality, in other words, has never been wider much like the enormous gulf between AI company valuations and their lagging revenues.

To many onlookers, that kind of hubris could end in disaster. As former Fidelity manager George Noble, who has spent decades in asset management, notes in a lengthy tweet, the company may already be “FALLING APART IN REAL TIME.”

“I’ve watched companies implode for decades,” he wrote. “This one has all the warning signs.”

Besides stalling subscriber growth, Noble pointed out that OpenAI is reportedly losing a staggering $12 billion per quarter, as well as “burning $15 million per day on [text-to-video generator app] Sora alone.” Noble also cast doubt on the AI industry’s promises of scaling up operations to meet demand, an immensely costly enterprise that’s bound to become even more expensive as AI models demand even more power.

Whether their utility will increase at the same rate remains a major point of contention, with some warning that we may have hit a point of diminishing returns in which each new iteration of the same AI model provides smaller and smaller benefits.

“Here’s the big math problem nobody wants to discuss,” Noble said. “It’s going to cost 5x the energy and money to make these models 2x better.”

“The low-hanging fruit is gone,” he added. “Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.”

As a result, the former asset management boss predicted that the “AI hype cycle is peaking” and that “diminishing returns are becoming impossible to hide” while “competitors are catching up.”

Noble advised investors to stay away from OpenAI, arguing that “I’m not touching OpenAI-adjacent plays at these valuations” since the “risk profile is astronomical.”

In a separate tweet, Noble compared Altman losing his cool during a podcast appearance last year when asked about the company’s eyebrow-raising financials to Enron’s former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who called an analyst an “asshole” during a now-infamous 2021 conference call after being questioned about not releasing a balance sheet. Skilling was at the epicenter of the Enron scandal and was eventually found guilty of conspiracy, insider trading, and securities fraud following the company’s collapse.

Noble’s comments come a week after Sebastian Mallaby, senior fellow at the nonpartisan think tank Council on Foreign Relations, predicted in an essay for the New York Times that OpenAI could run out of money within the “next 18 months.”

“OpenAI failure wouldn’t be an indictment of AI It would be merely the end of the most hype-driven builder of it,” he wrote.

Noble, on the other hand, has clearly taken a far more bearish position, arguing that Altman declaring a “code red” late last year was a blinking warning sign of a tough road ahead. As the Wall Street Journal reported at the time, the CEO urged staffers to focus on improving ChatGPT, even at the cost of delaying other projects, as Google continued to play a successful game of catch-up.

“I can’t state it more clearly,” he tweeted in a follow-up. “JUST SAY NO TO SCAM ALTMAN.”

“OpenAI is a cash incinerator,” he added. “The product is losses for investors.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As a severe winter storm approaches, the Trump administration has bigger concerns on its plate: not getting trolled on the internet. And, we almost forgot to mention, memes.

On Thursday, Homeland Security officials instructed disaster response staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency to avoid using the word “ice” in public messaging about the impending storm for an incredible reason, CNN reports: because of all the outrage surrounding the other ICE, the US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.

The urgent concern, according to two sources familiar with the directive, is that it could not only cause confusion, but heaps of online mockery.

“If FEMA says, ‘Keep off the roads if you see ice,’ it would be easy for the public to meme it,” one of the sources told CNN.

Ice posing a threat to the safety of American citizens? Gallows humor on the topic certainly does spring to mind — the controversial agency shot and killed another protestor today.

The unorthodox guidance, according to CNN‘s sourcing, was delivered “informally” by officials from the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both FEMA and ICE, and comes as the latter agency faces ever intensifying public backlash against its brutal — and deadly — crackdown in Minnesota. Meanwhile, FEMA, which Trump has openly mused about dismantling entirely, has been targeted with cuts and layoffs and reportedly plans to eliminate half its workforce, although it has paused those layoffs because of the storm, per another CNN scoop.

According to the latest reporting, the sources claim the officials said to avoid phrasing like “watch out for ice,” arguing that the memes those could spawn would take away from the serious nature of the warnings. Instead, the officials suggested using terms like “freezing rain,” very possibly eliciting groans from meteorologists the world over.

One of the sources called the directive a “dangerous precedent to set.”

“If we can’t use clear language to help prepare Americans,” the source told CNN, “then people may be left vulnerable and could suffer.”

Twenty-two states have issued states of emergency in anticipation of the storm that, stretching over 2,000 miles from Texas to New England, may affect over half the population of the entire country. In some regions, temperatures could plunge to such extremes lows that trees could start exploding.

One of the biggest threats the storm will pose, despite FEMA’s instructions to avoid mentioning it, is ice — the frozen water, not the immigration agency, which imperils roadways and weighs down trees, raising the risk of them toppling onto power lines.

If the directive to FEMA to censor ice because of ICE sounds too stupid to be true, then maybe it is, if you’re inclined to believe a very hostile sounding FEMA spokesperson.

“‘Reporting’ like this reads like a desperate ploy for clickbait rather than real journalism that actually gives Americans disaster preparedness information that could save lives,” the spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “FEMA will use correct and accurate descriptors of weather conditions to communicate clearly to the American people.”

The official status dashboard for Google Workspace suggests that the issues began at around 5am Pacific on Saturday morning, with users experiencing both “misclassification of emails in their inbox and additional spam warnings.”

For me, that meant my Primary inbox was filled with messages that would normally appear in the Promotions, Social, or Updates inboxes, and that spam warnings were appearing in emails from known senders.

Other users have complained on social media that “all the spam is going directly to my inbox” and that Gmail’s filters seem “suddenly completely busted.”

            <h2>Tech CEOs boast and bicker about AI at Davos</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/24/tech-ceos-boast-and-bicker-about-ai-at-davos/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There were times at this week’s meeting of the World Economic Forum when Davos seemed transformed into a high-powered tech conference, with on-stage appearances by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and even more industry executives.

The big topic, unsurprisingly, was AI, with CEOs laying a vision for the technology’s transformative potential while also acknowledging ongoing concerns that they’re inflating a massive bubble. Amidst all that big-picture prognostication, they also found time to take swipes at their competitors, and even at their ostensible partners.

On the latest episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, I discussed all things Davos with TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec and Sean O’Kane.

Kirsten noted that the conference seemed transformed from past years, with tech companies like Meta and Salesforce taking over the main promenade, while important topics like climate change failed to draw crowds. And Sean said that even if AI execs weren’t quite “panhandling for usage and more customers,” it could sometimes feel that way.

Read a preview of our full conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.

Kirsten: Some of the discussions around, let’s say, climate change or poverty and big global problems, [are] not really attracting the crowds. Meanwhile, on the main promenade in Davos, Switzerland, some of the biggest storefronts have been converted and taken over by companies like Meta and Salesforce, Tata, also a lot of Middle East countries. And I think the largest was the USA House, which was sponsored by McKinsey and Microsoft. It really felt visually different.

And then Elon Musk being there — Sean, you and I both listened to it. There wasn’t a lot of there there, but I will say that it was interesting that he showed up, because in the past he has avoided Davos.

Anthony: We were trying to pull out the tech content of Davos, [and] there are absolutely things that worth highlighting here, but it’s also striking how, especially as AI has become such a big business story, it’s hard to fully separate that from all the other threads going on in terms of bigger questions about international trade, about world politics.

One of the big headlines coming out of [Davos], for us at least, was the remarks by the CEO of Anthropic, where he basically attacked this Trump administration decision to allow Nvidia to send chips to China. It’s a story that is a tech story, but it’s also a trade story, it’s a politics story.

I think in terms of the substance of what he said, it felt consistent to me in the sense that he’s generally comfortable shooting his mouth off, and also that it’s this interesting line [in AI discourse] where there’s an element of criticism, but it also ties into this really intense AI hype. One of the phrases he used was that an AI data center is like a country full of geniuses. I have questions about that — but he’s like, “How could we possibly send all these chips to China if we’re worried about China? Because essentially we’re sending a country full of geniuses over to China and letting them control it.”

Sean: You could probably fill a notebook with all the different weird phrases that these CEOs use this week. The other one that has been stuck in my mind is that Satya Nadella kept calling the data centers token factories, which is a wonderful abstraction of what he thinks they’re there for.

You know, there were two things that really stuck out to me about all the different things that were said by these CEOs in different parts of the week. One is that they are definitely all sort of sniping at each other — not just Anthropic with Nvidia, which is interesting in its own right, because Anthropic is a huge Nvidia customer and uses Nvidia GPUs, and there’s an interesting tension there. But also just seeing them sitting them next to each other and really kind of pulling, know, putting the knives out a little bit more than we’re used to seeing.

We know that they’re all jockeying to be the lead and that they’re also trying to hold on to talent without overspending themselves to death. And this was one of the first times where it really felt like that tension was palpable and that they were present for it. Those two things are not often true at the same time.

The other thing, to your point about a lot of the geopolitics of it and the business of it — this was the most blatant that I feel like we’ve gotten these CEOs on record as far as what they think they need to continue succeeding.

Satya Nadella — I think you could maybe unfavorably read it this way, but I don’t think it’s that unfavorable — more or less was like, “More people need to be using this or else it’s going to be a bubble and a popped bubble.” He took a much different position in some ways from Dario Amadei of Anthropic, because Nadella’s focus is really about trying to broadly scoop up as much usage as possible [and] how do we make sure that AI is equitable across all these different communities and throughout the globe, versus concentrated in one place, like only the wealthy places, which I thought was an interesting tension. But there is an element of him giving away the game of not really panhandling for usage and more customers … but kind of.

And to that point, Jensen Huang of Nvidia did something similar, where he was more or less saying, “We’re not investing enough in this and we need more investment to be able to make this work.”

Kirsten: Jensen’s comments were interesting because he really talked about it in terms of job creation, and one could give the counterpoint of, there will be a moment where the build out slows, but no one’s really talking about that right now.

The other thing, I think, was a good point that you made, which is we’ve never really seen them all sort of together in a room sniping at each other. Oftentimes you’ll have like Sam Altman at a conference or Satya [Nadella], but here they are all together. So you’re hearing it in real time.

            <h2>Former Googlers seek to captivate kids with an AI-powered learning app</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/24/former-google-trio-is-building-an-interactive-ai-powered-learning-app-for-kids/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Big Tech companies and upcoming startups want to use generative AI to build software and hardware for kids. A lot of those experiences are limited to text or voice, and kids might not find that captivating. Three former Google employees want to get over that hurdle with their generative AI-powered interactive app, Sparkli.

Sparkli was founded last year by Lax Poojary, Lucie Marchand, and Myn Kang. As parents, Poojary and Kang were not able to satisfy their children’s curiosity or give engaging answers to their questions.

“Kids, by definition, are very curious, and my son would ask me questions about how cars work or how it rains. My approach was to use ChatGPT or Gemini to explain these concepts to a six-year-old, but that is still a wall of text. What kids want is an interactive experience. This was our core process behind founding Sparkli,” Poojary told TechCrunch over a call.

Prior to launching Sparkli, Poojary and Kang co-founded a travel aggregator called Touring Bird and a video-focused social commerce app, Shoploop, at Google’s Area 120, the company’s internal startup incubator. Poojary later went on to work at Google and YouTube on shopping. Marchand, who is the CTO of Sparkli, was also one of the co-founders of Shoploop and later worked at Google.

“When a kid asked what Mars looks like fifty years ago, we might have shown them a picture,” said Poojary. “Ten years ago, we might have shown them a video. With Sparkli, we want kids to interact and experience what Mars is like.”

The startup said that education systems often fall behind in teaching modern concepts. Sparkli wants to teach kids about topics like skills design, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship by creating an AI-powered learning “expedition.”

The app lets users explore some predefined topics in different categories or ask their own questions to create a learning path. The app also highlights one new topic every day to let kids learn something new. Kids can either listen to the generated voice or read the text. Chapters under one topic include a mix of audio, video, images, quizzes, and games. The app also creates choose-as-you-go adventures that don’t create the pressure of getting questions right or wrong.

Poojary mentioned that the startup uses generative AI to create all of its media assets on the fly. The company can create a learning experience within two minutes of a user asking a question, and it is trying to reduce this time further.

The startup mentioned that while AI assistants can help children learn certain topics, their focus is not on education. It said that to make its product effective, the first two hires were a PhD holder in educational science and AI and a teacher. This was a conscious decision to ensure its content better serves children, keeping principles of pedagogy in mind.

One of the key concerns around kids using AI is safety. Companies like OpenAI and Character.ai are facing lawsuits from parents who allege that these tools encouraged their children to self-harm. Sparkli said that while certain topics like sexual content are completely banned on the app, when a child asks about topics like self-harm, the app tries to teach them about emotional intelligence and encourages them to talk to their parents.

The company is piloting its app with an institute that has a network of schools with over 100,000 students. Currently, its target audience is children aged 5-12, and it tested its product in over 20 schools last year.

Sparkli has also built a teacher module that allows teachers to track progress and assign homework to kids. The company said that it was inspired by Duolingo to make the app engaging enough that kids can learn concepts and also feel like coming back to the app frequently. The app has streaks and rewards for kids for completing lessons regularly. It also gives kids quest cards, based on the initial avatar they have set up, for learning different topics.

“We have seen a very positive response from our school pilots. Teachers often use Sparkli to create expeditions that kids can explore at the start of the class and lead them into a more discussion-based format. Some teachers also used it to create [homework] after they explain a topic to let kids explore further and get a measure of their understanding,” Poojary said.

While the startup wants to primarily work with schools globally for the next few months, it wants to open up consumer access and let parents download the app by mid-2026.

The company has raised $5 million in pre-seed funding led by Swiss venture firm Founderful. Sparkli is Founderful’s first pure-play edtech investment. The firm’s founding partner, Lukas Weder, said that the team’s technical skill and market opportunity nudged him to invest in the startup.

“As a father of two kids who are in school now, I see them learning interesting stuff, but they don’t learn topics like financial literacy or innovation in technology. I thought from a product point of view, Sparkli gets them away from video games and lets them learn stuff in an immersive way,” Weder said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped its lawsuit against Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

The Winklevoss twins were donors to Donald Trump’s re-election campaign and also backed his family’s business ventures.

In a joint filing on Friday, the SEC and Gemini asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, which centered on the collapse of an investment product called Gemini Earn, with some investors losing access to their money for 18 months.

New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Gemini in 2023 and accused the company of defrauding investors. To justify dismissing the SEC’s case, the new filing points to a 2024 settlement between New York and Gemini, with investors ultimately receiving “one hundred percent of the crypto assets they had loaned […] through the Gemini Earn program.”

This appears to be a larger pattern of leniency from the Trump administration towards the crypto industry. The New York Times previously reported that the SEC has either dismissed, paused, or reduced penalties in more than 60 percent of the crypto lawsuits pending when Trump took office last year.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/24/a-new-test-for-ai-labs-are-you-even-trying-to-make-money/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re in a unique moment for AI companies building their own foundation model.

First, there is a whole generation of industry veterans who made their name at major tech companies and are now going solo. You also have legendary researchers with immense experience but ambiguous commercial aspirations. There’s a clear chance that at least some of these new labs will become OpenAI-sized behemoths, but there’s also room for them to putter around doing interesting research without worrying too much about commercialization.

The end result? It’s getting hard to tell who is actually trying to make money.

To make things simpler, I’m proposing a kind of sliding scale for any company making a foundation model. It’s a five-level scale where it doesn’t matter if you’re actually making money – only if you’re trying to. The idea here is to measure ambition, not success.

The big names are all at Level 5: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and so on. The scale gets more interesting with the new generation of labs launching now, with big dreams but ambitions that can be harder to read.

Crucially, the people involved in these labs can generally choose whatever level they want. There’s so much money in AI right now that no one is going to interrogate them for a business plan. Even if the lab is just a research project, investors will count themselves happy to be involved. If you aren’t particularly motivated to become a billionaire, you might well live a happier life at Level 2 than at Level 5.

The problems arise because it isn’t always clear where an AI lab lands on the scale — and a lot of the AI industry’s current drama comes from that confusion. Much of the anxiety over OpenAI’s conversion from a non-profit came because the lab spent years at Level 1, then jumped to Level 5 almost overnight. On the other side, you might argue that Meta’s early AI research was firmly at Level 2, when what the company really wanted was Level 4.

With that in mind, here’s a quick rundown of four of the biggest contemporary AI labs, and how they measure up on the scale.

Humans& was the big AI news this week, and part of the inspiration for coming up with this whole scale. The founders have a compelling pitch for the next generation of AI models, with scaling laws giving way to an emphasis on communication and coordination tools.

But for all the glowing press, Humans& has been coy about how that would translate into actual monetizable products. It seems it does want to build products; the team just won’t commit to anything specific. The most they’ve said is that they will be building some kind of AI workplace tool, replacing products like Slack, Jira and Google Docs but also redefining how these other tools work at a fundamental level. Workplace software for a post-software workplace!

It’s my job to know what this stuff means, and I’m still pretty confused about that last part. But it is just specific enough that I think we can put them at Level 3.

This is a very hard one to rate! Generally, if you have a former CTO and project lead for ChatGPT raising a $2 billion seed round, you have to assume there is a pretty specific roadmap. Mira Murati does not strike me as someone who jumps in without a plan, so coming into 2026, I would have felt good putting TML at Level 4.

But then the last two weeks happened. The departure of CTO and co-founder Barret Zoph has gotten most of the headlines, due in part to the special circumstances involved. But at least five other employees left with Zoph, many citing concerns about the direction of the company. Just one year in, nearly half the executives on TML’s founding team are no longer working there. One way to read events is that they thought they had a solid plan to become a world-class AI lab, only to find the plan wasn’t as solid as they thought. Or in terms of the scale, they wanted a Level 4 lab but realized they were at Level 2 or 3.

There still isn’t quite enough evidence to justify a downgrade, but it’s getting close.

Fei-Fei Li is one of the most respected names in AI research, best known for establishing the ImageNet challenge that kickstarted contemporary deep learning techniques. She currently holds a Sequoia-endowed chair at Stanford, where she co-directs two different AI labs. I won’t bore you by going through all the different honors and academy positions, but it’s enough to say that if she wanted, she could spend the rest of her life just receiving awards and being told how great she is. Her book is pretty good too!

So in 2024, when Li announced she had raised $230 million for a spatial AI company called World Labs, you might think we were operating at Level 2 or lower.

But that was over a year ago, which is a long time in the AI world. Since then, World Labs has shipped both a full world-generating model and a commercialized product built on top of it. Over the same period, we’ve seen real signs of demand for world-modeling from both video game and special effects industries — and none of the major labs have built anything that can compete. The result looks an awful lot like a Level 4 company, perhaps soon to graduate to Level 5.

Founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, Safe Superintelligence (or SSI) seems like a classic example of a Level 1 startup. Sutskever has gone to great lengths to keep SSI insulated from commercial pressures, to the point of turning down an attempted acquisition from Meta. There are no product cycles and, aside from the still-baking superintelligent foundation model, there doesn’t seem to be any product at all. With this pitch, he raised $3 billion! Sutskever has always been more interested in the science of AI than the business, and every indication is that this is a genuinely scientific project at heart.

That said, the AI world moves fast — and it would be foolish to count SSI out of the commercial realm entirely. On his recent Dwarkesh appearance, Sutskever gave two reasons why SSI might pivot, either “if timelines turned out to be long, which they might” or because “there is a lot of value in the best and most powerful AI being out there impacting the world.” In other words, if the research either goes very well or very badly, we might see SSI jump up a few levels in a hurry.

            <h2>How PopWheels helped a food cart ditch generators for e-bike batteries</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/24/how-popwheels-helped-a-food-cart-ditch-generators-for-e-bike-batteries/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Food carts are a staple of New York City dining, dispensing everything from dosa and doner kebabs to dogs and dim sum in short order. But no matter how enticing the aroma of a cart’s food, the smelly gas generators that keep the lights on threaten to put customers off their meals.

Cart owners and customers may not have to suck on fumes much longer. A Brooklyn-based startup is testing the use of its e-bike batteries to power food carts, starting with La Chona Mexican on the corner of 30th and Broadway in Manhattan.

“This really started out as a lark last summer,” David Hammer, co-founder and CEO of PopWheels, told TechCrunch. “I’m an ex-Googler from the early days, and this felt like a classic, old-school 20% project.”

Normally, PopWheels battery packs are zipping around the city strapped to food delivery bikes. The team soon realized that connecting them to food carts was an avenue worth pursuing.

“Are e-bike packs the perfect energy type to be powering food carts? Maybe, maybe not,” Hammer said. “I would argue it doesn’t matter. What matters is, can you solve distribution and charging?”

PopWheels currently operates 30 charging cabinets around Manhattan, which serve gig workers riding e-bikes, most of whom use either Arrow or Whizz models. That’s resulted in a “de facto  decentralized fleet,” Hammer said, allowing the company to stock just a few different types of batteries to serve hundreds of customers.

Many delivery workers ride into Manhattan from the farther reaches of the city. It’s a trip that can burn a significant portion of their charge, and many workers need two batteries to get through a full day. In response, bodegas started offering e-bike charging services, for which delivery workers typically pay $100 per month. When factoring in battery wear and tear, the total cost nears $2,000 per year, Hammer said.

“We can make the economics work so that we’re actually saving them money right off the bat,” he said. PopWheels charges customers $75 per month for unlimited access to its network, and Hammer said the company has a long waitlist.

The startup’s charging cabinets can hold 16 batteries, and PopWheels designed them to swiftly extinguish a battery fire should anything go awry during charging. (The company’s founding mission was to stamp out e-bike fires in New York City, which became a significant problem few years ago.) After building some initial cabinets, the company raised a $2.3 million seed round last year 2025.

Swap sites are typically small open spaces like parking lots, which PopWheels has retrofit with fences and the necessary electrical connections to support several cabinets. Each cabinet draws about as much electricity as a Level 2 electric vehicle charger, which is to say not that much.

As PopWheels e-bike service grew, the startup began studying other opportunities.

“There was always a little bit of an underlying thesis that there’s something bigger here,” Hammer said. “If you build urban-scale, fire-safe battery swapping infrastructure, you’re creating an infrastructure layer that lots of people are going to want to get on board with.”

Hammer started to think about alternative uses for the batteries after someone sent an article about how New York City was working to decarbonize food carts. That’s when the PopWheels team started running the numbers.

Food carts, Hammer estimates, probably spend around $10 a day on gas for their generators to keep the lights on. (Most of the cooking is done via propane, which is a separate matter.) That’s about how much PopWheels would charge someone to subscribe to four of its batteries per day. Conveniently, four of its batteries can supply about five kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is enough to cover the low end of what a typical cart might draw. If they need more juice, Hammer said they can run to a swap station midday.

After realizing the math penciled out, PopWheels built a prototype adapter and trialed it at a small event at the Brooklyn Navy Yard at last year’s New York Climate Week. Since then, the startup has been working with the the non-profit Street Vendor Project to move the idea forward. Last week’s demonstration with La Chona was the first time the batteries powered a food cart for a full day.

“I had multiple food cart owners come up to me and say, ‘Wait, there’s no noise with this cart. What are you guys doing? Can I get this?’” Hammer said.

“We are planning to roll this out aggressively starting this summer,” he said. “We think we could be cost neutral with gasoline for a food cart owner while solving all of the quality of life issues.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the early hours of January 3, the United States armed forces executed an astounding operation. American air, land, and sea units destroyed Venezuela’s air defenses, sent in Special Forces that took out President Nicolás Maduro’s security team, and brought the dictator and his wife back to the U.S. for trial. But rather than applaud the removal of an illegitimate dictator and his wife, many foreign leaders quickly condemned the snatch-and-grab.

If critics correctly argue that the attack on Venezuela violates international law, they have unintentionally revealed that international law—not the United States—must change. Removing Maduro was just: The dictatorship has killed tens, if not hundreds of thousands, of Venezuelans, destroyed the country’s economy, and denied the electoral wishes of the Venezuelan people for new leadership. But international law did nothing about this crisis, and countenanced no solution. Because it prevents Western democracies from using force to preempt grave threats from disruptive nations, such as Venezuela or Iran, while posing little obstacle to the designs of our rivals in Beijing or Moscow, international law no longer serves as an instrument of global stability. The United States must lead an effort to reform it to allow more stability-enhancing interventions in the new era of great-power competition that we are entering.

Opponents of the American intervention in Venezuela have a good case that Trump acted outside of legal norms. The U.S., along with virtually every nation in the world, has ratified the United Nations Charter, which forbids “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” The charter provides exceptions only when nations act under “the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense” or participate in actions approved by the UN Security Council (of which the U.S. is a member and enjoys an absolute veto). These opponents argue that the attack was not covered under either of these exceptions, and that no attack on the United States, its personnel, or its assets was imminent—a circumstance that international legal authorities generally concede would permit the preemptive use of force in self-defense.

Graeme Wood: The messiness of a post-Maduro world

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has offered an alternative justification for the Venezuela strike. He claims that the U.S. has the right to carry out its criminal law—here, executing an arrest—and to use armed force to protect law-enforcement agents, even within the territory of another nation without its permission. This is difficult to accept. Indeed, if such a rule took root, nations could use force against any other country in the world simply by indicting its leader. Rather than a law-enforcement operation, the attack on Venezuela constituted an act of war. It came in the midst of a broader conflict in which the United States has placed an oil blockade on Venezuela, destroyed alleged drug-running boats leaving Venezuelan ports, closed its airspace, leveled sanctions on its economy, and struck infrastructure targets. If any U.S. personnel had been captured in these operations, the White House surely would have demanded that they receive the protections under the Geneva Conventions for lawful combatants in an armed conflict.

The Trump administration should give up on any half-hearted legal defense of its attack. Rather, the United States should use this opportunity to change international law to be more flexible, specifically by shifting it away from the criminalization of preventive action. Washington itself promoted rules prohibiting aggression after World War II to stop another Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan from invading its neighbors. But such rules will not meaningfully deter Russia in Ukraine, or China in the South China Sea. Nor should democratic nations have to wait until troops are amassed at their borders or they have suffered a devastating attack before international law recognizes their right to act.

An international law that forbids all uses of force except for self-defense or force authorized by a paralyzed Security Council no longer fits today’s world. At the end of World War II, the United States attempted to use its vast power to create an international order that reflected its liberal values—peace and nonaggression, free trade, and democracy. But the U.S., aided by its democratic allies, no longer bestrides the world as a colossus. As the first Trump administration’s and the Biden administration’s national-security strategies recognized, the world is returning to great-power competition. Communist China has taken advantage of its rapid economic growth to embark on an astounding military building program, one that can already claim the largest navy in the world. Russia has launched the deadliest war in Europe since 1945 and seeks to test NATO’s viability. A loose axis of dictatorships in Moscow, Beijing, and Tehran is waging an assault, both open and covert, on the U.S.-led liberal order.

Democracies need room to maneuver as they strive to defend peace and security in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, and Asia from these illiberal regimes. International law should adopt a cost-benefit approach to interventions. It should allow military intervention today to prevent greater harms tomorrow, such as human-rights catastrophes, severe political and economic oppression by authoritarian regimes, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and the operations of international terrorist groups.

Reforming global rules will not affect the relationship between democracies and their opponents; the decision to use force will, as always, depend on their relative power and the likelihood of a successful military campaign, balanced against material losses and the possible destabilization of a region. Nations will create a far more effective deterrent to great-power conflict by deploying a capable military than by relying on the UN Charter. Changing the rules will not interfere with the great powers’ ability to balance one another, but instead should provide democracies with the legal right to protect peace and order from the destabilizing threats of dictatorships.

Anne Applebaum: Trump’s ‘American dominance’ may leave us with nothing

Abiding by current international rules only raises the costs of intervention in places such as Venezuela. A system that deems such interventions illegal will discourage allies from cooperating in the military actions needed to keep the peace; the British reportedly have refused to share intelligence with the U.S. on Caribbean drug traffic. It will inhibit the private sector from helping in the reconstruction and management of war-ravaged countries—oil companies will face uncertainty, because of the questionable legality of the American use of force, over any investments in Venezuela’s oil industry. (The U.S. dealt with a similar problem initially in Iraq, as I saw firsthand when I was working at the Justice Department at the time). International law thus is contributing to the disincentives that already discourage the United States and its allies from devoting the resources necessary to maintain global welfare. International rules should follow power relationships, rather than the other way around.

This is not to argue that global affairs should return to the law of the jungle (if there ever was one). International law should continue to prohibit pure aggression that serves no positive end, such as any effort by the U.S. to take Greenland or, for that matter, Russia’s efforts to annex Ukraine. We are fortunate to live in an age when civilized nations have made progress in reducing the destructiveness of war by demanding necessity and proportionality in the use of force and, expanding a norm that dates back to ancient times, greater protection for civilian life. But international law is not truly law in the domestic sense. It lacks compulsory jurisdiction and coercive enforcement mechanisms. It operates successfully only when it is aligned with the distribution of power and the wishes of nations. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. famously said that the common law was not a “brooding omnipresence in the sky,” whose eternal principles come down from on high to govern all human activity for all time. Neither is international law. When any international legal rule has outlived its usefulness, nations can replace it with one that better suits their needs.

That is the case today. Global power is shifting, and old fictions are collapsing. If international law is to retain relevance, it will have to follow power, not pretend to constrain it. The United States can use the Venezuela operation to recognize that the unipolar moment is over, that great-power politics have returned, and that international law must serve the greater good of allowing the democratic nations of the West to protect themselves and their people from a new rising axis of dictatorships.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-25</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/maxwell-frost-assault/685750/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last night at a bar in Park City, Utah, a man approached Representative Maxwell Frost and said to him, “We are going to deport you and your kind.” The 28-year-old man then yelled a racial slur and punched Frost in the face before running away, according to court documents reported by KUTV and a social-media post by Frost.

Just a few days into the second year of Donald Trump’s second term as president, his incendiary comments and actions, and the fact that they come from the president of the United States, seem to be inspiring some Americans to act in line with their worst intentions and their darkest passions, Frost told me. “Trump has brought out the worst in everybody,” Frost said when I reached him by phone this evening. “People are just really emboldened, and it’s a really scary time.”

Frost’s alleged assailant was arrested soon after the incident, with the help of security at the venue, and booked on suspicion of aggravated burglary, assaulting an elected official, and assault. The attack took place at a party for the talent agency CAA, celebrating the Sundance Film Festival’s final year in Park City.

Frost told me that he tries to “live a normal life,” not typically bringing security to bars or other small gatherings. Now he feels like he’ll have to bring security everywhere he goes in public. According to Frost, the Capitol Police are now involved in the investigation.

Adrienne LaFrance: How much worse is this going to get?

Frost said it wasn’t entirely clear that his assailant knew who the congressman was. “My friends think he did, but I don’t want to say for sure. He came right to me, but he was also drinking,” he said. “He was being a normal drunk guy at a bar and just being belligerent. Out of nowhere, completely, he got very racist.” Frost is Black and Latino and grew up in central Florida, the region he now represents in Congress. In 2022, at age 25, he became the first member of Gen Z to be elected to the U.S. House, and now, at age 29, he remains the youngest member of Congress.

In recent years, politicians on both sides of the aisle have been subjected not just to threats, but also to violent attacks. As such incidents mount, it’s growing harder for elected officials to interact with the public—and less appealing to run for office. As a result, it’s not just the politicians who are victimized by violence, but the democratic system itself.</div>

            <h2>Minneapolis Is a Second Amendment Wake-Up Call</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-25</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/minneapolis-second-amendment-tyranny/685749/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, as rumors swirled about an impending ICE surge that would target the Somali population in Maine, where I live, I called my barbershop to schedule a last-minute appointment. I didn’t want a haircut, but I worried that I needed one. I am a light-skinned Black American: My hair and beard are thick and curly. On Thursday, I had both cut extra short in an effort to look less like someone ICE might find interesting. That is to say, for the first time in my life, I tried to look a little whiter.

I had seen video after video of federal agents occupying Minneapolis, flagrantly racially profiling innocent people on the street—demanding that American citizens, including police officers and Native Americans, show their papers, and even detaining some—and it seemed that the same chaos was coming to southern Maine.

I also made another change in advance of ICE’s arrival: I stopped carrying the 9-mm compact handgun—a Glock 19 equipped with a Holosun red dot—that I keep underneath my shirt most days, in full compliance with Maine’s concealed-carry laws. Although it is completely within my rights to carry concealed in my state (a practice I began a little over a year ago, after having gotten several death threats for my political writing), the past few weeks have made it apparent that ICE and Border Patrol don’t put much store in the law or Constitution.

When I heard news that Maine was about to get the Minneapolis treatment, a fear gnawed at me: What happens if I’m harassed or grabbed by an ICE agent for walking down the street without my passport, and an agent feels the pistol beneath my sweatshirt? What happens, God forbid, if my Glock dislodges from my appendix holster while I’m being roughly detained? I worried that, in such an event, ICE officers—poorly trained, trigger-happy—might panic and shoot me out of fear, even if I was doing nothing illegal or threatening. I worried, too, that they might not even bother to learn Maine’s gun laws before descending on my state.

Today, Border Patrol’s killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti—a 37-year-old ICU nurse who the Minneapolis Police Department believes possessed a legal-carry permit, and was armed in the lead-up to his death—made it clear that my paranoia was justified. It also made it clear that it is not only minorities who are having their First, Fourth, and now Second Amendment rights trampled by the federal government: Pretti, like Renee Nicole Good before him, was white. And while new facts could certainly emerge that complicate what we know so far, existing videos of the incident seem to show that he never reached for his weapon in his fatal encounter with the feds. It appears to have been removed by agents before they shot him dead, after first pepper-spraying him in the face as he tried to help a woman who had been knocked to the ground. Apparently, the federal bootheel is now colorblind, one of the Trump administration’s more notable anti-DEI achievements.

Although the administration claims that its immigration-enforcement operations are meant to protect Americans from an “invasion” of foreign-born gang members, federal officials have now killed two American citizens—specifically, white American citizens, the kind Donald Trump and Stephen Miller tacitly signal they care the most about—in less than a month. It is plain that Operation Metro Surge and Operation Catch of the Day—yes, that’s what ICE actually calls its Maine operation—are not about protecting the good citizens of Minnesota and Maine. And they are certainly not about protecting our rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

I’ve spent nearly my entire life in American gun culture: My father was a combat veteran turned state-police officer; I come from a hunting family; my first job was at a gun club; I regularly invest hours at the range, and burn through 1,000 or more rounds of pistol and rifle ammo every month. I admit that by the standards of some readers, I no doubt qualify as a “gun nut.” And I have had innumerable arguments with liberal friends about the Second Amendment. My views are unfashionable in some of the circles in which I travel. I believe, and have always believed, that despite the National Rifle Association’s faults, the organization is correct about the core purpose of the Second Amendment: to prevent government tyranny. And because tyrannical governments can be either liberal or conservative, the Constitution protects those on the left and right equally.

Some time before he was shot dead in Utah, Charlie Kirk said, now infamously, that it was worth accepting “some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.” Many of his critics dredged up that quote following his assassination, noting the irony and suggesting that his manner of death disproved his argument. I agreed with Kirk about very little, but about this he was right: The blight of gun violence is a uniquely American tragedy. But the Second Amendment is a uniquely American freedom, and in fact is the very thing that makes possible all the others.

Some pro-gun organizations are already taking a stand: “Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms—including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights,” Minnesota’s Gun Owners Caucus wrote in response to today’s killing. “These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed, and they must be respected and protected at all times.” Gun Owners of America, meanwhile, observed that the “Second Amendment protects American’s right to bear arms while protesting—a right the federal government must not infringe upon.” Despite touting itself as a staunch defender of American gun rights, however, the Trump administration appears to be taking a rather different tone. “Thank God for the patriots of @ICEgov,” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth posted on X, showing no concern that a federal agent emptied his magazine into the back of an apparently law-abiding, gun-owning American who seemed to have been safely disarmed. “You are SAVING the country.”

Whether they lean right or left, are pro-immigration or have more restrictionist views, my fellow gun owners should understand the message that is being sent by this administration: If you exercise your constitutionally protected right to bear arms, masked federal agents can murder you in cold blood, simply because an American citizen exercising their Second Amendment rights scares them. This isn’t about politics; it is about the rights that make our politics possible in the first place.

It is not yet clear what exactly Pretti’s own views were, or what motivated him to be on that Minneapolis street. But he knew what the Second Amendment is for: to affirm that Americans are a free people, and free people will not be cowed by masked federal agents. As this country’s gun enthusiasts have long known, freedom means little if you lack the means to keep it. Without the Second Amendment, the Constitution is a bit of parchment. With the Second Amendment, the Constitution is a demand. These rights shall not be infringed.</div>

            <h2>Pete Hegseth Should Stay Out of Minneapolis</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This story was updated on January 24, 2026, at 8:46pm ET.

The Trump administration has once again immersed the United States in a crisis. The officers who are supposed to be protecting America’s borders have again been unleashed on an American city—this time, Minneapolis. The authorities in Minnesota want the Border Patrol and ICE forces to leave; the U.S. government’s response has been to continue to allow them to operate without any limits. These agents are now behaving like a roving mob, a riot squad in balaclavas desperately in search of a riot—and for the second time in 17 days, they have killed one of the American citizens protesting their police-state behavior.

Today’s victim was a 37-year-old ICU nurse named Alex Pretti, shot multiple times while lying on the ground after taking a beating from government agents.

As if to prove that they can always make a terrible situation worse, Trump-administration officials have made a series of statements; some of them are tasteless and immature, while others challenge the intelligence of anyone who has viewed the multiple videos of the killing. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem claimed that the victim walked up to the agents with the intent to slay several of them. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted on X that an “assassin tried to murder federal agents.” Neither of these seems to correspond with the video evidence.

Minneapolis police say Pretti had a firearms permit, and that open carry is legal in the state for permit holders. Video of the incident shows him holding a phone, not a gun. Officers do not seem to have realized he was armed until after they pinned him to the ground, and the video does not show them opening fire until after they have taken away his pistol.

The situation looks bad from every angle, which is probably why administration figures are spinning this moment as hard as possible. But what on earth is the self-styled secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, talking about—and why is he talking at all?

Late this afternoon, Hegseth posted this from his personal account on X:

Thank God for the patriots of @ICEgov — we have your back 100%. You are SAVING the country.

Shame on the leadership of Minnesota — and the lunatics in the street.

What, exactly, does this mean? (A Pentagon spokesperson said the department had “nothing to provide beyond the Secretary’s tweet.”) The leader of the U.S. military is telling the agents of another government department—one of whom is on video pumping at least five bullets into a man who’d already been shot and was lying on his face—that “we have your back.” Does Hegseth intend to protect these men if they are charged by city or state authorities? Or is he itching to get the U.S. military into the streets, to back up ICE’s undertrained civilians with professional soldiers and heavier hardware?

Worse, the secretary seems to be implying that the government of Minnesota is an enemy of the United States. “ICE > MN” might mean that ICE is … better than Minnesota? Sovereign over Minnesota? Whatever the intent of this formulation, Hegseth thinks ICE is “saving the country,” apparently from the elected leaders of Minnesota and the “lunatics” in the street. (These “lunatics” are also known as “American citizens.”)

Hegseth has neither the legal authority nor the right—and certainly not the moral standing—to make such claims. Statements by incompetent appointees like Noem are bad enough, but Hegseth committing the United States military to “have the backs” of men who shot to death a citizen lying in the street, before the shooting has even been investigated, is beyond irresponsible. Unfortunately, such recklessness is to be expected from a man, and an administration, that treats any city, state, or government agency not controlled by Trump loyalists as an enemy.

Perhaps Hegseth was only showing off. He is an immature and undisciplined man, and he may be trying to prove that he, too, can say something terrible in the wake of a shocking moment of violence. But the secretary of defense is supposed to be the steward of the American military. He is supposed to keep the armed forces out of all but the most dire civil disturbances; instead, Hegseth is trying to involve them in a lawless mess created by another government department. He is supposed to keep the military professional, ready, and apolitical; instead, Hegseth has identified a bunch of rogue civilians as brothers-in-arms, and promised to protect them. He is supposed to keep the American military ready to fight foreign enemies; instead, Hegseth is lashing out at state officials in Minnesota.

Hegseth’s apparent desire to get involved in the Minnesota debacle is dangerous not only to the lives of innocent Americans, but to American democracy itself. The military should not be involved in domestic policing. Cops and border agents and soldiers are different from one another, and they are kept separate in a democracy for good reason. And most important, the Pentagon’s top official should not use his office to identify elected leaders who disagree with the president as enemies who will destroy the nation.

Pete Hegseth has one of the most important jobs on the planet, and it carries a world of obligations to the soldiers of the United States, and to the American people. For now, he might consider adding another task to his many duties, one that would be of immense help to the nation and to the armed forces: He should shut up.</div>

            <h2>The Truth About ICE’s Recruiting Push</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/ice-new-hires-training-minneapolis-shooting/685745/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the second Trump administration, immigration policy is made with big round numbers. There’s a formula: First the White House sets an ambitious goal—1 million deportations a year, 3,000 immigration arrests a day. Then it presses the federal workforce to meet the target. Last year, Trump officials pledged to double staffing at ICE by adding 10,000 new deportation officers by January 2026. Stephen Miller treated the recruitment drive as a priority on par with the deportation push, demanding daily updates on the pace of hiring. Immigration and Customs Enforcement held job expos in multiple cities and dangled $50,000 bonuses, student-loan forgiveness, and other perks before potential recruits.

Just after New Year’s Day, the Department of Homeland Security declared victory, celebrating an ICE hiring spree that “shattered expectations” and achieved a “120% Manpower Increase.” DHS said it received more than 220,000 applications (many candidates applied for three or four different jobs) and signed up 12,000 new officers, agents, and legal staff in about four months. No federal law-enforcement agency has ever expanded this fast.

The percentage of new deportation officers who are actually ready to go out on the streets, however, is much lower than what the administration has been claiming, according to five DHS and ICE officials I spoke with. About 1,200 recruits have completed courses at ICE’s training academy, and another 3,000 have finished online training courses for new hires with previous policing experience. ICE has also brought back about 800 retirees who can earn a salary on top of their pension. These roughly 5,000 new deportation officers are considered “operational,” and have been given a badge and a gun, though some have yet to deploy due to administrative and logistical reasons. Three of the officials told me they estimate that it will likely take five or six months for the target number of new deportation officers—10,000—to be fully ready.

ICE veterans I’ve spoken with have concerns about the qualifications and aptitude of their new colleagues, especially those with little or no previous law-enforcement experience. Some academy classes have had dropout rates near 50 percent because so many failed the physical-fitness requirements. The Trump administration slashed the length of the training course from about five months to 47 days last summer—because Trump is the 47th president, three officials told me at the time—then cut it further. Now it’s 42 days.

Read: ICE’s ‘athletically allergic’ recruits

As new employees have started showing up at ICE regional offices around the country, some have been greeted with wariness by veteran officers. “These are people who have no business setting foot into our office,” one senior ICE official told me, describing new recruits who appeared physically unfit for the job and “who would have been weeded out during a normal hiring process.” The DHS and ICE officials I spoke with did so on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to reporters.

Tricia McLaughlin, the chief spokesperson for DHS, declined to say how many of ICE’s 12,000 new hires have hit the streets full-time. “We are not going to disclose the specifics for operational security purposes,” McLaughlin wrote to me. She attached a department statement denouncing “mendacious politicians and the mainstream media,” who “continue to smear ICE officers, lying to the American people, and falsely claiming that they are untrained for the job at hand.”

The statement said the 42-day ICE academy course provides training in arrest techniques, conflict management and de-escalation, firearms safety, and proper use of force. I asked one veteran ICE official how much time new hires are spending on de-escalation tactics, especially after the fatal shooting earlier this month of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. The principles of de-escalation are sprinkled throughout use-of-force classes and arrest training, the official told me. But he said the amount of time dedicated specifically to de-escalation is about four hours.

This morning, a 37-year-old man in Minneapolis was fatally shot after a group of federal officers and agents wrestled him to the ground. The circumstances of the killing remain hazy. On social media, DHS officials claimed the man had approached Border Patrol agents with a gun and violently resisted arrest. The department published an image of a 9-mm pistol that it said the man was carrying, and said his death “looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”  Bystander videos that apparently captured the moments leading up to the altercation showed the man, identified as Alex Pretti by The Minnesota Star Tribune, standing in the street and holding up a phone, not a weapon, likely to record the federal forces. In the videos, he makes no attempt to attack authorities. As one agent approaches Pretti, another begins shoving him back toward the sidewalk.

The reporter Laura Jedeed published a first-person account in Slate this month describing how she landed a job offer from ICE last fall, suggesting that the agency failed to conduct basic internet research that would show she is a journalist and an outspoken Trump critic. DHS dismissed Jedeed’s account as “a lazy lie” and claimed that she was never offered a position. But Jedeed posted a subsequent video on social media that appeared to show ICE’s hiring portal with her final job offer and an onboarding date at the agency’s New York City field office. “Welcome to ICE,” it said. Jedeed didn’t take the job.

Her story is hardly the only sign that the ICE hiring surge may be cutting corners to achieve the White House’s political objectives. Some ICE regional offices where staffing levels are poised to double don’t have enough desks, body armor, and parking spaces for everyone, agency veterans told me. DHS has emphasized that it will assign new hires to work alongside experienced officers, but those pairings require additional planning at a time when the ICE workforce has been under relentless pressure to ramp up arrests and deportations.

“ICE officers go through a rigorous on-the-job training and mentorship,” DHS said in its statement to me. “New hires take what they learn” from the ICE academy “and apply it to real-life scenarios while on duty, preserving ICE’s reputation as one of the most elite law enforcement agencies not only in the U.S., but the entire world.”

The ICE staffing surge is crucial to the Trump administration’s bigger goal of 1 million deportations a year. ICE deported about 400,000 people during Trump’s first year in office, well below the president’s target. Trump officials claim that more than 2 million people have voluntarily left the United States during the past year— counting them as deportations—even though that figure is based on academic estimates of census surveys.

ICE has an annual budget of about $10 billion, but the agency received three times that much in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to fund the hiring boom. The bill also provided about $45 billion to expand ICE’s network of detention centers. When Trump took office, about 39,000 detainees were facing deportation in ICE custody. Today there are more than 70,000, and Trump officials want to boost detention capacity to more than 100,000 this year. When I attended an ICE hiring expo outside Dallas last summer, recruiters explained that the state with the highest number of open positions was Louisiana, the operational hub of Trump’s deportation campaign.

The administration also wants more ICE officers on the streets. Trump officials have brought in Border Patrol agents to act as reinforcements in cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago and now Minneapolis. Trump’s rolling campaign has generally targeted one location at a time, but the new hiring surge will give the administration enough personnel to target multiple cities at once.

Trump officials say they are filling the jobs by hiring experienced law-enforcement officers from other federal agencies or state and local police departments. Many of the new hires are anxious about their career prospects at ICE once the burst of onetime funding runs out, officials at ICE and DHS told me, especially if Democrats take control of Congress.

One ICE official I spoke with told me that some of the new hires, especially rehired retirees, are having second thoughts. Hundreds of the returning officers have been ordered to Minnesota, two officials said, where the administration is conducting the largest-ever DHS crackdown. Some officers have been so cold and miserable that they’ve already quit, and ICE officials have held calls to figure out how to deal with the sudden resignations.

Returning officers who have come back from retirement are finding themselves in unfamiliar roles. They spent much of their careers trying to conduct low-key “targeted enforcement” operations in which they planned arrests in advance and sought to take suspects into custody in the safest and least dramatic way possible. Now they’re out in the streets wearing masks, with protesters yelling at them and video cameras rolling. ICE has changed, and the job isn’t the same.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered a speech in Davos in which he spoke about the end of the American-led, rules-based world order. On Washington Week With The Atlantic, panelists joined to discuss the remarks, and what they may signal about Donald Trump’s rift with American allies.

“What Carney did is he took the mask off,” Atlantic staff writer Idrees Kahloon said last night. “There’s a new world order—and if Donald Trump wants to act like the hegemon in North America, China in Asia, Russia in Europe, then countries like [Canada] have to pivot, and they have to deal with the multipolar world as it exists.”

Joining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this, and more: Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent at The New York Times; Leigh Ann Caldwell, the chief Washington correspondent at Puck; Stephen Hayes, the editor of The Dispatch; and Kahloon, a staff writer at The Atlantic.</div>

... that bypassing the long established and fairly well working path of distributions with something that&#39;s essentially &quot;download a binary and run it&quot; with no actual reviews could actually lead to something that&#39;s less secure than what you had before.

Neither option is very good. Linus spoke about how much effort is wasted in traditional repos, and how they cause version and dependency issues. That&#39;s part of the reason why things like Docker are so popular.

Snaps may be crap, but so are all the other options.

It&#39;s not difficult to avoid installing a fake clone program, but the automatic updating by default presents an enormous attack surface. Disable auto-updating:

Or just don&#39;t use Snap at all, one of several reasons I run Mint on my machines.  And even Mint is, unfortunately, relying on containerized packages for a significant portion of software from Ubuntu repos.  But at least Mint provides native packages for all of the important stuff (Firefox, LibeOffice, GIMP, Audacity, VLC, Geeqie, Okular, Thunderbird, Pluma, Guvcview, Kdenlive, Wine, Meld, Claws, etc).

It is likely either LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition) or just plain Debian is in my future, though.

Curating a store or package repository in general takes lots of effort, I don&#39;t think volunteers can hack it in today&#39;s environment. Snaps and flatpacks are the biggest target, but this could just as easily happen for distro packages. Only Apple makes that kind of money from the store itself to pay for it.

For Linux on the desktop to escape hobbyism you need complete ecosystems with large revenue streams. Like Google, but I think it&#39;s possible without it being quite so closed. Ideally Valve would buy Ubuntu

Seen any ads on Youtube? Not once, but I hear about them all the time. How do people manage to see them is a mystery.

That you don&#39;t own a phone is a mystery. Blocking Youtube ads on a phone requires patching and installing no less than 2 different background services to run on an Android device, and simply isn&#39;t possible on iPhone. Unless you watch Youtube in a browser on a phone in which case there&#39;s probably something medically wrong with you if you put yourself through that kind of UI misery.

Google is a search engine, an advertisement company, and has a video company, so I don&#39;t think they should be trusted for medical anything.

It&#39;s like RFK, Jr saying you shouldn&#39;t take medical advice from him even though he is supposed to be the top medical professional in the country.

Which youtube site are you using, xhamster or xvideos?

Or the one with the name being an adjective that describes the state of having no mother?

How does a skincare routine solved diabetes? I&#39;d understand gokkun videos though admittedly the thought of it can leave a bad taste in the mouth, but a topical ointment application to solve diabetes would revolutionise the industry.

Easy: you need to eat the skin care products, which are high fat. And at the same time drastically cut down on carbs... voila, a keto diet! :-D

What&#39;s even worse, every question you now ask is answered mostly with video links. Why? Because of ads, of course. It is increasingly more difficult to get a simple text answer. They want you to watch a 5-10 minute video for a 5 second section where the question is actually answered. Just so that they can use you to bump someone&#39;s engagement and ad scores.

This makes Google increasing more difficult to work with and significantly reduces it&#39;s value these days. Search engines used to be all about efficiency a

Neither with nor without AI summaries you should try to use Google to find medical advice.

If the kind of EV chargers they&#39;re talking about are actually EVSEs, then no, it&#39;s not scary.  EVSEs are actually just a glorified extension cord for connecting your EV to your home&#39;s mains.  All the hardware that actually modulates the amperage draw and converts the voltage to what is required to charge the traction battery, is located inside the vehicle itself.  The EVSE only tells the car what is available from the circuit it is connected to and engages a contactor that energizes the cord, after the car

Some units including the ChargePoint (which I own one) rely on software to set the upper current limit. During installation you tell the unit what the breaker size is, and while you can use the user&#39;s app to change the max current at any time, it will not let you go above the breaker rating set during installation. Changing this requires using a special installer&#39;s app and connecting to the unit locally via bluetooth.

So if an attacker gains arbitrary code execution ability, I suppose it might be possible to

pretty scary...Stop being professionally offended.

For the &quot;slow&quot; chargers (EVSEs), I&#39;m not too worried. Worst cases:- They could allow someone to do &quot;unauthorized&quot; charging if it&#39;s behind a key- They could potentially do a denial of service (make the EVSE not connect)- If you have limited the current in the charger configuration, the EVSE basically signals the car &quot;you can slurp up to X amperes&quot;, if you can hack the EVSE to tell car to grab as much as you can you could, I guess, blow a fuse or in worst case, start a fire. Or just

&quot;Leave the World Behind&quot; - it wasn&#39;t supposed to be a documentary.

And they *certainly* don&#39;t listen to their people.

Well, unless they say what the CEO already thinks.

If it&#39;s good for the stock price, the MBAs will do it. They&#39;ll exercise their options and be long gone before the damage becomes obvious.

On Friday I had to drive into the office at -34C to make Teams calls to the rest of my team who live hundreds of miles away. But I probably added 0.0000001 cent to the stock price by doing so.

My work sent out an email on Friday saying anyone who physically reports to the office at several locations would not have to report on Monday or Tuesday due to incoming snowstorm. However, the email also stated that anyone who teleworked was required to work on Monday or Tuesday or use leave to take those days off.

Guess who is upset they have to work on Monday and Tuesday.

What vehicle are you driving that you put $200 worth of gas in each month, a gas-guzzling pickup truck?  You&#39;re getting paid to come to work whether you drive, take a train, bus, or taxi.  It&#39;s always been like that.  Besides, with all the people now driving electric or electric hybrids, they&#39;re not paying anywhere near that amount to go to work.

&quot;2025 mileage rates  Self-employed and business: 70 cents/mile&quot;

My commute used to use 9 gallons a week and at $4 per gallon (thanks Seattle Democrats) or $144 per month. That doesn&#39;t include tires and such.

At IRS rates and a 56 mile round trip per day that&#39;s $784 per month which must be depreciation on a Tesla.

&quot;2025 mileage rates  Self-employed and business: 70 cents/mile&quot;??? Does that include all the car maintenance and insurance. But still that is almost 2x more expensive than using car sharing service around here, which provides cars for rent for prices from 25 cents/km. And this is in Europe, where fuel is 1.5-2 €/l.

And if that&#39;s just fuel, than it is insane... I am paying 5-10 ct/km for my current PHEV, which is quite thirsty for fuel.

I wouldn&#39;t be upset.. because I like working from home that much.  Also if I was to take a couple days off I would just fall behind on my work and have to do more in fewer days.

A company implementing a &quot;return to office&quot; mandate, without any other consideration, will both lose top talent and lose dead weight.

Top talent loves working from home, dead weight loves working from home as well.

The elephant in the room: Managers can&#39;t differentiate between the two.

If I were Dead weight I would probably stay and commute knowing three things

1) I can manage to be dead weight here but what are the chances another company will just let me slide in and slack as soon as I get hired? The lazier deadweightier option is to stick to it2) When the other people leave my positon here is more secure.3) Its actually easier to do nothing at the office, because there&#39;s so much other junk going on, more meetings that kinda looks like work, more socializing that kinda looks like work.If you have charisma its much more easy to manipulate your manager. If I want I can just make ai quarter-ass the little work I do and spend the rest of the time flirting with Jessica in the accounting department.

In an office it&#39;s easier to do performative productivity where you look busy buy aren&#39;t actually doing anything productive. It just looks like you&#39;re not deadweight because you&#39;re getting something done.

Deadweight is easier to hide in an office than it is WFH - because things often get passed around more informally as in &quot;Hey Joe, can you get me those X numbers for the week&quot; instead of doing them yourself. WFH those kinds of people would be constantly asking for stuff over Teams and such and be much more an

I have always preferred going to the work site and working, so that there is a clear delineation b/w work and home.  Somehow, working at home, the demarcation looks fuzzy

When my kid was a toddler, there were some occasions when I worked from home, so that I could free his mom up for tasks she needed to do, while I took care of him.  Other than that, I have only worked from home when I needed to have international conference calls w/ colleagues in Japan, which for me was past midnight.  Otherwise, I prefer

While not even the office dress code requires a shirt and tie, I still wear them when WFH, as well as smart trousers. At the end of my working day I change into casual clothes. That&#39;s how I delimit being &quot;at work&quot; and being &quot;at home&quot;.

I work with someone that does this.  I&#39;ve never been on a video call with this person where he hasn&#39;t been wearing a suit, in his home office.   I have my camera disabled in the BIOS and I am working on my 6th pair of socks and 3rd bathrobe.   I haven&#39;t dressed for work in my home office ever, and I&#39;ve been working from home for thirteen years.

I really don&#39;t understand people who say they love their families yet seem to do everything they can to get away from them.

I have always preferred going to the work site and working,

You&#39;re not the only one. I prefer working from the office to the point that when I was a contractor/consultant working fully remote for random clients. I got so fed up working from home that I ended putting a coworking space as a business expense so I had somewhere else to work. As well as small companies, there were quite a few others like me in the space. It was 100% worth it. I learned some stuff from my fellow coworkers that lead to a startup. A

It is important to remind everyone that no one is saying you HAVE to work from home.  Just that there should be the choice to work from home if there is no reason to forbid it.  Also that everyone should be judged by their productivity and skill, not by their ability to befriend the boss.

No. Dead weight tends to stay because they don&#39;t have the sort of CV that gets them a nice WFH job elsewhere. Top talent is a lot more mobile.

So you&#39;ll see top talent flee and dead weight slogging to the office and pulling down morale because they hate it.

If the majority of companies return to some in office days where are the &quot;top talent&quot; going to flee to exactly? Also most places don&#39;t want anti social basement dwelling mushrooms anymore even in development, those days are gone particularly with the squeeze in the jobs market. The autists will just have to find some other career.

There will always be developers gifted enough that they will be sought after.

But somehow I expect CEOs will not listen to the obvious being stated time and again. They are certainly not smart enough to recognize it themselves.

During many rounds of voluntary incentives, I watched the good people go and the weak people say.

Reasons people want to work from home in the US:- Commuting cost savings- Commuting stress- Commuting time savings- Comfortable home working environment- Undesirable office working environment

Interestingly these are not quite the same in Tokyo:- Commuting cost savings - [N/A] The company pays for commuting costs- Commuting stress - [Similar] &quot;Traffic&quot; stress replaced by crowded train stress- Commuting time savings - [Similar]. Although Tokyo commute times are more predictable.- Comfortable home working environment - [Worse] Less spacious Tokyo homes means less comfortable home working environment- Undesirable office working environment - [Better] Tokyo office and after work city life is more appealing than some industrial park office

I appreciate you helping your dad but let&#39;s be honest - you shouldn&#39;t really be doing on your work time, unless you always make up your hours to the amount you&#39;re contracted for.

You missed the following:- Playing with kids instead of working, and no one can see that you&#39;re doing so.- Doing chores you&#39;d normally have to complete after work, and no one can see that you&#39;re doing so.- Potentially working a second job, and your employers don&#39;t know you&#39;re doing so.

- Commuting stress - [Similar] &quot;Traffic&quot; stress replaced by crowded train stress

Can&#39;t speak for Tokyo trains specifically, but for me unless you&#39;re, like, standing for an hour or more a crowded train beats bad traffic.

Driving is particularly horrible, you&#39;re operating in one mode, moving, with high awareness, thinking fast then you slam into a traffic jam and are stopped, and your brain&#39;s completely jacked up with suddenly nothing to do. I think that experience is horrible and why people get so rage filled.

- Commuting stress - [Similar] &quot;Traffic&quot; stress replaced by crowded train stress

Can&#39;t speak for Tokyo trains specifically, but for me unless you&#39;re, like, standing for an hour or more a crowded train beats bad traffic.

Driving is particularly horrible, you&#39;re operating in one mode, moving, with high awareness, thinking fast then you slam into a traffic jam and are stopped, and your brain&#39;s completely jacked up with suddenly nothing to do. I think that experience is horrible and why people get so rage filled. There&#39;s something uniquely unpleasant about heavy traffic and it makes people awful.

If you are an IT worker most of your work hours are going to be spent sitting in a chair in front of a keyboard and a monitor. Maybe just a laptop, maybe several screens, and you gotta come up with some software there. If you have to drive in and work in a bullpen office environment it will be much the same scenario. People are mainly just trying to get their work done with the computer interfaces in front of them.

But on the other hand there reportedly are those who work multiple jobs remotely without the employers being aware of it. And these days maybe it is easier to do. If you know how to use AI assistance effectively you can generate the coding output of 2-3 unboosted humans without undue effort.

CEOs are unconcerned about employee retention. They just want to reduce labour costs for their shareholders.

What matters for me the most while working remotely is being at the same desk every day, with all the little things that help me stay focused and productive. Same screens, same positions, same landscape. Same chair, same comfortable lightning. No needless commotion and passing shadows. An environment where I can feel psychologically familiar with the surroundings and be actually be productive.

Fuck hot-desking with insufficient screens, new seat and a new problem every day. And if you get in even 15 minutes late, all the best spots are gone.

Since forever and way before the pandemic, truly top talent has been able to work from home or wherever they want.  But that&#39;s only for truly top talent where the guy would be hired even if there&#39;s no position.  Most people who think they&#39;re top talent actually aren&#39;t because the company can find other people who are equally competent.

But unfortunately today the swing of the pendulum is granting the power to the employer. As industries collapse and jobs are wiped out at all seniority levels, the flood of available talent makes going elsewhere more difficult. Even the best may be reluctant to take a stand against things like return to office mandates.

AI is going to replace all these folks within the next 5 years anyway, right? /sarc

If LLMs and whatever successors come along are as good as the tech bros keep telling us, most programmers and managers will be replaced by machines and WFH won&#39;t be an issue.

Conversely, if there&#39;s a panic around losing workers because of back-to-the-office mandates, then the C-levels in those companies must not have very much confidence in the AIs they&#39;re trying to shove down everyone&#39;s throats. That would suggest that a lot

but as soon as the market improves, employees will bolt away faster than a rear-ended Pinto.

Could be. Even longer if the AI bubble pops, tanking the entire economy. At least we could finally buy PC parts.

The amount of marketing crap on that web page is beyond belief. Easily one of the top 3 worst web pages I encountered in the past 12 months.

Where I work, we had two senior developers retire a couple years ago.  We posted the job openings, and got a few applicants. In the interviews, they all asked about our work-from-home policy. I had to tell them that we don&#39;t have one officially, but it does happen (we actually had an unofficial hybrid policy after COVID ended). Two of the three weren&#39;t interested, and the one we hired left for a fully work-from-home company a year later. I told the boss that we would likely get more applicants with an offic

Any Brit can tell you that it&#39;s spelled LaGrauniad, innit.

Ted Cruz is actually smart.He just purports evil and moronic stuff to be popular in Texas (the ass of the USA... New Jersey is the armpit and Florida is a dick.)

He lost his spine after he quit being the zodiac killer when he found a replacement for human blood to maintain his human-like form.

I think what they mean by &quot;most flights from Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina to Portland, Maine, were canceled&quot; is that airports north of Raleigh and south of Portland have canceled most of their flights. As RDU->PDM is operated by Breeze on Mondays and Fridays only, then taking it literally means a remarkably small percentage of US flights.  Breeze have very nice A220s.

There are about 27k commercial flights daily in the USA. 10k is a huge number.

It&#39;s not even a case of hubs. It&#39;s a case of risk assessing the region climate. Capabilities vary depending on risk.

In areas like Chicago where bad weather is expected regularly they are setup to handle it. Chicago can process just shy of 60 aircraft an hour in freezing conditions (that includes clearing runway of snow, and de-icing aircraft prior to take-off). This allows them to operate relatively close to normal capacity during storm (at least as far as snow and ice is concerned, there may be other facto

Believe your federal government, not your own eyes. If you are big on the right to bear arms, make an exception this time. These are the Trump administration’s messages after a horrible Saturday in Minnesota.

Homeland Security agents shot 37-year-old Minneapolis ICU nurse and researcher Alex Pretti dead on Saturday morning in broad daylight. A few things are already clear from the best video angle out now: Pretti was directing traffic on a Minneapolis street. He was filming agents out in public, as is his undisputed right. An agent approached Pretti and then shoved a woman, hard, into a snowbank. Pretti put his hand up as he went to assist the woman. The masked agent who threw the woman to the ground draped himself over Pretti, then was joined by several of his colleagues. They got Pretti to the ground, struggled for a moment, and shot him until he was dead. Was this death sentence the result of sheer incompetence by agents who had no idea how to handle conflict? Was it a summary execution? Or, as the Trump administration would have you believe, did the dead man have it coming?

Pretti had a gun on him. An administration that once wrapped Kyle Rittenhouse in a loving embrace after he brought a rifle to a protest and killed two men took an interesting view of that fact. “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” an unsigned Homeland Security post said. “An assassin tried to murder federal agents,” Stephen Miller said. (JD Vance, the heir apparent to the Republican presidential nomination, reposted Miller.)  And what about the man who is nominally still running the country? Donald Trump pointed to a picture of Pretti’s handgun, confiscated by the agents, and noted it was loaded and “ready to go – What is that all about?”

Perhaps we will learn more in the coming days about what exactly happened when. But the early videos are already quite clear, as is what Trump and Miller and Vance are not saying. Nobody argued that Pretti brandished the gun before agents shot him several times. Moreover, no one argued that Pretti wasn’t allowed to have the gun. Minnesota allows people to carry a gun if they have a permit, and the Minneapolis police chief told reporters that Pretti had one. He had no criminal history beyond traffic tickets.

But the Trump administration has already told you what happened. One, the man had a gun, which is bad now. Two, the man was out to kill federal agents, which is obvious, because he had a gun.

We all have to decide for ourselves what we’ll believe about this case.

On the one hand, Pretti was a nurse who worked at the Veterans’ Administration. (If there’s one job that screams “disrespect for federal officers,” it’s “nurse at the VA.”)  Pretti was reaching for a woman whom an anonymous federal agent had just launched into a snowbank in frigid weather. It even looks like if anyone fired Pretti’s gun, it was a federal agent who had disarmed him and accidentally shot it into the pavement. And, fine, the physical altercation was initiated entirely by the agents, who put the woman on the ground and mobbed Pretti before shooting him to death.

But on the other hand, Stephen Miller says the man was an assassin. Would Stephen Miller lie?

Then there’s the matter of the gun itself. As Trump noted, the gun was “ready to go.” Pretti, though, had a legal right to carry that gun, thanks in large part to the gun-rights movement that has been part of Trump’s base for his entire political career. And most people who carry guns also carry bullets for those guns, as bullets are the primary projectile that guns send flying through the air.

But on the other hand, Alex Pretti had a gun. And would any American carry a gun in public without the intention to murder federal agents in cold blood? Remember, the sum total of violent crimes this ICU nurse had been charged with in his life was zero.

Miller says Pretti was a “domestic terrorist,” a label the administration also applied to the also-37-year-old Renee Good after one of its agents shot her through her car’s side window. The feds left their victim’s body splayed out on the road after taking the life from it, but they were at least a bit more dignified with him in one way. Nobody appears to have called Pretti a “fucking bitch,” as Good’s killer did right after shooting her.

You might get the impression from this series of federal killings that the real crime against this administration is opposing it in any way. But can you really trust yourself?

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, Slate’s weekly politics newsletter that needs to seriously ramp up its war crimes, and soon, if we’re going to snag a Board of Peace seat.

This week, oh brother. We’ll just say upfront that there was so much Minnesota/ICE stuff to consider that we decided to not include any of it (this is called “news judgment”), though we would refer you to other excellent Slate content here. We do however talk about the Minnesota Senate race, and observe how Bill and Hillary Clinton are going to jail for a million years (unconfirmed). Plus, an old-fashioned look at Trump’s poll numbers, one year in.

But first, Canada: Can we trade you for Mark Carney??

Most contemporary political speeches are terrible, flattened into pablum and crowd-pleasing safety, delivered by empty vessels, then forgotten within the hour. Yet the address from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a collected and poised former central bank head, will, we fear, be remembered for a long time. While he didn’t mention names, he did speak quite precisely of the recent “rupture” in the world order in which “great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.” In other words, the great powers—such as the neighbor to which Canada’s economy has been deeply linked for decades—have begun to throw their weight around unreliably and turn on their own partners. That means it’s time for “middle powers,” like Canada or major European countries, to orbit around different suns, to diversify, and to work together outside the restraints of the broken American-led order. We encourage you to read it yourself. (Once you’re done with the Surge—no clicking away!)

This, in a nutshell, is the risk of Donald Trump. While it was good that Trump called off the dogs on a hostile takeover of Greenland—for the moment—in his own Davos address the next day, the damage was already done. You can only threaten NATO, threaten global institutions, threaten or implement tariffs, and threaten the sovereign territory of your allies so much before they’ll deem you an unreliable partner and begin to turn away. It’s just a rational response. Trump has a psychological need—wholly unfixable, at this point—to push buttons and wield power recklessly until it causes a stock market dip, at which point he walks it back. The stock market reverses, but the long-term damage to America’s brand doesn’t.

Congratulations to everyone for making it a full year through Donald Trump’s second presidency! How many years are left? Eh, counting is for nerds. Let’s review how Trump’s political standing has changed over the past year. If you’ll recall, Trump’s favorability rating down the stretch of the 2024 election and leading into his inauguration was the highest it had ever been. That revealed new strengths about his second coalition, as it had made great strides with previously Democratic constituencies like young people and nonwhite voters.

One very exciting year later, all of that is back in the dumps. His job approval is lousy, hovering just north of 40 percent on average. And, as a New York Times/Siena poll this week demonstrated, much of that hemorrhaging support comes from the new blocs of voters he had acquired last year. Nearly 70 percent of registered voters under 30 disapprove of Trump, along with nearly 60 percent of Hispanic voters. Democrats, meanwhile, lead the generic congressional midterm ballot by 5 points—something that’s about in line with the polling average leading into this fall. This is in spite of Democrats, still, being historically loathed. Democrats will have to fix themselves ahead of 2028. (Who knows how!) But the midterms will primarily be a referendum on Trump, and it’s shaping into a horror story for the GOP. Trump’s reaction to the NYT poll was to threaten legal action against the Times.

Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy voted to convict Trump during his 2021 impeachment trial. This made political life challenging for Cassidy after Trump retook the presidency. To succeed in the 2026 primary in his solid red state, Cassidy would need Trump’s support, or at least his neutrality. So Cassidy spent the past year as one of Trump’s biggest cheerleaders. Even when he had a chance to block the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose overt agenda was to destroy everything Cassidy had learned in his career as a physician, Cassidy held his nose and offered his support.

It was all for naught. Last weekend, Trump urged Rep. Julia Letlow to challenge Cassidy and offered her his endorsement. Reporting suggests this was always Trump’s plan, and he just wanted to get through peak legislating season before he risked alienating Cassidy and his vote. Cassidy has pledged to remain in the race for now, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee will have his back as it always does with incumbents. But his fate may have been sealed when he cast that impeachment vote. He should wear that as a badge of honor and speak out against the administration more frequently in 2026—though we’re not holding our breath.

Last September, Trump forced out a U.S. attorney in the D.C. area who was trying to do his job honestly and replaced him with Lindsey Halligan, an insurance lawyer from Florida, who was willing to defy all career prosecutors’ advice and indict the president’s enemies. She indicted a couple of them—former FBI Director Jim Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James—only to have those indictments tossed out when a federal judge determined in November that Halligan had been illegally appointed to her job. Halligan nevertheless kept showing up to work, as a sort of Schrödinger’s U.S. attorney.

Halligan’s tenure came to an end this week when federal judges humiliated her out the door. A federal judge in Richmond concluded that “this charade of Ms. Halligan masquerading as the United States Attorney for this District in direct defiance of binding court orders must come to an end,” struck her title from all filings, and said the only reason it would refrain from “referring her for further investigation and disciplinary action” was because she “lacks the prosecutorial experience that has long been the norm for those nominated to the position of United States Attorney in this District.” A separate judge, meanwhile, directed the clerk to publish a job listing for Halligan’s vacant role in local newspapers. What do you think, should the Surge apply?

This week, the NRSC announced with great fanfare its latest recruit: former NFL sideline reporter turned conservative political commentator Michele Tafoya will run for the Minnesota Senate seat left vacant by Sen. Tina Smith’s retirement. This effectively closes out the NRSC’s offensive map for 2026, as it plans to contest Democratic seats in Georgia, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Minnesota. Their argument for the Minnesota seat is that Trump came within 4 points of winning it in 2024, and state Democrats have suffered from scandals surrounding mass social services fraud.

Uh huh. The national environment in 2026 is shaping up to be much different than it was in 2024, and those state scandals’ impact on Dems might be offset by the Trump administration’s more recent decision to send in Immigration and Customs Enforcement and, potentially soon, the military to Minnesota. But! At least a quality recruit could force Democrats to spend some cash in Minnesota. So is Tafoya a quality recruit? Time will tell, though her name recognition will be high. Yet we can’t help but be tickled by her initial message. “For years, I walked the sidelines when the stakes were the highest, and that job taught me how leadership really works,” Tafoya’s team wrote in a social media post alongside her launch video. Her qualification for leadership is that she was quite literally on the sidelines while leadership (in football) was happening nearby. By that logic, we must remind you that the Surge has interviewed former football coach Tommy Tuberville. Do we get a Minnesota Senate seat now?

The House Oversight Committee, which has been conducting its own investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, voted to hold Bill and Hillary Clinton in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas to testify. This came after a lengthy back-and-forth between the Clintons’ lawyers and the Oversight Committee about whether the committee’s subpoena was merely an effort to embarrass them, given that the Clintons have already shared what “little information” they know. It’s now a question of whether—when, really—the contempt resolution gets a full House vote, and then whether the Justice Department pursues charges.

Is Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer trying to embarrass the Clintons and turn some of the main-boss energy in the Epstein saga away from Trump? Of course. But what was most catching about the vote was how nine Democrats on the committee joined Republicans to hold Bill Clinton in contempt, while three voted to hold Hillary Clinton in contempt. There’s a couple of political factors at play here. First, Democrats do not want to appear, at this stage in the Epstein saga, to be protecting their own from consequences as they pursue the truth. Second, Democrats pursued quite a few contempt resolutions when they held the House in the Biden years, and giving up on their righteous indignation about the importance of complying with congressional subpoenas wouldn’t smell right. Anyway: Bill and Hillary to serve as inaugural prisoners at the reopening of Alcatraz? (Remember that?)

As of Thursday, the House has passed all 12 appropriations bills to fund the federal government, at new levels and reflecting new needs, for the remainder of the fiscal year—and only four months behind schedule, which isn’t too bad! The Senate, assuming senators can ax their way past treacherous ice demons and through the Capitol doors, expects to vote on the final few bills next week. This is the first time since the Biden administration that Congress has passed all new appropriations bills; the government has been running on a series of continuing resolutions, extending old funding levels, since 2024.

So how did this happen? There was bipartisan recognition among appropriators—led by Rep. Tom Cole on the Republican side and Rep. Rosa DeLauro on the Democratic—that they needed to if they wanted to be taken seriously anymore. Passing another CR reflecting old needs, and ceding a proactive congressional power of the purse, would have further emboldened the executive branch and anti-government Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought to do with federal spending as he pleased. “If we wouldn’t have been able to do this, then Congress would have been, frankly, diminished in a way that would have been bad for our republic,” GOP Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart told reporters. Now Congress is back, and the republic is saved!

Remember to salt your steps and walkways, the last thing anyone needs this weekend is a broken neck. Cheers!

The evidence is mounting that ICE is not only unbothered by moral boundaries, but immigration and customs enforcement agents acting on behalf of President Trump believe they are not constrained by constitutional red lines, either. According to a super-secret internal memo flagged in a whistleblower complaint this week, the Fourth Amendment simply doesn’t apply to ICE. That sense of impunity is also clear in a growing chamber of horrors from their enforcement operations; from masked agents taking a child in a blue bunny hat, to the shooting of Renee Good. Worryingly, this sweeping concept of immunity is kind of true—though maybe not for the reason you think. This week on Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick talks with Alex Reinert, the Max Freund Professor of Litigation & Advocacy at Cardozo School of Law. He is also the director of the Center for Rights and Justice and Co-Director of the Floersheimer Center for Constitutional Democracy. Alex explains the origins of qualified immunity—a legal theory that allows law enforcement officers to be free from consequences for their actions—why ICE’s lawlessness is not a new phenomenon (even if it is a phenomenon in hyperdrive under Trump), and what we can do about the obvious problem of maximal impunity for the people who have the most power to inflict harm.

This week, the Department of Justice forged ahead with criminal investigations into Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey—just a few days after Minnesota filed suit against Homeland Security over its surge of federal agents in and around the Twin Cities. State Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty are also being roped in and face subpoenas. The federal government is considering whether to charge Minnesota officials with conspiracy to impede federal agents’ immigration enforcement duties, but the case is clearly doomed to the same failure that met President Donald Trump’s efforts to prosecute political adversaries New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey. While those cases fell on technicalities, the investigations of the Minneapolis officials look likely to topple on more straightforward grounds: An administration that postures as fierce defenders of First Amendment rights is targeting these officials purely for their speech. While this effort is destined to fail, it still has the power to inflict long-term damage.

“The government may not take action based on the viewpoint of the speaker. Period, full stop,” former U.S. Attorney and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Harry Litman explained to Slate. Litman hosts the Talking Feds podcast, and he explained that the DOJ appears to be going after Walz and Frey through a federal statute that makes it a crime for local officials to conspire to prevent, force, intimidate, or threaten an officer who is required to perform their duties.

In order to prove Walz and Frey conspired against federal agents, the DOJ is likely going to attempt to use their public comments against them. For instance, Walz called the deployment of federal agents in Minnesota “sensationalized operations” and also put out a public statement urging people to “speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully.” Frey, during a separate press conference, made national waves when he said, “To ICE: Get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here.”

To almost anyone hearing those comments, Walz’s and Frey’s statements would not amount to a “conspiracy.” The obvious reality is that the Trump administration simply has beef with the public statements Walz and Frey have made and is trying to intimidate them and any other critics of ICE’s brutal—arguably murderous—recent tactics.

The issue for the DOJ in this case is that these statements don’t clear the bar of the federal statute it’s trying to invoke. “It has to be an agreement to use force, threat, or intimidation to impede federal officials,” Litman explained, and those threats have to produce imminent lawless action—known as the Brandenburg standard. Previous Supreme Court jurisprudence has confirmed this, with the court ruling that even speech where someone is calling for unlawful action is protected under the First Amendment, until and unless it actually results in a tangible crime. “The basic idea is that the First Amendment line is really robust and really extensive and it stops at the point, but only at the point, where some really bad shit is just about to go down because of your words,” Litman explained.

Another problematic element to the DOJ’s strategy is the fact that they have issued subpoenas to the state attorney general and the local prosecutor, both of whom have pledged to look into investigating Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good. Litman said it’s highly irregular to subpoena a prosecutor, and particularly problematic in this instance when the federal statute the DOJ is using to investigate may not hold up to scrutiny in court. On top of that, grand jury rules dictate that prosecutors cannot just hand out subpoenas in order to dig around for new information or to harass someone; they must be in pursuit of a legitimate crime.

To Litman, the bottom line is that the president is clearly using the threat of criminal prosecution to further threaten our constitutional democracy. As he told me, the message to local officials across the country who are already experiencing federal agents in their cities and to those who may be next is: “If you argue with me politically, I’ll see your ass in court—and maybe in jail.”

This week, President Donald Trump suffered a string of defeats that exposed the real limits of his power at home and abroad. First, his Justice Department abandoned its efforts to illegally appoint Lindsey Halligan, his former personal lawyer, as U.S. attorney, yielding to a furious judicial rebuke of its dirty tactics. Then the president dropped his threat to seize Greenland through military force or ruinous tariffs in the face of stiff international resistance. At almost the same time, the Supreme Court threw cold water on his bid to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, Minneapolis residents continue to protest, thwart, and document his violent assault on immigrant communities.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the vital lessons to be gleaned from these victories against the president’s abuses of power. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This story feels symbolic of the theme we wanted to talk about this week, which is that sometimes standing up to Trump really works. In November, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had illegally installed Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. attorney in Virginia and threw out her sloppy indictments of James Comey and Letitia James. But somehow Halligan refused to leave the office and kept claiming the title. When a different judge, David Novak, told her to stop, she filed this seething reply, with full backing from Pam Bondi’s DOJ, calling him a partisan hack. Tell us how he responded this week.

Mark Joseph Stern: This was one of the most incandescent judicial opinions I think I have ever seen. And, by the way, this is a Trump appointee; he’s not a flaming liberal. But Novak accused Halligan of wildly unprofessional conduct and openly breaking the law. This was a master class in dressing down the class clown. He wrote that her brief “contains a level of vitriol more appropriate for a cable news talk show and falls far beneath the level of advocacy expected from litigants in this Court, particularly the Department of Justice.”

Novak also pointed out that the chief judge of the 4th Circuit has made the ruling against Halligan’s appointment binding across the district, so Halligan was “simply flouting a judicial order because of a disagreement” by pretending to still hold the office. He wrote: “Ms. Halligan’s response asserts that she is free to act in an unlawful capacity, because she disagrees that she does so unlawfully. But that’s not how our legal system works.” And he went on: “The Eastern District of Virginia has long enjoyed the service of experienced prosecutors” who “shared an unwavering commitment to the Rule of Law, putting the interests of the citizens of the District before their own personal ambitions, as true public servants do. Unfortunately, it appears that this ethos has come to an end.”

Obviously, Novak was not backing down. He struck Halligan’s title as U.S. attorney from all relevant filings. And he said that while professional discipline—including potential disbarment—would have been appropriate, he would give Halligan “the benefit of the doubt” because of her unusual “inexperience” as a prosecutor. That was an extraordinary way to say: You are so unprofessional and inexperienced that I’m not even going to discipline you because you never had any business in this position in the first place.

The really important thing here is that, in a world in which these folks act as though they have boundless impunity to do what they want, it is incredibly important for judges to say no. It’s the cornerstone of how we think about the judicial role. That said, I have to read one more smackdown. Novak wrote: “No matter all of her machinations, Ms. Halligan has no legal basis to represent to this court that she holds the position. … This charade of Ms. Halligan masquerading as the United States Attorney for this District in direct defiance of binding court orders must come to an end.”

This is a historic dressing-down of somebody who thought they were made of Teflon. A few months ago, Halligan was asserting that she had the power to jail the president’s political foes on a pretext. And this humiliation is compounded by the fact that the chief judge of the district court posted a notice on Tuesday that the position of U.S. attorney was vacant—because even if Halligan had been appointed legally, her 120 days in the office were officially up. How did Halligan react to these slights?

She gave up, which is not what I expected. It was entirely possible that the Trump administration would attempt to reappoint her as interim U.S. attorney for another 120 days and try to fight this out till the end. Instead, it surrendered. Bondi announced on social media that Halligan would no longer seek to serve in the position. That is a victory for all the judges who stood up to this unlawful appointment. And it took me by surprise because the Justice Department’s filing earlier sounded like the opening salvo of a major battle over the limits of a president’s power to install his crony as top prosecutor. Then, when the DOJ got shot down and embarrassed and threatened with actual consequences, it just tucked in its tail and limped away.

There’s another topic I want to discuss in this same key. As late as Tuesday, America’s allies seem to be gearing up for a full-on confrontation with Trump over his deranged quest to seize Greenland. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney gave a stem-winder of a speech at Davos promising to defend Greenland’s sovereignty and bemoaning Trump’s “rupture” of the rules-based international order. Then, on Wednesday, in the face of all this, Trump just rolled over and gave up?

He conceded defeat. He said he was not going to use military force to seize Greenland, which was the threat that he had been pushing for days—tanking the markets, terrifying the allies, forcing Denmark and Greenland to prepare for possible battle with the United States. He just said: Never mind, I’m not going to do that. Then he purported to secure a deal with NATO that would give the U.S. unlimited access to Greenland, something we already have under current agreements. So he didn’t do anything at all. He imperiled the entire world order to end up with the status quo.

When Carney gave that speech, and world leaders gave him a standing ovation, I was worried. I wondered: Is this the provocation? Is this the moment we truly become a rogue nation? Are the tanks going to be rolling into Greenland? And instead, Trump gave up, just as he did with Halligan. The truth is that he’s weak. He is not the muscular president he pretends to be on television. When someone says no, and uses tools at their disposal to enforce that boundary, he stands down, because he is terrified of being defeated in a way that he can’t spin as a secret victory.

That’s particularly salient in a week when so many horrors have befallen residents of Minnesota who are standing up to genuine tyranny. It may be tempting to slide into defeatism. But your point is that Donald Trump is a cartoon strongman’s idea of a strongman, right? He’s not actually very strong. If people and institutions and businesses and government stand up to him, he crumples.

Let’s braid into that a conversation we had earlier in the week about the Supreme Court arguments over Trump’s attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve. The justices were like: What? You can’t do this. We can’t have the Fed at the mercy of a president who goes on pretextual fishing expeditions to go after people he doesn’t like. The point here seems to be: Don’t cede all this power to him. And maybe if SCOTUS would grow a spine, this could end tomorrow.

You observed on Wednesday that a lot of the justices sounded pissed. They were like: How did we get to this point? And it’s their own fault! They gave Trump so much leeway in all of these earlier cases to break the law. Then they seemed irked when he crossed the line that they had tried to draw in the sand over the Federal Reserve. They seemed to wonder: How could this happen? Well, look in the mirror. When you capitulate, you empower Trump to push further past your limits. That’s the lesson that the international community seems to have learned, and that our more courageous judges in the lower courts have learned. Let’s just hope that John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett are learning it now, because it’s one of the few things that could turn around this catastrophe.

With Trump, you’ve got to hold the line, or else you just get bowled over. That is what everyone out in the streets in Minnesota is doing right now, and we are seeing the results. The average protester blowing a whistle on the streets of the Twin Cities has shown more courage than John Roberts has in maybe his entire career.

It’s remarkable how many times Donald Trump acts like Donald Trump, and people come away dazed and stupefied, as if they haven’t witnessed the spectacle over and over before.

It happened again this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In his speech on Wednesday, our president doubled down on his odd obsession over Greenland, demanding U.S. ownership of the icy island, insisting that he needs it for national security, and telling European leaders, in the pose of a Mafia don, “You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember.”

Trump had threatened, a few days earlier, to impose 100 percent tariffs on European nations that opposed his takeover plans. It seemed, this time, he wasn’t going to back down from his own ruinous demands.

And then he backed down. Just a few hours after his speech, which was unusually hostile by even his standards, he emerged from a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, announced that they’d worked out the “framework of a future deal” on Greenland, so there’d be no need for an invasion or for any punitive tariffs. Asked about the details of this framework, Trump said, “We’ll have something in two weeks”—his usual timetable for putting off important decisions, or sometimes evading them altogether.

In other words, Trump the Godfather had once again transformed into the TACO Man—the derisive acronym for “Trump Always Chickens Out,” coined after the first couple of times he threatened tariffs, then backed off, early on in his second term as president.

But this time, the syndrome played out differently. The targets of the threat, in this case the leaders of European nations, were in the same room, watching in real time. They’d gathered earlier, to work out a unified stance, and they were energized by one of their own, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose speech, the day before Trump’s, laid out a clear path for how medium-sized countries, working together, can outmaneuver the dictates of large powers that abuse the rules they created for their own benefit. (Carney is no starry-eyed idealist, having once been the head of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada.)

In short, the Europeans did something that Trump, with some reason, thought they would never do—they held firm. They threatened to invoke the Anti-Coercion Instrument (nicknamed “the Bazooka”), which allows the European Union to counter economic pressure from third nations with tariffs and penalties of its own. The bazooka was designed as a deterrent—and it seems to have deterred. It was a major reason why Trump backed down. The financial markets’ response to Trump’s speech probably also played a role; the S&P 500 plunged 2.5 percent, some bankers worried about a run on the dollar and a sell-off of Treasury notes. (The stock market recovered its losses, and financiers’ panic abated, after the president chickened out.)

Many European leaders—and probably some of Trump’s aides too—heaved a huge sigh of relief. For all the wishful talk of “strategic autonomy,” at least by some EU members, they prefer mutually productive relations with the United States. The dollar still reigns supreme in global transactions, and a reliable U.S. military presence is crucial to Europe’s security, at least for the next decade.

Yet under Trump, relations with the U.S.—for not just the Europeans but all of America’s traditional allies—are neither productive nor reliable. And his backpedaling on Greenland, while welcome, doesn’t alter this clear reality. In fact, in some ways, it intensifies the pervasive aura of insecurity. Trump came to Davos so insistent in his belligerence, so determined to pursue U.S. interests as he saw them (however misguided he was about what those interests really were)—then, within hours, shifted 180 degrees with no explanation and only the vaguest outline of an alternative plan. How, from now on, can anyone take seriously any threat or promise Trump makes? He is still, by default, the leader of the free world and, by constitutional powers, the commander in chief of the world’s most lethal military establishment—yet how can anyone rely on anything he says?

We have been creeping, for some time now, toward this crisis (crisis is not too strong a word for what we’re facing), but the summit in Davos dramatized it. It did so in two ways. First, Trump’s speech was so hostile and his subsequent retreat was so airheaded. (No one could convincingly claim, as some have in the wake of previous reversals, that Trump was playing some wizard’s game of four-dimensional chess.) Second, and more important, the leading allies publicly talked about his behavior and found in Carney’s speech—which they greeted with (a rarity at Davos) a roused standing ovation—a way of moving out of the old order’s grip.

It’s unclear whether they’ll be able to sustain this pivot toward a “third way.” The United States still has, as Trump likes to put it, lots of “cards” to play in tit-for-tat games of leverage. Still, the landscape is changing. China is exploiting the trans-Atlantic transition (or, as Carney described it, the “rupture”), moving into markets that had previously been closed; even before his Davos speech, Carney signed a high-profile trade deal with Beijing. The EU negotiated a similar deal with South American nations, similarly designed to bypass Washington’s control. Denmark announced that it would sell its stockpile of U.S. Treasury notes, valued at $100 million, at the end of the month. This isn’t as much as it may seem; the EU holds about $10 trillion in U.S. assets. Still, it’s an unusual gesture fraught with at least symbolic significance.

Trump has responded to the growing discontent with dismissive contempt. In his Davos speech, he bellowed that, without the United States, much of the world “wouldn’t be making anything”; that without his own efforts, “you wouldn’t have NATO,” which gives us “absolutely nothing” in return; and that if America hadn’t entered World War II, “you’d all be speaking German”—a bizarrely crude thing to say in Switzerland, where the most commonly spoken official language is German.

Yes, the U.S. holds a lot of cards. But Trump doesn’t realize that the game is changing and that, under the emerging set of new rules, his cards are slowly but steadily declining in value.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The future of the British Army&#39;s troublesome Ajax armored vehicle program has again been called into question after the official in charge was removed and use of Ajax halted over its effects on personnel.

Initial operating capability (IOC) of the tracked reconnaissance vehicle was declared in November last year, despite ongoing concerns over excessive noise and vibration impacting Army personnel using it.

Now the Minister for Defence Readiness and Industry Luke Pollard MP has disclosed in a statement to Parliament that he had been given written assurances by senior Ministry of Defence (MoD) personnel that Ajax was &quot;demonstrably safe.&quot;

Since that guarantee was given, 35 service personnel reported symptoms consistent with noise and vibration effects during a training exercise, causing him to order an indefinite pause of the use of Ajax for training, while safety investigations are carried out.

A ministerial review into the advice that Pollard and other senior officials were receiving concluded that people had been raising issues with the Ajax program, but those issues were not being &quot;elevated to an appropriate level.&quot;

In response, the Senior Responsible Owner of the Ajax program has been removed, and Pollard says he has passed oversight to the National Armaments Director. The latter is a civil servant, Rupert Pearce, who was appointed last year with a brief to reform defense procurement.

As for Ajax itself, Pollard said the MoD is working with the contractor, General Dynamics, to identify problems and solutions, adding that &quot;we will need to decide on the platform&#39;s future shortly.&quot;

This seems to suggest that the UK government may be preparing to cancel Ajax if the issues cannot be fixed, but that would open up a whole new can of worms, as the program is already years behind schedule and the multibillion-pound budget for it has already been spent.

It has been suggested that the MoD should consider buying the CV90 instead, which is already in service with several other European armies, but the MoD is said to be facing a £28 billion ($38 billion) funding &quot;black hole&quot; over the next four years, as it stands.

Meanwhile, the government has just committed £650 million ($880 million) to upgrade the RAF&#39;s fleet of Typhoon fighter jets, as some ask whether more of these should be procured instead of the troublesome F-35 stealth aircraft.

About £453 million ($612 million) is going on fitting European Common Radar System (ECRS) Mk2 kit [PDF]. This is said to be able to simultaneously detect, identify, and track multiple targets in the air and on the ground, while providing a high-powered jamming capability in contested environments.

Another £205 million ($277 million) is going on specialist engineering support by QinetiQ to help upgrade the Typhoon&#39;s weapon systems, the MoD says.

But both Turkey and Germany recently placed orders for 20 new-build Typhoons apiece, in the latter case to replace aging Tornado aircraft. At the time, MPs questioned in Parliament why the UK isn&#39;t buying any more itself, especially as the Royal Air Force (RAF) has retired many of its oldest Tranche 1 models, leaving it with about 107 Typhoons in service.

Instead, the government last year decided to buy 12 F-35A fighters capable of carrying nuclear weapons, despite the fact these can&#39;t be refueled by the RAF&#39;s own tankers and the nukes they would carry are owned by the US.

The RAF and the Royal Navy also operate the F-35B version of the jet, as a replacement for the Harrier in the Navy&#39;s case, and the Tornado in RAF service.

Pressure will likely grow for the government to change its mind on a Typhoon purchase, especially in light of recent events that have led many to question whether the US can be considered a reliable partner.

Spain last year cancelled plans to buy the F-35, opting for the Typhoon instead.

In addition, the maker of the F-35, Lockheed Martin, has dragged its heels on supporting UK weapons such as the Spear and Meteor missiles, a capability not expected before 2031, five years behind schedule.

However, the UK is already committed to developing the Typhoon&#39;s replacement, as part of the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) project with Italy and Japan. Codenamed Tempest, this is expected to be in service by 2035, which means the UK may see little point in ordering new Typhoons now. ®

            <h2>How an experienced developer teamed up with Claude to create Elo programming language</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-24</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">feature Bernard Lambeau, a Belgium-based software developer and founder of several technology companies, created a programming language called Elo with the help of Anthropic&#39;s Claude Code.

Starting on December 25, 2025, he published a series of posts about the project. The first post names Claude as a co-author.

&quot;In roughly 24 hours of collaboration, we built a complete expression language with a parser, type system, three compilers, a standard library, a CLI tool, and a documentation website. Not bad for a day&#39;s work,” Lambeau and Claude wrote.

&quot;Elo isn&#39;t just a demonstration that AI can write code. It&#39;s a demonstration that humans and AI can build together – each contributing what they do best,” they added.

As an expression language that compiles to JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL, Elo is intended as a portable way to handle form validation, e-commerce order processing, and subscription logic.

Lambeau, founder and CTO of Klaro Cards and CEO of app consultancy Enspirit, is not the first to develop a programming language with the help of AI.

Steve Klabnik performed a similar feat last year with the Rue programming language. In September 2025, Geoffrey Huntley enlisted Claude to write a programming language called Cursed. And before that, Avital Tamir published a Claude-authored repo for the Server programming language, with the caveat that the code is not intended for actual use.

Claude Code isn&#39;t the only AI-assisted programming method having a moment. AI biz Cursor created a rudimentary browser using OpenAI&#39;s GPT-5.2. And developer Ola Prøis used Cursor, powered by Claude, to create a Rust-based text editor called Ferrite.

Claude users generally acknowledge that their pair partner makes mistakes. But those committed to AI assistance find it worthwhile to clean up after their helper.

&quot;Claude Code knows almost every tech stack (and can search the web), knows the Linux commands that matter (search code, search & replace, compile, test, etc.), and does that 10x faster than I can do myself,&quot; Lambeau told The Register in an email interview.

Claude, he said, allows him to use technology he hasn&#39;t mastered.

&quot;I was already a full-stack developer (on languages, frameworks & reusable libraries I knew); I&#39;m now a full-stack++ dev because I can also use languages, frameworks, and reusable libraries I barely know, if at all,&quot; he explained.

&quot;Claude Code falls short if you don&#39;t have a great methodology. It needs feedback loops to work fine; otherwise, it derails. One possible feedback loop is a human reviewing code and testing manually. But there&#39;s a better/complementary approach if you want it to work autonomously. On both Elo and Bmg.js, I&#39;ve started by making sure the testing methodology was effective and scientifically sound. Claude writes the tests, executes them, discovers where it&#39;s wrong, and corrects itself. Impressive.&quot;

Lambeau said he still needs to review some of Claude&#39;s output.

&quot;But if I read the tests, agree with them, and can check myself that they run fine, I&#39;m 95 percent sure it&#39;s already correct as a black box (not even reading the code),&quot; he explained. &quot;Then I can check the architecture and code quality as a white box by having a general look at the code, but I don&#39;t have to understand every detail.&quot;

Notably, Lambeau documented the series of prompts he used to create the language. The repo includes more than 100 tasks used to direct the AI model. In addition, Lambeau has published a video that describes his AI pair programming process.

&quot;I started in a setting where Claude Code asked for permissions every 20 seconds and I was checking everything it did,&quot; Lambeau explained. &quot;After a few successes, I quickly set up safe environments to be able to let Claude Code run in full autonomy (isolated computer & isolated Linux user, or running in a Docker image).&quot;

Lambeau said he still uses plan mode for complex tasks that require conversation with Claude.

&quot;I review the plan, make sure we have a test strategy that&#39;s sound, then switch Claude to autonomous mode and look at the tests, code & results afterward,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s very similar to a lead-dev/CTO + QA role, btw; it&#39;s just much faster than with human devs.&quot;

Lambeau, who has a PhD in software engineering and 30 years of experience as a developer, said both experts and novices can benefit from Claude Code, though he added that a service like Lovable might be more approachable for those not already acclimated to the command line.

&quot;Now, when it comes to real software/product engineering, I think Claude Code requires experts (so far),&quot; he said. &quot;You still need to guide it a lot to keep the quality high enough. You need very strong expertise to do it effectively. Currently (Claude will still improve a lot), if you don&#39;t have the expertise, you certainly end up with a big mess of unmaintainable code.&quot;

Many developers have said as much about AI tools. They&#39;re more useful as an amplifier of expertise than as a replacement for it. The situation is analogous to the introduction of sequencing software, digital synthesizers, and drum machines half a century ago. These tools enabled a lot of people who weren&#39;t great musicians to make music. But they didn&#39;t instill musical skill, and they produced the most interesting work in the hands of practiced musicians.

The cost to do this, Lambeau said, has been a Claude Max subscription that he purchased in December for €180 a month. In that time, he says, he wrote Elo (https://elo-lang.org), completed Bmg.js (https://github.com/enspirit/bmg.js), completed Bmg&#39;s documentation (https://www.relational-algebra.dev), and created the first version of the Try page (https://www.relational-algebra.dev/try).

&quot;It&#39;s all personal research and open-source projects,&quot; he said. &quot;It would have required several weeks to do the same manually myself, and several months to ask another developer to do it. The cost would be mostly because of the scientific & technical knowledge transfer about the data language I envision. Strangely enough, it&#39;s very cheap with Claude Code. There&#39;s something true about the fact that those LLMs have a PhD.&quot;

Lambeau explained that Elo isn&#39;t just a way to test Claude Code. He also sees it as an extension of his academic work in software engineering and his personal interest in the Relational Model – he&#39;s served as a lecturer for database courses at Belgium’s UCLouvain.

&quot;I&#39;m absolutely convinced that we need better/safer/simpler programming languages inside no-code tools and when interconnecting them (e.g. Zapier, Make, n8n, etc.),&quot; he said. &quot;Mainstream programming languages are very complex, error-prone, sometimes dangerous, and the programs are difficult to review for non-experts.&quot;

&quot;More importantly, they are cumbersome to use for even simple data tasks. I mean, even validating the schema and constraints of a data file at runtime tends to be a nightmare in existing languages. It&#39;s not built-in in any mainstream language; you immediately need validation libraries; most of them are limited in what they can easily check, so you need to add dedicated boilerplate code.&quot;

In a world where non-technical people will have the opportunity to write untrustworthy code with the help of AI, he said, we need to be able to run that code safely.

&quot;Elo aims at providing a safe & simple alternative,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be a limited language (non-Turing-complete, as we say) but super safe & simple, and usable in 80 percent of common data use cases. The very first no-code tool to integrate it will be Klaro Cards, of course.&quot; ®

            <h2>Bill Gates-backed startup aims to revive Moore's Law with optical transistors</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/24/neurophos_hopes_to_revive_moores_law/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Moore&#39;s Law slows to a crawl and the amount of energy required to deliver generational performance gains grows, some chip designers are looking to alternative architectures for salvation.

Neurophos is among those trying to upend Moore&#39;s Law and make good on analog computing&#39;s long-promised yet largely untapped potential.

The Austin, Texas-based AI chip startup says it&#39;s developing an optical processing unit (OPU) that in theory is capable of delivering 470 petaFLOPS of FP4 / INT4 compute — about 10x that of Nvidia&#39;s newly unveiled Rubin GPUs — while using roughly the same amount of power.

Neurophos CEO Patrick Bowen tells El Reg this is possible in part because of the micron-scale metamaterial optical modulators, essentially photonic transistors, that the company has spent the past several years developing.

&quot;The equivalent of the optical transistor that you get from Silicon Photonics factories today is massive. It&#39;s like 2 mm long. You just can&#39;t fit enough of them on chip in order to get a compute density that remotely competes with digital CMOS today,&quot; he explained.

Neurophos&#39; optical transistors, Bowen says, are roughly 10,000x smaller. &quot;We got our first silicon back in May demonstrating that we could do that with a standard CMOS process, which means it&#39;s compatible with existing foundry technologies.&quot;

Using these transistors, Neurophos claims to have developed the optical equivalent of a tensor core. &quot;On chip, there is a single photonic tensor core that is 1,000 by 1,000 [processing elements] in size,&quot; he said.

This is quite a bit bigger than what&#39;s typically seen in most AI accelerators and GPUs, which employ matrix multiplication engines that are at most 256x256 processing elements in size.

However, rather than having dozens or even hundreds of these tensor cores, like we see in Nvidia&#39;s GPUs, Neurophos only needs one. Bowen tells us the tensor core on its first-gen accelerator will occupy roughly 25 mm2.

The rest of the reticle-sized chip is &quot;the boondoggle of what it takes to support this insane tensor core,&quot; Bowen said.

Specifically, Neurophos needs a whack-ton of vector processing units and SRAM to keep the tensor core from starving for data. This is because the tensor core itself — and yes, again, there&#39;ll only be one of them on the entire reticle-sized die — is operating at around 56 gigahertz.

But because the matrix-matrix multiplication is done optically, Bowen notes that the only power consumed by the tensor core is what&#39;s needed to drive the opto-electrical conversion from digital to analog and back again.

Neurophos says its first OPU, codenamed the Tulkas T100, will feature a dual reticle design equipped with 768 GB of HBM that&#39;s capable of 470 petaOPS while consuming 1 to 2 kilowatts of power under load.

As impressive as all this sounds, it&#39;s important to remember that these figures are more like goal posts at this point. The chip is still in active development with full production not expected to begin until mid-2028. Even then, Bowen doesn&#39;t expect it to ship in large volumes. &quot;We&#39;re talking thousands of chips. Not tens of thousands of chips.&quot;

While Neurophos believes its optical tensor cores can address a broad array of AI inference workloads, it expects its first chip will be used primarily as a prefill processor.

As we&#39;ve previously discussed, LLM inference can be broken into two phases: a compute intensive prefill stage in which input tokens are processed, and a memory bandwidth bound stage in which output tokens are generated.

Over the past year or so, we&#39;ve seen chip designers like Nvidia disaggregate prefill and decode into separate pools of GPUs. For its latest generation of GPUs, Nvidia has developed a dedicated prefill accelerator that it calls Rubin CPX.

Bowen envisions the Tulkas T100 filling a similar role as Rubin CPX. &quot;The current vision, which is subject to change, is basically we would put one rack of ours, which is 256 of our chips, and that would be paired with something like an NVL576 rack,&quot; he said.

Long-term, Bowen aims to tackle the decode phase as well, but notes that a variety of technologies, including co-packaged optics, will need to be developed before the startup is ready to take on token generation.

While the Tulkas T100 won&#39;t ship until at least 2028, Bowen says the company is actively working on a proof of concept (PoC) chip to validate the compute and power densities it&#39;s claiming.

This week, Neurophos completed a $110 million Series-A funding round led by Gates Frontier, with participation from Microsoft&#39;s venture fund and other investors, which Bowen says will fund development of this PoC. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK Home Office is spending up to £100 million on intelligence tech in part to tackle the so-called &quot;small boats&quot; issue of refugees and irregular immigrants coming across the English Channel.

The Whitehall department&#39;s Border Security Command (BSC) is on the hunt for a &quot;maritime situational awareness system&quot; it says should &quot;autonomously detect, track, and identify small boats and non-cooperative vessels at range.&quot;

The official prior information notice marks engagement with vendors for a system set to fuse &quot;data from land-based and Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS)&quot; drones with existing platforms.

The continued flow of refugees, asylum seekers, and irregular immigrants has become a major focus of UK politics in recent years, with successive governments keen to be seen to act in response to adverse publicity.

The Home Office notice said it had decided to combine its requirement for a real-time view from land-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) with the Joint Maritime Security Centre (JMSC) of the Maritime Domain Awareness service, which provides security and regulatory enforcement data and was already the subject of a separate procurement.

It now plans to merge the two into a single procurement: the Coastal Maritime ISR Service.

The Home Office said that under the deal, suppliers would &quot;strengthen the UK&#39;s response to clandestine entry and wider maritime security by delivering a scalable, managed service that provides enhanced domain awareness and supports operational decision-making.&quot;

&quot;The solution will autonomously detect, track, and identify small boats and non-cooperative vessels at range, fusing data from land-based and Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) sources with existing platforms,&quot; it said. BVLOS is shorthand for piloting drones without being able to directly see them.

The winning bidder will be expected to integrate data from satellite-based automatic identification, radar, and drone-based sensors to create a &quot;Tracks as a Service&quot; in near real-time via an API to the Royal Navy Maritime Domain Awareness Programme (MDAP) and connect to the Home Office, a &quot;common operating picture accessible to key decision-makers and first responders.&quot;

&quot;A supplier portal will provide camera feeds, alternative track displays, and alerts, ensuring flexibility to meet short-notice operational requirements across the UK, Crown Dependencies, and British Overseas Territories,&quot; the notice said.

The contract is set to last between three and five years, including any extension periods, and could be worth £100 million for the full five-year term.

Research from campaign group Progressive International claims private companies won around £3.5 billion in contracts for UK border security since 2017, including &quot;contracts specifically related to the regulation of people moving across the English Channel in small boats.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">exclusive The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency won&#39;t attend the annual RSA Conference in March, an agency spokesperson confirmed to The Register.

&quot;Since the beginning of this administration, CISA has made significant progress in returning to our statutory, core mission and focusing on President Trump&#39;s policies for maximum security for all Americans,&quot; CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy told us. &quot;CISA has reviewed and determined that we will not participate in the RSA Conference since we regularly review all stakeholder engagements, to ensure maximum impact and good stewardship of taxpayer dollars.&quot;

McCarthy declined to comment on whether the decision had anything to do with former CISA director Jen Easterly being named chief executive of RSAC last week.

Easterly, who was appointed to lead America&#39;s top cyber-defense agency under the Biden administration, joined her predecessor and CISA&#39;s first-ever director Chris Krebs in President Trump&#39;s line of fire back in July.

In a now-deleted LinkedIn post, the US Military Academy at West Point announced that Easterly - who graduated from West Point in 1990 - would return to the academy as a Robert F. McDermott Distinguished Chair in West Point&#39;s Department of Social Sciences, where she previously taught economics and national security.

Soon after, far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer criticized Easterly&#39;s appointment on X, and the next day, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll directed West Point to rescind Easterly&#39;s offer before she even began her new gig.

Last week, Easterly announced that she&#39;s joined RSAC as its new CEO, and almost immediately, rumors began swirling that Trump cybersecurity officials would boycott the industry&#39;s &quot;largest and most influential conference&quot; to protest Easterly&#39;s appointment.

NextGov reported that officials in the White House Office of the National Cyber Director, National Security Council, and CISA all discussed canceling their appearances at the annual conference in San Francisco.

The Register also reached out to the Office of the National Cyber Director and the National Security Council, and did not receive any response.

Federal cyber officials historically have active speaking roles at RSAC, with both Easterly and Krebs previously delivering keynotes, speaking on panels with other government network defenders, and talking to the press. In 2024, Easterly and co even wrangled nearly 70 tech providers into signing a Secure by Design pledge.

That all changed, however, last year, with the National Security Agency abruptly canceling its popular State of the Hack panel and CISA declining any press interviews or roundtable discussions.

In a last-minute addition to the 2025 agenda, however, Homeland Security boss Kristi Noem did appear on the keynote stage and said CISA had gone off the rails. She vowed to put the agency &quot;back on mission.&quot;

A year later, however, it appears that she&#39;s been sidetracked with ICE&#39;s militaristic occupation of major American cities. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ofcom is formally investigating whether Meta complied with legally binding information requests regarding WhatsApp&#39;s role in the UK business messaging ecosystem.

The case, published on Ofcom&#39;s own enforcement register on Friday, centers on two statutory &quot;section 135&quot; notices issued to Meta on July 31, 2024, and June 19, 2025, under the Communications Act 2003.

Those notices required Meta to hand over data on how WhatsApp Business competes in the application-to-person messaging market – the unglamorous stuff companies use to ping customers about parcels, appointments, and login codes.

Ofcom said the information it received so far may not have been complete or accurate. In statutory requests like these, accuracy isn&#39;t a suggestion: it&#39;s a legal requirement, and failure to comply can trigger enforcement action under section 138 of the Act.

&quot;The information gathered through statutory information requests is a key part of Ofcom&#39;s work and informs how it carries out its statutory functions as a regulator,&quot; the watchdog said. &quot;It is therefore crucial that stakeholders provide accurate and complete information in a timely fashion.&quot;

Ofcom declined to say what details provided by Meta may have been questionable when asked by The Register.

In a statement to The Register, Meta said: &quot;We take regulatory obligations seriously and devote significant resources to responding to requests for information in a timely and accurate manner. We will cooperate with Ofcom in its investigation.&quot;

The probe adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches for Meta in the UK and Europe – from child protection age-checks to gambling ad scrutiny – as competition authorities globally tighten oversight of Big Tech.

Ofcom will publish further updates on its enforcement page as the inquiry develops. ®

The Sony LinkBuds Clip are the company’s first clip earbuds. They follow the innovative donut-hole LinkBuds and LinkBuds Open and, like their predecessors, allow you to listen to music or podcasts, make phone calls, or be active outdoors while still maintaining awareness of your surroundings. The clip design has become more popular over the past couple of years, and while the LinkBuds Clip have a solid design and good sound, there’s nothing significant that sets them apart from competitors, especially at their $229.99 price.

Like other open earbuds, the LinkBuds Clip wrap around your ear helix like an ear cuff. The small spherical speaker enclosure is positioned just outside your ear canal and is connected by a flexible band to a larger capsule-shaped housing that rests on the outside. I like the look of the Clip buds, with their slightly glossy enclosures and selection of subdued color tones, including lavender, green, greige (a grayish beige), and black. Some might prefer a bolder, flashier look, but I like the green sample Sony provided. You can also mix and match five different case covers — black, green, blue, coral, and lavender — to customize them.

More expensive than competitorsMissing some expected features

The Clip are intended to sit midway up your ear, but since everyone’s ears are different, there could be some adjustment to find the most comfortable spot for you (for me, it’s a little lower on my ear). Once you find the sweet spot, putting the earbuds on is quick and easy, although I found the fit a bit loose. The band isn’t as flexible as the one on the Shokz OpenDots One, which fit more securely around my ear. Instead, Sony includes silicone “cushions” that fit around the band. (Color-matching cushions come with the additional top case covers.) They gave me the secure fit I was looking for, and I was able to wear them for nearly an entire workday without discomfort. I even forgot I was wearing them at times, since they let in ambient sound. Those with larger ears might feel more of a pinch from them, even without the cushions attached.

While I preferred the fit of the LinkBuds Clip with the cushions, using them affected the sound balance. The cushions caused the speakers to sit just a bit farther away from my ear canal, which resulted in less bass performance. And the Clip — and really every pair of open earbuds — are a bit light on thumping bass. There are three primary listening modes: standard, voice boost, and sound leakage reduction.

Standard mode sounds the most natural, with a clear midrange that doesn’t overpower the higher frequencies. Voice boost added a bit too much vocal presence that became oppressive over longer music listening sessions, but added good clarity for podcasts and news programs. The sound leakage reduction mode cuts out much of the high-end response, limiting potential disturbances to those around you, but it also makes the music sound muffled and dull. And there wasn’t a significant amount of leakage anyway, even in standard and voice boost modes.

There are some presets in Sony’s Sound Connect app, as well as a 10-band equalizer, if you want to boost or cut a specific frequency range. For some of my more rocking tracks — Soundgarden’s “Spoonman,” for instance — I pumped up the bass and low mids a bit. There’s also Sony’s DSEE, which improves the sound of compressed audio a little bit.

The LinkBuds Clip really shine when on calls. They have a new AI noise-reduction chip and bone-conduction sensor that allow them to focus on the wearer’s voice and isolate it from the noise around them. During multiple calls while walking down the busier streets in my Los Angeles neighborhood, my friends could easily hear me, while the traffic around me was suppressed. There were occasional moments where they commented about hearing a gust of wind or the sirens of a nearby police car, but they were fleeting. It was during those moments, though, that I had some trouble hearing them because of the Clip’s open design.

I was a bit surprised at some of what was missing with the LinkBuds Clip, especially for $230. While they have good battery life at nine hours per charge (and another 28 hours with the case), the case doesn’t have wireless charging. The earbuds support the standard SBC and AAC codecs, but Sony’s own high-res LDAC is missing. They also don’t have audio sharing, which is available on the WF-1000XM5 and can now be found for only $25 more than the Clip.

The touch controls can be finicky. You use multiple taps for different controls — two taps on the right side to pause and play, three taps for the next song, and four taps to raise the volume (or lower the volume on the left earbuds). But the spot to tap on the band has a small margin of error, so if my finger was off target at all, the taps wouldn’t register. It was even harder while jogging. I’d need to slow down to a fast walk to get better control.

You can set up scene-based listening in the Sound Connect app, which allows you to customize the earbuds’ functionality based on your activity or location. So you can have a specific playlist start when you start running, or when you arrive home, the app can switch to your favorite music streaming service. You can also have the app read out notifications in your ear. It’s an interesting feature if you have certain routines and invest in the time to set it up.

It makes sense that Sony came out with the Clip, especially since it helped popularize the open earbuds trend with the original LinkBuds. And the Clip are good earbuds that look cool, sound pretty good, and are comfortable. But for $230, there’s nothing that sets them apart from other recent open earbuds like the Shokz OpenDots One and EarFun Clip, both of which are cheaper. Once they come down in price or go on sale, they’ll be much more of an enticing purchase. But until then, unless you’re in love with the LinkBuds Clip look, it’s better to wait.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">﻿New Jersey just approved a wildly out-of-step new law that restricts all e-bikes, regardless of speed or power capabilities. Will other states follow?

This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on the e-bike movement, follow Andrew J. Hawkins. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.

Last week, I did something I don’t typically do, which is call up one of my elected officials and yell at them about a new bill.

New Jersey’s car-brained lawmakers had just passed legislation that would impose heavy restrictions on e-bike ownership in the state, and I was livid. Obviously there’s been a lot of concern about the growing number of teenagers being injured and killed while riding e-bikes, many of them powerful, high-speed ones that are more akin to motorcycles than bikes. Lawmakers claim they’re just trying to bring some order to what is increasingly becoming a wild, unregulated market.

But the bill needlessly lumps together high-powered e-motos with low-speed pedal-assist bikes, often used by food delivery workers or parents who want to take their kids to school without using a car. Forcing someone who owns an e-bike without a throttle that can’t go faster than 20mph to register their bike with the DMV, acquire a license, and buy insurance seems ridiculous on its face, and will absolutely harm efforts to encourage more sustainable transportation modes in the state. And for that reason, I called up my governor and asked him to veto the bill.

Now, New Jerseyeans will be forced to reckon with one of the nation’s most restrictive e-bike laws. Bike advocates are aghast at how this bill sailed through the legislature and was signed into law at the eleventh hour by an outgoing governor. And they worry that other states will follow New Jersey’s lead, given the rising panic around teenagers riding e-bikes.

New York City recently capped e-bike speeds at 15mph, which is painfully slow and robs an e-bike’s ability to outmaneuver multi-ton SUVs and trucks on busy city roads. And now some Manhattan residents are calling for an outright ban on e-bikes in Central Park, citing a handful of collisions between pedestrians and e-bikes. Meanwhile, lawmakers in California have proposed a bill that would ban the sale of e-bikes with motors that exceed 750W of power.

To be sure, lawmakers are certainly getting an earful from their constituents about the proliferation of high-powered, high-speed e-bikes in their communities. Dip into any town’s Facebook group, and you’re likely to find a lot of pearl-clutching about teenagers riding e-bikes. And often their concerns are warranted, given the increasing rate of injuries and fatalities related to e-bikes. This is a problem that’s solvable with better infrastructure and more safety education, both for parents and their kids.

But when these complaints result in disastrous legislation, like in New Jersey, it adversely affects the broader community of people who want to use a low-cost, environmentally friendly mode of transportation to replace car trips — teens included. Multiple studies have shown that e-bikes are ridden more often than traditional bikes, and are typically used to replace car trips, which results in lower carbon emissions and cleaner, healthier communities. But rather than support and promote this mode of transportation by building bike lanes to protect riders, lawmakers are becoming more reactionary, which fails to address the real safety issues that contribute to the rising number of fatalities and injuries on our roadways: cars.

Bike advocates are scrambling to fix the glaring problems with New Jersey’s e-bike law, hoping to redirect the energy toward stricter rules around kids and e-motos. Their success is no guarantee.

But in the meantime, misinformation about e-bikes is proliferating online. My colleagues at the Montclair Bike Bus are being inundated with negative comments from people illogically equating all e-bikes with death and danger, failing to grasp the enormous difference between a 40mph electric dirt bike and a throttleless pedal assist bike that maxes out at 20mph.

None of this is surprising. In a country as car dependent as the US, we sometimes fail to grasp the need to promote better, more sustainable modes of transportation, instead of just working within the same, broken, car-centric system. There are many names for this phenomenon — windshield bias, car brain, motonormativity — the view that all decisions should be in service of the automobile. Lawmakers are especially prone to these biases.

It’s true that some e-bikes are a menace, just like some cars. But treating all e-bikes as the same, regardless of power capabilities and speed, fails to account for the enormous potential of e-bikes. I can’t help but think that e-bikes are victims of their own success. I’ve seen nasty comments from drivers annoyed about having to slow down for an immigrant delivery worker or a mom with her kids on a cargo bike, or about a new bike lane in their town. E-bikes are just as polarizing as they are popular, so maybe it was inevitable that car drivers, who can’t countenance any delay, no matter how slight, would strike back.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After Alex Pretti was shot, photographer Steven Garcia followed peaceful protestors as they withstood being teargassed by ICE agents.

Steven Garcia, as told to Gaby Del Valle:

I was in the middle of a frozen lake when I got the notification from the Minnesota Star Tribune that there had been a shooting. I was on assignment at a pond hockey event, and someone who was supposed to play later that evening said he probably wouldn’t be able to make it — they knew there would be protests and demonstrations happening.

I arrived a little over three hours later. Federal officers had already cleared the scene — the FBI had been there investigating — so the only law enforcement present were state and local officials: the Minneapolis Police Department, their SWAT team, the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, and the Minnesota State Patrol.

There were protesters at multiple intersections. People had blocked off the streets with trash cans and dumpsters, and there were mattresses on the ground. Protesters were heckling officers, but there were no physical altercations. Eventually law enforcement retreated by a block and started throwing tear gas. They drove their trucks over the mattresses as they left.

When those tear gas canisters go off, they pop and bang, kind of like a firework. Dozens of canisters were going off. Even initially, there were four, five, six canisters at a time that they were throwing. I had to duck in an alley for a little bit because it got through my mask. It’s not a fun experience, even in very small amounts. You have to keep your eyes closed. It burns your eyes, it burns your mouth. For some people, it causes nausea and burning on the skin. Another local reporter told me his neck was burning and he had to use a decon wipe.

I think because of George Floyd in 2020, people knew how to respond. Gregory Bovino, the head of the US Border Patrol who has been here the whole time, has said community members in Minneapolis are really prepared. A lot of people I’ve talked to have said, “I had my respirator ready from 2020,” and they just restocked on safety supplies, decon wipes, and first aid kits. Even if they weren’t immediately prepared, they could rapidly respond to these kinds of events. At all the events I’ve been to, people will set a table to hand out food and water and hand warmers. It was especially cold today — it wasn’t supposed to get above 0 degrees.

After the officers cleared the scene, everyone convened at the intersection of 26th and Nicolette, just a couple hundred feet from where Alex Pretti was shot. Some community members started a makeshift vigil for him at the location where he was killed. People were spelling his name out with pinecones and starting to leave flowers.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Privacy advocates are worried about the precedent this sets and the potential for abuse.

Privacy advocates are worried about the precedent this sets and the potential for abuse.

The FBI went to Microsoft last year with a warrant, asking them to hand over keys to unlock encrypted data stored on three laptops as part of an investigation into potential fraud involving the COVID unemployment assistance program in Guam — and Microsoft complied.

Typically, companies resist handing over encryption keys to authorities. Most famously, Apple refused to grant the FBI access to a phone used by the San Bernardino shooters in 2016. The FBI eventually found a third-party to hack their way into the phone, but ultimately withdrew its case. Most of the major tech companies, including Google and Facebook backed Apple in its battle with the FBI. Even Microsoft supported Tim Cook’s position, if a bit less forcefully than some others.

In this instance, however, it seems that Microsoft has decided to bow to government demands and confirmed to Forbes that it “does provide BitLocker recovery keys if it receives a valid legal order.” Microsoft spokesperson Charles Chamberlayne told The Verge that Microsoft is legally required to produce the keys stored on its servers.

Chamberlayne ellaborated saying, “customers can choose to store their encryption keys locally, in a location inaccessible to Microsoft, or in Microsoft’s cloud. We recognize that some customers prefer Microsoft’s cloud storage so we can help recover their encryption key if needed. While key recovery offers convenience, it also carries a risk of unwanted access.”

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon countered, telling Forbes that it was “irresponsible” for companies to “secretly turn over users’ encryption keys.”

What alarms privacy advocates like the ACLU is the precedent this sets and the potential for abuse. The current administration and ICE have shown little respect for data security or the rule of law. And beyond American borders, Jennifer Granick, surveillance and cybersecurity counsel at the ACLU, told Forbes that “foreign governments with questionable human rights records” may also expect Microsoft to hand over keys to customer data.

Welcome to the weekend, friends! We’re still in a bit of a deals lull before the Presidents Day and V-Day sales begin, the bulk of which we anticipate kicking off the first week of February. However, for now, we’re still seeing some solid discounts on a few newer gadgets and some old, Verge-approved favorites. Anker’s Nano Travel Adapter has returned to its best price to date, for instance, as has Samsung’s last-gen Frame TV. You’ll also find discounts on microSD Express cards, budget-friendly robot vacuums, and more, so let’s get into it.

If you have plans to spend some time outside of the US this year, Anker’s versatile Nano Travel Adapter is on sale at Amazon in black and white — and directly from Anker with code WS7DV21AXQQZ — for $19.99 ($6 off), matching its lowest price to date.

Anker’s thin, foldable charger measures a mere 0.98 inches thick and sports a pair of USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and a US-style Type A outlet on the front, in addition to four plug types (Type A, C, G, and I). The main drawback, aside from the lack of a voltage converter, is that the maximum power output is 20W (or 15W when sharing power across all four USB ports), meaning you’ll need to bring another adapter if you want to charge a laptop or any other power-hungry device.

It’s been nearly eight months since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 — meaning, if you haven’t already purchased a microSD Express card to level up your storage capacity of your console, you’ll likely need to do so soon. Fortunately, Samsung’s P9 microSD Express card is currently on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with 256GB of storage starting at $39.99 ($15 off), matching its second-best price to date.

As you might expect, P9 is built to handle the Switch 2’s faster storage speeds, with sequential read speeds of up to 800 MB/s, resulting in quicker load and launch times. The Switch 2 features 256GB of internal storage, meaning you’re doubling your storage capacity with a 256GB card, or tripling it in the case of Samsung’s 512GB variant. Most first-party Nintendo games aren’t massive, mind you, but third-party titles like Split Fiction (69GB) and Madden NFL 26 (59GB) can quickly devour dozens of gigabytes. That makes picking up a discounted microSD Express card a no-brainer, especially since they’re also compatible with cameras, drones, and any gadget with a microSD USH-I slot.

I hate to break it to you, but so-called “art TVs” are not exceptional TVs, at least not in a traditional sense. Still, Samsung’s 2025 Frame TV — which is on sale at Woot in its 43-inch configuration starting at $597.99 ($302 off) through January 31st — is likely to look far better in your living room when idle than your typical LCD or OLED TV.

Samsung’s last-gen 4K TV is vastly different than the company’s 2026 panels, either. The slim QLED display can cycle through a small selection of free art pieces when idle, all of which take on a more textured, canvas-like appearance thanks to an anti-glare matte coating that helps curb unwanted reflections. The Frame is plenty good enough for bingeing Slow Horses and Stranger Things, even if the refresh rate is capped at 60Hz, and you still get support for both HDR10 Plus and Dolby Atmos, along with access to all your favorite streaming apps.

DJI’s drones might have been banned in the United States, but you can still pick up some of the company’s other gear stateside (at least for now). Take DJI’s Mic Mini, for instance, which is currently on sale at Amazon with a single mic and two transmitters for $59.99 ($20 off), matching the record-low first set during this time last year.

If you want to capture audio that sounds more professional than your smartphone can deliver on the go, the Mic Mini is a commendable option. The compact, 10-gram wireless microphone plugs directly into your phone via USB-C, Lightning, or a standard 3.5mm audio cable, and it can be clipped to clothing or worn using a magnetic mount or lanyard. The receiver lasts up to 10.5 hours and includes an onboard dial, which lets you fine-tune gain settings and adjust your volume levels. The pair of included transmitters, meanwhile, can run for up to 11.5 hours on a single charge and capture audio from up to about 400 meters away, provided they’re connected simultaneously.

Just don’t expect built-in backup recording or the option to connect a smaller lav mic, neither of which is available on the Mic Mini.

Some Gmail users may have noticed that promotional emails that normally go to their own siloed tab have started flooding their inbox. Reports hit the Google forums and Reddit that messages are bypassing the Updates and Promotional filters and went straight to Gmail inboxes. Some also reported seeing a banner at the top of some messages warning them to “be careful with this message,” explaining that it hasn’t been fully scanned for spam or malware.

Google acknowledged the issue, posting on the Workspace Status Dashboard:

Gmail users might see banners indicating missing spam checks.We are experiencing an issue with Gmail beginning on Saturday, 2026-01-24 05:02 US/Pacific. Users might experience the following banner: “Be careful with this message. Gmail hasn’t scanned this message for spam, unverified senders, or harmful software.”We advise the users to be extra diligent in lieu of missing spam checks. Our engineering team is investigating the issue. We will provide an update by Saturday, 2026-01-24 09:30 with current details.

By the afternoon, reports of problems had started to taper off, and at 8:28PM ET, Google updated the Status Dashboard to say that the issue had been resolved:

The issue with Gmail email classification is resolved as of Saturday, 2026-01-24 09:55 US/Pacific. We will publish an analysis of this incident once we have completed our internal investigation. We thank you for your patience while we worked on resolving the issue.

For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. The big question is: can the obvious risks of using AI for health-related queries be mitigated enough for them to be a net benefit? Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry.

Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy. The move marked a victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead. Read our story about what’s on the horizon.

This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance. Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.

Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.

While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance.

After all, wastewater contains saliva, urine, feces, shed skin, and more. You could consider it a rich biological sample. Wastewater analysis helped scientists understand how covid was spreading during the pandemic. It’s early days, but it is starting to help us get a handle on measles.

Globally, there has been some progress toward eliminating measles, largely thanks to vaccination efforts. Such efforts led to an 88% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that “nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine” since 2000.

Still, an estimated 95,000 people died from measles in 2024 alone—most of them young children. And cases are surging in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Last year, the US saw the highest levels of measles in decades. The country is on track to lose its measles elimination status—a sorry fate that met Canada in November after the country recorded over 5,000 cases in a little over a year.

Public health efforts to contain the spread of measles—which is incredibly contagious—typically involve clinical monitoring in health-care settings, along with vaccination campaigns. But scientists have started looking to wastewater, too.

Along with various bodily fluids, we all shed viruses and bacteria into wastewater, whether that’s through brushing our teeth, showering, or using the toilet. The idea of looking for these pathogens in wastewater to track diseases has been around for a while, but things really kicked into gear during the covid-19 pandemic, when scientists found that the coronavirus responsible for the disease was shed in feces.

This led Marlene Wolfe of Emory University and Alexandria Boehm of Stanford University to establish WastewaterSCAN, an academic-led program developed to analyze wastewater samples across the US. Covid was just the beginning, says Wolfe. “Over the years we have worked to expand what can be monitored,” she says.

Two years ago, for a previous edition of the Checkup, Wolfe told Cassandra Willyard that wastewater surveillance of measles was “absolutely possible,” as the virus is shed in urine. The hope was that this approach could shed light on measles outbreaks in a community, even if members of that community weren’t able to access health care and receive an official diagnosis. And that it could highlight when and where public health officials needed to act to prevent measles from spreading. Evidence that it worked as an effective public health measure was, at the time, scant.

Since then, she and her colleagues have developed a test to identify measles RNA. They trialed it at two wastewater treatment plants in Texas between December 2024 and May 2025. At each site, the team collected samples two or three times a week and tested them for measles RNA.

Over that period, the team found measles RNA in 10.5% of the samples they collected, as reported in a preprint paper published at medRxiv in July and currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal. The first detection came a week before the first case of measles was officially confirmed in the area. That’s promising—it suggests that wastewater surveillance might pick up measles cases early, giving public health officials a head start in efforts to limit any outbreaks.

There are more promising results from a team in Canada. Mike McKay and Ryland Corchis-Scott at the University of Windsor in Ontario and their colleagues have also been testing wastewater samples for measles RNA. Between February and November 2025, the team collected samples from a wastewater treatment facility serving over 30,000 people in Leamington, Ontario.

These wastewater tests are somewhat limited—even if they do pick up measles, they won’t tell you who has measles, where exactly infections are occurring, or even how many people are infected. McKay and his colleagues have begun to make some progress here. In addition to monitoring the large wastewater plant, the team used tampons to soak up wastewater from a hospital lateral sewer.

They then compared their measles test results with the number of clinical cases in that hospital. This gave them some idea of the virus’s “shedding rate.” When they applied this to the data collected from the Leamington wastewater treatment facility, the team got estimates of measles cases that were much higher than the figures officially reported.

Their findings track with the opinions of local health officials (who estimate that the true number of cases during the outbreak was around five to 10 times higher than the confirmed case count), the team members wrote in a paper published on medRxiv a couple of weeks ago.

There will always be limits to wastewater surveillance. “We’re looking at the pool of waste of an entire community, so it’s very hard to pull in information about individual infections,” says Corchis-Scott.

Wolfe also acknowledges that “we have a lot to learn about how we can best use the tools so they are useful.” But her team at WastewaterSCAN has been testing wastewater across the US for measles since May last year. And their findings are published online and shared with public health officials.

In some cases, the findings are already helping inform the response to measles. “We’ve seen public health departments act on this data,” says Wolfe. Some have issued alerts, or increased vaccination efforts in those areas, for example. “[We’re at] a point now where we really see public health departments, clinicians, [and] families using that information to help keep themselves and their communities safe,” she says.

McKay says his team has stopped testing for measles because the Ontario outbreak “has been declared over.” He says testing would restart if and when a single new case of measles is confirmed in the region, but he also thinks that his research makes a strong case for maintaining a wastewater surveillance system for measles.

McKay wonders if this approach might help Canada regain its measles elimination status. “It’s sort of like [we’re] a pariah now,” he says. If his approach can help limit measles outbreaks, it could be “a nice tool for public health in Canada to [show] we’ve got our act together.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.

Though ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives.

Some doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety [and] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”

The release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance.

But those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.

Pinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.

Sirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.

A different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.

For people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.

Since Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.

Some studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.

OpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.

An LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.

Even if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.

Lederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.”

It’s supposed to be frigid in Davos this time of year. Part of the charm is seeing the world’s elite tromp through the streets in respectable suits and snow boots. But this year it’s positively balmy, with highs in the mid 30s, or a little over 1°C. The current conditions when I flew out of New York were colder, and definitely snowier. I’m told this is due to something called a föhn, a dry warm wind that’s been blowing across the Alps.

I’m no meteorologist, but it’s true that there is a lot of hot air here.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump arrived in Davos to address the assembly, and held forth for more than 90 minutes, weaving his way through remarks about the economy, Greenland, windmills, Switzerland, Rolexes, Venezuela, and drug prices. It was a talk lousy with gripes, grievances and outright falsehoods.

One small example: Trump made a big deal of claiming that China, despite being the world leader in manufacturing windmill componentry, doesn’t actually use them for energy generation itself. In fact, it is the world leader in generation, as well.

I did not get to watch this spectacle from the room itself. Sad!

By the time I got to the Congress Hall where the address was taking place, there was already a massive scrum of people jostling to get in.

I had just wrapped up moderating a panel on “the intelligent co-worker,” ie: AI agents in the workplace. I was really excited for this one as the speakers represented a diverse cross-section of the AI ecosystem. Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG had the macro strategic view; Enrique Lores, HP CEO, could speak to both hardware and large enterprises, Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh has the inside view on workforce training and transformation, Manjul Shah CEO of Hippocratic AI addressed working in the high stakes field of healthcare, and Kate Kallot CEO of Amini AI gave perspective on the global south and Africa in particular.

Interestingly, most of the panel shied away from using the term co-worker, and some even rejected the term agent. But the view they painted was definitely one of humans working alongside AI and augmenting what’s possible. Shah, for example, talked about having agents call 16,000 people in Texas during a heat wave to perform a health and safety check. It was a great discussion. You can watch the whole thing here.

But by the time it let out, the push of people outside the Congress Hall was already too thick for me to get in. In fact I couldn’t even get into a nearby overflow room. I did make it into a third overflow room, but getting in meant navigating my way through a mass of people, so jammed in tight together that it reminded me of being at a Turnstile concert.

The speech blew way past its allotted time, and I had to step out early to get to yet another discussion. Walking through the halls while Trump spoke was a truly surreal experience. He had truly captured the attention of the gathered global elite. I don’t think I saw a single person not starting at a laptop, or phone or iPad, all watching the same video.

Trump is speaking again on Thursday in a previously unscheduled address to announce his Board of Peace. As is (I heard) Elon Musk. So it’s shaping up to be another big day for elite attention capture.

I should say, though, there are elites, and then there are elites. And there are all sorts of ways of sorting out who is who. Your badge color is one of them. I have a white participant badge, because I was moderating panels. This gets you in pretty much anywhere and therefore is its own sort of status symbol. Where you are staying is another. I’m in Klosters, a neighboring town that’s a 40 minute train ride away from the Congress Centre. Not so elite.

There are more subtle ways of status sorting, too. Yesterday I learned that when people ask if this is your first time at Davos, it’s sometimes meant as a way of trying to figure out how important you are. If you’re any kind of big deal, you’ve probably been coming for years.

But the best one I’ve yet encountered happened when I made small talk with the woman sitting next to me as I changed back into my snow boots. It turned out that, like me, she lived in California–at least part time. “But I don’t think I’ll stay there much longer,” she said, “due to the new tax law.” This was just an ice cold flex.

Because California’s newly proposed tax legislation? It only targets billionaires.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. Read the full interview.

In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now. The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid.

Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again. What happens next could have big implications for mining and battery technology. Read the full story. This story first appeared in The Spark, our newsletter all about the tech we can use to combat the climate crisis. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Wednesday.

Cement hides in plain sight—it’s used to build everything from roads and buildings to dams and basement floors. But it’s also a climate threat. Cement production accounts for more than 7% of global carbon dioxide emissions—more than sectors like aviation, shipping, or landfills.

One solution to this climate catastrophe might be coursing through the pipes at Sublime Systems. The startup is developing an entirely new way to make cement. Instead of heating crushed-up rocks in lava-hot kilns, Sublime’s technology zaps them in water with electricity, kicking off chemical reactions that form the main ingredients in its cement.

But it faces huge challenges: competing with established industry players, and persuading builders to use its materials in the first place. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amsterdam-based hospitality tech platform Mews has raised €255 million (about $300 million) in a Series D funding round as it pushes deeper into automation and AI-powered workflows for hotels around the world.

The round was led by EQT Growth with new participation from Atomico and HarbourVest Partners, alongside existing backers including Kinnevik, Battery Ventures and Tiger Global. The investment values the company at roughly $2.5 billion.

Founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr and Matt Welle, Mews builds a cloud-native “operating system” for hotels  software that ties together reservations, check-ins, housekeeping, payments and more in one platform.

Its technology is designed to replace legacy systems that many hotels still rely on, offering a more flexible, connected way to manage day-to-day operations.

The new funding will be used to expand the company’s AI and automation capabilities at the core of its product.

That includes embedding agent-driven systems that can take on complex routine tasks, reduce manual work for staff and streamline how hotels handle everything from guest interactions to revenue management.

Mews says its platform already supports more than 15,000 properties in 85 countries, and in 2025 it processed nearly 42.3 million check-ins and handled nearly $20 billion in transaction volume.

The software also helped generate over $500 million in additional revenue for hoteliers through features like its Mews Spaces module.

In a statement, CEO Matt Welle said the new capital will help Mews build an operating system that handles operational complexity so hotel teams can focus on guest experience rather than juggling disparate tools.

“We are engineering an operating system that is changing how hoteliers interact with their guests,” CEO Matt Welle said, adding that the goal is to lighten the cognitive load on staff and make everyday operations smoother.

Industry observers say the round is one of the largest ever in hospitality software and reflects broader investor interest in infrastructure-level platforms that bring AI and fintech together for real-world business operations.

As hotels embrace digital transformation, technology that can automate workflows and personalise guest experiences  without adding complexity is increasingly in demand.

For Mews, the challenge now is execution: turning generous funding into tangible upgrades that deliver value for hoteliers of all sizes.

But with strong adoption, a global footprint and a growing suite of automation tools, the company is positioning itself as a central technology partner at a time when hotels are looking to modernise their operations and enhance guest satisfaction.

            <h2>How Flippa Is Removing the Language Barrier from Global Deal-Making</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-flippa-is-removing-the-language-barrier-from-global-deal-making">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, access to high-quality deal flow and sophisticated M&A infrastructure has been largely designed for well-connected investors and industry giants. Small businesses and independent founders, particularly those operating outside English-speaking markets, may often find the barriers even higher. Language, geography, and limited access to networks could mean that opportunity stops at the border.

Amidst this trend, Flippa, a platform for buying and selling digital businesses, is rewriting the script and dismantling those barriers. Under the leadership of CEO Blake Hutchison, the company has connected buyers and sellers across continents, linguistic differences, and price points, closing deals from $100,000 up to $10 million. Now, with the launch of its AI-powered multi-language Deal Room, Flippa is addressing what it sees as one of the last major points of disadvantage in global business deals and M&A, calling it the “Language Tax.”

Founded in 2009, Flippa has grown into a global marketplace where entrepreneurs can buy and sell digital assets ranging from e-commerce stores and SaaS businesses to YouTube channels, online communities, and mobile applications. According to Hutchison, the platform supports users from 189 countries, attracting over 450,000 new buyers in the last two years alone. “Our internal data shows that cross-border transactions now account for approximately 85% of all deals completed on the platform,” Hutchison says. “That growth has been especially pronounced in Europe. As a highly fragmented market with high cross-border trade volume but multiple operating languages, I believe Europe often faces structural friction in cross-border dealmaking.”

He notes that European businesses are increasingly being acquired by international buyers, with US-based acquirers representing a significant share of demand. Yet, as deal volumes continue to decline, Hutchison believes that language barriers have historically slowed or derailed otherwise viable transactions.

The company’s new multi-language Deal Room is designed to remove that friction entirely. Within the Deal Room, Hutchison notes that buyers and sellers can now negotiate and transact in their preferred languages. “For example, a French seller can communicate in French with an Italian or English-speaking buyer, who receives the message instantly translated into their own language,” he says, explaining how replies can be translated back in real time, while preserving the original message for verification and clarity.

Hutchison states, “Our goal is to make deal-making as efficient and approachable as possible. Whether you are a SaaS founder in Paris or an e-commerce operator in Berlin, you should be able to negotiate your exit in the language of your choice.”

Alongside the Deal Room translation tool, Flippa has also launched a fully localized French version of its platform, with Spanish scheduled to follow shortly. The expansion reflects the user demand and the reality that French and Spanish are not only widely spoken across Europe, but globally. Spanish is spoken by 550 million people globally, and is spoken widely across the US and Brazil. Similarly, French, being the 5th most widely spoken language in the world, has 321 million speakers, with 61.8% of those speakers living in parts of North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, significantly extending the global reach of European-founded businesses.

According to Hutchison, this shift comes as Europe’s M&A market continues to rise again, with an estimated USD412 billion in deal value, with mid-market and digital-first businesses representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Flippa’s role, according to Hutchison, has been to create infrastructure for businesses to source deals with greater reach than elite investment banks, but with a fraction of the cost.

“We often describe Flippa as the investment bank for the 99%,” Hutchison says. “The difference now is that geography and language no longer define who gets access. The demand for cross-border deals was already there. The technology simply needed to catch up.”

Flippa continues to integrate AI-driven discovery, valuation, and outreach tools through its proprietary LaurenAI engine. “The model is trained on more than 200,000 historical listings and transactions,” he explains. “The system then helps buyers identify opportunities, estimate enterprise value, and initiate conversations at scale.” It autonomously indexes the web to identify businesses across SaaS, e-commerce, apps, publishing, and next-generation media.

Human expertise remains embedded in the process, with certified brokers and M&A professionals supporting transactions once a match is made. As Hutchison puts it, “LaurenAI gives people the ability to access off-market deals and build pipelines the same way Wall Street players do, but without the barriers of capital or connections.”

He notes that entrepreneurs who may not feel confident negotiating complex deal terms in English can now access global liquidity without intermediaries or external advisors. At the same time, international buyers can gain visibility into high-quality European businesses that were previously difficult to source or engage.

As digital entrepreneurship continues to globalize, Flippa is positioning itself at the center of a more inclusive M&A ecosystem, one where language is no longer a tax on ambition and opportunities. Flippa’s multi-language Deal Room represents a structural shift in how global deal-making can be done. For founders and buyers alike, it signals a future where the next meaningful transaction can begin in any language, from anywhere in the world.

            <h2>French fintech Pennylane raises €175M</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/french-fintech-pennylane-raises-e175m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-based fintech Pennylane has just pulled off one of Europe’s most noteworthy funding rounds of the year, announcing €175 million in new capital to accelerate its push into artificial intelligence and expand its footprint across the continent. 
The round was led by growth investor TCV, with participation from Blackstone Growth and a group of existing backers that includes Sequoia Capital, DST Global, CapitalG and Meritech Capital.

What makes this raise stand out isn’t just the size of the cheque, though €175 million is hard to ignore in a selective funding market, but the strategic timing and purpose behind it. Pennylane says it didn’t need the capital to survive; it chose to raise now to double down on AI product development and prepare for a phase of market consolidation in European financial software.

Since its founding in 2020, Pennylane has positioned itself as more than just an accounting tool. It has built what it calls a financial operating system for small and mid-sized businesses and the accountants who serve them, bringing invoicing, payments, bookkeeping, and cash-flow management into a shared platform.

That unified approach taps a persistent pain point in Europe’s SME economy, where many companies still stitch together separate systems to manage their finances.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The new funds will support expanded R&D, particularly in generative AI, with early efforts already focused on building intelligent assistants that help accountants interpret data, automate routine bookkeeping, and deliver richer insights to their clients.

The company is also gearing up for regulatory shifts, including electronic invoicing mandates rolling out across several EU countries and refining localisation for key markets like Germany.

Pennylane’s latest round reportedly values the company at about $4.25 billion (€3.6 billion), reinforcing its unicorn status and standing among Europe’s higher-valued fintech startups. That valuation reflects both investor confidence and the company’s growing footprint: Pennylane is used by thousands of accounting firms and hundreds of thousands of businesses across several European markets.

This deal also underscores a broader trend in European tech: AI is moving beyond buzzy chatbots and large language models into critical business infrastructure.

Fintech tools, compliance software, and productivity platforms are increasingly weaving machine learning and automation into once manual workflows. For accountants juggling multiple clients in different jurisdictions, AI isn’t a luxury; it’s a practical way to keep up with regulatory complexity and expectations for real-time financial insights.

Strategically, Pennylane’s timing matters. European financial software is under pressure to modernise rapidly as digital tax reporting and e-invoicing standards become the norm rather than the exception.

By raising capital now, even without immediate pressure,  Pennylane is planting a flag as these shifts accelerate. The presence of heavyweight global investors like TCV and Blackstone signals that international capital still sees promise in Europe’s SaaS and AI stack.

But there’s a deeper dynamic at play. In Europe, fintech innovation often means balancing diversification with consolidation. Investors backing Pennylane now are betting that the company can serve as a common platform for both accountants and SMEs across borders, a role that gets harder as local regulatory regimes and market expectations diverge.

Generative AI, if deployed thoughtfully, could be what ties all those variations together, letting the platform adapt to local tax rules or reporting needs without keeping teams chained to repetitive work.

From Berlin to Barcelona, founders and investors alike are watching to see whether this latest bet on AI financial tooling pays off. In a funding landscape where some sectors have tightened, and valuations have been scrutinised, Pennylane’s ability to attract major global backers while maintaining founder control and avoiding unnecessary dilution signals that Europe’s fintech scene still has room to grow.

For businesses and accountants alike, the surge in capital behind AI-first tools could translate into more seamless workflows, smarter insights, and faster decision-making.

And if Pennylane’s vision plays out, it might not just be a win for one French unicorn, but a sign that European software can innovate too, not by mimicking Silicon Valley, but by solving problems that are uniquely local, and increasingly global.

            <div id="article-text">In October 2021, the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn interpreted the first movement of Beethoven’s 10th unfinished symphony, which was completed with the use of artificial intelligence.

A team of computer scientists, music historians, musicologists, and composers developed the ‘Beethoven AI’ to analyze Beethoven’s music style and life, using the sketches he left behind of the 10th symphony, plus works from other composers that had a notable influence on his life, such as Johann Sebastian Bach, to generate pieces that reflect what he would have composed.

Beethoven AI, as others AI composition programs, produces music in the same way ChatGPT produces outcomes. It uses machine learning and algorithms to analyse musical data and patterns, and generative models to produce music based on inputted prompts.

Hence, the AI tool was trained by the team of experts and provided with all the necessary information for it to understand, be contextualized, and finally, be able to create something that Beethoven himself could have written.

This milestone raises an important question that becomes more relevant day by day: as technology becomes increasingly capable of initiating creativity, what remains distinctly human in the classical music world?

Can AI replace the sensitivity and humanity needed to compose, interpret, convey the emotions, or communicate the composer’s intended message?

Classical music has historically been a niche domain. It was born in the house of Jesus as the natural successor after choral music.

Whatsoever, only the most privileged ones, those of noble background or family with ties to music, could dedicate their lives to the study of an instrument or composition, and only those part of the aristocracy had the privilege to enjoy it.

Over time and thanks to globalization and the massive spread of information, classical music has expanded, allowing millions of people around the world to be delighted by it.

Digital platforms like Spotify and YouTube offer all audiences the opportunity to access an immense variety of compositions and recordings across history, democratizing classical music.

Simultaneously, social media allows traditional or innovative artists to showcase their interpretation of it, whether it is a classical performance of Campanella by Paganini or a modern version of The Four Seasons by Vivaldi, played as a trap variation.

The introduction of modern technologies has represented an opportunity for the classical music industry to find innovative ways to remain relevant in a fast-paced world.

The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has launched a digital concert hall, a streaming platform for users to access multiple recordings and content on demand. Similarly, the Philharmonia Orchestra uses Virtual Reality to create an immersive experience, allowing the audience to enjoy the concerts onstage, among the players.

However, the new technologies also symbolize a challenge and introduce concerns about the future of human creativity for the creative industries, including the classical music world.

AyseDeniz Gokcin, a Turkish pianist, uses AI to arrange pieces from iconic composers, adapting them to modern trends or to what they might have produced if they lived today, which risks displacing contemporary composers trying to establish their own voices.

From a symphony finished with AI, to the experience of listening to an orchestra being onstage with them, or to have the possibility of listening to your favorite composer in a modern, personalized style, technology brings clear advantages to the classical music industry.

A study in ‘Music Composition with AI’ made by the World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews (WJARR) highlights how AI technologies can improve efficiency and accessibility, preserve and enhance historical pieces, and unlock new possibilities for innovation in performance and education. Y

et, it also challenges the role of human artistry and raises concerns about the lack of emotional depth, ethical and legal issues, and the livelihoods of today’s musicians and composers.

AI can be a powerful tool and ally for those who are willing to work with it as an extension of human creativity and as a means to explore new ways of expressing themselves.

While those who see it as a threat can focus on seeing AI as a digital instrument that will never replace the touch of mankind, since it depends on artists to create, replicate, and generate outcomes.

Lastly, it is on us, creators and audiences, to make a conscious choice in how we use new technologies and to preserve humanity in a rapidly evolving world.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Europe races into the AI era, its policymakers are laying new pipes for the continent’s digital future. The European Commission’s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) promises to rewire the EU’s telecom landscape, with big implications for artificial intelligence infrastructure, connectivity equity, and the startup ecosystem.

Exposed as part of a broader push to make Europe “fit for the Digital Age,” the draft law aims to modernize how networks are built and regulated, from 5G towers in rural villages to fiber links between data centers.

I have to say it’s a bold vision of a more connected, innovative Europe, but one that must navigate a thicket of competing interests and unanswered questions.

For years, EU leaders have urged the creation of a true single market for digital services. The DNA is a centerpiece of that strategy, aligning with Europe’s Digital Decade goals for universal high-speed internet by 2030.

How can we translate this? Well, I think Brussels wants to turn the patchwork of 27 national telecom systems into one seamless network. The Act’s core objective is to “harmonise the EU connectivity sector by addressing delays, inconsistencies, and fragmentation”, removing barriers to cross-border operations and stimulating investment in very high-capacity networks.

This mirrors the logic behind earlier EU tech regulations;  just as the Digital Markets Act tackled Big Tech gatekeepers, the Digital Networks Act targets the digital plumbing beneath them.

This reform doesn’t come out of the blue.

A Commission white paper in 2024 warned that without cutting-edge digital infrastructure, Europe’s digital economy would stall. It painted vivid scenarios: doctors unable to perform remote surgery, smart farms and self-driving cars hamstrung by slow connections.

Secure and sustainable networks are one of the “cardinal points” of the EU’s 2030 digital agenda.

The DNA is Brussels’ attempt to meet those needs by boosting investment, standardizing rules, and making sure that every corner of Europe can plug into the opportunities of the digital age.

At its core, the Act hands telecom operators some long-sought gifts. One headline measure would grant carriers unlimited radio-spectrum licenses, ending the era of auctions that force telcos to periodically renew their rights.

For Europe’s big mobile providers, this change offers certainty: they can invest in 5G and future 6G networks without fearing their spectrum will expire.

Regulators argue this will “increase investment predictability” and accelerate network roll-out.

In theory, more cell towers could now reach remote areas, and companies might more freely trade or lease unused frequencies to new players.

The DNA couples permanent licenses with “use-it-or-share-it” obligations to prevent hoarding. If an incumbent isn’t using its spectrum in, say, a rural region, it could be forced to share it or lose it,  allowing a competitor or community network to serve that area.

It’s a nod to connectivity equity: Europe doesn’t want scarce wireless spectrum lying fallow while some communities remain underserved.

Broadband for all is the mantra, and long license tenures will come with accountability to deliver on coverage.

Another provision tightens the oversight of dominant firms. Under current plans, if a telecom operator holds significant market power (SMP) in one market (for example, fixed broadband), regulators could extend that designation to a closely related market (like mobile services).

In practice, this means big incumbents might face extra obligations, from transparency to price controls, across their range of services. The idea is to prevent giants from leveraging their dominance in one domain to squelch competition in another.

That could open space for smaller internet providers or innovative ISPs to compete, a boon for consumer choice and startup entrants.

A cohort of six member states,  including France, Germany and Italy, has pushed back, urging Brussels not to centralize control over frequencies and mergers.

Spectrum auctions have long been jealously guarded as national turf (they can fill state coffers, after all), and capitals are wary of one-size-fits-all rules emanating from the EU.

These governments also worry that encouraging pan-European telecom mergers (another idea floated in the reform) could reduce competition at home. In their joint memo, they caution that while a level playing field between telecoms and tech firms is a laudable goal, “this does not necessarily imply the same regulations should apply”to both sectors.

It’s a reminder that the DNA, for all its single-market ideals, must reckon with political realities: Europe’s telecom revolution won’t happen without consensus among very different national markets.

Perhaps the most contentious debate surrounding the Digital Networks Act has been over who pays for the next-generation networks. Telecom giants have spent years lobbying for a “fair share” contribution from Big Tech, arguing that bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix, YouTube, and cloud platforms should chip in to finance the infrastructure that carries their content.

The draft Act steers clear of any direct “network usage fee” on content providers. Instead, it reaffirms Europe’s commitment to net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic must be treated equally by providers.

Any cooperation with Big Tech will rely on voluntary “best practice” discussions moderated by EU regulators, not on legally mandated payments.

This decision followed intense pushback from many sides. Over the summer, consumer groups and tech industry alliances publicly warned against reviving the “fair share” idea under any guise, noting it had been “clearly rejected in previous consultations” for threatening consumers, competition and innovation.

Even a U.S.–EU trade agreement in late 2025 extracted a pledge from Brussels “not [to] adopt or maintain network usage fees”, highlighting the geopolitical stakes of singling out mostly American tech firms.

On the other hand, startups and digital rights advocates breathed a sigh of relief at the Commission’s stance. Allied for Startups, a coalition of European entrepreneurs, argued that net neutrality is essential for startup growth, preventing a two-tier internet that would “favour dominant players” and raise barriers for newcomers.

In their view, a “traffic tax” isn’t just about Google or Amazon’s bottom line, it would set a harmful precedent that could box out the little guys who rely on affordable, equal-access bandwidth to innovate.

By keeping the DNA free of explicit network fees, Europe is signaling that the open internet won’t be collateral damage in the drive for better infrastructure.

Beyond telecom boardrooms and Silicon Valley balance sheets, the Digital Networks Act is ultimately about the kind of digital society Europe wants to build.

A major motivation is preparing for a future where artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT devices are ubiquitous, and will demand unprecedented bandwidth and low latency.

The Commission’s own analysis stresses that only with the “highest performance” networks will transformative technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, remote health care, and smart grids reach their potential.

In simple terms: if data is the new oil, Europe needs better pipes to pump it.

The Digital Networks Act sits alongside Europe’s broader tech push by focusing on the infrastructure AI needs to scale. Beyond regulating AI, the EU is investing in next-generation networks, from fiber to 5G and 6G, through initiatives such as the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.

Faster rollout of these networks would underpin everything from AI-driven industry to cloud services, all of which depend on high-capacity, cross-border connectivity.

The Act also addresses connectivity equity. While Europe’s digital goals assume universal gigabit access and widespread 5G, large parts of the continent still lag behind.

The proposal combines simpler deployment rules with tougher coverage obligations, while allowing flexibility where older networks cannot yet be switched off. The aim is to expand access without letting rigid deadlines slow progress.

Whether this works will depend on execution. Investment still favors dense urban markets, and rural coverage remains a challenge. If the Act can meaningfully lift fiber and 5G reach across Europe, it could help ensure the AI economy extends beyond major tech hubs to the rest of the continent.

From the perspective of Europe’s startups and innovators, the DNA is a double-edged sword that tilts promisingly toward opportunity. On one side, the Act’s push to harmonize telecom rules could tear down barriers that have long frustrated young companies.

Today, a cloud services startup or an IoT device maker in Europe must navigate a maze of national regulations when scaling up, from differing network standards to separate certification hoops in each country.

By creating a more unified framework (for instance, common rules on spectrum and infrastructure access), the DNA could make it easier for a startup in Portugal to expand its services to Poland or Finland without running into 27 different regulatory roadblocks.

Startups rely on an open and predictable internet, and on this front the Commission’s approach offers some reassurance. By preserving net neutrality and rejecting new network tolls, the Act allows young companies to reach users on equal terms, without the risk that deeper-pocketed rivals can buy preferential treatment.

For small fintech or AI startups, avoiding additional network costs matters, and under the current proposal they won’t be asked to shoulder them.

At the same time, founders are reading the fine print carefully. Proposals around a “level playing field” raise concerns that telecom-style regulation could spill over onto digital services, including smaller platforms.

The balance remains fragile: regulate too little and dominant players squeeze out challengers; regulate too broadly and compliance costs can smother the next generation of European tech companies.

As an ambitious blueprint for Europe’s digital infrastructure, the Digital Networks Act embodies a careful balancing act. It must entice telecom operators to spend the billions needed to upgrade networks for an AI-driven future, yet not at the expense of the open internet or new challengers.

It seeks to unify Europe’s connectivity market while respecting that one size may not fit all in a Union of 27. In the coming months, EU lawmakers and member states will debate and tweak the proposal, and the stakes are high.

The outcome will shape not just who foots the bill for Europe’s next-gen networks, but also who can innovate on those networks in the years ahead.

There will be bumps on this road, resistance from powerful telecom lobbies, wrangling between capitals and Brussels, and possibly even transatlantic frictions.

In the end, the Digital Networks Act is about Europe’s place in the digital world. A continent that pioneered GSM mobile standards and championed data privacy now wants to set the standard for equitable, innovation-friendly networks.

Striking a balance between investment and fairness, between scale and competition, won’t be easy. But it’s essential. If the EU succeeds, the reward could be a resilient digital backbone capable of supporting AI breakthroughs and economic growth across all its regions, without leaving its core values behind.

If it stumbles, Europe risks buffering on the sidelines while others surge ahead.

The coming debate will reveal whether Europe can indeed reshape its digital DNA for the better, or if old divides will slow down this grand connectivity project.

Either way, the world will be watching the EU’s next move in this high-stakes telecom reboot.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/berlins-cloover-secures-over-1-2-billion-to-build-the-shopify-of-energy">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.
