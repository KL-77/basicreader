            <div id="article-text">A decade is a long time for a TV series; no single iteration of Star Trek has made it that far.

But “a Star Trek podcast by two guys just a little bit embarrassed to have a Star Trek podcast” has now passed the milestone. January 25, 2026, marks a full decade since The Greatest Generation, my favorite podcast, debuted. Like a bottle of Château Picard, the show has only improved with age. (I interviewed the guys behind the show back in 2016 when they were just getting started.)

The podcast helped me rediscover, and appreciate more fully, Star Trek: The Next Generation—which is also my favorite TV show. The Greatest Generation continues to delight with its irreverent humor, its celebration of the most minor of characters, and its technical fascination with how a given episode was made.

Over the last decade, hosts Ben Harrison and Adam Pranica have both moved to Los Angeles and become full-time podcasters. They have completed an episode-by-episode recap of all of The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager, and they’re now nearing the end of Enterprise. When finished, they’re threatening/promising to start over again.

The podcast has spawned its own (sometimes NSFW!) lexicon (a “friend of DeSoto” means a listener to and fan of The Greatest Generation), its own recurring and hilarious segments (“Drunk Shimoda,” “Bad Bit Moment,” and “Polo? Polo? Or Pollo?”), and most importantly, its own delightful fandom. It’s the coolest and dorkiest secret club that I will ever be a part of.

In 2016, the podcast was folded into the Maximum Fun organization. Harrison and Pranica formed their own company, Uxbridge-Shimoda LLC, that takes its name from two obscure TNG-era characters.

Like the original Star Trek, the podcast even spawned its own 2017 spinoff—now called The Greatest Trek—entirely devoted to the newer series in the Star Trek universe.

Harrison and Pranica also produce two irregularly released, members-only podcasts called Santa Monica Mountains (about the 1980s and 1990s TV show Baywatch) and Factory Seconds (where they eat at various Cheesecake Factory restaurants). Last year, they also started—in conjunction with YouTube cooking star Adam Ragusea—yet another podcast, called Wholesome, which is only available to Patreon subscribers.

In a world replete with chaos and awfulness, I’m just here for the hang.

(This interview, which was conducted earlier this month, has been lightly edited for clarity and flow.)

Ars: When I first spoke to you guys back in 2016, Adam was living in Seattle. Ben, I believe you were living in New York. You guys were still working in film production. As best as I could tell, this was just a fun little side project. Who knew how long it would run?

Ben: I think that us talking to you has a lot to do with it taking over our lives.

Ars: Sorry, not sorry? I don’t know! [laughs]

Adam: Your Ars article was one of the reasons we catapulted into the sort of audience we got afterward. It’s an audience that has meant we’ve been able to do the show professionally for 10 years.

Ben: Yeah. And when we meet people—all the time—people will say: “Oh, I’ve been listening to you guys since the beginning. Like, I was on at episode five because of that Ars Technica article.”

Ars: Do you feel like you are over it? It’s been a decade now. Is Greatest Gen as we know it going to continue?

Adam: I think the thing that’s changed is that in the beginning, it felt like a fun hobby. But when you professionalize a thing and you hire employees and you are depended on for the thing that you make in a way that you’ve never been before, it’s serious business.

This is the best job I’ve ever had, but it’s also the most seriously I’ve ever taken a job because it means so much to our well-being, but also the folks who appreciate what we do.

Ben: Yeah, one thing that Adam has said many times is we’re going to die in these chairs.

And I think also, as we come toward the end of Enterprise and have sort of run out of the well of Old Trek, as it were, I have been thinking about [what] if I hadn’t had this show? I would still be about ready to start my next TNG rewatch.

Loving Star Trek is a lot about watching it over again, you know? In the same way that I’ll put on an old rerun of The Simpsons or Seinfeld. And I love rewatching those shows. I love rewatching Star Trek.

I think Adam and I have grown as both a comedy duo but also as observers of Star Trek and what it means on an ongoing basis. So I feel like it would be unfair for us not to go back and start painting the bridge from the beginning.

Adam: I think one of the things that we’ve learned from doing the show, especially live in front of people, is that we are told by the people who enjoy this show that it’s about Star Trek, sure, but that’s not the thing that people love the most about the show.

And I think that’s what makes a return to the beginning of it make so much sense in the way Ben’s describing. It’s about the hang and your life as it relates to a Star Trek rerun that you’re watching in that moment.

Ars: I have watched zero minutes of Baywatch in my life. But I have listened to every single episode of the Santa Monica Mountains. I enjoy hearing you guys talk about it.

I think you’ve hit on a format: “Let’s talk about a thing in the way that we like to talk about it and make jokes in the way that we like to make jokes about it.” Which for me really resonates more than the format of a podcast that’s like: “Let’s get comedians to talk about a thing.”

Adam: Or let’s get celebrities in a room to talk about anything and have that be good enough.

Ben: The format that our shows tend to follow is something that I think just kind of was an emergent property of the way Adam and I talked to each other, much more so than it was us attempting to create a show that was our version of anything else.

I don’t really listen to other recap podcasts. It’s kind of a funny thing, but we weren’t really inspired by any recap podcasts in particular. I guess the Flop House a little bit for me, but what they do is so different and such its own thing.

It’s hard to feel like we are connected to the universe of recap podcasts. Like when we go to add our show to a podcast service like iTunes or Apple Podcasts, you have to pick the category that you’re going to be in, and we’ve always picked comedy.

Properly, I guess we probably would be in the television recap podcast section. We just never really thought of ourselves as being that. We were just doing what we wanted to do.

You know, we’re just making a show that makes us laugh. Making each other laugh has always been the primary goal of the show.  So it’s very funny to me that we’re in a category that we’ve never really aspired to be in or compared ourselves to in any way.

Ars: Any favorite moments, perhaps at live shows, that have happened to you over the last 10 years?

Ben: Getting to do live shows at all has been a total shock to me. When we talked to you for that first article, we barely knew what we were doing as entertainers. And I’ve taken improv classes and stuff but never really had any personal aspirations to be someone who gets up on a stage and does something. And I found that I fucking love it!

I really love doing the show in front of an audience! And we just have had so many amazing adventures getting to go all over the country doing that.

And all over the world—we’ve done the show in Canada and London now. That was a total surprise to me.

Like, if you grabbed me on the street 15 years ago and said, “Hey, you’re going to have a show that you get to travel around and do in front of audiences of 300 people someday!” I would have said, “Get the hell out of here! That’s not possible. That’s not something I am working toward in any way.”

Adam: There’s an unexpected quality to the type of—I mean, barf, right? I’m going to say the word “celebrity.” But David Letterman said that when you achieve a certain amount of notoriety, the world becomes a neighborhood to you.

A week ago, I was at a bar with friends, and a stranger came up and told me that they really like our show and they thanked me for making it. And that is something that happens in my life in a way that I never could have anticipated at all.

It’s those little moments that you have with people. Those perfect interactions where it’s just like: “I like what you do and thanks for doing it.”

That makes my life seem meaningful in a way that any previous job did not create the conditions for, you know? You do the work and you think it matters and it’s important, and largely it is in its own way, in its own ecosystem.

But to have a broad interest from folks in what you do and that it matters to them and what they do in their lives? That’s the very best part of this entire thing: knowing that the times that I can make Ben laugh are also the times that I can make 500 people laugh in a room or 25,000 people laugh on a Monday when the episode drops, you know?

That’s really powerful stuff! And it keeps me on my best behavior when I’m out in public in case an FOD is out there watching what I’m doing.

Ben: Oh, yeah. You don’t want to see all the videos of Adam on Worldstar.

Ars: You try really hard to make the show sound great, which it does. It is well-engineered. It is well mixed. You guys put a lot of care into the production of the show.

But also, to my knowledge, you have never missed a show’s publish date. I’m curious about how you balance all of that with whatever else is going on in your lives. Ben, you have two young kids. I know Adam has martinis to drink and golf to play.

Ben: I think the best thing that has happened to us as a duo over the years has been all of the people who have been here to help us along the way.

You know, for a while, we were working with a producer named Rob Schulte, who was really great. And we’re now very fortunate to have a full-time producer named Wynde Priddy, who is so good at anticipating things that are coming up and keeping our minds on what we need to be prepping for the future. And also taking all of the stuff off of our plate that involves the day-in, day-out of editing and producing the shows.

So when it’s all running as it should be, which is most of the time—Adam and I get to focus on prepping, sitting down and recording, and then listening back to basically finished episodes. At that point, we’re just pitching jokes. Like: “Hey, we could add a little audio here to illustrate this point or whatever.” But 90 percent of the time we listen to an episode that’s pretty much ready to go and are just signing off on it for Wynde.

I think that the logistics of making this are complex in some ways. But at its core, it’s just me and Adam having to watch a TV show and then talk to each other about it. And that period of the day, that period of the week where I’m talking to my buddy about a thing we both really love is still the best part of my week.

Adam: We’ve been doing this for 10 years. If you need to take some time off, we know about it usually a month before, and we prepare for it. We know that we record two or three or four episodes a week, every week.

We know that if one of us gets sick, we will have to record more than that in a given week. And I think part of it is if you know that’s what your life is, it’s not stressful or disappointing when that’s your responsibility. That’s just what it takes.

We were both in alignment right away initially that you cannot miss a week doing this because people depend on it for the rhythm of their own weeks. But also, be a fucking professional! Are you telling me you don’t have an afternoon in a given week to do the thing that you’re doing professionally? Get out of here. Of course you do! Find a way.

And this is why, when people over the years have told us, “I really want to do a podcast,” the first advice is: “The same time, the same day, every week. Forever.” And that’s the only advice I give because if you can do that for a year and you ask me what else you need to do, then we can have that conversation.

But if you’re not willing to be a pro like that, good luck. I doubt your ability to get traction with an audience, because I think so much depends on that.

Ben: The podcasts that I listen to throughout the week are something I really look forward to—those shows being there at that time when I do the thing that I do when I listen to them. And so we’ve been very lucky to burrow under the skin of a lot of people—

Adam: I wonder if that’s how we know, Ben? Like, we’re not just the president of Hair Club, we’re also the clients? I think we know what’s meaningful to a podcast listener because we are them ourselves. In a way, I feel like nouveau podcasting right now is often made up of hosts who are doing it because it’s lucrative in their niche, you know?

Ben: Wait, this can be lucrative? Shit, what have we been doing?

Ars:  I’m at a place in my life right now—and maybe you guys are, too—where I find it very hard to emotionally engage with the news. I find myself turning off the news on the radio, on my phone, in ways that I didn’t three years ago, five years ago. I used to be hyper-on: all the news, all the things, all the time. And I just can’t now. I just want to hear some guys talk about martinis.

Ben, you mentioned earlier that this is a show about the hang, and it’s sort of loosely anchored around the thing that you love, Star Trek.

Do you have that same feeling when it’s chatting with Adam Pranica about Baywatch? Does the subject for you, both of you, matter at all? Or does Star Trek have a particular emotional resonance in a way that, you know, lawns don’t?

Ben: I think that the Trek of it all is still really important to the show. And I think that we’re in an era where the news is devastating and exhausting in equal measure, and, you know, Trek has a lot of politics in it.

Adam and I share a lot of politics, but we also, I think, are pretty conscious of this being a place where the horrors of the world aren’t the center of attention.

So we’ve been pretty intentional about trying to make a thing that is a refuge and not a giant bummer.

And I think in its own way, that is an act of defiance. Still being able to have the hang despite all of the horrific shit going on is a sort of powerful statement—no, we’re not going to be ground into bummer pulp.

Adam: Yeah, I agree. I mean, I’m not interested in introducing that into our programs at all. I think a person’s politics is largely their behavior, and I don’t want to compare the things that I’m watching to the things that are happening in the real world generally.

But I think I might take a different side than Ben, about how Star Trek-located the project needs to be for it to be—I don’t know—fun or enriching.

I think those other projects, whether they’re about Baywatch or food or whatever—I’m interested in interesting conversations that are challenging or comedically interesting to me. It largely doesn’t matter what the subject is at its core. I want to be the sort of person that could make anything funny in conversation and through our various other types of shows, that’s become the truth, I hope.

Ben: That’s very fair. I still sort of think it’s the on-ramp for a lot of people. Like, oh, yeah, I like Star Trek. I’ll give that a try. And then it becomes about more than that.

Ultimately, I couldn’t make a show with Adam Pranica and Adam Ragusea if I wasn’t delighted by their perspective on things on an ongoing basis. The thing that’s amazing about this is we’ve made 600-something episodes of The Greatest Generation and 300-something episodes of Greatest Trek and dozens and dozens of episodes of Wholesome, and Adam says stuff every single time we sit down that surprises and delights me. That’s a complete magic trick.

Adam: You can’t do this for 10 years if it’s a bummer-hate show with a bunch of politics in it. That would have been exhausting nine years ago, you know? I don’t listen to any news or politics podcasts. Why would you? Look for the light where you can find it.

Ars: Going back to our original interview, you guys didn’t have very much in the way of established bits and jokes in the way that you do now.

I’m looking here at the Wikia and there’s a long list of bits and phrases: 50-year-old Ensign. Anybody Canyon. Bangers. Ball-kicking machine. Big Rod. McLaughlin Group. Miriam. Mount Armis. Natural Yeager.

Do you feel like any bits are played out? As I read through this, I’m like, “Oh yeah, I totally forgot about ‘Fuck Bokai.’ That’s pretty funny!”

Ben: Oh man, Fuck Bokai. That may have been the high-water mark! I think that one of the cool things about some of these is that they sort of ebb and flow depending on what we’re covering, you know?

There were things that were kind of jokes that stayed within the confines of Deep Space Nine or Voyager that sometimes you get an idea and you can pull one out of the cold storage.

But often the group of active working runners is very influenced by what we are actively covering. I think it’ll be very interesting to see how that long list of old inside jokes interacts with the show when we start going back through the second time.

Because I’m kind of tempted to not reference any of that stuff. I don’t know. I will have to see what happens when we start doing it.

Adam: I feel the same way, Ben. I think we don’t do a bit just because it’s “time to do the bit.” I have felt for a long time that it’s not funny if you’re trying to be funny. If we choose to turn it around and go back from the beginning—these are going to be new experiences for the time that we record them.

And they’re going to feel brand new. I wouldn’t expect a retread of much of anything. Because that doesn’t sound funny to me.

Ben: Well, also 10 years older. Our lives are different. Our world is different.

We will see new things in the show. And that’s one of the things that’s so cool about Star Trek: I feel like I experience it in new ways each time I watch it. So I think it’s kind of inevitable that it will get something that is really different and novel. And maybe some of those old runners will find their way back because they happen to be the funny thing at that moment.

But generally speaking, I’m really excited for crumpling up the paper and throwing it away and writing something fresh, you know?

Adam: Cyrus, you mentioned the Wiki, and I just want to say, one of the best things that’s happened to us over the 10 years of making the show has been the community that formed around it to do things, like making the wiki, making the Discord, that have formed groups where they watch movies together and date each other and marry each other and whatever.

This is a thing that we didn’t intend—imagine doing a thing so important that a large audience would enjoy it—but this large audience has their own lives, and they’re enjoying this thing that we do completely separate from us in their own way.

In a way, that’s great. Neither Ben nor I have the time or the inclination to make a wiki about our show, for example. And yet the folks that put in the effort here to make the experience of listening to the show better for everyone—that’s selfless and good and appreciated.

Ars: Given that there’s such a large body of work that you guys have produced, do you ever get people asking: “You guys have done a thousand episodes. Where do I start?”

I’ll give my answer first. I always tell people who are Star Trek fans but who have maybe not listened to Greatest Gen, “Choose a Star Trek episode that you love or that is memorable to you in some way and listen to the podcast episode about that episode.”

Ben: I like that, too. I also get the question “Oh, you know a lot about Star Trek. I want to get my kid into it. Where should we start?” And I don’t really think that there’s a right answer to that kind of question. Like, going back to the beginning doesn’t necessarily work for me or doesn’t necessarily work as an answer for everybody.

So I like the suggestion to jump in somewhere where you feel like you’ve got some fluency, but I also think it’s totally cool to jump in midstream on the show now or, you know, start at the beginning of one of the series that you really like or jump around. We hear from people that do it all different kinds of ways.

We’ve heard from people who got into the Greatest Generation because of Greatest Trek. We’ve heard from people who started listening to the Greatest Generation and were like: “Well, there’s a lot of references to old stuff in here. So I better go back and listen from the beginning.”

And then they binge the entire thing in three months. And I’m concerned that there may be some kind of exposure toxicity!

Adam: It’s an interesting quality to consider because a lot of the podcasts I listen to are about sports, and the sports that just happened over the weekend. No one listens to that show a month after it comes out.

But 10 years of our conversations are still being listened to in a way that I feel [isn’t the case] if you’re podcasting about the football game.

Ben: As many things as we’ve done in the past of the show, they stay in the present for a lot of people—I think more than half of our downloads in a given week are old episodes.

So that is a place where people hang out, and I think a lot of people that have jobs where they’re working with their hands but they don’t need to be processing language—[they] love podcasts. So we hear from a lot of graphic designers and truckers who like the show.

And that huge back catalog is such a boon to them because by the time you’re on your second listen through, you’re not going to remember exactly how the bit went from episode 324. So the comedy works again for that person.

Ars: I presume you guys have received screeners for Starfleet Academy. How are you feeling about Starfleet Academy as a show? And how are you guys feeling about doing it for your own show?

Ben: I’ve watched two episodes now. And I remain pretty optimistic about Starfleet Academy as a show. I think that there is some melancholy to it being the only one that’s actively being made now of any of the shows. I think they’ve wrapped on Strange New Worlds, even though they haven’t released season four. And none of the others are, like, in production at this point.

Adam: I’m also two episodes in—two very long episodes. I think that one of the qualities to Starfleet Academy that’s been surprising is the hour-long nature of it.

I think many years ago I coined the phrase “Star Trek is a place.” And what that means definitionally is that it’s not a ship or a particular captain or a planet or a federation. It’s a place to tell stories.

That’s just my way of saying that Starfleet Academy at this point, two episodes in, feels like the expression of that idea. Like, Starfleet Academy exists in a place that is Star Trek.

So I don’t hate it because they put out a cheesy poster. I don’t hate it at all! I am enjoying what I’ve seen so far. It’s interesting and new. I think the feeling that I have about it is something that Ben touched on a little bit there, which was like, are we getting near the end of it? Are we going to go back into the desert of ten years without Star Trek?

I hope not because I think my preference is going to always be that I would rather have Star Trek even if it’s difficult or disliked by folks or whatever, than to go without it at all because it provokes thought. I mean, even when it’s not your Star Trek, I think it’s still fun to talk about.

Ars: One of your greatest wishes—maybe the greatest wish of your lives—is to be blown out of an airlock in a new episode of Star Trek. How close are we to seeing that on screen?

Ars: Have you actually pitched this to somebody who could make it happen?

Ben: There are people inside the walled garden that are aware that a lot of people are invested in this idea. And yeah, it’s happened in comics, it’s happened in fan productions several times now.

We leap at every opportunity we have to get blown out of an airlock. If and when the call comes from inside the Star Trek house, it will be the thrill of a lifetime. That remains the overarching goal of the show, I would say.

We’ve gone so far as to say that if the offer is made, we will fly ourselves to Toronto. If [Paramount is] obligated by some kind of agreement with the union to pay us, we will donate that money to a charity.

This is not about fame or fortune for us. It is about getting blown out of an airlock, which…

Adam: It’s about finally experiencing the sweet, sweet peace of death.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/wiper-malware-targeted-poland-energy-grid-but-failed-to-knock-out-electricity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers on Friday said that Poland’s electric grid was targeted by wiper malware, likely unleashed by Russia state hackers, in an attempt to disrupt electricity delivery operations.

A cyberattack, Reuters reported, occurred during the last week of December. The news organization said it was aimed at disrupting communications between renewable installations and the power distribution operators but failed for reasons not explained.

On Friday, security firm ESET said the malware responsible was a wiper, a type of malware that permanently erases code and data stored on servers with the goal of destroying operations completely. After studying the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attack, company researchers said the wiper was likely the work of a Russian government hacker group tracked under the name Sandworm.

“Based on our analysis of the malware and associated TTPs, we attribute the attack to the Russia-aligned Sandworm APT with medium confidence due to a strong overlap with numerous previous Sandworm wiper activity we analyzed,” said ESET researchers. “We’re not aware of any successful disruption occurring as a result of this attack.”

Sandworm has a long history of destructive attacks waged on behalf of the Kremlin and aimed at adversaries. Most notable was one in Ukraine in December 2015. It left roughly  230,000 people without electricity for about six hours during one of the coldest months of the year. The hackers used general purpose malware known as BlackEnergy to penetrate power companies’ supervisory control and data acquisition systems and, from there, activate legitimate functionality to stop electricity distribution. The incident was the first known malware-facilitated blackout.

ESET said the attack targeting Poland occurred on the 10th anniversary of that event. The security firm provided few other details about the attack other than the malware used has been dubbed DynoWiper.

Custom Wipers have long been a preferred tool for Russian hackers. In 2022, government attackers used wiper malware dubbed AcidRain to knock out 270,000 satellite modems in Ukraine in an attempt to disrupt communications. At the time, it was the seventh wiper Russia had used against since invading the neighboring country. ESET said last year that Sandworm had unleashed multiple wipers on universities and critical infrastructure in Ukraine.

The best known case of Russia’s use of wipers came in 2017 with the release of NotPetya. The destructive worm was intended to target only Ukraine, but quickly spread around the world and wreaked havoc as it disrupted computer operations. The event is estimated to have cost governments and businesses $10 billion, making it likely the most expensive computer intrusion in history.

There is no indication how or why DynoWiper failed to take out power. It’s possible Russia planned it to do so in an attempt to send a message without provoking Polish allies. Another possibility is that cyber defenses prevented the wiper from working as intended.</div>

            <h2>Did Edison accidentally make graphene in 1879?</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/did-edison-accidentally-make-graphene-in-1879/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Graphene is the thinnest material yet known, composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. That structure gives it many unusual properties that hold great promise for real-world applications: batteries, super capacitors, antennas, water filters, transistors, solar cells, and touchscreens, just to name a few. The physicists who first synthesized graphene in the lab won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics. But 19th century inventor Thomas Edison may have unknowingly created graphene as a byproduct of his original experiments on incandescent bulbs over a century earlier, according to a new paper published in the journal ACS Nano.

“To reproduce what Thomas Edison did, with the tools and knowledge we have now, is very exciting,” said co-author James Tour, a chemist at Rice University. “Finding that he could have produced graphene inspires curiosity about what other information lies buried in historical experiments. What questions would our scientific forefathers ask if they could join us in the lab today? What questions can we answer when we revisit their work through a modern lens?”

Edison didn’t invent the concept of incandescent lamps; there were several versions predating his efforts. However, they generally had a a very short life span and required high electric current, so they weren’t well suited to Edison’s vision of large-scale commercialization. He experimented with different filament materials starting with carbonized cardboard and compressed lampblack. This, too, quickly burnt out, as did filaments made with various grasses and canes, like hemp and palmetto. Eventually Edison discovered that carbonized bamboo made for the best filament, with life spans over 1200 hours using a 110 volt power source.

Lucas Eddy, Tour’s  grad student at Rice, was trying to figure out ways to mass produce graphene using the smallest, easiest equipment he could manage, with materials that were both affordable and readily available. He considered such options as arc welders and natural phenomena like lightning striking trees—both of which he admitted were “complete dead ends.” Edison’s light bulb, Eddy decided, would be ideal, since unlike other early light bulbs, Edison’s version was able to achieve the critical 2000 degree C temperatures required for flash Joule heating—the best method for making so-called turbostratic graphene.

Plus, Eddy had access to Edison’s original 1879 patent describing the invention process. Eddy recreated Edison’s experiment, attaching light bulbs to a 110-volt power source and switching it on for 20 seconds at a time to rapidly heat the carbon-based material to between 2000 to 3000 degrees C. (Switch it on for any longer and you get graphite rather than graphene.) Then he examined the results using a modern optical microscope.

His first attempt didn’t work out because the bulbs he bought turned out to use tungsten rather than carbon filaments. “You can’t fool a chemist,” said Eddy. “But I finally found a small art store in New York City selling artisan Edison-style light bulbs.” Those artisan bulbs used bamboo filaments, with diameters a mere 5 micrometers larger than Edison’s original filaments.

This time, Eddy noticed that the carbon filament turned to a “lustrous silver.” Raman spectroscopy revealed that parts of the filament had turned into turbostratic graphene. The team also took before and after images using transmission electron microscopy. Eddy and his co-authors acknowledge that this is not definitive proof that Edison produced graphene. The inventor lacked the means to detect it even if he had been aware that such a material existed. And even if one were to analyze Edison’s original bulb, any graphene would have long since turned into graphite.

The authors concluded by noting the research potential of revisiting other early technologies using the tools of modern materials science, such as vacuum tubes, arc lamps, and early X-ray tubes. These also may have accidentally produced unusual materials or reactions that weren’t analyzed or even noticed at the time. “Innovation can emerge from reinterpreting the past with fresh tools and new questions,” they wrote. “In the case of ‘Edison graphene,’ a 140-year-old invention continues to shed light not just literally but scientifically.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/a-weird-itchy-rash-is-linked-to-the-keto-diet-but-no-one-knows-why/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A 20-year old man in Taiwan went to a dermatology clinic for a strange rash that had developed across his shoulders and chest. The raised, red, and itchy condition had been bothering him for a full month. By this point, he had also developed patches of pigmented skin interlaced with the red rash.

According to a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine, a skin biopsy showed swelling between his skin cells and inflammation around blood vessels, but testing came up negative for other common signs of skin conditions, leaving doctors with few leads. The doctors ultimately came to a diagnosis not by analyzing his skin further but by hearing about his diet.

The man told doctors that two months prior to his clinic appointment—a month before his rash developed—he had switched to a ketogenic diet, which is a high-fat but very low-carbohydrate eating pattern. This diet forces the body to shift from using glucose (sugar derived from carbohydrates) as an energy source to fat instead.

When this happens, the body can go into ketosis. This starts with fat tissue breaking down, leading to the release of free fatty acids. These fatty acids are transported to the liver, where they’re metabolized to acetyl-CoA. Excessive amounts of this molecule gum up metabolic processes and lead to the formation of ketone bodies, primarily acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. (A ketone is a specific chemical structure that includes a single bond to two CH3 or R groups with a double bond to an oxygen molecule.) Ketone bodies made in the liver can enter the circulatory system and be used as a source of energy for tissues around the body, particularly the brain.

Ketogenic diets have clinical uses—they’ve proven useful for managing drug-resistant epilepsy and some rare genetic metabolic diseases. Studies have looked at them as possible ways to manage obesity and type 2 diabetes, and there’s interest in their use in cancer metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.

Otherwise, the keto diet is popular among people trying to lose weight, particularly those trying to lose visceral fat, like the man in the case study. Anecdotal reports promote the keto diet as being effective at helping people slim down relatively quickly while also improving stamina and mental clarity. But robust clinical data supporting these claims are lacking, and medical experts have raised concerns about long-term cardiovascular health, among other things.

There are also clear downsides to the diet. Ketones are acidic, and if they build up too much in the blood, they can be toxic, causing ketoacidosis. This is a particular concern for people with type 1 diabetes and for people with chronic alcohol abuse. For everyone else, there’s a list of common side effects, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, bad breath, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. Ketogenic diets are also linked to high cholesterol and kidney stones.

But there’s one side effect that’s well established but little known and still puzzling to doctors: the “keto rash” or prurigo pigmentosa. This rash fits the man’s case perfectly—red, raised, itchy bumps on the neck, chest, and back, with areas of hyperpigmentation also developing.

The rash was first identified in Japan in 1971, where it was mostly seen in women. While it has been consistently linked to metabolic disorders and dietary changes, experts still don’t understand what causes it. It’s seen not only in people on a keto diet but also in people with diabetes and those who have had bariatric surgery or are fasting.

In a review this month, researchers in Saudi Arabia noted that a leading hypothesis is that the high levels of ketones in the blood trigger inflammation around blood vessels driven by a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, and this inflammation is what causes the rash, which develops in different stages.

While the condition remains poorly understood, effective treatments have at least been worked out. The most common treatment is to get the person out of ketosis and give them an antibiotic in the tetracycline class. Antibiotics are designed to treat bacterial infections (which this is not), but they can also dampen inflammation signals and thwart the activity of neutrophils.

In the man’s case, doctors gave him a two-week course of doxycycline and told him to ditch his keto diet. A week later, the rash was gone.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/tr-49-is-interactive-fiction-for-fans-of-deep-research-rabbit-holes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve ever fallen down a Wikipedia rabbit hole or spent a pleasant evening digging through college library stacks, you know the joy of a good research puzzle. Every new source and cross-reference you find unlocks an incremental understanding of a previously unknown world, forming a piecemeal tapestry of knowledge that you can eventually look back at as a cohesive and well-known whole.

TR-49 takes this research process and operationalizes it into an engrossing and novel piece of heavily non-linear interactive fiction. Researching the myriad sources contained in the game’s mysterious computer slowly reveals a tale that’s part mystery, part sci-fi allegory, part family drama, and all-compelling alternate academic history.

The entirety of TR-49 takes place from a first-person perspective as you sit in front of a kind of Steampunk-infused computer terminal. An unseen narrator asks you to operate the machine but is initially cagey about how or why or what you’re even looking for. There’s a creepy vibe to the under-explained circumstances that brought you to this situation, but the game never descends into the jump scares or horror tropes of so many other modern titles.

Your only real form of interaction with the world of TR-49 is through a sepia-toned tube display on the left and a four-character split-flap on the right that serves as the computer’s only input. You quickly discover that entering specific sequences—each with two letters followed by two numbers, as suggested by the game’s name—brings up library catalog-style entries referring to a vast web of literary works that form the core of the game’s wider fiction.

While the catalog contains short excerpts from each of these discovered works, it’s the additional notes added to each entry by subsequent researchers that place each title in its full context. You’ll end up poring through these research notes for clues about the existence and chronology of other authors and works. Picking out specific names and years points to the codes and titles needed to unlock even more reference pages in the computer, pushing you further down the rabbit hole. Picture something like Her Story, but replace the cinéma vérité surveillance video clips with a library card catalog.

You’ll slowly start to unravel and understand how the game world’s myriad authors are influencing each other with their cross-pollinating writings. The treatises, novels, pamphlets, and journals discussed in this database are full of academic sniping, intellectual intrigue, and interpersonal co-mingling across multiple generations of work. It all ends up circling a long-running search for a metaphysical key to life itself, which most of the authors manage to approach but never quite reach a full understanding.

As you explore, you also start to learn more about the personal affairs of the researchers who collected and cataloged all this reference material and the vaguely defined temporal capabilities of the information-synthesis engine in the computer you’ve all worked on. Eventually, you’ll stumble on the existence of core commands that can unlock hidden parts of the computer or alter the massive research database itself, which becomes key to your eventual final goal.

Through it all, there’s a slowly unfolding parallel narrative involving Liam, the unseen voice guiding you through the research process itself. Through occasional voice clips, Liam eventually hints at the existence of a powerful and quickly encroaching threat that wants to stop your progress by any means necessary, adding a bit of dramatic tension to your academic pursuits.

I’m being intentionally vague about the specifics here because I think TR-49‘s subtle and well-crafted sci-fi world-building is best experienced by exploring the game for yourself. There’s a real satisfaction in staring at a once impenetrably obtuse research note, recalling a bit of information from a recent cross-reference, and feeling your understanding suddenly click into place. And while the vocal performances can verge on cheesy, the writing captures the monomaniacal intensity of truly obsessive academics to a tee.

One of the game’s best features is a “Notes” sub-menu, which automatically outlines relevant facts (and potential facts) about various authors, groups, and publications as you discover them. This means you don’t have to take page after page of hand-written notes to keep track of the game’s complex connections (and potential connections), as you do in games like Blue Prince or Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. It makes for a much smoother puzzle-solving experience, even if the automatic notes sometimes pick up on things you may have missed while skimming.

TR-49 also benefits from being relatively compact compared to some other narrative deduction games. A diligent investigator can reach a conclusion in four or five hours, depending on how thorough they want to be. That makes it relatively easy to keep the broad outlines of the game’s dense but parsable world in your head over a couple of evening play sessions.

There are bound to be some people who see TR-49 as akin to a homework simulator, with painful flashbacks to all-nighters spent desperately researching a last-minute college term paper. For anyone who knows the inherent appeal of diving deep into a previously unknown world, though, TR-49 is an engrossing work of world-building fiction presented in a truly memorable way.</div>

            <h2>Demand for Intel's processors is apparently there, but the supply is not</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/core-ultra-series-3-launch-may-be-hampered-by-chip-shortages-says-intel/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel reported its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2025 yesterday, and the news both for the quarter and for the year was mixed: year-over-year revenue was down nearly imperceptibly, from $53.1 billion to $52.9 billion, while revenue for the quarter was down about four percent, from $14.3 billion last year to $13.7 billion this year. (That number was, nevertheless, on the high end of Intel’s guidance for the quarter, which ranged from $12.8 to $13.8 billion.)

Diving deeper into the numbers makes it clear exactly where money is being made and lost: Intel’s data center and AI products were up 9 percent for the quarter and 5 percent for the year, while its client computing group (which sells Core processors, Arc GPUs, and other consumer products) was down 7 percent for the quarter and 3 percent for the year.

That knowledge makes it slightly easier to understand the bind that company executives talked about on Intel’s earnings call (as transcribed by Investing.com). In short, Intel is having trouble making (and buying) enough chips to meet demand, and it makes more sense to allocate the chips it can make to the divisions that are actually making money—which means that we could see shortages of or higher prices for consumer processors, just as Intel is gearing up to launch the promising Core Ultra Series 3 processors (codenamed Panther Lake).

Intel CFO David Zinsner indicated that Intel is “prioritizing [its] internal wafer supply to data center” and having more of its consumer chips made externally. Substantial portions of the Core Ultra Series 3 processors are manufactured at Intel, after the company primarily used TSMC’s chip factories for the Core Ultra Series 2 designs.

“We can’t completely vacate the client market,” said Zinsner, but Intel is “shifting as much as we can over to data center to meet the high demand.”

Compounding this is that yields for the new 18A process—that is, the number of chips in a wafer with no defects that can work as designed—are still improving. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said that “while yields are in line with our internal plans, they are still below what I want them to be.”

Yields are currently improving by 7 or 8 percent every month, according to Intel. But that could be building on pretty low initial yields—reporting from last summer suggested that just 10 percent of the chips coming off of the 18A production lines were meeting Intel’s requirements at the time. Intel predicts that its supply will have ramped up enough within the next few months to help alleviate shortages.

“I do believe that the first quarter is the trough,” said Zinsner. “We will improve supply in the second quarter.”

When Intel can start making enough chips to meet its demand, it ought to help brighten the company’s earnings reports.

“We delivered [our Q4 2025] results despite supply constraints, which meaningfully limited our ability to capture all of the strengths in our underwriting markets,” said Tan. “We are working aggressively to address this and better support our customers’ needs going forward.”

Intel has been signaling for a while now that it was selling essentially all of the chips it could get its hands on. Intel investor relations VP John Pitzer said last month that Intel would be selling more of both its Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake Core Ultra Series 2 chips for consumers, as well as its Granite Rapids chips for data centers, if it could get more of them.

As Intel seeks to improve its position in the short term, the company also says that it’s still making progress on its future manufacturing nodes, including different versions of the 18A process and the upcoming 14A process. Intel is working to engage “potential external customers” who would use the 14A process to make their own chips. If these third parties decide to use Intel’s manufacturing facilities, Intel expects to know about it “starting in the second half of this year and extending into the first half of 2027,” and then it expects to build out manufacturing capacity based on the number of external customers it finds.

On the chip design side, Intel also expects to have its first next-generation Nova Lake chips ready “at the end of 2026.” We don’t know much about Nova Lake yet, but it should be Intel’s next architecture to cover both desktop and laptop processors, while Panther Lake chips are intended mainly for laptops. At least part of the chip will also be manufactured using the 18A process.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Adult content has never been as accessible as it is now, thanks to the internet. Hell, online smut played a major role in the rise of the web itself in the 1990s.

With that glut of porn, some have voiced concerns that some people are consuming too much of the stuff or even becoming addicted, which they claim could have consequences like regulating emotions or impaired sexual functioning.

But as PsyPost reports, these concerns may be overblown. Researchers at the University of Pécs in Hungary have found that it doesn’t matter how frequently one watches porn; the reasons why somebody indulges in the stuff are far more predictive of their sexual health.

As detailed in a new paper published in the International Journal of Sexual Health, the researchers found that positive motivations, such as “enhancing sexual pleasure, exploring fantasies, or deepening intimacy,” were “associated with frequent but non-problematic pornography use and with adaptive sexual regulation.”

However, those with “negative motivations,” such as “stress reduction, emotional escape, or avoidance of discomfort,” were strongly linked to “sexual system hyperactivation, emotion regulation difficulties, and impaired relational functioning.”

The study involved  890 adult participants in Hungary, including 600 individuals assigned female at birth and 290 assigned male at birth. The participants submitted answers anonymously through an online survey.

“A major gap in the literature is that pornography use is often evaluated mainly by how frequently people use it, even though frequency alone tells us very little about whether use is actually harmful,” University of Pécs psychology professor Norbert Meskó told PsyPost.

“We were interested in whether these different motivations are linked to different patterns of sexual and emotional functioning,” he added.

Most strikingly, the researchers found that participants who reported frequent pornography use were less likely to experience problematic outcomes. However, those who primarily used it for coping and managing stress were more likely to experience symptoms of problematic use, indicating that frequency isn’t the main indicator of whether it’s actually harmful.

“One somewhat surprising finding was that frequent use, when driven by positive motivations, was linked to less sexual deactivation — meaning less emotional withdrawal from sexuality,” Meskó told PsyPost. “In contrast, only problematic use — not frequent use — was associated with these kinds of disengaged or avoidant sexual patterns.”

“Importantly, problematic use showed much stronger links to difficulties in sexual and emotional functioning than simple frequency did,” he added. “This suggests that from a practical standpoint, it is more useful to look at whether someone feels out of control or distressed by their use than at how often they watch pornography.”

Of course, as the researchers note in their paper, there are some limitations to their research. For one, the self-reported nature of their data may not be reliable, as it relies on memory. It also may not be generalizable to a broader population as a result.

Multiple motivations for pornography use may also overlap — for instance, seeking pleasure while also distracting from stress — meaning that some cases may not neatly fit into either positive or negative motivations. One category may also quickly shift to another, further complicating the picture.

“We would caution against thinking of pornography as either simply ‘good’ or ‘bad,&#39;” Meskó told PsyPost. “For some people, it may be part of healthy sexual expression, while for others it may function as a way to avoid emotional problems or relationship difficulties.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thanks to scores of competing AI systems clogging up online application portals, applying for a new job in 2026 can feel more like applying for a bank loan than seeking a job.

At least, that’s what a group of disgruntled job seekers is claiming in a lawsuit against an AI screening company called Eightfold AI. According to the New York Times, the plaintiffs allege that Eightfold’s employment screening software should be subjected to the Fair Credit Reporting Act — the regulations protecting information collected by consumer credit bureaus.

The reason, they say, can be found deep within Eightfold’s AI algorithm, which actively trolls LinkedIn to create a data set of “1 million job titles, 1 millions skills, and the profiles of more than 1 billion people working in every job, profession, industry, and geography.” That data set, in turn, is used in marketing material to help sell its services to potential clients.

Using an AI model trained on that data, plaintiffs say, Eightfold scores job applications on a scale of one to five, based on their skills, experience, and the hiring manager’s goals. In sum, their argument is that it’s not at all unlike the opaque rules used to govern consumer credit scores.

In the case of Eightfold, however, applicants have no way of knowing what their final score even is, let alone the steps the system took to come up with it. That creates a “black box”: a situation where the people subjected to an algorithmic decision can only see the system’s outcome, not the process that led to it. And if Eightfold’s AI starts making things up on the fly — an issue AI models are infamous for — the job seeker has no way of knowing.

There’s also the issue of data retention. With no way to take a peek under the hood, there’s no telling how much data from job applicants’ résumés Eightfold collects, or what the AI company and its clients are doing with it.

“I think I deserve to know what’s being collected about me and shared with employers,” Erin Kistler, one of the plaintiffs told the NYT. “And they’re not giving me any feedback, so I can’t address the issues.”

Kistler, who has decades of experience working in computer science, told the publication she’s kept a close score of every application she’s sent over the last year. Out of “thousands of jobs” she’s applied for, only 0.3 percent moved on to a follow-up or interview, she said.

It all underscores the sad state of the job market, which has become the stuff of dystopian nightmares thanks to AI hiring tools. Whether the lawsuit can gain enough momentum to challenge the massive legal grey area of AI hiring remains to be seen. If it does, it could bring relief to throngs of despondent job seekers whose careers quite literally hang in the balance.

Eightfold AI didn’t respond to the NYT‘s request for comment.

            <div id="article-text">It’s a plant! It’s a fungus! It’s… an entirely new type of lifeform hitherto unknown to science?

That appears to be the case for a puzzling, spire-shaped organism that lived over 400 million years ago, according to a new study published in the journal Science Advances. After analyzing its internal structures, the authors argue that the mystifying ancient beings known as prototaxites don’t belong to any of the existing biological kingdoms.

“It feels like it doesn’t fit comfortably anywhere,” Matthew Nelsen, a senior research scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History who wasn’t involved in the work, told Scientific American. “People have tried to shoehorn it into these different groups, but there are always things that don’t make sense.”

The name Prototaxites means “early yew” or “first yew,” a misnomer that captures the debate that has surrounded its nature for over a century. With its resemblance to a tree trunk, scientists initially suspected it was some kind of extinct tree when its fossils were first unearthed in 1855.

This assumption would probably offend the prototaxites were they still alive to hear it. In reality, the peculiar pillars likely emerged before the first trees appeared on Earth some 400 million years ago, and at an estimated height of around 26 feet, would’ve absolutely towered over other land organisms at the time.

What was the nature of these colossi? Scientific speculation abounded once it became clear that it wasn’t a plant. In the decades that followed its discovery, the consensus flipped to it being a kind of algae. In more recent decades, the suspicion became that it was some kind of giant fungus, because it appeared that they contained carbon isotopes typically found in such organisms.

Boldly, the authors of the new paper — which we’ve been following since back before it was peer-reviewed — say that everyone’s got it all wrong. The tubelike structures in the fossils are wild and varied, unlike the structures in modern fungi, which are more ordered, SciAm noted. There were also no detectable traces of chitin, a chemical that makes up the cell walls of all known fungi.

“It doesn’t seem to have any of the characteristic features of the living fungal groups,” co-lead author Laura Cooper, a researcher at the University of Edinburg, told SciAm, adding that many facets of its biology elude our understanding, not just its taxonomy. “How it actually works energetically is still a complete mystery.”

Some argue that Prototaxites represent a completely extinct lineage of fungus, which, if true, means it would have had to independently evolve into a new form of complex life, according to Kevin Boyce, a paleobotanist at Stanford University who coauthored a 2022 paper with Nelsen on the organisms — something that would be astounding in its own right. “No matter what,” Boyce told SciAm, “it’s something weird doing its own thing.”

Cooper, however, remains adamant that the Prototaxites are too “fundamentally different” to shove it into the category of fungi. Science doesn’t like outliers, so if it is something entirely new, chances are there’s something else like it out there that we haven’t stumbled on yet. And so, according to Vivi Vajda, a paleobiologist at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, the “next step would be to find other fossil life forms with similar chemical fingerprints to trace this enigmatic life form through the tree of life,” she told Science.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The headlines of 2025 painted a portrait of America in chaos, driven by the financial logic of America’s media ecosystem. It’s number one product isn’t news, but fear.

“NYC youth crime doubled since controversial state Raise the Age Law kicked in,” exclaims one hysterical New York Post headline from September. “Business owners express frustration over crime surge in Federal Hill,” reads a banner from FOX45 News, a local outlet in Baltimore. “Office shooter’s rampage shows terrifying rise of motive-free violence, experts warn,” goes a Fox News heading from August.

The scary headlines were all underscored by inflammatory rhetoric from the Trump administration, which continued to insist that America’s cities are crime-ridden hell holes well into the new year.Selective media coverage of crime certainly isn’t a new phenomenon, though it’s worth revisiting — especially because new data suggests 2025 was actually one of the least violent years for the US in over a century.

According to fresh Council on Criminal Justice crime statistics, Axios reports, murder rates fell 21 percent last year across the 35 largest cities in the US. It’s the single largest one-year-drop ever, the publication reports, and possibly the lowest homicide rates we’ve seen as a nation since the year 1900 — when the last generation of frontier outlaws were still robbing train cars.

Homicide wasn’t the only crime that fell in 2025. Out of 13 crimes tracked by the Council on Criminal Justice, 11 of them were lower last year than in 2024. Aggravated assaults, for example, fell by 9 percent across the 35 cities, while gun assaults and robberies dropped off by 22 and 23 percent, respectively. (The only category that increased was drug crimes, up 7 percent — and which are nonviolent.)

To sum up it all up: the sensationalized crime coverage dominating the evening news stands in stark, frustrating contrast to the actual data. In 2026, American media is dominated by just six billion-dollar media conglomerates, an arrangement which has held for well over a decade.

Under this system, news becomes commodified — clicks and views drive revenue, the core function of any business. Media companies have a financial incentive to churn out hysterical headlines and “Nightcrawler”-esque violence porn over rational breakdowns of actual statistics, nevermind the social and financial conditions that give rise to crime.

With so many Americans reliant on the commercialized news cycle for information about the world, it’s no wonder our politics are still steeped in debates over “law and order,” driven by a crisis that doesn’t seem to exist.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Magic mushrooms, an informal group of fungi that contain the naturally occurring psychedelic substance psilocybin, are known for inducing powerful hallucinations. They can induce feelings of euphoria, a sense of belonging in the world, and distort reality by messing with the brain’s visual cortex, turning the world into a trippy, shimmering pocket dimension full of pulsating geometric patterns.

Now we’re hearing about a lesser-known species, known for its umami-forward flavor in China, which can induce far more specific hallucinations — when not prepared correctly by a chef, that is.

As the BBC reports, the mushroom, Lanmaoa asiatica, can cause you to see countless tiny people everywhere you look. Doctors in the Yunnan province of China are treating hundreds of cases a year of people having visions of small, “pint-sized, elf-like figures” crawling around and climbing up walls.

“At a mushroom hot pot restaurant there, the server set a timer for 15 minutes and warned us, ‘Don’t eat it until the timer goes off or you might see little people,&#39;” University of Utah doctoral candidate in biology Colin Domnauer told the broadcaster.

“It seems like very common knowledge in the culture there,” he added.

The hallucinations can last a very long time, up to three days after a 12-to-24-hour onset, and often result in hospitalizations. That’s considerably longer and more severe than the average psilocybin trip.

“One elder tribesman in Papua New Guinea describes this effect, explaining how ‘he saw tiny people with mushrooms around their faces. They were teasing him, and he was trying to chase them away,&#39;” Donmauer wrote in a November piece for the University of Utah.

“When I lifted the tablecloth higher, the heads came off and stuck to the bottom of the cloth and the bodies kept marching in place… I did this many times, at two-minute intervals, and each time they were there, marching and grinning… I measured them, too… they were [one inch] high,” a professor in Yunnan told Donmauer, recounting his own trip.

Domnauerhas been trying to hunt down the origins of the mushroom and investigate how it affects the brain, producing such surprisingly similar hallucinations in different people.

“It sounded so bizarre that there could be a mushroom out there causing fairytale-like visions reported across cultures and time,” he told the BBC. “I was perplexed and driven by curiosity to find out more.”

The appearance of tiny humans after ingesting the mushrooms does appear in academic literature, describing them as “liliputian hallucinations,” or “elusive little people.”

Even Albert Hofmann, the Swiss chemist known for being the first to synthesize, ingest, and learn about the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), failed to identify the molecules that caused the mysterious hallucinations.

The mushrooms got their formal Latin name in 2015, yet many questions remain about their psychedelic qualities, a gap Donmauer is hoping to fill with his research.

In experiments involving mice, he found that the animals fell into a stupor after being administered extracts of the mushroom.

Donmauer has also determined that the L. asiatica mushrooms do not contain psilocybin, the substance that gives magic mushrooms their hallucinogenic qualities.

The main thing that sets it apart is that trips don’t vary greatly depending on the individual, unlike those triggered by psilocybin which can differ greatly.

The “perception of little people is very reliably and repeatedly reported,” Donmauer told the BBC. “I don’t know of anything else that produces such consistent hallucinations.”

The researcher has yet to eat the mushroom himself. Given the length of the trips and the chances of being hospitalized, we can’t blame him.

“While many questions remain, one thing is for certain: Lanmaoa asiatica reminds us that the world of mushrooms, even those found in markets and on dinner plates, conceals mysteries and wonders we’ve yet to imagine,” Donmauer wrote in his piece for the University of Utah.

“Somewhere between traditional folklore and modern biology, between the wild forest floor and the sterile scientific laboratory, lies a story still unfolding, a story that may begin with something as seemingly innocuous as a bowl of mushroom soup,” he added.

            <div id="article-text">Something strange is happening with ManyVids, an OnlyFans-like porn platform with millions of users. For roughly the past half-year, its official account on X and on its own website have been posting bizarre, feverishly spiritual rants on topics ranging from aliens to numerology, along with absurd AI-generated images and videos that depict its CEO Bella French, 404 Media reports,

What’s more, many of the adult content creators on the platform suspect that the cryptic posts are a sign that French is suffering from some kind of delusional episode brought on by her addiction to AI, a phenomenon that psychiatrists are labeling AI psychosis. And it’s leaving them feeling pretty uneasy about the site’s future.

“If something were to happen to MV (or to my account there) due to what can only be described as AI psychosis, I would lose upwards of 14k per year — a not insignificant amount of income,” one of these creators told 404. “It concerns me that access to my earnings, and more importantly my personal information, is in the hands of someone seemingly out of touch with reality.”

The posts first started appearing on X, formerly, Twitter, in mid-2025. As 404 tells it, instead of promoting creators and other stuff relevant to the platform, the ManyVids account started “posting cryptic quotes, phrases, and images, many seemingly generated by or about AI.” The account would also interact with obvious bots, or post nonsensical, bullet-pointed and emoji-bedecked rants that are the exact kind of drivel you’d expect to see from AI spammers.

The posts have stopped on X. But they continue on the ManyVids website itself, which has a dedicated feed for official posts.

At some point during the AI posting spree, the site’s owner French appeared to have a concerning change of heart. A former cam model, she has long championed the rights of sex workers and launched ManyVids over a decade ago to provide a platform where they could monetize their content and be treated fairly by the site owners, according to 404.

But now she appears to be crusading against the very thing she created. As recently as last November, French updated her website to state that her new personal mission is to “transition one million people out of the adult industry and do everything we can to ensure no one new enters it,” 404 noted.

The dramatic shift in beliefs, paired with the bizarre rambling posts on cultish topics, show the hallmarks of AI psychosis, a term some experts are using to describe episodes in which users are led down mental health spirals by an AI chatbot. Some extreme cases end with explosions of violence, including suicide and murder. But more common cases see someone drawn down a delusional rabbit hole, leading them to believe they’ve had divine experiences, or discovered game-changing scientific advances, or possess supernatural powers like the ability to bend time.

ManyVids content creators agree that there’s something AI-related afoot. Almost all of the platform’s creators who 404 spoke to brought up “AI psychosis” unprompted, observing the bizarre and AI-generated characteristics of the rants and videos. And it’s leaving them insulted and unnerved.

“Ethical dilemmas about AI aside, the posts are completely disconnected with ManyVids as a site,” another ManyVids creator told 404 Media. “Their customers and their creators are not served in any way by these. When faced with backlash, MV removed the ability to comment on posts.”

A quick bit of breaking news that hit just as we were about to send this newsletter out. The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation into Waymo after its robotaxis have been spotted illegally passing stopped school buses numerous times in at least two states. Read the full story here.

Tesla made a couple of moves this week — and just before its quarterly earnings drops — designed to show its progress, and even dominance, in automated driving technology. But, hold up, there is more to it than mere optics.

The week started with Tesla offering passengers robotaxi rides in Austin without a human safety driver in the front seat. If you recall, Tesla launched a limited service in Austin last year with a fleet of modified Tesla Model Y vehicles running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software known as Full Self-Driving Supervised (this one being “unsupervised”). Human safety operators have been riding in the front passenger seat as a precaution since the rollout.

Not all of Tesla’s fleet in Austin will be fully driverless, and there is apparently a chase vehicle behind those that are. Still, it is notable and suggests Tesla is moving toward a broader ramp-up.

Meanwhile, Tesla has killed Autopilot, the advanced driver-assistance system that was initially introduced to its vehicles in 2014. Autopilot has gone through several software and hardware iterations over the years with new capabilities.

Autopilot was instantly popular and controversial, in part because the name implied the system was more capable than it actually was. (Drivers are responsible and are supposed to have their hands on the wheel when Autopilot is engaged.)

Tesla eventually made a basic Autopilot system standard in all of its vehicles, while launching and charging for a more robust system known now as Full Self-Driving (Supervised). The basic version, which is now dead, included traffic-aware cruise control, in which the vehicle maintains a set distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a feature that centers the vehicle in the lane and steers it.

Its decision to kill what was standard ADAS comes one week after Tesla said it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software and move all customers to a monthly subscription.

These decisions when taken together offer a simple enough explanation: Tesla wants to recognize more revenue from FSD as it positions itself as an AI and robotics company.

But there is another possible reason. The company is facing a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in California after a judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD.

The ruling has been stayed for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply. Dropping the Autopilot name while cashing in on FSD is a rather bold move. But perhaps Tesla believes this is enough to satiate the DMV.

Zipline, the autonomous drone-delivery and logistics startup, has been around for more than a decade, starting in Rwanda delivering blood. Its progress has been slow and steady, notching wins in other African countries and expanding to the United States. That trajectory sped up after it launched a new drone platform in 2025 called P2 that focuses on home delivery of food and other goods.

Now, fueled with $600 million in new funding, its expansion ambitions have grown. The company, which is now valued at $7.6 billion, is bringing its service to Houston and Phoenix and plans to expand to at least four more U.S. states in 2026.

Fidelity Management & Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Valor Equity Partners, and Tiger Global participated in the funding round.

ABZ Innovation, a Europe-based maker of heavy-duty agricultural and industrial drones, raised $8.2 million in a funding round led by Vsquared Ventures, with participation from Assembly Ventures and Day One Capital.

Ethernovia, a San Jose, California-based startup that makes Ethernet-based systems for autonomous vehicles, raised $90 million in a Series B funding round led by Maverick Silicon — an AI-focused fund created in 2024 by hedge fund Maverick Capital.

Serve Robotics, the sidewalk delivery robot company backed by Nvidia and Uber, acquired Diligent Robotics in a deal that values the common stock at $29 million. Diligent builds robots named Moxi that are designed to assist in hospitals by delivering lab samples, supplies, and other tasks. Note: Watch for more autonomous vehicle tech-robotics crossovers in the coming year.

Terralayr, a German grid-scale battery storage company, raised €192 million in a round led by Eurazeo. RIVE Private Investment, Creandum, Earlybird, Norrsken VC, and Picus Capital also participated.

TrueCar founder Scott Painter reacquired the company in a $227 million deal through his firm Fair Holdings, and partners AutoNation, PenFed Credit Union, Zurich North America, and others. TrueCar will no longer be publicly traded, and Painter has returned to the CEO spot.

Austin Russell, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt lidar company Luminar, agreed to accept an electronic subpoena for information on his phone pertaining to the company. The subpoena is related to Luminar’s ongoing bankruptcy proceeding.

Chinese automaker Geely Holding Group released its five-year blueprint, and among its many goals is a section on robotaxis. The company said that by 2030 its Cao Cao Mobility ride-hailing unit will operate a fleet of 100,000 robotaxis covering major cities in China. It also hinted at plans to expand beyond China “in the future.”

General Motors is moving production of two gas-powered vehicles away from China and Mexico and to a U.S. factory in Kansas. That change will also mean the end of its rebooted Chevrolet Bolt EV, the only vehicle currently built at the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas.

Tesla aims to restart work on Dojo3, the company’s previously abandoned third-generation AI chip. Dojo3 won’t be aimed at training self-driving models. Instead, CEO Elon Musk says it will be dedicated to “space-based AI compute.”

Waymo has opened its robotaxi service in Miami. Riders will be accepted on a rolling basis, to the nearly 10,000 local residents on its waitlist.

Alex Roy, who co-hosts the Autonocast with me and Ed Niedermeyer, just traveled from Los Angeles to New York in a Tesla Model S, in which the vehicle’s Full Self-Driving Supervised software handled all of the driving. This “Cannonball Run” route is one Roy is familiar with; he set the transcontinental driving record in 2007 when he traveled the route in 31 hours and 4 minutes. He has gone on to make other Cannonball Run records in EVs. Others have followed and since beaten those records.

According to Roy, who captured the entire run on video, the FSD (version 14.2.2.3) drove 100% of the 3,081-mile journey. That included exiting the highway and parking at EV chargers. The time was 58 hours, 22 minutes.

            <div id="article-text">We’re about to get our first real look at the results of the recently announced AI partnership between Apple and Google, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

Gurman reports that Apple is planning to announce a new version of Siri in the second half of February. Using Google’s Gemini AI models, this Siri update will reportedly be the first to live up to the promises Apple made in June 2024, with the ability to complete tasks by accessing user’s personal data and on-screen content.

And that’s ahead of an even bigger upgrade that Apple plans to announce in June, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Gurman says. This version of Siri is supposed to be more conversational, in the style of other chatbots like ChatGPT, and it could run directly on Google’s cloud infrastructure.

Earlier reports suggested that Apple has been struggling to get its AI strategy back on-track. In fact, Gurman says Apple’s Mike Rockwell told foundation team members over the summer that one of Gurman’s earlier reports was “bulls–t.” But with the Google partnership, as well as the recent departure of Apple’s AI chief John Giannandrea, it seems the company has indeed found a new direction.

            <h2>What is Bending Spoons? The little-known firm behind Vimeo’s sweeping layoffs</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-25</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/25/what-is-bending-spoons-everything-to-know-about-aols-acquirer/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vimeo was hit by a massive round of layoffs this past week, according to a report by Business Insider. Staffers posting on various social media sites that the layoffs impacted most of the company, including the entire video team. Vimeo is a video-hosting platform, so that sounds bad.The layoffs are the latest restructuring by Bending Spoons, the Milan-based tech conglomerate that acquired Vimeo for $1.38 billion in an all-cash deal that closed in the latter half of 2025. While Bending Spoons may be unknown to many, it’s quietly become one of the tech industry’s most prolific buyers, now owning Meetup, WeTransfer, Eventbrite, and many others.

So what exactly is Bending Spoons? Despite its catchy name, the 12-year-old company has stayed remarkably under the radar, typically making headlines only when it adds another recognizable brand to its portfolio — or when it restructures these companies through significant layoffs.

The company’s playbook has become clear: acquire underperforming but popular tech brands, then transform them to serve millions of users more efficiently through controversial changes to beloved products and substantial workforce reductions. It followed this pattern with Evernote and WeTransfer, and is now repeating it with Vimeo.

Despite remaining largely unknown to the public, Bending Spoons’ roster of products has served more than a billion people, with over 300 million monthly active users and 10 million paying customers. Here’s what you need to know about the company reshaping some of the internet’s most recognizable brands.

Despite often being described as a private equity firm, Bending Spoons describes itself more specifically as a company that acquires and transforms digital businesses. Having grown to a headcount of 400 to 500 employees (whom the company calls “Spooners”), its main focus is on making improvements to products and services that others have created.

However, it didn’t start that way — Bending Spoons’ founders had taken a stab at building their own apps and products before eventually shifting their focus.

The little-known backstory is that Bending Spoons was born out of the remains of Evertale, a Copenhagen-based startup that participated in Disrupt SF 2011’s Startup Alley and raised seed funding for its photo-sharing app, Wink.

Evertale failed not long after, and investors were able to exit, but its founders and a couple of employees kept working together, initially on in-house apps. Soon enough, the team made its first acquisition, followed by many others, CEO and co-founder Luca Ferrari told the venture podcast 20VC in a rare interview.

In 2020, Bending Spoons made an exception when it created and donated Immuni, Italy’s official COVID-19 contact-tracing app. But other than that, it has mostly been honing a formula: Bending Spoons identifies a popular product it thinks it can improve inside and out, and buys it from owners who have reached their limits.

After the acquisition, Bending Spoons is anything but a passive owner, making changes to the products’ user experience and features, as well as to the underlying tech; monetization strategy, including pricing; and team organization, including headcount.

While this focus on efficiency and revenue overlaps with private equity strategies, Bending Spoons claims a key difference: It “aims to hold forever, and has never sold an acquired business.” It is building a live portfolio, not collecting internet relics or presiding over a tech graveyard.

To be clear, Bending Spoons’ acquisition targets so far haven’t necessarily been failing businesses — many still had substantial user bases and revenue. But they’ve tended to be stagnant, neglected, or had owners looking to exit. Let’s recap these key deals, and what happened in their aftermath.

While Bending Spoons acquired several companies between 2014 and 2021, including the AI-powered photo enhancer Remini, its most notable acquisitions happened more recently.

In 2022, it acquired Filmic, known for its popular video- and photo-editing apps, and laid off the entire staff in December 2023.

In a deal also announced in 2022 and finalized in early 2023, Bending Spoons also acquired Evernote, the note-taking app that had reportedly reached a $1 billion valuation before hitting trouble. Layoffs followed the acquisition, as well as cuts to Evernote’s free offering.

The first half of following year, 2024, was particularly active, with the acquisition of Meetup, app maker Mosaic Group, and Hopin’s StreamYard all happening within six months.

In July 2024, it went on to acquire the publishing platform Issuu and the file transfer service WeTransfer, where it later cut staff and made changes to its free plan, introducing stricter limits. In December 2025, WeTransfer’s cofounder Nalden criticized Bending Spoons’ decisions and said he was building another file transfer service.

In November 2024, Bending Spoons announced it would spend $233 million on an all-cash take-private deal to acquire video platform Brightcove.

The acquisitions have continued apace in 2025, with acquisitions that include the route planner Komoot and management software maker Harvest.

Bending Spoons also announced its intention to acquire Vimeo in a $1.38 billion all-cash deal, and soon after, to acquire AOL from Yahoo for an undisclosed amount. (Disclosure: Both AOL and Yahoo are former owners of TechCrunch, in which Yahoo retains a small interest.)

At the time, Bending Spoons said the acquisitions of AOL and Vimeo were expected to close by the end of 2025, subject to standard closing conditions and regulatory approvals; including, in the case of Vimeo, approval by its stockholders, which they have recently granted.

The Vimeo acquisition closed in the latter half of 2025, and was followed by the massive layoffs that hit the company this month, impacting most of the workforce including the entire video team.

In December 2025, Bending Spoons announced it would acquire yet another well-known brand: Eventbrite. Once again, it may pay much less than Eventbrite was once worth — only some $500 million, a far cry from the company’s $1.76 billion valuation when it went public in 2018.

However, there might be more hurdles. Earlier this month, Eventbrite stockholders filed a lawsuit in Delaware to upend the take-private deal over voting rights, and Eventbrite is currently fighting an effort to fast-track this challenge.

Since October 2025, Bending Spoons has been one of Europe’s rare tech decacorns (companies valued at more than $10 billion).

This comes on the heels of Bending Spoons’ latest funding round: $270 million from investors, including T. Rowe Price and earlier backers Baillie Gifford, Cox Enterprises, Durable Capital Partners, and Fidelity, plus a $440 million secondary share sale by existing shareholders.

The company last raised at a $2.8 billion valuation in 2024, making its updated $11 billion valuation a significant step up — also for its four co-founders, who joined the billionaire ranks as a result.

Ferrari’s stake in Bending Spoons is now reportedly worth $1.4 billion, while co-founders Matteo Danieli, Luca Querella, and Francesco Patarnello each hold stakes worth $1.3 billion, according to Forbes estimates based on shareholder data published by the Italian Business Register.

It’s unclear whether any of the co-founders sold stock in the secondary transaction. Bending Spoons has declined to comment on its co-founders’ stakes.

Though long bootstrapped, Bending Spoons had previously raised equity financing several times, including in September 2022 and early 2024. It also has VIPs on its cap table, including tennis and entertainment stars Andre Agassi and Bradley Cooper; tech industry bigs Eric Schmidt, Mike Krieger, and Xavier Niel; and performers The Weeknd, The Chainsmokers, and Maluma.

Upon announcing its new funding in October 2025, Bending Spoons said it would support future acquisitions and investment in its proprietary technology and AI capabilities. This comes in addition to the $2.8 billion in debt financing the company disclosed when it announced its intention to acquire AOL, debt that will fund the AOL deal and future acquisitions.

Bending Spoons said it intends to continue pursuing new acquisitions that expand its portfolio of consumer and enterprise digital products, and it now has funding to afford more prominent targets going forward — as confirmed by its decision to acquire Eventbrite.

AOL and Vimeo already carry far more name recognition than earlier targets, though the AOL terms remain undisclosed. The properties also have some reach. In announcing the AOL deal, Bending Spoons claimed that AOL remains one of the top 10 most-used email providers in the world, with 8 million daily active users and 30 million monthly active users. (Not long before acquiring AOL, Bending Spoons was also rumored to be eyeing app maker Elysium and Typeform, the Barcelona-based SaaS company known for its form creation tools.)

Presumably to support its continued efforts to acquire companies, it also has openings across various roles, with new hires initially working from its Milan headquarters before gaining the option to work from offices in London, Madrid, and Warsaw, or remotely.

In fact, despite warning candidates that Bending Spoons is a “demanding environment,” the company has said it already received more than 600,000 job applications in 2025, a figure that will likely climb as its recent deals generate additional attention.

Candidates aside, Bending Spoons is also interviewing banks. According to reports, the company is holding talks with several financial entities to launch an IPO on the NYSE. In November, Ferrari had told Reuters that should it decide to go public, Bending Spoons would probably list in the U.S., where tech companies tend to achieve higher valuations.

            <div id="article-text">If your Gmail account didn’t seem to be working properly Saturday, you were not alone. But Google says the issue has been be resolved.

The official status dashboard for Google Workspace suggests that problems began at around 5am Pacific on Saturday morning, with users experiencing both “misclassification of emails in their inbox and additional spam warnings.”

For me, that meant my Primary inbox was filled with messages that would normally appear in the Promotions, Social, or Updates inboxes, and that spam warnings were appearing in emails from known senders. Other users complained on social media that “all the spam is going directly to my inbox” and that Gmail’s filters seem “suddenly completely busted.”

The Google dashboard was updated with messages throughout the day on Saturday saying that the company was still working to resolve the issue. Later on Saturday evening, Google posted that the issue had been “fully resolved for all users.”

“Some Gmail users experienced a misclassification of emails in their inbox, delays in receiving email,” the company said in a dashboard update. “Additionally, misclassified spam warnings from the incident may persist for existing messages received before the issue resolution.”

The company also said that it will “publish an analysis of this incident once we have completed our internal investigation.”

This post was first published on January 24, 2026. It has been updated to include Google’s statement that the issue has been resolved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There were times at this week’s meeting of the World Economic Forum when Davos seemed transformed into a high-powered tech conference, with on-stage appearances by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and even more industry executives.

The big topic, unsurprisingly, was AI, with CEOs laying a vision for the technology’s transformative potential while also acknowledging ongoing concerns that they’re inflating a massive bubble. Amidst all that big-picture prognostication, they also found time to take swipes at their competitors, and even at their ostensible partners.

On the latest episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, I discussed all things Davos with TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec and Sean O’Kane.

Kirsten noted that the conference seemed transformed from past years, with tech companies like Meta and Salesforce taking over the main promenade, while important topics like climate change failed to draw crowds. And Sean said that even if AI execs weren’t quite “panhandling for usage and more customers,” it could sometimes feel that way.

Read a preview of our full conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.

Kirsten: Some of the discussions around, let’s say, climate change or poverty and big global problems, [are] not really attracting the crowds. Meanwhile, on the main promenade in Davos, Switzerland, some of the biggest storefronts have been converted and taken over by companies like Meta and Salesforce, Tata, also a lot of Middle East countries. And I think the largest was the USA House, which was sponsored by McKinsey and Microsoft. It really felt visually different.

And then Elon Musk being there — Sean, you and I both listened to it. There wasn’t a lot of there there, but I will say that it was interesting that he showed up, because in the past he has avoided Davos.

Anthony: We were trying to pull out the tech content of Davos, [and] there are absolutely things that worth highlighting here, but it’s also striking how, especially as AI has become such a big business story, it’s hard to fully separate that from all the other threads going on in terms of bigger questions about international trade, about world politics.

One of the big headlines coming out of [Davos], for us at least, was the remarks by the CEO of Anthropic, where he basically attacked this Trump administration decision to allow Nvidia to send chips to China. It’s a story that is a tech story, but it’s also a trade story, it’s a politics story.

I think in terms of the substance of what he said, it felt consistent to me in the sense that he’s generally comfortable shooting his mouth off, and also that it’s this interesting line [in AI discourse] where there’s an element of criticism, but it also ties into this really intense AI hype. One of the phrases he used was that an AI data center is like a country full of geniuses. I have questions about that — but he’s like, “How could we possibly send all these chips to China if we’re worried about China? Because essentially we’re sending a country full of geniuses over to China and letting them control it.”

Sean: You could probably fill a notebook with all the different weird phrases that these CEOs use this week. The other one that has been stuck in my mind is that Satya Nadella kept calling the data centers token factories, which is a wonderful abstraction of what he thinks they’re there for.

You know, there were two things that really stuck out to me about all the different things that were said by these CEOs in different parts of the week. One is that they are definitely all sort of sniping at each other — not just Anthropic with Nvidia, which is interesting in its own right, because Anthropic is a huge Nvidia customer and uses Nvidia GPUs, and there’s an interesting tension there. But also just seeing them sitting them next to each other and really kind of pulling, know, putting the knives out a little bit more than we’re used to seeing.

We know that they’re all jockeying to be the lead and that they’re also trying to hold on to talent without overspending themselves to death. And this was one of the first times where it really felt like that tension was palpable and that they were present for it. Those two things are not often true at the same time.

The other thing, to your point about a lot of the geopolitics of it and the business of it — this was the most blatant that I feel like we’ve gotten these CEOs on record as far as what they think they need to continue succeeding.

Satya Nadella — I think you could maybe unfavorably read it this way, but I don’t think it’s that unfavorable — more or less was like, “More people need to be using this or else it’s going to be a bubble and a popped bubble.” He took a much different position in some ways from Dario Amadei of Anthropic, because Nadella’s focus is really about trying to broadly scoop up as much usage as possible [and] how do we make sure that AI is equitable across all these different communities and throughout the globe, versus concentrated in one place, like only the wealthy places, which I thought was an interesting tension. But there is an element of him giving away the game of not really panhandling for usage and more customers … but kind of.

And to that point, Jensen Huang of Nvidia did something similar, where he was more or less saying, “We’re not investing enough in this and we need more investment to be able to make this work.”

Kirsten: Jensen’s comments were interesting because he really talked about it in terms of job creation, and one could give the counterpoint of, there will be a moment where the build out slows, but no one’s really talking about that right now.

The other thing, I think, was a good point that you made, which is we’ve never really seen them all sort of together in a room sniping at each other. Oftentimes you’ll have like Sam Altman at a conference or Satya [Nadella], but here they are all together. So you’re hearing it in real time.

            <h2>Former Googlers seek to captivate kids with an AI-powered learning app</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/24/former-google-trio-is-building-an-interactive-ai-powered-learning-app-for-kids/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Big Tech companies and upcoming startups want to use generative AI to build software and hardware for kids. A lot of those experiences are limited to text or voice, and kids might not find that captivating. Three former Google employees want to get over that hurdle with their generative AI-powered interactive app, Sparkli.

Sparkli was founded last year by Lax Poojary, Lucie Marchand, and Myn Kang. As parents, Poojary and Kang were not able to satisfy their children’s curiosity or give engaging answers to their questions.

“Kids, by definition, are very curious, and my son would ask me questions about how cars work or how it rains. My approach was to use ChatGPT or Gemini to explain these concepts to a six-year-old, but that is still a wall of text. What kids want is an interactive experience. This was our core process behind founding Sparkli,” Poojary told TechCrunch over a call.

Prior to launching Sparkli, Poojary and Kang co-founded a travel aggregator called Touring Bird and a video-focused social commerce app, Shoploop, at Google’s Area 120, the company’s internal startup incubator. Poojary later went on to work at Google and YouTube on shopping. Marchand, who is the CTO of Sparkli, was also one of the co-founders of Shoploop and later worked at Google.

“When a kid asked what Mars looks like fifty years ago, we might have shown them a picture,” said Poojary. “Ten years ago, we might have shown them a video. With Sparkli, we want kids to interact and experience what Mars is like.”

The startup said that education systems often fall behind in teaching modern concepts. Sparkli wants to teach kids about topics like skills design, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship by creating an AI-powered learning “expedition.”

The app lets users explore some predefined topics in different categories or ask their own questions to create a learning path. The app also highlights one new topic every day to let kids learn something new. Kids can either listen to the generated voice or read the text. Chapters under one topic include a mix of audio, video, images, quizzes, and games. The app also creates choose-as-you-go adventures that don’t create the pressure of getting questions right or wrong.

Poojary mentioned that the startup uses generative AI to create all of its media assets on the fly. The company can create a learning experience within two minutes of a user asking a question, and it is trying to reduce this time further.

The startup mentioned that while AI assistants can help children learn certain topics, their focus is not on education. It said that to make its product effective, the first two hires were a PhD holder in educational science and AI and a teacher. This was a conscious decision to ensure its content better serves children, keeping principles of pedagogy in mind.

One of the key concerns around kids using AI is safety. Companies like OpenAI and Character.ai are facing lawsuits from parents who allege that these tools encouraged their children to self-harm. Sparkli said that while certain topics like sexual content are completely banned on the app, when a child asks about topics like self-harm, the app tries to teach them about emotional intelligence and encourages them to talk to their parents.

The company is piloting its app with an institute that has a network of schools with over 100,000 students. Currently, its target audience is children aged 5-12, and it tested its product in over 20 schools last year.

Sparkli has also built a teacher module that allows teachers to track progress and assign homework to kids. The company said that it was inspired by Duolingo to make the app engaging enough that kids can learn concepts and also feel like coming back to the app frequently. The app has streaks and rewards for kids for completing lessons regularly. It also gives kids quest cards, based on the initial avatar they have set up, for learning different topics.

“We have seen a very positive response from our school pilots. Teachers often use Sparkli to create expeditions that kids can explore at the start of the class and lead them into a more discussion-based format. Some teachers also used it to create [homework] after they explain a topic to let kids explore further and get a measure of their understanding,” Poojary said.

While the startup wants to primarily work with schools globally for the next few months, it wants to open up consumer access and let parents download the app by mid-2026.

The company has raised $5 million in pre-seed funding led by Swiss venture firm Founderful. Sparkli is Founderful’s first pure-play edtech investment. The firm’s founding partner, Lukas Weder, said that the team’s technical skill and market opportunity nudged him to invest in the startup.

“As a father of two kids who are in school now, I see them learning interesting stuff, but they don’t learn topics like financial literacy or innovation in technology. I thought from a product point of view, Sparkli gets them away from video games and lets them learn stuff in an immersive way,” Weder said.

            <div id="article-text">Chances are, you’ve seen Richard Tsong-Taatarii’s photo. Taken Wednesday in Minneapolis, it shows an unidentifiable protester face down on the ground; two Border Patrol agents are on top of him, holding him there, while a third unloads pepper spray into his face from just inches away.

Tomorrow’s front page of the Minnesota Star Tribune: Jan. 23, 2026  [image or embed]

The photo ran on the front page of The Minnesota Star Tribune on Friday and already feels like a defining image of the long ICE incursion in Minneapolis—a powerful illustration of how the agency has acted, in broad daylight, with excessive force and impunity.

This is just one example of federal agents terrorizing people in the city. There’s also the photo of a 5-year-old boy being detained outside his home. There’s the video of an agent chasing a teenager through the snow on a residential street as the boy yells “I’m legal” in Spanish. And yesterday, the world saw footage of Alex Pretti, a nurse who worked in the ICU of a Veterans Affairs hospital, as agents pepper-sprayed him, knocked him down, appeared to remove a legally permitted gun from his person, and fired at least 10 bullets into his prone body. (Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino has claimed that the agents were the “real victims” and suggested that they were acting in self-defense.)

There are still unknowns in this case, as there are in many of the chaotic moments that have come out of ICE’s recent surge in Minneapolis. But there are basic facts: Pretti was helping a woman when agents swarmed him. He did not have a gun in his hand. In the past 18 days, agents have used excessive force against numerous people in Minneapolis and killed two of them—first Renee Good, now Pretti. We know about this violence—we can see it ourselves from numerous angles—largely because of video and photographic evidence taken by everyday citizens, many of whom have purposefully set out to make sure that they are recording what is happening for the world to see.

Tsong-Taatarii credits these volunteers, many of whom are trying to protect their neighbors, for his now-famous shot. On Wednesday, Tsong-Taatarii had been following Bovino but realized that was “a wild goose chase,” and was alerted by a group to an escalating situation in South Minneapolis. He drove over and got the photo. When I spoke with him on Friday, he told me that protest observers have set up Signal group chats, which help track agents’ movements across the city. He uses the chats to make sure he can be in the right place at the right time to document what is happening.

If it still is not clear why this matters, compare the documented reality with the Trump administration’s blatant propaganda. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement yesterday that Pretti “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” Similarly, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a “would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement.” Video footage directly contradicts these claims. It shows Pretti holding a phone in his hand, pointing it at an agent after another shoved a woman. He was shot again and again while on the ground.

The full evidence around Pretti’s death has not yet been released. If he was indeed filming agents before he was shot, there is likely first-person footage on his phone. But Pretti’s last seconds were captured from multiple angles, in sickening footage widely distributed on social media and by news organizations. It is able to be seen and dissected online precisely because of the observers who were there to document it, who watched as federal agents piled atop Pretti and who did not drop their phones when the gunshots rang out.

Read: Minneapolis is a Second Amendment wake-up call

The work of observers and photographers in Minneapolis right now is as dangerous as it is crucial, because ICE’s presence in Minneapolis is provoking not only physical conflict but an informational conflict. Agents themselves are pulling out their phones during altercations with protesters. According to The Washington Post, the White House has urged ICE to “produce videos for social media of immigrant arrests and confrontations to portray its push for mass deportation as critical to protecting the American way of life.” Last week, President Trump posted on Truth Social that ICE must “start talking about” the people they’re arresting in Minnesota, writing: “Show the Numbers, Names, and Faces of the violent criminals, and show them NOW.” When the footage doesn’t suit the administration, it seems to have no issue doctoring images to suit its alternate reality, as it did on Thursday. Agents had arrested an attorney who was protesting at a local church, and the White House posted a photo of this woman that was altered, presumably by AI, to make it look like she was crying.

A dark irony of our current age is that there is more video and photographic evidence than ever before, and yet propagandists can coerce or convince others to not believe what they can see with their own eyes. (See also: January 6, 2021.)

If the truth is ever to win out over propaganda, it can only do so in the face of overwhelming evidence, the collection of which has become ever more treacherous in the second year of Trump’s second presidency. But the news and footage of Pretti’s death seems to have broken through the usual informational chaos—at least to some extent. On Reddit, Instagram, and Facebook pages, the videos of Pretti’s last moments appear to have galvanized people who don’t normally engage or post about politics. And it is thanks to the bystander videos of Pretti’s killing that people are trying to hold the administration accountable. This morning, the CNN host Dana Bash referenced the footage in an interview with Bovino, asking him why Pretti was shot after being disarmed. “We’re not going to adjudicate that here on TV in one freeze frame,” Bovino replied. “It’s not a freeze frame,” Bash said. “We’re showing a video of one of your agents taking the gun away. And that happened before Pretti was shot.”

Minneapolis residents are risking their lives to document what is happening to their city. In Pretti’s case, doing so cost him everything. We should believe what we can see with our own eyes. One can only imagine what Miller and the administration might have said about the shooting and Pretti if there weren’t an abundance of footage. Thankfully, because of the observers, the world can see for itself.</div>

            <h2>No Cap: ‘SNL’ Just Killed Gen Z Slang</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-25</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/no-cap-snl-just-killed-gen-z-slang/685754/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On last night’s Saturday Night Live, we learned that time stops for nothing—not people and not language. Marcello Hernández, the cast member perhaps most likely to become SNL’s next breakout star, dropped by the “Weekend Update” desk to inform the Millennial co-anchor Colin Jost—and, by proxy, many Millennial audience members—of the slang terms favored by Gen Z. Hernández kicked off the segment by explaining the term chopped to “older folks” such as Jost. If you, like Jost, thought it was a reference to a cooking-competition show, then it might be time to look into retinol. In fact, chopped means “visually unappealing”—a connotation the young star illustrated with a photo of Jost in middle school.

Hernández, always a sweetheart beneath the bluster, eased up by complimenting Jost on his “glo-up”—going from “‘busted’ to ‘Hear me out, though’” as he progressed into adulthood. When Jost wondered why his co-anchor, Michael Che, wasn’t getting this lesson, Hernández explained that Che already knew all this because “Gen Z slang is African American slang. Basically, Black people start saying something, then young people think it’s cool so they start saying it, then white people say it, and then once Elon Musk says it, it’s over.” Jost, always game to play a befuddled white man in dangerous cultural waters, suggested this might be “cap” (a lie). Sadly, but inevitably, Hernández had to declare that, after passing through the lips of this “Boomer,” cap had “officially passed away.” (The bit cut to a headstone, scored by a flourish of “Taps,” reading Cap: ??–2026.)

SNL was making a pretty sharp point. Slang has originated in the Black community for decades, though etymologies are inherently elusive. Unless a slang term emerges from a popular movie, pinpointing an exact date of birth is difficult (hence the question marks on the tombstone). Cap, more frequently invoked in its negative, no cap, achieved new levels of prominence after the Atlanta rappers Future and Young Thug immortalized it in song. Of course, slang can come from other subcultures. The recently departed SNL cast member Bowen Yang, for example, got a lot of comedic mileage out of gay memes and references; blame him if you’ve recently had to explain to your parents what “poppers” are.

Still, as in the best SNL skits, Hernández poked fun at something broadly true: Slang used by young people often pulls from small circles before going mainstream and being appropriated by elders—resulting in its demise. And one element of SNL’s success, especially in recent years, is its ability to facilitate and benefit from that cultural cycle. This is part of the cruel paradox that Hernández highlighted: The show invokes slang terms to seem hip—and, in doing so, uses up the last of the terms’ currency.

Jost, 43, played his part in this. He asked Hernández to explain slang in a context he would understand: the history of World War II. (The trope of elder fascination with World War II is itself a little long in the tooth.) Hernández said that Hitler came to power after Germany’s economy was “in its flop era,” allowing the historical monster to seize control, only to prove himself a “certified crash out.” “The world’s op” became “high-key overstimulated,” Hernández continued—and so Hitler “low-key unalived himself and then everybody was like, ‘Fahhhhh!’”

“I guess you could say that Hitler was chopped,” Jost surmised—thus killing the term—and then laid waste to lots of other Gen Z terminology: “Stop playing in my face, okay, be so for real. You come to my desk, trying to drag me, when you’re the one sipping the dumb bitch juice? Okay, you must be delulu, boo-boo, because I’m about to crash out right now, fahhhh!”

Hernández regretfully informed Jost that he had just unalived seven more slang terms (which appeared on one last, very wordy tombstone). Depending on your age and pop-culture savvy, this entire endeavor was enlightening, hilarious, or utterly cringe. That’s not an accident; this ambiguity is essential to how SNL now operates.

More than any other popular media institution, the show must constantly reinvent itself to keep a young audience keyed in. Sometimes its evolution is gradual, but then there are seasons like this one, when multiple cast members leave and the transition to a new era accelerates. As new performers and writers join, the pop-culture references will change, and so will the prevailing comedic sensibilities. In the 1990s, the show was often fratty and boorish; in the aughts, it leaned wry and hipsterish; in the 2010s, it was a bit too addicted to social media for its own good; right now it’s still figuring out its next iteration.

This perpetual motion helps the long-running series stay fresh, but it also leads to second-guessing and nostalgia, usually from audience members who feel they are getting aged out of the demo against their will—and who wonder whether terms such as delulu are real or jokes designed to confuse those who can legally drink.

But don’t blame Saturday Night Live for the march of time; judge the show by how it adapts. The challenge for the writers is to find the right balance between seeming hip and coming off as a try-hard (to use a slang term that was mercifully spared last night). This task might seem impossible to get just right; what’s cringe is always in the eye of the beholder. But as Jost proved, sometimes it’s funnier to admit that you’ve passed your pop-culture sell-by date, even as the world, and your show, low-key moves on.</div>

When Alex Pretti went out to protest ICE actions in Minneapolis on Saturday morning, he surely knew that Renee Good had been shot and killed about two weeks earlier. He surely saw at least some of the videos that have been circulating showing confrontations between ICE agents and Minnesotans: an immigration agent kneeing a man while he was already pinned down, another pushing a protester into the street in front of a bus. He surely knew that being white and speaking English without an accent would not protect him, because Good was white and spoke English without an accent. But still, he decided it was important enough to go out there anyway, in subzero temperatures. Pretti ended up in another Minneapolis tragedy, caught on video.

The cultural stereotype is “Minnesota nice.” These past two weeks, anger, persistence, and bravado are also in the mix among residents who have shown up to observe, film, or protest the actions of immigration agents. Pretti’s parents, Michael and Susan, wanted the world to know that their son was a “kindhearted man” and a “good soul.” But in their statement they also called out “Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs” and referred to the “lies” the administration told about their son as “disgusting.”

Trump officials told their own story about Pretti, which is a variation on the one they told about Good. “A would-be assassin tried to murder federal law enforcement and the official Democrat account sides with the terrorists,” Stephen Miller tweeted. President Trump’s statement twice mentioned the “gunman’s gun.” Pretti had a license to carry a concealed weapon. In the many videos of the encounter, the immigration agents surrounding him appear to remove his holstered gun before shooting him in the back.

On this week’s Radio Atlantic, our staff writer Adam Serwer joins from Minneapolis to reflect on the news of the shooting and argue that what’s happening in the city is a form of activism not seen since the 1960s, or maybe even the abolition years—perhaps even earlier. Serwer spent last week in Minneapolis talking with protesters. “They know that ICE has the guns. They know that if ICE kills them, this federal government will call them a terrorist and not even bother to investigate. And they’re still out there. Because they feel very strongly about finding a way to nonviolently resist a federal government that has openly said it’s there to persecute them.” In this episode, we hear recordings from the scene and get Serwer’s perspective on the showdown in Minnesota.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Before we start, a warning: In this episode, you’ll hear audio of a shooting, and you can hear the shots clearly.

Brian O’Hara: Minneapolis police received a report of a shooting involving federal law enforcement in the area of East 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue, on the south side of the city.

Rosin: This is Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara yesterday.

O’Hara:  This is a 37-year-old white male who is a Minneapolis resident, and we believe he is an American citizen—

Rosin: The victim’s name was Alex Pretti, and he was 37 years old. He worked as an ICU nurse at the city’s VA hospital—before he was shot by immigration agents on Saturday morning.

O’Hara: We have not been told any official reports of what has led up to the shooting, but we have seen the video that is circulating on social media.

Bystander: The fuck did you just do? What the fuck did you just do?

Rosin: Pretti was the third person in Minneapolis in just over two weeks to be shot by immigration agents, the second to be killed after Renee Good, who was shot in her car on January 7 by an ICE agent.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey spoke soon after Chief O’Hara.

Jacob Frey:  I just saw a video of more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death. How many more residents, how many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end?

Rosin: After Pretti’s killing, the residents showed up with whistles and cellphone cameras out, a lot of anger and also some pride about how consistently in the last few weeks they have kept showing up, despite the below-freezing weather and the obvious danger.

Rosin: Atlantic producer Jocelyn Frank went out to the scene of the shooting in the hours after.

Jocelyn Frank:  It looks like there’s gas canisters going both directions, forward and backwards, at the crowd.

Frank: The driver just pulled over; it was tear gas.

Rosin: I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. ICE agents have parachuted into different American cities for months, and locals have shown up to protest their presence, but none with quite the force and persistence of Minnesotans.

On Friday, tens of thousands of people participated in a blackout day of protest—no work, no school, no shopping—and a march in subzero temperatures.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has continued to label the protesters “domestic terrorists.”

Hours after Pretti was shot and killed on Saturday, Stephen Miller tweeted, “A would-be assassin tried to murder federal law enforcement and the official Democrat account sides with the terrorists.”

Newscaster (on Fox 9 Minneapolis–St. Paul): We now have a new statement from President Donald Trump. It says, “This is the gunman’s gun,” and it shows the picture of the gun that Greg Bovino just showed in the briefing here to—that DHS posted earlier. So, “This is the gunman’s gun,” writes the president, “loaded”—in parentheses—“(with two additional full magazines!), and ready to go.”

Rosin: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz once again pushed back.

Tim Walz:  Well, as I said last week, this federal occupation of Minnesota long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement; it’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of our state. And today, that campaign claimed another life. I’ve seen the videos from several angles, and it’s sickening.

Adam Serwer:  I was immediately getting different videos from my contacts in Minnesota, who were, like I was, shocked to see what was happening.

Rosin: This is staff writer Adam Serwer, who was in Minnesota on the day of the shooting.

Serwer:   I heard the news that another observer had been shot while I was at a food-distribution site, and one of the first thoughts I heard out loud was people discussing how to route the food around the shooting because people still needed their food, their toilet paper, their diapers. It’s a testament to the commitment of the people who are involved in the mutual-aid stuff that they kept going.

And I think it also accentuates the importance, the risk, and the real selflessness that is involved in being an observer. Because the only reason we know that this happened the way that it happened was because so many people in that neighborhood were also prepared to witness if something terrible happened, and it did, and now we have many videos of it that contradict the direct statements of the federal government about the circumstances of this killing.

Without those videos, we wouldn’t have the kind of evidence that we have that the government is lying. Everybody can see what happened in those videos, and it doesn’t match what the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security are saying, what the president is saying, what the president’s advisers are saying. This was not a man who was being aggressive towards federal agents—he was filming them. And now we know how important it was that he was doing that, but also how dangerous it is and how brave the people who do that are.

I don’t know where it goes from here. But I do think, if nothing else, has awakened Americans to the kind of country we live in now—I hope this does it, and I hope people take it seriously.

Rosin: Adam spent several days in Minneapolis and St. Paul following organizers and volunteers. We spoke to him the night before the shooting to get his perspective on what’s happening on the streets.

Serwer: The type of activism that we’re seeing here is something, I think, we haven’t seen maybe since the 1960s, maybe not since the abolitionists, because what these people are doing—they’re trying to circumvent state power. There’s a very organized, localized resistance to ICE.

Many of the people I met are intensely patriotic people, and they feel that they are defending their country against, fundamentally, an alien force that is trying to destroy their community. They feel like they are filling the void that has been left by the inability of their local politicians to do anything about this.

What people here feel like it is, is just an attempt to shatter this community and ethnically cleanse it of people who Stephen Miller and Donald Trump don’t think should be here. But I also think that Trump has made it very clear—he said, Minnesota’s a “corrupt” state. They didn’t vote for me. And I think he has employed ICE and the Border Patrol as a kind of partisan militia against the parts of the country that he feels are too liberal, too Democratic, and are insufficiently loyal to Donald Trump.

Rosin: So the term partisan militia, which I’ve heard before, I’m curious what that actually looks like in the streets when you’re seeing these protests. How does that show up?

Serwer: Well, I think the point is to terrorize people. You have this woman who was killed, and the federal government has refused to investigate, and they’ve called her a terrorist, and they’ve tried to indict her widow. In some sense, there’s a palpable disgust that this community has responded not by cowering, not by submitting, not by being grateful for this sort of armed invasion that is meant to stress everyone out, but by trying to foil it.

We’re talking about a vast series of operations. It’s very decentralized—in some cases, it’s networks from the George Floyd protests that are coming alive again. And these people, they’re not being violent. They are not trying to spark violent confrontations with ICE. They know that ICE has the guns, they know that they have the mass, and now they know that if ICE kills them, that this federal government will call them a terrorist and not even bother to investigate, and they’re still out there. And they’re still out there because they feel very strongly about finding a way to nonviolently resist a federal government that has openly said it’s there to persecute them.

Rosin: That’s interesting. So you’re saying the very fact that people in Minnesota of all races have come together and unified in this way, like they did on Friday in this mass protest, is further antagonizing the administration—that’s your theory?

Serwer: I think that’s why [Vice President J. D.] Vance was sent. This whole administration is sort of a parody of, like, a women’s-studies class on masculinity. And so these guys come here, and they feel like they have the guns; they have the masks; they have the uniforms; they have the equipment. And all we’ve been hearing about for years is sort of the weakness of liberals who won’t even defend their own ideals, and then they come here, and it turns out that “the libs,” broadly speaking, they turn out to be a lot braver and made of a lot sterner stuff than they expected.

You have ICE agents saying things making reference to [Renee] Nicole Good’s death, like, Didn’t you learn your lesson?, and these people are still out there.

Serwer: And I think that irritates them because it’s a kind of bravery that they did not expect. They did not expect the steel that exists in this community, because they had persuaded themselves that all of these people were weak, that they would submit, that they were “virtue signaling,” that they didn’t really believe in the concept of multiracial community or multiracial democracy. They would stick a sign outside of their house or whatever, right—All are welcome here—but it’s not like they would actually welcome anybody into their homes. And instead, you see this intense sacrifice from people who are neglecting families, jobs just to try and repel what they feel like is an invasion.

Rosin: You’ve talked about the protester side of it. What do you think the Trump administration is trying to accomplish there? ’Cause it’s pretty unusual what’s happening.

Serwer: I think that this community is, ideologically—according to the Trump administration, it should not exist. When you listen to people like Stephen Miller and J. D. Vance talk this, like, blood-and-soil stuff, they imply that you can only have community with people who look like you. So theoretically, a multiracial, multifaith community like Minneapolis and St. Paul, people shouldn’t get along. People should be lonely and atomized and hate each other because they’re so different from each other.

This sort of blood-and-soil nationalism that has taken over the elite of the Republican Party is really a reflection of being extremely online. When you come here to Minneapolis, what you see is people who feel intensely about protecting their neighbors, regardless of who they are.

I have never seen anything like this, and I’ve covered a lot of protests, you know what I mean? I was in Ferguson. I’ve been to protests before; I’ve been to rallies. This is different because it feels like people are actually at risk in a way that they were not before. I wouldn’t have necessarily thought that before Renee Good’s killing and the reaction to it. But now these people all know that something could happen.

And I think that raises the stakes in the fact that people, instead of withdrawing from what they were doing, if anything, what they’ve told me is that these Signal chats where they do patrols or where they organize, they fill up fast because there’s so many volunteers that they have to make new ones because there are limits. So I think responding to that violent incident by becoming more motivated to defy a government that has already made clear how it will treat you in that situation, I do think that’s brave.

Rosin: I see what’s moving you. They know that what they’re risking could be their life. You could get shot in this situation, and they’re doing it—not only are they doing it anyway; they’re doing it, like, tenfold.

Serwer: They’re doing it anyway, and I will say, some of them are scared.

Serwer: When they’re following ICE, when they find an ICE van or an ICE truck, they will follow it around the neighborhood, and eventually, the ICE truck will give up. They’ll get on the highway, and they’ll leave the neighborhood. These people know that they might run into another ICE van; they might get boxed in. The guy might come out and take their picture and be like, I know where you live. I just ran your plate. So these people are scared, but they’re acting anyway. And I think that matters because they don’t have the government on their side.

While the federal government has sort of tried to escalate what they’re doing, these people have all taken trainings where they know exactly where the line is, as far as the law. They’re following traffic laws. They’re trying to hew to establish First Amendment precedent when it comes to what they’re allowed to do. They know what to say if they’re stopped, to say, I have a First Amendment right to observe. It takes bravery to do this. And the fact that they’re scared doesn’t mean they’re not brave. It means they are.

Rosin: When we come back: how race plays into this. Adam makes a case for why it’s significant that the two victims were white.

Rosin: Adam, can you tell me how you see race or identity playing out on the ground in Minnesota, Renee Good’s identity, for example?

Serwer: I think, even in the aftermath of the killing, the focus on her being a woman, being a lesbian, being a white lesbian, liberal woman, that fixation on her identity, I think, is not coincidental. If this is supposed to be this very masculine civilizing mission—you’re coming to the jungle to bring back civilization—the lesbian who writes poetry is braver than you (Laughs.), that probably will set you off, or even that this person is not as afraid of you as they should be, which is not giving you the emotional satisfaction that you wanted from coming down here in a mask and a gun. I don’t think it’s necessarily a coincidence that the first time that someone got killed, that it was a white woman.

I’ve talked to a lot of people who are white who are involved in activism here, and they say things to me like, Whatever privilege I have doesn’t protect me the way I thought it did, but it does protect me more than other people, and I’m going to use it to help them. This is not me saying this—they see themselves as having a racial privilege as white women that it is their duty to use on behalf of other people who don’t have that privilege. This woman who is, like, spending all of her afternoons driving from house to house bringing food to families, to me, that’s heroism.

When people talk about community, you know what I mean, there’s this whole right-wing nationalist theory of community and cohesion, and We can’t let in immigrants from countries that are too different from us because they won’t be cohesive. But then these people don’t feel that way. The people where these people actually live don’t feel that way. The way that they feel is: You’re not gonna take my neighbors from me.

But again, what this is, is these are very diverse communities, and these people feel like they are obligated to put their lives on the line to protect their neighbors.

Rosin: Right, right. Oh, I see. So in some sense, the coming together of people in Minnesota is a rebuke to the nativist argument that, in order to have cohesion, you all have to be the same race.

Serwer: In order to have a real country, you have to all be the same. There’s that anecdote about how Trump said something like, Stephen Miller would like it if everybody in the country looked like him. But Minneapolis is saying, No, that’s not true. That’s not good. That’s not what we want.

And I think that is the exact kind of, sort of, quote, unquote, “woke” sentiment that really drives Trump people crazy. One conservative influencer, after Renee Good was killed, said she was “pro-Somali.”

Serwer: That is some 1860s racism right there.

There’s so much deference from law enforcement and the courts, and the Trump administration has felt very comfortable lying about the nature of incidents that have led to confrontations with ICE, so much so that there have been so many felony cases that have fallen apart because the federal government has misled the courts on the nature of that behavior.

I think it’s worse than the rules have changed. It reminds me of the sort of Jim Crow South in the sense that there are rules that are written down, but you don’t know that, if they break the rules, that anybody will be held accountable for it.

J. D. Vance, the vice president, walked back his statement about absolute immunity that he made in the aftermath of Good’s death. They could say one thing, but they’re doing another, right? He said, If ICE engages in misconduct, we’ll investigate, but they didn’t investigate. They said, She was a terrorist, and said, We’re not gonna look into it.

Rosin: You’ve used the term about Trump authoritarian innovator. Do you feel like there’s some innovation going on right now in Minneapolis and elsewhere?

Serwer: I think the use of federal agents for this kind of semi-occupation is a kind of innovation because he’s been foiled in the courts using the military, who might actually be a lot more disciplined in their treatment of civilians.

Rosin: I see. So it’s, like, the off-brand use of immigration agents, who are supposedly there to find undocumented immigrants, using them against protesters.

Serwer: Yeah, look, and these guys are all kitted up, with their body armor and their green, and there’s a little bit of a cosplay element to it. They are really federal agents, but they look like military for reasons, I think, probably, of intimidation.

Rosin: Mm-hmm. I wanna ask you about the racial-profiling element of this. There was the story of these off-duty Minnesota police who alleged racial profiling by ICE officers, and there’ve been other stories like that. What are you seeing is changing around this question of who you can pick up, how you can decide if someone’s a suspect?

Serwer: Well, there was a Supreme Court emergency-docket case, or “shadow docket” case, involving racial profiling, and the Supreme Court overturned the injunction against ICE, against the federal government doing that.

Rosin: Right, Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh’s argument that agents could stop people based on ethnicity or accent.

Serwer: Right. In Kavanaugh’s concurrence, he’s like, Well, it’s common sense if someone’s in a Home Depot parking lot speaking Spanish that they might not be a citizen. Basically, he’s Elmer Fudd sticking a giant box of dynamite under the 14th Amendment and jumping up and down on the pump. You have just obliterated equal protection of the law.

He tried to walk it back in a recent case, where, like, Obviously, it violates Fourth Amendment to engage in racial—but you can’t walk that back. That genie is out of the bottle. Stephen Miller is out here saying, We’re only taking white refugees and putting travel bans on every non-white country in the world.

It’s very clear what they’re doing: They’re engaged in a demographic-engineering project in order to make America whiter. And to some extent, it’s working. I’ve heard anecdotes from people who are saying that there are people here who have citizenship who are leaving because they don’t wanna deal with it. And I talked to some protesters, and some of them were second-generation immigrants from countries where their parents were like, We came to America so that we wouldn’t have to deal with this, and it’s shocking that it’s just like the place that we fled.

Serwer: And I think that’s extraordinary because Trump keeps talking about how horrible those places are, and in the eyes of these people who fled those places, he is making America more like them.

Rosin: Right, right. I see the ways in which they’re ignoring the rules and doing what they want, but between the Kavanaugh stops, the Kavanaugh ruling, and then this other ruling about what counts as obstruction, what counts as peaceful protest, it does feel like the rules of how people can resist federal authority are actually really shifting right now.

Serwer: They’re definitely trying to do that. There was that protest at the church where they breached the church—the pastor is associated with ICE. And the Justice Department tried to charge Don Lemon, who was there filming the whole thing, and he said, We’re reporting; we’re not here with the activists. He was very clear about that. But the Trump administration wants to make content for its right-wing posters on X. So they’ve been trying to reportedly indict Don Lemon for doing his job.

I think the problem is, as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, it feels like, to a lot of law professors, that a hundred years of precedent has been tossed out, and now the only rule is: Mr. Trump gets what he wants.

Serwer: So there are a number of cases, very big cases, that are gonna be decided soon that are gonna tell us how far the doctrine of “Mr. Trump gets what he wants” goes here, but it certainly feels like that’s the only real constitutional rule anymore.

Rosin: On the one hand, we’ve been talking about some dynamics that are specific to Minneapolis—to its history, to how people came together here. But I wanna ask you about other cities. I’m thinking about Portland, Maine, for example, where immigration agents are deployed right now and which, like Minneapolis, has a Somali American community.

Serwer: What’s happening in Minneapolis is, to some degree, it’s about lessons learned in other cities that have been subject to these kinds of deployments. And I think there’s no reason for them to go to Portland, Maine; they said they were coming to Minnesota to deal with fraud, which obviously makes no sense because the people involved in that—that case is already ongoing.

But it does make sense if you’re like, The president doesn’t like Somali people, which he’s been very clear about. He thinks they’re, quote, unquote, “trash”; he doesn’t want them here. Then, in that context, sending federal agents to Portland, Maine, has some logic to it because, after all, they’re just there to treat Somali Americans like shit—excuse my language. If you’re just racial profiling, if you’re just trying to harm this community, then it makes sense that you would send federal agents to Minneapolis and to Portland.

The justices on the Supreme Court are subject to the same rationalizations that the rest of the conservative movement is in terms of jettisoning their stated values in order to appease Trump. I think their inability to stand up to him is related to that.

Rosin: You wrote a famous headline during Trump’s first term, also the title of your book, The Cruelty Is the Point. Now, that was back in the first term. How do you see that as having evolved?

Serwer: Last week, the Trump administration arrested a prominent Black activist here in Minneapolis who was involved in the protest at that church, and they used AI to Photoshop a picture of her being arrested. She was not crying, and then they used AI to make her look like she was crying when she got arrested. And I think that’s extraordinary because what it said was reality did not provide them with the humiliation of a Black woman who exceeded her station, in their view, that their audience was craving, and so they had to use AI to complete the fantasy. And the fantasy was: Look at this Black woman suffering because we got her.

But I do think that, as an ethos, it’s very clear that they get off on cruelty, that a lot of the people who support them get off on it—not everybody. I think there are a lot of Trump people who voted for Trump who are appalled by this. But for that extremely online far-right audience, they want more of it. It’s not enough.

            <h2>The Logical End Point of Trump Saying He Could Shoot Somebody on Fifth Avenue</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-25</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/maga-second-amendment-minneapolis/685752/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On January 23, 2016, Donald Trump notoriously declared, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters.” That statement was understood at the time as a metaphorical expression of the depth of Republican voters’ commitment to him. Ten years and one day later, his administration’s agents shot a disarmed man on the street in full view of the public. Perhaps we should have taken him not only seriously but also literally.

The dynamic Trump observed is that he had created a bond with his supporters that no outside facts could break, even something as blatant as a cold-blooded killing on an American street. And that is the nub of the crisis into which we have plunged over the past decade. All politicians spin and distort to some extent, of course. Trump’s innovation was to grasp that, because the conservative movement had trained its devotees to ignore mainstream media and rely completely on information supplied by its own loyalists, his ability to control his supporters’ perceptions effectively had no limit. And because his supporters would believe anything, he could do anything.

After Customs and Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis yesterday, the Trump administration immediately branded him a “domestic terrorist.” The specific allegation it employed to support this hyperbolic charge was that, because Pretti was carrying a firearm while filming and then clashing with agents, he intended to massacre federal officers. Even if that were true, it still would not remotely justify the fact that, according to multiple videos of the incident, agents shot Pretti after they had pinned him to the sidewalk and disarmed him.

Until very recently, conservative rhetoric has valorized gun ownership as a bulwark against tyrannical government, to the point of fetishization. Conservatives defended Kyle Rittenhouse as a hero for bringing a rifle to a chaotic protest in Wisconsin during the summer of 2020, as well as armed bands of protesters who marched into state capitol buildings during the COVID lockdowns.

Tyler Austin Harper: Minneapolis is a Second Amendment wake-up call

For Trumpists to infer homicidal intent from the exercise of a right they have fetishized is a Fifth Avenue–level mental reversal. Their view of the Second Amendment turns out to be no different from their view of the First: one whose protections apply exclusively to themselves.

The administration’s immediate use of the terrorist label should be understood not just as a hyperbolic accusation of intent but as an umbrella term it applies to political opposition generally. “There is a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism in this country,” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has written. “It is well organized and funded. And it is shielded by far-left Democrat judges, prosecutors and attorneys general. The only remedy is to use legitimate state power to dismantle terrorism and terror networks.”

Miller wrote that message in October. His definition of terrorism does not require imputing specific motives to protesters who own a gun or, like Renee Nicole Good, drive a car. He has called forth state power on a scale that is coming to resemble the piecemeal extension of martial law. The more abusive the power of the state, the more angry people will become, which the administration then uses as a pretext to crack down harder.

The administration’s allies, not all of whom wish to directly endorse summary executions, have played along with his logic, treating protesters’ reaction to the crackdown as though it were its cause.

“For months, radical progressive politicians like Tim Walz have incited violence against law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their jobs,” the National Rifle Association wrote in a statement yesterday. “Unsurprisingly, these calls to dangerously interject oneself into legitimate law-enforcement activities have ended in violence, tragically resulting in injuries and fatalities.”

Read: The truth about ICE’s recruiting push

“The Left is in a cycle of constant self-radicalization—the resistance to ICE creates the predicate for tragedies that are used to justify ever-more resistance and the demand for the de-facto nullification of federal immigration law in Minneapolis,” National Review’s editor in chief, Rich Lowry, wrote on X.

In reality, Minnesotans are taking to the streets to warn passersby of ICE’s actions and to record them because, as multiple reporters have documented, federal immigration agents appear to be routinely violating the law. Democratic Party leaders in the state have urged residents to record activity in order to produce a record of these acts. That is why Pretti was holding his phone, not his gun, when he intervened to protect a woman being tear-gassed by CBP agents, who then killed him.

The phone, not the gun, is the weapon the administration fears. The phone produces evidence of its agents’ misconduct, which is what the administration seems determined to destroy. Officials’ insistence that citizens who record agents are provoking violent retribution is a justification for what is becoming a very literal war on truth.

If Trump himself, and not just one of his agents, actually shot somebody on the street, we can guess what would happen. He would call the victim a terrorist. His allies would say the victim had provoked their own death and blame Democrats for inciting the violence. A decade ago, Trump intuited at some level that the end point of his power to command the minds of his followers would be a killing on the street. What was once seen as a joke has attained the status of a prophecy.</div>

            <h2>Yes, It’s Fascism</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-25</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Until recently, I resisted using the F-word to describe President Trump. For one thing, there were too many elements of classical fascism that didn’t seem to fit. For another, the term has been overused to the point of meaninglessness, especially by left-leaning types who call you a fascist if you oppose abortion or affirmative action. For yet another, the term is hazily defined, even by its adherents. From the beginning, fascism has been an incoherent doctrine, and even today scholars can’t agree on its definition. Italy’s original version differed from Germany’s, which differed from Spain’s, which differed from Japan’s.

I accepted President Biden’s characterization of the MAGA movement as “semi-fascist” because some parallels were glaringly apparent. Trump was definitely an authoritarian, and unquestionably a patrimonialist. Beyond that, though, the best description seemed to be a psychological one propounded by John Bolton, Trump’s first-term national security adviser: “He listens to Putin, he listens to Xi, he listens to how they talk about governing unburdened by uncooperative legislatures, unconcerned with what the judiciary may do, and he thinks to himself, Why can’t I do that? This doesn’t amount to being a fascist, in my view, [or] having a theory of how you want to govern. It’s just Why can’t I have the same fun they have?”

Writing a year ago, I argued that Trump’s governing regime is a version of patrimonialism, in which the state is treated as the personal property and family business of the leader. That is still true. But, as I also noted then, patrimonialism is a style of governing, not a formal ideology or system. It can be layered atop all kinds of organizational structures, including not just national governments but also urban political machines such as Tammany Hall, criminal gangs such as the Mafia, and even religious cults. Because its only firm principle is personal loyalty to the boss, it has no specific agenda. Fascism, in contrast, is ideological, aggressive, and, at least in its early stages, revolutionary. It seeks to dominate politics, to crush resistance, and to rewrite the social contract.

Over Trump’s past year, what originally looked like an effort to make the government his personal plaything has drifted distinctly toward doctrinal and operational fascism. Trump’s appetite for lebensraum, his claim of unlimited power, his support for the global far right, his politicization of the justice system, his deployment of performative brutality, his ostentatious violation of rights, his creation of a national paramilitary police—all of those developments bespeak something more purposeful and sinister than run-of-the-mill greed or gangsterism.

When the facts change, I change my mind. Recent events have brought Trump’s governing style into sharper focus. Fascist best describes it, and reluctance to use the term has now become perverse. That is not because of any one or two things he and his administration have done but because of the totality. Fascism is not a territory with clearly marked boundaries but a constellation of characteristics. When you view the stars together, the constellation plainly appears.

Demolition of norms. From the beginning of his first presidential run in 2015, Trump deliberately crashed through every boundary of civility; he mocked Senator John McCain’s war heroism, mocked fellow candidate Carly Fiorina’s face, seemingly mocked the Fox News host Megan Kelly’s menstruation, slurred immigrants, and much more. Today he still does it, recently making an obscene gesture to a factory worker and calling a journalist “piggy.” This is a feature of the fascist governing style, not a bug. Fascists know that what the American Founders called the “republican virtues” impede their political agenda, and so they gleefully trash liberal pieties such as reason and reasonableness, civility and civic spirit, toleration and forbearance. By mocking decency and saying the unsayable, they open the way for what William Galston has called the “dark passions” of fear, resentment, and especially domination—the kind of politics that shifts the public discourse to ground on which liberals cannot compete.

Glorification of violence. Every state uses violence to enforce its laws, but liberal states use it reluctantly, whereas fascism embraces and flaunts it. Trump thus praises a violent mob; endorses torture; muses fondly about punching, body-slamming, and shooting protesters and journalists; and reportedly suggests shooting protesters and migrants. His recruitment ads for ICE glamorize military-style raids of homes and neighborhoods; his propaganda takes childish delight in the killing of civilians; and we have all seen videos of agents dragging people out of cars and homes—partly because the government films them. Like the demolition of civic decency, the valorization of violence is not incidental to fascism; it is part and parcel.

Might is right. Also characteristic of fascism is what George Orwell called “bully-worship”: the principle that, as Thucydides famously put it, “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” This view came across in Trump’s notorious Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump showed open contempt for what he regarded as Ukraine’s weakness; it came across explicitly, and chillingly, when Stephen Miller, the president’s most powerful aide, told CNN’s Jack Tapper: “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world that have existed since the beginning of time.” Those words, though alien to the traditions of American and Christian morality, could have come from the lips of any fascist dictator.

Politicized law enforcement. Liberals follow the law whether they like it or not; fascists, only when they like it. Nazism featured a “dual state,” where, at any moment, the protections of ordinary law could cease to apply. Trump makes no secret of despising due process of law; he has demanded countless times that his opponents be jailed (“Lock her up!” chants, with his endorsement, were a prominent feature of his 2016 campaign), and he has suggested the Constitution’s “termination” and said “I don’t know” when asked if he is required to uphold it. His single most dangerous second-term innovation is the repurposing of federal law enforcement to persecute his enemies (and shield his friends). No prior president has produced anything like Trump’s direct and public order for the Justice Department to investigate two former officials, or like his blatantly retaliatory prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James. “At least 470 people, organizations and institutions have been targeted for retribution since Trump took office—an average of more than one a day,” Reuters reported in November (and today one can add others to the list, beginning with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell). Had Trump done nothing else, his demolition of independent and apolitical law enforcement would still have moved the U.S. government closer than ever before to a fascistic model.

Dehumanization. Fascism draws its legitimacy from its claims of defending the people from enemies who are animals, criminals, brutes. Trump characterizes (for instance) political opponents as “vermin” and immigrants as “garbage” who are “poisoning the blood of our country” (language straight out of the Third Reich). Vice President Vance, as a senator, endorsed a book called Unhumans (a title that refers to the left). And who can forget his false claim that Haitians abduct and eat pet cats and dogs?

Police-state tactics. Trump has turned ICE into a sprawling paramilitary that roves the country at will, searches and detains noncitizens and citizens without warrants, uses force ostentatiously, operates behind masks, receives skimpy training, lies about its activities, and has been told that it enjoys “absolute immunity.” He more than doubled the agency’s size in 2025, and its budget is now larger than those of all other federal law-enforcement agencies combined, and larger than the entire military budgets of all but 15 countries. “This is going to affect every community, every city,” the Cato Institute scholar David Bier recently observed. “Really almost everyone in our country is going to come in contact with this, one way or the other.” In Minneapolis and elsewhere, the agency has behaved provocatively, sometimes brutally, and arguably illegally—behaviors that Trump and his staff have encouraged, shielded, and sent camera crews to publicize, perhaps in the hope of eliciting violent resistance that would justify further crackdowns, a standard fascist stratagem. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s recent appearance with a sign reading One of ours, all of yours seemed to nod toward another fascist standby, collective punishment—as did the administration’s decision to flood Minneapolis with thousands of officers after residents there began protesting federal tactics, a prioritization that was explicitly retributive.

Undermining elections. Trump’s recent musing that there should be no 2026 election may or may not have been jocular (as the White House has maintained), but he and his MAGA supporters believe they never lose an election, period. They went to great lengths to overturn the 2020 election, as the prosecutor Jack Smith’s indictment of Trump and subsequent report detail ad nauseam. Rigging, stealing, or outright canceling elections is, of course, job one for fascists. Although Trump is term-limited, we must not expect that he and his MAGA loyalists will voluntarily turn over the White House to a Democrat in 2029, regardless of what the voters say—and the second insurrection will be far better organized than the first.

What’s private is public. Classical fascism rejects the fundamental liberal distinction between the government and the private sector, per Mussolini’s dictum: “No individuals or groups outside the State.” Among Trump’s most audacious (if only intermittently successful) initiatives are his efforts to commandeer private entities, including law firms, universities, and corporations. One of his first acts as president last year was to brazenly defy a newly enacted law by taking the ownership of TikTok into his own hands. Bolton understood this mentality when he said, “He can’t tell the difference between his own personal interest and the national interest, if he even understands what the national interest is.”

Attacks on news media. Shortly after taking office in 2017, Trump denounced the news media as “the enemy of the American people,” a phrase familiar from dictatorships abroad. His hostility never relented, but in his second term, it has reached new heights. Trump has threatened broadcast licenses, abused his regulatory authority, manipulated ownership deals, filed exorbitant lawsuits, played favorites with journalistic access, searched a reporter’s home, and vilified news outlets and journalists. Although Trump cannot dominate news media in the United States in the way that Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has done in Hungary, he is running the Orbán playbook. No other president, not even Richard Nixon (no friend of the media), has used such blatantly illiberal tactics against the press.

Territorial and military aggression. One reason I held out against identifying Trumpism with fascism in his first term was Trump’s apparent lack of interest in aggression against other states; if anything, he had seemed shy about using force abroad. Well, that was then. In his second term, he has used military force promiscuously. Of course, many presidents have deployed force, but Trump’s explicitly predatory use of it to grab Venezuela’s oil and his gangster-style threat to take Greenland from Denmark “the easy way” or “the hard way” were 1930s-style authoritarian moves. The same goes for his contempt for international law, binding alliances, and transnational organizations such as the European Union—all of which impede the state’s unconstrained exercise of its will, a central fascist tenet. (Mussolini: “Equally foreign to the spirit of Fascism … are all internationalistic or League superstructures which, as history shows, crumble to the ground whenever the heart of nations is deeply stirred by sentimental, idealistic or practical considerations.”)

Sally Jenkins: What Leni Riefenstahl’s work reveals about fascism

Transnational reach. Like authoritarians generally, fascists love company; the world is safer for them if there are more of them. In his second term, Trump has broken with long-standing U.S. policy by dialing back support for human rights while praising and supporting authoritarian populists and illiberal nationalists in Serbia, Poland, Hungary, Germany, Turkey, El Salvador, and Slovakia, among other places—and by being weirdly deferential to the strongman Russian President Vladimir Putin. Even more striking is his de facto alignment against America’s liberal allies and their parties in Europe, which he holds in contempt.

Blood-and-soil nationalism. A fascist trademark is its insistence that the country is not just a collection of individuals but a people, a Volk: a mystically defined and ethnically pure group bound together by shared blood, culture, and destiny. In keeping with that idea, Trump has repudiated birthright citizenship, and Vance has called to “redefine the meaning of American citizenship in the 21st century” so that priority goes to Americans with longer historical ties: “the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War,” as he put it, or people whom others on the MAGA right call “heritage Americans.” In other words, some Americans are more volkish than others.

White and Christian nationalism. While Vance, Trump, and MAGA do not propound an explicit ideology of racial hierarchy, they make no secret of pining for a whiter, more Christian America. Trump has found many ways to communicate this: for example, by making clear his disdain for “shithole” countries and his preference for white Christian immigrants; by pointedly accepting white South Africans as political refugees (while closing the door to most other asylum seekers); by renaming military bases to share the names of Confederate generals (after Congress ordered their names removed); by saying that civil-rights laws led to whites’ being “very badly treated.” In his National Security Strategy, he castigates Europe for allowing immigration to undermine “civilizational self-confidence” and proclaims, “We want Europe to remain European,” a rallying cry of white Christian nationalists across the continent. Taking his cue, the Department of Homeland Security has propagated unashamedly white-nationalist themes, and national parks and museums have scrubbed their exhibits of references to slavery.

Mobs and street thugs. The use of militias and mobs to harass, rough up, and otherwise intimidate opponents is a standard fascist stratagem (the textbook example being Hitler’s Kristallnacht pogrom in 1938). As few will need reminding, the Trump-MAGA parallel is the mob and militia violence against the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Trump knowingly laid groundwork for this operation, calling on militia forces to “stand back and stand by” in September 2020 and later dog-whistling “Be there, will be wild!” to his supporters. His pardon of all of the Capitol attackers—more than 1,500, including the most violent—only proved what we knew, which is that they had his blessing. While Trump has found state violence adequate to his purposes so far in his second term, street violence is self-evidently in his repertoire.

Leader aggrandizement. Since 2016, when he declared that “I alone can fix it” and bragged that his supporters would remain loyal if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue, Trump has cultivated a personality cult. Although some of his efforts at self-aggrandizement can seem comical (the gilding of the Oval Office, the renaming of the Kennedy Center, the proposed triumphal arch), he understands the centrality of leader worship in a fascist-style regime. In sharp contradistinction to the American presidential tradition since George Washington, he makes no pretense of serving the people or the Constitution. His mindset, his symbolism, and his rhetoric all underscore the point he made to The New York Times this month: his own mind and morality are the only limits on his global power. This is Fascism 101.

Alternative facts. As Orwell, Hannah Arendt, and practically every other scholar of authoritarianism have emphasized, creating a reality-distortion field is the first thing a fascistic government will do, the better to drive its own twisted narrative, confuse the citizenry, demoralize political opponents, and justify every manner of corruption and abuse. While other presidents (including some good ones) have lied, none have come close to Trump’s deployment of Russian-style mass disinformation, as I detail in my book The Constitution of Knowledge. From the start of his first term, Trump has made “alternative facts” a hallmark of his governing style, issuing lies, exaggerations, and half-truths at a rate of 20 a day. Predictably, his second term has brought more of the same. Following his lead, a MAGA-fied postmodern right gleefully trashes objectivity as elitism and truth as a mask for power.

Maria Ressa: Fight fascism before it’s too late

Politics as war. A distinctive mark of fascism is its conception of politics, best captured by Carl Schmitt, an early-20th-century German political theorist whose doctrines legitimized Nazism. Schmitt rejected the Madisonian view of politics as a social negotiation in which different factions, interests, and ideology come to agreement, the core idea of our Constitution. Rather, he saw politics as a state of war between enemies, neither of which can understand the other and both of which feel existentially threatened—and only one of which can win. The aim of Schmittian politics is not to share the country but to dominate or destroy the other side. This conception has been evident in MAGA politics since Michael Anton (now a Trump-administration official) published his famous article arguing that the 2016 election was a life-and-death battle to save the country from the left (a “Flight 93” election: “charge the cockpit or you die”). In the speech given by Stephen Miller at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, MAGA’s embrace of Schmittian totalism found its apotheosis: “We are the storm. And our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion … You are nothing. You are wickedness.”

Governing as revolution. Although born in revolution, the American liberal tradition, especially its conservative branch, prizes continuity, stability, and incremental change guided by reason. Fascism, by contrast, “is not reactionary but revolutionary,” as Mussolini insisted. It seeks to uproot and replace the old order and embraces bold, exhilarating action unshackled to rational deliberation. MAGA embraces its own revolutionary ethos, what Russell Vought, the administration’s Office of Management and Budget director and probably its most formidable intellect, has called “radical constitutionalism,” a doctrine that would vitiate many checks on presidential power. In pursuit of this vision, Vought told Tucker Carlson in a November 2024 interview, “The president has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible, with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle that [federal] bureaucracy and their power centers” because “the bureaucracies hate the American people.” He predicted, “If you have a radical constitutionalism, it’s going to be destabilizing … But it’s also exhilarating.” He said he would put federal agencies “in trauma,” an idea echoed by Christopher Rufo, an architect of Trump’s attack on universities, which Rufo described as a “counterrevolution blueprint” to put universities “in an existential terror.” As Trump shuttered a congressionally mandated agency, renamed an international body of water, arrested an op-ed writer, deported immigrants to a foreign gulag, terrorized American cities, threatened an ally, and more, he showed how it looks when a radicalized state abandons rational deliberation and goes to war against itself.

One can object that there are elements of classical European fascism that are not found in Trumpism (mass rallies and public rituals, for example)—or that there are additional elements of Trumpism that belong on the list (MAGA’s hypermasculinity, misogyny, and co-option of Christianity all resemble fascist patterns). The exercise of comparing fascism’s various forms is not precise. If historians object that Trump is not a copy of Mussolini or Hitler or Franco, the reply is yes—but so what? Trump is building something new on old principles. He is showing us in real time what 21st-century American fascism looks like.

If, however, Trump is a fascist president, that does not mean that America is a fascist country. The courts, the states, and the media remain independent of him, and his efforts to browbeat them will likely fail. He may lose his grip on Congress in November. He has not succeeded in molding public opinion, except against himself. He has outrun the mandate of his voters, his coalition is fracturing, and he has neglected tools that allow presidents to make enduring change. He and his party may defy the Constitution, but they cannot rewrite it, thank goodness.

Read: How to tell if your president is a dictator

So the United States, once the world’s exemplary liberal democracy, is now a hybrid state combining a fascist leader and a liberal Constitution; but no, it has not fallen to fascism. And it will not.

In which case, is there any point in calling Trump a fascist, even if true? Doesn’t that alienate his voters? Wouldn’t it be better just to describe his actions without labeling him controversially?

Until recently, I thought so. No longer. The resemblances are too many and too strong to deny. Americans who support liberal democracy need to recognize what we’re dealing with in order to cope with it, and to recognize something, one must name it. Trump has revealed himself, and we must name what we see.</div>

And someone actually asked Stallman:  Should I use Emacs over Vi?  Stallman answered...  &quot;As long as it&#39;s a free version of Vi, then there&#39;s no moral reason one way or the other.  

&quot;But Emac loves every user and will be  sad if you don&#39;t love it back.&quot; 

At the end of the event, Stallman auctioned off an autographed hardcover copy of  Free Software, Free Society: Selected Essays of Richard M. Stallman, an Emacs manual -- and a gnu-shaped stuffed animal (which went for $260).  But towards the end, 72-year-old Stallman was asked &quot;What do you hope to accomplish in the next 10 or 20 years with this movement...&quot;  HIs answer? 

&quot;Well, sad to say, I probably won&#39;t see what happens in the next 10 years. I&#39;m getting old. I may still be alive in 10 years. But I wouldn&#39;t count on that. It&#39;s not going to be up to me for that long.&quot; 


He also said, more generally, that &quot;we don&#39;t have enough control over the situation to be able to plan for specific goals. 

&quot;We can plan for what direction to push in.&quot;

Directly below this story is one about Congress failing to repeal the kill switch mandate for cars.  Maybe the guy is on to something.

And he is the only one to be consequent. Most people here know about enshittification, know why ToS are unfair to users and hugely in favor of companies and know that most proprietary software includes anti-features working against the users. Many here are old enough to remember when virus scanners found &quot;adware&quot; and know every app does not only contain ad frameworks, but also tracking frameworks and sometimes other ways to monetize your device.

Still most choose convenience and just accept it the way it is. You may have a custom ROM for Android, but did you uninstall the Playstore? And if you did, are you still avoiding any non-free apk? What about your Google account? Dropbox? Some of the Meta social media? Windows? Apple? I don&#39;t know if I know about any paranoid nerd but Stallman who 100% stands by his word and manages to avoid all these things.

A smartphone is a handheld ARM-based computer with crappy controls and an unusual network adapter, a cellular modem. All but a few of them come with shitty closed OSes, but the same is true of desktop computers. He should try a Purism Librem 5 for example.

There is nothing inherent to a smartphone that makes it an Orwellian surveillance and tracking device any more than there is anything inherent to a desktop computer that makes it an instrument of Microsoft&#39;s control over users.

&quot;And they also make mistakes without batting a virtual eyelash. So you can&#39;t trust anything that they generate.&quot; - woah! That&#39;s damning! Thank goodness that doesn&#39;t apply to humans!

Seriously, anyone who is down on this technology needs to hand in their nerd/geek card and go and start shouting at clouds. That goes for Slashdot readers too. The handwringing over a technology by middle aged men is, just sad. This tech is transforming, dirty, gritty, and messed up. It&#39;s like the Internet used to be. If you can&#39;

The whole point is that if we want accuracy, we use machines. If I wanted fiction and unreliability, I&#39;ll ask humans. If I want to calculate an integral, I don&#39;t want an RNG infused answer that might or might not be wrong.

The techology is really cool, it&#39;s not AGI, but it has it&#39;s place and uses, but with a few issues: 1) it&#39;s pay-to-win: the ones with the deepest pockets can make the best product 2) privacy issues - all your data gets siphoned and sold to the highest bidder 3) you unskill yourself by using

For them to mention something about illegal immigrants driving and this will get rubber stamped through.

Yeah, all Dems voted against repealing this &quot;kill switch&quot; law i.e.  for allowing law enforcement to disable people&#39;s cars.  Maybe tell them that ICE will get the kill switch to disable the cars of illegal aliens, and watch all those 211 Dems flip their votes

It ultimately boils down to property rights, which are increasingly getting eroded in this country.  Whether it&#39;s homes, computers, phones, TVs, cars or any asset one may own
Whoooaah, Nelly. 
The Democrats voted against a spending bill that had the repeal tacked on as a rider.  I don&#39;t know what was in the spending bill, but that&#39;s important context.  If the bill was &quot;Investing In Grinding Up All Pet Dogs To Put In Big Macs&quot;, I&#39;d hope they&#39;d be voting against it even if there were good things attached. 
That said, the mandate bill Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021 was tabled and passed in a Democrat presidency, and contained a bunch of important spending for roads and transport.  Both parties argued over it for a while and unfortunately I can&#39;t find which one injected that the vehicle-disabling wording. 
But... what I did find was some debate that the time, which indicates that the mandate is regarding vehicles detecting a driver is drunk, then disabling it.  Apparently remote disabling isn&#39;t what it mandates.  The wording of the section is included at the end of my comment here.  Now, I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m in favor of even that.  But I have a hard time saying I&#39;m against it.  If the detection technology were flawless, I&#39;d definitely be in favor.  My only concern is reliability. 
So it turns out the topic is complicated and has been made deliberately more so by the jackasses that keep tacking it onto the side of spending bills. 

SEC. 24220. ADVANCED IMPAIRED DRIVING TECHNOLOGY.


(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
  (1) alcohol-impaired driving fatalities represent approxi-
mately 1 /3 of all highway fatalities in the United States each year;
  (2) in 2019, there were 10,142 alcohol-impaired driving fatalities in the United States involving drivers with a blood alcohol concentration level of .08 or higher, and 68 percent of the crashes that resulted in those fatalities involved a driver with a blood alcohol concentration level of .15 or higher;
  (3) the estimated economic cost for alcohol-impaired driving in 2010 was $44,000,000,000;
  (4) according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology can prevent more than 9,400 alcohol-impaired driving fatalities annually; and
  (5) to ensure the prevention of alcohol-impaired driving fatalities, advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology must be standard equipment in all new passenger motor vehicles.


(b) DEFINITIONS.—In this section:

  (1) ADVANCED DRUNK AND IMPAIRED DRIVING PREVENTION TECHNOLOGY.—The term ‘‘advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology’’ means a system that—
     (A) can—
        (i) passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired; and
        (ii) prevent or limit motor vehicle operation if an impairment is detected;
     (B) can—
        (i) passively and accurately detect whether the blood alcohol concentration of a driver of a motor vehicle is equal to or greater than the blood alcohol concentration described in section 163(a) of title 23, United States Code; and
        (ii) prevent or limit motor vehicle operation if a blood alcohol concentration above the legal limit is detected; or
     (C) is a combination of systems described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).

  (2) NEW.—The term ‘‘new’’, with respect to a passenger motor vehicle, means that the passenger motor vehicle—
     (A) is a new vehicle (as defined in section 37.3 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulat

Don&#39;t worry, someone will write some code that disables this function.

The way to prevent drunk driving is to punish drunk driving, not jam more buggy technology into vehicles that can be misused. Instead, so something like this: First offense of drunk driving is a mandatory misdemeanor conviction, $5,000 fine, a diversion program, and installation of an interlock device for a year. Second offense is a felony conviction, $10,000 fine,  license suspension for 30 days (maybe a jail term), and 5 years of an interlock device. Third offense is a jail term and license suspension, ma

I find your ideas intriguing and wish to subscribe to your newsletter.

In Washington drunk driving is an automatic 1 year suspension of license, misdemeanor conviction, and fine on **first offense**.  We still have drunk drivers killing people, including ones who already lost their license.  Just doesn&#39;t work any better than outlawing heroin has.

It&#39;s so cute you thought &quot;property rights&quot; were meant for you and me.  The ruling class has always had a desire to own everything and return to feudalism or slavery.  Capitalism is/was a modern way to amass wealth and property, while providing scraps and limited opportunity to &quot;climb the ladder&quot; for us plebs while the ruling class figures out the next government/religion/financial method to stay in control.

Ideally, the kill switch exists, but the kill switch is not something that can be activated by LEO&#39;s, but only something that can be activated by the dealership. So they need to identify the vehicle, who owns it, and then ask the owner for permission to &quot;kill it&quot;, and the dealership can hand over the frequency and password to LEO kill switch signal. No permission, no kill switch.

If someone reports their vehicle stolen, they can hand this information over so the dealership can disable the car

Hard to believe in this environment of authoritarian overstep, Congress would advance a mandate that enables &quot;law enforcement&quot; to disable your car.

Because it was tied to this https://www.congress.gov/bill/... [congress.gov]

Except that the party overwhelmingly opposed to this &quot;authoritarianism&quot; - the Dems - unanimously voted against repealing that mandate.  The only 164 who voted for it were all from the GOP
I consider Dems that voted against repealing the kill switch legislation to be traitors to liberalism. Giving governments kill switches and the means to spy on our daily activities is NOT what I call liberal.Then again, it seems that a lot of Dems in positions of power are only too eager to sell out to the highest bidder; witness Newsom saying whatever he thinks his current audience wants to hear, and the ongoing support of many Dems for the Palestinian genocide.

Yes, the Democrats are far from perfect and this amendment isn&#39;t great, but JFC learn how to understand imperfect choices instead of continuing like it&#39;s sports and you just want to root for your team.

Personally, I&#39;d keep giving them fake files.

It seems to be the way to go. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if low-mileage early-2000s economy cars quickly escalate to the cost of new cars. (They&#39;re halfway there already from the auctions I&#39;ve looked at.)

Not exactly the same thing, but I also bought a low-end ca. 2018 DSLR at the pawn shop recently. I should probably get another, maybe mid-range model to future-proof my ability to take and store my own photos. Because the camera manufacturers are no longer making anything sub-$1000.

Just buy one.  There is and will likely always be a market for &#39;classic&#39; cars and they will be cheaper than the new ones that have all the modern tech innovations.

My car built in 2021 has no connectivity. I know because when I disconnected the battery the time did not self set. The previous owner did not buy the navigation package either.

There’s also nothing stopping anyone from disconnecting the cell antenna on their car.

It is not about a remote kill switch, it is drunk driving detection.

The headline just calls it a kill switch, the article calls it &quot;impaired-driving prevention systems&quot;, which is close to what the law calls it.

The requirement is for creating a policy that has passive alcohol estimation (breath, skin, whatever) and driving patterns typical of drunk driving.

Sure... they&#39;re going to call it an &quot;impaired driver prevention system&quot; to get the technology approved. Of course, what it will really be used for is remotely disabling cars when their owners are more than 14 days behind on car payments.

There is over 1 1/2 Trillion dollars of car loan debt in this country now, and the auto makers know that there will be millions of additional repossessions the next time the economy takes a bad turn. Rather than pay repo men to clean up this mess, it&#39;s far easier to remotely

Aftermarket remote kill switches already exist.  If anything, the only people who have to worry about remote kill switches are the repo men, since they&#39;ll be out the work if it&#39;s easier/cheaper for the lender to electronically disable a customer&#39;s car until they pay up.  There really is no situation where you don&#39;t pay, but get to keep driving the car.

The real issue with mandating this technology is that it&#39;s yet another point of failure/false positives.

Monitor diver behavior? Maybe just have a lifeguard on duty for those hillbilly hot-tubs.

My fingerprint reader on my phone works 90% of the time and my car&#39;s radar collision alarm goes off for no reason in normal traffic about twice a year.

Imagine if it caused my car and every other one on the road come to an uncontrolled stop for no reason twice a year.

bad, bad, really bad, double plus ungoodIt will kill new car sales and make used cars very expensiveHopefully hackers will find workaroundsIt&#39;s not about safety, it&#39;s about more government control

&quot;..while those in favor argue that it could prove to be lifesaving.&quot;

Banning cars &quot;could prove to be lifesaving&quot;, why not that?

Universal healthcare &quot;could prove to be lifesaving&quot;, why not that?

Cars exist for a reason, driving exists for a reason.  Elon Musk has proven that technology to save lives is likely to do the opposite.

This is not a remote âoekill switchâ. Decision to disable the car is done internally and only when it is stopped. The argument against this is the odds of false positives and false negatives, try to remain in reality if you want to win.

Ah, yes. &quot;Not remote&quot; in a car that more likely than not has a remote network access. Sure, the default will be &quot;not remote&quot;, but do you really think they will not have that one ready?

The truth hurts. People too dumb to understand what moderation is actually for notwithstanding.

For those whose data happens to be MS Office files, and who for some reason or other can&#39;t switch to LibreOffice or Google Docs/Sheets/Slides.  But yeah, since the CPU under is not x64, I won&#39;t claim that there are legacy hardware and software that will run under Windows 11 here

Some of us have jobs and don&#39;t live in a bubble.

VMs are not security isolation. Even if often advertised as such. As they increase complexity, they decrease security. There is now a long trail of &quot;VM breakout&quot; vulnerabilities and I predict these will not go away.

A big win for &quot;compatibility&quot; indeed! And finally, you do not have to think about data on your phone being better protected (maybe), because that is a thing of the past! Hence also a great win for simplicity!

We can get answers in seconds.But are they the right ones?

Or use AI and pick one. You know which one.

That thing is so badly broken that apparently the user numbers for Win10 are raising and the ones for Win11 are falling.

As to Linux, well. It is a phone. For small things, you can always use things like Termux. For large things, it is probably the wrong platform.

Windows 11 isn&#39;t broken. It&#39;s just twisted, contorted, hijacked, and stupid.

I loved my old Windows Phone. It was a phone that ran full Windows with Office. You could dock it and use it as a workstation. This was 8 years ago!!!

That type of use has been a part of Android for years.  Probably iPhone, too, but I&#39;m not sure.

Nah, the only thing that was better probably were cheaper drugs, other than that the Office for Windows Phone (later renamed to Windows 10 Mobile, than Windows 10 -even if it had nothing in common with &quot;the real&quot; Windows 10 - and then killed) was a pathetic joke. Even compared with the current Android MS Office, which is in fact worse than the web version.

You can already by a similar thing from Elecrow [elecrow.com].

It&#39;s essentially a monitor that accepts HDMI or video over USB-C, and a USB keyboard and trackpad in a laptop form-factor.  You can hook up a phone or a Raspberry Pi to turn it into a working laptop.

OK, didn&#39;t know that.  I plan on using mine with a Pi 5, so it should be fine.

for a phone that runs Linux natively - and no, Android doesn&#39;t qualify as Linux merely because it uses the kernel. I also need to be able to plug it into a docking station and use it the same way I use my laptop. And it has to be viable as a daily-use phone, so the Pinephone doesn&#39;t work for me.

I might be able to compromise on my wants a bit for the NexPhone, if it could be completely de-Googled and if I could totally nuke the Windows partition and reclaim the wasted space it occupies. But I suspect that&#39;s

How does that make any sense? First, how many people even have a backup phone? And, second, for that small number who do - wouldn&#39;t they want their &quot;do it all&quot; phone to be their primary phone?

The real reason for the very out-of-date hardware is almost certainly they couldn&#39;t make the economics work with up-to-date components.

Otherwise it might very well replace the Android bootloader with it&#39;s own on an update, discover there&#39;s not enough room, and brick the phone completely.

Nuclear Power is inherently CHEAPER than fossil fuels, not more expensive.

No. It is not. You are apparently going for a BIG LIE here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie). Makes you a fundamentally bad person.

Also nice is the invalid comparison. Because what people _actually_ are building is renewables. And there nuclear reveals that it is nothing but a fundamentally bad idea.

People are building &quot;renewables&quot; because they&#39;re subsidized.

People aren&#39;t building nukes because governments deliberately make them expensive.

I&#39;m not entirely sure the latter is a bad thing given that Nothing Works Any More and I don&#39;t trust people to be competent enough to keep nukes working safely. But it&#39;s very clear that the power generation industry has nothing to do with what makes logical or financial sense and is largely driven by government policies.

People are building &quot;renewables&quot; because they&#39;re subsidized.In general they are not subsidized.

And bottom line that does not matter anyway. Renewables, hence the name, do not need fuel. So except for maintenance, they have no running costs.

If I put up a solar or wind plant in ether Germany or Thailand: I do not get any subsidized, unless YOU jump up and gift me some. Need my paypal? You are welcome!

People are building &quot;renewables&quot; because they&#39;re subsidized.Not a single power plant in the world has been built without subsidy. None what so ever.People aren&#39;t building nukes because governments deliberately make them expensive.That&#39;s just false which is plain to see in countries which don&#39;t have bureaucracy where it is still incredibly fucking expensive to build. Nuclear power plants may look simple on the surface, but they are an engineering marvel to behold and priced accordingly.

Indeed. But nuclear power has basically never been built without massive amounts of government money (i.e. taxes) and never with insurance coverage while running. Tells you the quality level of the &quot;investment&quot; rather nicely.

As a side note: Nuclear power _can_ be insured. That it cannot be is a direct lie, often repeated. But insurers look at the actual risks, not some hallucinated numbers like &quot;1 large accident expected in 1M years&quot; or similar lies. Hence even only publishing the cost to insure nuclear pow

&quot;This is a massive mis-statement, if not a lie by omission. nuclear power is known for one thing - having lower operational costs.&quot;But to &quot;compete on cost&quot; you have to consider ALL costs.  The &quot;lie by omission&quot; here is yours.

&quot;It is &#39;expensive&#39; for one reason - government regulations/paper work.&quot;That, and what those regulations are for.  They are cheaper to make when you accept that a cost of doing business is calamities, but governments don&#39;t agree.

&quot;Nuclear has far more regulations than coal. &quot;Not an argument for reducing regulations, not matter how hard it is for you to accept.

&quot;Much of this cost is that each nuclear power plant is a &#39;bespoke&#39; / unique design.&quot;Citations please.

&quot;The main idea of a small nuclear reactor is that it would solve the regulation/paper work by creating an &#39;approved&#39; module that can then be created repeatedly without new paperwork every time.&quot;Then why complain about regulations or claim that they are the problem?

&quot;If this happens, then most of the expense to build a nuclear power plant will vanish, leaving only the significantly cheaper operational costs.&quot;Then the fact that a nuclear expert feels that &quot;this&quot; will not &quot;happen&quot; should tell you something.

&quot;Nuclear Power is inherently CHEAPER than fossil fuels, not more expensive. It is only the set up and regulatory costs that are massive. Ignoring this factor is ignoring the entire idea of small nuclear reactors.&quot;And promoting this falsehood is ignoring reality.

Nuclear can&#39;t get insurance. The potential liability is so high that no commercial insurer will touch it. Governments have to back it.

Therefore the subsidies for nuclear are infinite. Unlimited, free insurance. The cost is potentially astronomical. Fukushima is on track for half a trillion Euros in direct costs, let alone the indirect ones.

The only answer I&#39;ve ever got to this is &quot;ours won&#39;t melt down, trust us bro.&quot;

This is a massive mis-statement, if not a lie by omission. nuclear power is known for one thing - having lower operational costs.I know other people have pointed out that this is a lie, but that is not the worst thing about it. It is also a deliberate attempt to misdirect from the one thing nuclear power is actually known for — when it goes wrong, it goes very wrong.

Nuclear power goes wrong, a few hundred square miles are uninhabitable for hundreds of years.Fossil fuels go right and the planet is uninhabitable

If only there were a third option that doesn’t cause climate change and doesn’t render hundreds of square miles of land uninhabitable if it goes wrong

They are, however, saying that the costs of climate change will be very high, possibly making equatorial regions uninhabitable, disrupting food production potentially resulting in mass starvation in some regions, and the possibility of sea level rise meaning as many as a billion people losing their homelands and becoming refugees.But that&#39;s not the same as &quot;the planet becoming uninhabitable.&quot;

It is &#39;expensive&#39; for one reason - government regulations/paper work.

The game here is to pretend this is all stupid overhead, imagine hundreds of lawyers toiling away to ensure proper punctuation to satisfy humorless bureaucrats who of course know nothing and only live to make life difficult for real he-man nooklular engineers.

A serious person would ask what the alternative would be. And for many projects, that would be an insurer, who would do the exact same thing - tell you to make various modifications, or you would pay significantly higher premiums to cover the risk, or maybe not get insurance.

The problem is private insurers won&#39;t accept the risk, because the costs are potentially existential for them. So the only insurer you can find is a government, who can nullify local victims&#39; legal claims.

But if you have a non-corrupt government, they&#39;re going to make you make it safe. Like, lots of money safe. And notice, shit still happens with these things.

So in reality, what dudebro here is asking for is the right to run take risks with other peoples&#39; health by running potentially dangerous things for private gain, and also wants to be indemnified if he hurts them.

And it is all bundled up in a little whiny bitch about stupid regulations.

I don&#39;t think any reasonable government would allow a private insurer to insure nuclear, because realistically none of them have enough money to pay out the potential liabilities.

They&#39;re two petrostates that are working particularly hard to reduce their use of fossil fuels.

Before starting a local nuclear power industry Korea did a thorough study of the global industry and decided to basically copy US NRC regulations. They had the option to start from scratch and create a new regulatory framework but they decided to go with one that had experience behind it and known weak spots documented.  I don&#39;t track that part of the industry closely any  more but my understanding is that Korean nuclear operational and safety requirements are now tighter than those of the US.

So, yes, coal plants produce radioactive waste. It is very low concentration, and hence a relatively small health risk per ton of coal burned, but since we burn billions of tons of coal per year, cumulatively we can conclude that yes, it had definitely killed people.

Yeah the pesky government regulations is also a reason you can&#39;t do tooth implants for $300 in my basement and instead have to pay 3K at a proper dentist.

Every SMR install will be bespoke too. It will need a geological survey, cooling pool, and all in a containment building. Of course, you need waste storage, and the whole site has to be secure and accessible by emergency services.

The cost savings from mass producing the reactors won&#39;t be large, and likely wiped out by the higher fuel/waste costs. Plus, you need several of them to equal one larger reactor.

You are convienently adding the word &quot;operating&quot; to costs.  The Life-Cycle Cost of Energy for nuclear is way too high compared to the alternatives.

For nuclear energy to be economically viable there needs to be one or two designs that are built at scale-- but to reach that scale (say >100 SMRs per design per year) the ramp-up cost (and risk) is unworkable.  The first mover advantage isn&#39;t even there because from initial funding to initial operation of the first unit you have at least 10 years of time pass

So business as usual for the nuclear assholes. Seriously, we need to start ignoring these people. All they do is massive damage.

Where and what &quot;massive damage&quot;? Be specific.

&quot;The amounts available are limited and the supply chain has been dominated by Russia&quot;

Somehow I doubt the russians are supplying fuel for the SMRs in Nato nuclear submarines.

They&#39;re not even close to dominating it. Just another BS error in this supposed &quot;factual&quot; article.

Err yeah they are. Are you thinking of Uranium? That&#39;s not what this is about nor what SMRs run on. There is currently a single commercial supply of HALEU (what SMRs use for fuel), and that is a subsidiary of Rosatom. ONE SINGLE SUPPLIER on this globe. Just one. Uno. Ein. Or more correctly &quot;Odin&quot; since that one supplier is Russian.

Centrus Energy in the USA is trying to break this monopoly and has to date managed to produce 20kg from a pilot plant to the DOE. That small chunk makes them the number 2 supplier

As of now the Russians very much do have a monopoly. There&#39;s a single company in the world providing HALEU (the fuel for SMRs) commercially, and it&#39;s a Rosatom subsidiary.

But the USA and UK have plans in place to start production, the US has Centrus Energy which built a pilot plant that currently has produced fuck all, and the UK want a plant up and running in the next 6 years. Until either is operational on a commercial level Russia has an absolute monopoly on supply.

Naval reactors run on HEU because they need to be compact, have high power density, and rapidly change power level because they&#39;re being used for propulsion, and that&#39;s the most practical way to meet the requirements.  We&#39;ve spent decades trying to phase out use of HEU in any reactors where it isn&#39;t absolutely necessary to meet requirements (e.g. adapting research reactors to use LEU or MOx fuel, and shutting down older power reactors that used HEU).  There&#39;s no way the proposed commercial SMRs will be allo

HEU is restricted to military systems because in principle it could be diverted for use in making a crude, but functional, nuclear bomb. HALEU would require isotope separation, which is a difficult process and easier to detect.It is HALEU, not HEU, that is being proposed for the small plants.

Yes, but look at the comment I replied to [slashdot.org]:

They&#39;re the ones saying that naval reactors need the same fuel as these proposed SMRs.  I was pointing out that naval reactors use different fuel.

To build bombs too. Of course it did it&#39;s always that they Underestimated just how fucking crazy and senile Trump is. They also underestimated how much Putin is willing to murder and hurt and kill his own population for his stupid boyhood dreams of imperial America. Because of that they got caught flat footed. They could turn to nuclear but they don&#39;t trust their private sector to do it safely after Fukushima and they don&#39;t trust their voters to keep it in the hands of the government.

because the orange one has a hate boner for wind

Just wait 3 years and he&#39;s history (assuming none of his coup attempts work).

That’s an exciting assumption but feels quite brave, tbh

Although JD Vance may not have a particular hateboner for wind he&#39;s still a fossil fuel industry lapdog like all the other Republicans, and they&#39;ve already demonstrated a willingness and ability to pay more money for dirtier energy sources.

Then you pick one of the half dozen battery technologies that are cheap at scale for a large installation and call it a day.Or better yet, wait a few months and then maybe you can pick a set of super-safe batteries with a crazy charge/discharge rate that cost the same as li-ion but last multiple centuries:  https://electrek.co/2026/01/14...

Hey I&#39;m close enough to those evil unamerican strawmen you mentioned and would like to suggest that on days with insufficient renewable power+reserves in batteries, people should take a day off and just chill.It would be like the covid lockdown, but with fewer deaths and restriction to socialising.

I&#39;ll get some AI help to do the maths to compare that to adding nuclear plants when my Solar generation is a bit more productive - maybe in 3 weeks.

Can&#39;t I host it in some 3rd hand Dell desktop down here in my old nan&#39;s basement?

When your Orange Jesus gives us WW3 because CNN&#39;s camera angle made his ass look fat, that&#39;s all that will be left.

The sun gives off free energy daily and we have devices that collect this energy passively and convert it to electricity. Energy free for the taking. Only a fool would turn that down.

Communist and socialist climate cultists won&#39;t be satisfied until everyone works by LED light, and everything is powered by wind turbines and solar with storage.FTFY, comrade! :D

But the equipment and techniques and materials for fusion are so exotic today - still beyond know engineering capabilities in fact - it is discouraging as to it ever providing cheap energy.

I love the idea of fusion, and hope it could become a cheap abundant power supply, but the huge difficulty with it is that the energy from the only fusion reaction we have any hope of igniting, D-T, produces most of its energy in the form of energetic neutrons. Since neutrons are uncharged, it is difficult to turn that into actual useable power, and very difficult to shield from them. What they do accomplish is to turn everything exposed to them radioactive.

Admiral Rickover&#39;s presentation on paper reactors vs real reactors is as applicable today as when he first gave it in 1953.

Thanks for that. An interesting read, especially given who he was and his role

The point is that Big-&quot;Tech&quot; is not trying to get cheap electricity. If they wanted that, they&#39;d invest in solar, wind and storage.

The point is that they know that the AI-bubble will burst, but they cannot admit it... as that would make the AI bubble burst immediately. After the burst they will need a lot less power as the profitable bits of it are a) just a small fraction, and b) tend to not need frontier models or huge data centers.Now by &quot;investing&quot; in some questionable technology, like &quot;SMRs&quot; or other t

biggest challenge nuclear has is competing with natural gas ... there is still stigma around nuclear waste

But apparently no stigma about greenhouse gasses.

Of course there is. Which is why we don&#39;t build nuclear. The lifecycle cost of a nuclear plant causes them to produce 50gCO2/kWh of generation thanks to the insanely complex construction of a nuclear power plant. Yeah still less than nat gas, but far more than actual green alternatives.

Also CO2 emissions are a problem today for which we need short / immediate term solutions. If you want nuclear plants, build a time machine and go get construction started 30 years ago. As of right now *any* nuclear plant you

As Nancy Pelosi said, &quot;we&#39;re capitalists&quot;...we all still gravitate to the cheapest solution that meets standards, and were long-willing to put up with the health effects of coal, ignore the whole climate-thing, to get it cheaper.David Roberts in Vox, in 2019, covered the MIT study that worked out just how very cheap batteries must get to make intermittent a baseload-replacement:https://www.vox.com/energy-and... [vox.com] ...turned out to be $20/kWh for CAPEX, back in 2019.  So that&#39;s $25/kWh in 2026.

Sodium-ion batteries are widely predicted to reach down to that price in a few years, less time than it takes to build a reactor.  That&#39;s if Form Energy, now selling in test batches, doesn&#39;t get there first with their with &quot;iron air&quot; batteries.

If the batteries can be produced, and work in the field (they are so far, batteries are the hot new grid purchase for 2026), then both fossil and nuclear projects will fail to find investors.  That&#39;s capitalism for you.

The only dodge around it is to appeal for government subsidy on some ideological grounds.  That&#39;s what renewable champions had to do until their solution became cheaper; and it was a hard sell, let me tell you.

Why would you need batteries to replace *baseload*, though? You need batteries to replace peakers, not baseload. You’re looking to get through lulls, you’re looking for dispatchability, these are not what baseload is.

Batteries already beat peakers at substantially higher prices than the $20 figure you mention. I did some maths on this the other day. In the UK:A 100MW gas peaker would have capex of about £40m, while a BESS is closer to £60m. But that £20m is dwarfed by opex, bec

Not an expert in the area but they seem to have no trouble paying some expert to say whatever they want said.

I&#39;ve not heard an expert confidently say they are affordable; mass production is kind of laughable - the whole market place is not large enough for what people usually consider huge gains by mass production... vendors have to produce at a high scale which requires multiples more demand than the threshold to make mass production viable - a monopoly would have the lowest threshold...

Um, isn&#39;t trying to go the &quot;cheap&quot; route on Nuclear power, historically, a bad idea?

As long as schools are narrowly focused on just results, I believe this will become the norm for human thinking. When these children graduate, they&#39;ll continue to have access to the tools that allow them to get the results they need for life. Their way of operating in the world will become ubiquitous and, sadly, most people won&#39;t care. It all seems so dystopian to me.

It&#39;s inevitable that it will be used in adult life, but school still teaches subjects that have been replaced by digital. We have had calculators for over 50 years, but we still teach hand and mental calculation. Same with handwriting, pencil/painting art, foreign languages.We must ensure that AI can be used in some classes, but not all. I see that schools still rely on paper and pencil, and that phones are being banned from classroom, so many countries are on the right trajectory.

One mode is your personal area of expertise. You could be a web app programmer, or biomedical researcher, or welder, or plumber, or whatever. You have all the knowledge you need to participate in your field without help.

The other side is &quot;everything else&quot;. You use AI to get you by the tasks you need to accomplish, because it&#39;s too difficult or onerous to go and read the documentation for everything.

Wanna bet that most schools will do it wrong and just use it to do more crappy teaching cheaper?

It is not about large companies or not. It is about students versus educators and how to deal with omnipresent tools for cheating that are hard to detect and reliable with the solutions for homework-level exercises. Either you learn the game or you lose, the decision if you want to play is already made by the students.

We could discuss about how much we dislike it, but that&#39;s pointless so we discuss the fact that it is there and that it is used and that we cannot reliably prevent it, and talk about how to be

A lot of scut work can definitely be done by AI, but you should not consider more trustworthy than an Intern.   It should not be trusted with:

If you want to protect children from AI, you&#39;re going to have to educate them about how AI fails. Not accidentally, by letting them use it and experience those failures by themselves because they might not run into them or might not understand them, but with directed age-appropriate education about how it works. Kids need to understand that getting into the van with the candy also has other consequences.

Now for something entirely different (allusion to Monty Python)...now NVidia, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc. will now fund a study to release a report about how AI is a great asset in schools, etc. The benefits of AI/ML are reminiscent of the studies about coffee in the 1980s and 1990s. First bad for you, drink de-caf. Then de-caf is bad for you drink coffee, and the band plays on...

New report says Coke tastes better than Pepsi.

From what I&#39;ve read across nearly all end user AI stories are 2 main things.1. AI is meant to replace a certain type of previously human only task2. AI supplements a knowledge worker&#39;s efficiency

To focus on point 2, you can&#39;t be truly efficient with AI if you are not knowledgeable enough in the source material to cut through poor or incomplete AI output or input proper iterative prompts.  Without that, your likely spending more time cleaning up after AI and doing actual research/data gathering when you probably could have done it yourself from the outset.

... that bypassing the long established and fairly well working path of distributions with something that&#39;s essentially &quot;download a binary and run it&quot; with no actual reviews could actually lead to something that&#39;s less secure than what you had before.

Neither option is very good. Linus spoke about how much effort is wasted in traditional repos, and how they cause version and dependency issues. That&#39;s part of the reason why things like Docker are so popular.

Snaps may be crap, but so are all the other options.

It&#39;s not difficult to avoid installing a fake clone program, but the automatic updating by default presents an enormous attack surface. Disable auto-updating:

Or just don&#39;t use Snap at all, one of several reasons I run Mint on my machines.  And even Mint is, unfortunately, relying on containerized packages for a significant portion of software from Ubuntu repos.  But at least Mint provides native packages for all of the important stuff (Firefox, LibeOffice, GIMP, Audacity, VLC, Geeqie, Okular, Thunderbird, Pluma, Guvcview, Kdenlive, Wine, Meld, Claws, etc).

It is likely either LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition) or just plain Debian is in my future, though.

There were more docker images with Bitcoin miners than Debian packages with Bitcoin miners.

Indeed. But people are stupid and not capable of seeing what the &quot;shiny new thing&quot; actually is.

Curating a store or package repository in general takes lots of effort, I don&#39;t think volunteers can hack it in today&#39;s environment. Snaps and flatpacks are the biggest target, but this could just as easily happen for distro packages. Only Apple makes that kind of money from the store itself to pay for it.

For Linux on the desktop to escape hobbyism you need complete ecosystems with large revenue streams. Like Google, but I think it&#39;s possible without it being quite so closed. Ideally Valve would buy Ubuntu and launch a Chromebook-like certification program for Steam phones, laptops and PCs.

One of the main aspects why Linux systems were more secure than Windows were people taking responsibility. If I install a package from my distribution, the maintainer is responsible for it. If the upstream does not fix a security bug, the maintainer may disable the affected feature altogether, because he takes the responsibility for the package being safe

If the vendor uploads an own package to snap or flatpak, there is no person from my trusted distribution responsible, but I am trusting a vendor I

Corruption?  In an unregulated market??  I&#39;m shocked, shocked I tell you!Why is this even a story?  It&#39;s less uncommon these days than &quot;dog bites man&quot;.

Package management seems better. At least for my needs.Not so much snap this, flatpack that, docker something else.

Nothing is perfect, but FreeBSD makes a better desktop than many people might expect.

In my experience traditional package-based, repo-based Linux applications have a very small chance of being infected by malware. Since Ubuntu manages the Snap Store, why can&#39;t they apply the same vetting process that has kept the traditional repos so safe for so many years?

I totally get the hate for stand-alone applications and the love for package-based ones. But I LIKE the ability to run stand-alone executables. I don&#39;t want the majority of my system to be that way, but sometimes there&#39;s a program - or a

Early Saturday morning in downtown Minneapolis, 37-year-old Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents in full public view. Within hours, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officials released a familiar statement: an agent, they said, had acted in lawful self-defense against an armed and violent agitator. According to this narrative, Pretti instigated the violence that led to his death. A multitude of videos filmed by witnesses from multiple angles show this to be a lie.

They show Alex Pretti holding up his phone, filming as masked ICE and CBP agents shoved demonstrators and sprayed pepper spray into the crowd. They show an agent shoving a woman in the street. They show Pretti stepping forward, without striking anyone or reaching for a weapon, attempting to shield the woman from the agent’s blows. They show an agent spraying Pretti directly in the face with chemical irritant. They show Pretti being tackled to the ground. They show six or seven agents piling on top of him, striking him while he lay immobilized. And then, they show one agent removing Pretti’s licensed handgun—which he was carrying in compliance with state law—from his waistband.

Then, while he remained pinned to the pavement, helpless beneath a mass of armed bodies, gunshots rang out. Agents scattered, and one of them appeared to clap. Pretti did not get up. This is not self-defense. It is much more akin to an execution.

Pretti was a licensed, law-abiding gun owner, registered nurse, and worked at a veteran’s hospital.

The sequence of events matters, not only because it starkly contradicts the official account, but because it exposes how the language of self-defense has been distorted to the point that it now functions as a near-automatic exoneration for state violence. When authorities invoke “self-defense” today, they rarely describe a factual necessity. They are deploying a rhetorical shield with deep historical roots and devastating contemporary consequences.

Just weeks earlier, on January 7, Renee Good was shot three times and killed by an ICE agent as she attempted to flee in her car. In that case, too, officials framed the killing as justified and necessary, as self-defense rather than aggression. In that case, too, video evidence and eyewitness accounts—including an agent muttering “fucking bitch” after the shooting—raised serious questions about the agents’ alleged “fear for their lives.” There is little to suggest that lethal force was unavoidable in this case, and yet Donald Trump’s Department of Justice is refusing to investigate the killing as a homicide. Instead, they are investigating Good’s widow. The pattern should be clear: use an empty claim of self-defense to exonerate the shooter, and then frame the victim as the perpetrator.

What we are witnessing is not a series of isolated tragedies. We have reached the logical endpoint of a political and legal culture that has long distorted claims of vulnerability, of “reasonable fear,” in the service of power, conflating aggressive, state-sanctioned violence with necessary self-protection.

From the nation’s founding, claims of self-defense have been used to justify extraordinary brutality. Systematic colonial violence against Indigenous nations was routinely rationalized as necessary to the protection of settler families and communities. Entire Indigenous communities were eradicated under the guise of lawful defense, with Indigenous resistance labeled “Savage Wars,” as a confrontation among equals rather than a genocidal onslaught.

After the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan organized itself “to maintain forever the supremacy of the white race.” At the center of their mission lay the claim that white society required urgent protection from formerly enslaved people. Their founding documents emphasized “the sacred duty of protecting [white] womenhood” from sexual violence, with violence as necessary.

This mandate of protection congealed into widespread racial terror, claiming the lives of thousands of Black men, women, and children between Reconstruction and the mid-twentieth century. The Equal Justice Institute estimates that 4,400 lynchings took place during this time period, which was also characterized by legalized segregation, mass disenfranchisement, economic coercion, and sexual violence perpetrated against Black women. And yet, when anti-lynching bills appeared before Congress—again and again—white leaders defended ritualized, spectacular acts of racial terror as a regrettable but necessary response to generally false claims of sexual violence by Black men against white women.

This “rape-lynch” mythology, “that Negro men rape white women” was a “threadbare lie,” as journalist Ida B. Wells painstakingly documented in 1892, and she was almost murdered for speaking the truth. But truth was never the point. The claim of self-defense functioned as a form of camouflage to shroud the economic, political, and social project of keeping Black Americans subordinate under a blanket of legitimacy. It worked because enough people were willing to accept it, to pretend that racial terror was necessary to (white) public safety.

A similarly pernicious logic has insulated law enforcement from legal accountability for generations. Police violence, no matter how extreme, is routinely reframed as a defensive reaction to a threat rather than aggression. “The officer feared for his life.” “The suspect was reaching…for something.” “The situation escalated quickly, and the officer had no choice but to shoot.” The language is reflexive, ritualized, and remarkably effective. It is baked into our nation’s DNA to frame the victims of state-sanctioned violence as perpetrators.

In recent decades, that logic has been codified into law and expanded to select citizens through “Stand Your Ground” laws and permissive gun regulations that collapse the distinction between defense and dominance. These laws encourage armed confrontation while removing the legal duty to retreat or de-escalate. They transform subjective fear into legal justification while inviting ordinary citizens to imagine themselves as lone sentinels in a hostile world, as heroic “good guys with guns,” and as “Armed Citizens” exercising their Second Amendment rights. The laws reward those who act on that fantasy with legal immunity.

But only when they are acting in the service of repressive power. By all accounts, including the video evidence, Alex Pretti was a law-abiding, good guy with a gun, who stepped in to protect an unarmed woman from an assault. He did not draw his weapon, nor did he attack the agents who disarmed him before shooting him multiple times while he was pinned to the ground.

What is new today is not the twisted rhetoric of self-defense, but its escalation, and its targets. Masked federal agents, many of them poorly trained, now patrol public streets with military-grade weapons and broad discretionary authority. They detain, assault, and, increasingly, kill people based on vague or erroneous claims of public safety. They do so while invoking the same exonerating language that has long enabled state violence.

For generations, public state violence has been normalized precisely because it was disproportionately inflicted on non-white people, immigrants, low-income and other marginalized individuals. Many learned to look away or to justify this violence as the necessary price of “law and order.” Part of race and class privilege was the capacity to see such violence as a regrettable but necessary byproduct of maintaining order and keeping “us” safe.

We are now witnessing—some of us in incredulous horror—what happens when a society confuses authority with innocence and violence with virtue. We have built legal doctrines that reward escalation. We have granted weapons to institutions without demanding restraint. We have taught ourselves that “good guys” with guns will keep us safe from “bad guys.” Maybe now we are learning that the boundary separating the two was never clear in the first place.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

On Thursday, I ended my day on daycare patrol as the windchill crept close to 25 degrees below zero. The patrols began after ICE appeared at my son’s daycare two weeks ago; that same day, a daycare worker for the same provider was taken by agents at a nearby location while trying to get in to work. During my recent patrol, ICE agents were spotted in the neighborhood, as they nearly always are, but everybody made it out of the building safely.

As I write this, a helicopter is circling over my neighborhood, as happens most days now. My phone is pinging near constantly with alerts from Signal groups that exist to defend and support our community. A friend texted to ask how concerned we should be that the president will invoke the Insurrection Act and send the military into our city; my husband just learned that workers at a nearby small business were taken by the government; a friend’s school went on lockdown today because ICE was nearby.

Our neighborhood has never been more united, but you wouldn’t know it from how few people are out on the streets. Nobody opens their door anymore, knowing that the next knock might be a federal agent demanding to know where the Brown people live in your neighborhood. People are making a point to support immigrant-owned restaurants, but you have to check if they’re open before you go, because so many aren’t. Folks are out delivering food and essentials to neighbors who are unable to leave their homes for fear, but they have to be careful to use a different car than they drive when they’re observing ICE, because the government is tracking license plates.

Earlier this week, students in our city lost  two days of learning because schools closed—the teachers needed time to shift to the virtual learning model which began on Thursday. This time, it’s not because of an unknown and deadly illness; it’s because the government is attacking our students. People are being shipped out of the state so fast that their families don’t have time to get to their holding cell with the paperwork proving they’re legally authorized to be here before they’re gone.

The horrors have not ceased since Renee Good’s death, instead they have increased. Protestors are being attacked and shot. On Tuesday, a five-year-old was detained by ICE and used to bait his family into leaving their home. The preschooler and his father have now been sent to Texas, and it is unclear if or when they’ll return. On Thursday, multiple civil rights leaders, including Saint Paul Public School board member Chauntyll Allen, were arrested for exercising their First Amendment right to protest, in a DOJ action that the NAACP has said was a likely violation of First Amendment rights. And on Saturday, Alex Pretti was killed by ICE agents, shot multiple times at close range. Every day, there is a new horror to process, a new way in which the federal government inflicts irreparable harm on our community.

I serve as a Saint Paul City Councilmember, and our community is under a violent attack at the hands of the federal government. And so we are fighting back in all the ways we know how.

On January 12th, Saint Paul announced a joint lawsuit with the city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota against the Department of Homeland Security, seeking to end this unconstitutional operation. Our City Council is working to strengthen our separation ordinance and develop other legal tools to make certain that our city resources—including our police department—cannot and will not support the work of immigration enforcement. We are calling on the governor to declare a state of emergency and enact a state-wide eviction moratorium to ensure that nobody loses their home because the federal government is making it impossible for them to earn a living. Every elected official in our city is working to connect our residents with whatever support they need right now. We are also demanding that Congress act—that our representatives and senators use every tool at their disposal to end this occupation—because neither cities nor states alone have enough tools to protect our people from the federal government.

None of this feels like enough. Individually, none of it is. But what we know from other countries that have successfully defeated authoritarianism is that democratic resurgence is possible. Over the last 30 years, 52 percent of “autocratization episodes” were followed by democratic resurgence. In 90 percent of those cases, countries were ultimately as or more democratic than they were previously.

In Saint Paul and across Minnesota, we’re showing that we have what it will take to win. We are cultivating solidarity and pushing back through every channel that we have—and building more capacity to fight for our community every day. We are demonstrating our commitment to nonviolence, even in the face of incredible levels of violence being used against us. We might get tired, but we are not succumbing to despair. Our civil resistance movement is strong, and it is growing.

Most importantly, we know what we’re fighting for, because we’ve already lived it. Saint Paul has always been at its strongest when we’ve embraced our immigrant neighbors. Minnesota has always been at its best when we’ve built structures that allow everybody in our state to flourish, whether they’ve been here for months or for generations. This is a place where we take seriously Paul Wellstone’s immortal words that “we all do better when we all do better.” The cruel, painful world that Donald Trump is trying to force on us is not one that we will ever, ever settle for. The path ahead is not clear, but we will continue to put one foot in front of the other until the day we win.

Shortly after 9 a.m. Saturday morning, my wife Julia woke up from a nightmare that federal agents were trying to break into our home, one of many nightmares she’s had since I was arrested by ICE, detained for 8 hours, then released without charges. I had been peacefully observing ICE when it happened, like so many Minnesotans have over the past weeks and days. That morning, she instinctively checked our neighborhood group chat. For the third time this month, someone in Minneapolis has been shot by federal agents. This time it had happened a mile from our home, to a man I would learn was Alex Pretti.

We haphazardly dressed in our cleanest warm clothes. As we opened our car doors we saw neighbors of ours, who we’ve never spoken to, doing the same. The entire neighborhood was converging. As we approached the intersection where Alex was shot 10 times, we heard chants of “ICE out” ringing out on Nicollet Ave, known locally as ‘Eat Street’ because of its dozens of globally minded restaurants.

What normally would have been an intersection full of chilly Saturday morning brunch-goers had become something akin to a warzone, as federal agents tried to break up the protestors gathered around the site of the shooting, at the intersection of Nicollet and 26th Street. Our presence, our bodies, were the only sign of solidarity and resistance we could offer, so that’s what we did. Agents assembled with weapons of war, and all we had was our outrage and our cameras.

We stood in the cold for a couple of minutes as the crowd swelled. At one point, someone threw a snowball at an agent. Two agents started chasing the man who’d tossed it westbound down 26th St. I tried to follow, but then heard an explosion from behind me. Flashbangs and chemical weapons were being shot or thrown into the crowd. I fled.

My sister-in-law, Eva Rose, who also lives nearby and also came to the intersection separately, described to me the moment the agents’ anger was unleashed a second time as she arrived 15 minutes later. Without warning, agents in tactical gear started throwing chemical weapons and chasing down protestors.

“The four of us ended up in a loading dock, in front of us were 10 agents and three things of tear gas, blowing in our faces.” Panicked and hardly able to see through the thick fog of chemical weapons, Eva and her friends wanted to escape, but they didn’t know how. In front of them, they saw a man getting randomly tackled by agents, his arms pinned behind his back, his face pressed inches from a billowing tear gas canister.  “We had nowhere to go, if we go straight we’ll get arrested or tackled, if we stay we’ll get gassed,” she told me later. As the tear gas filled their lungs and vision, they eventually decided to bolt. One of Eva’s friends threw up in the snow. Eva spit, and her saliva was neon orange.

“We were blindly running, I couldn’t breathe, I was choking on tear gas. My eyesight went black and I collapsed on the snow.” Eva’s fiancee helped her up, and they were able to make it home safely.

I was separated from Julia, and as my phone battery drained in the subzero air as I tried to reconvene with her. We found each other eventually, and went back to Nicollet to try to document what was happening. I watched as agents started rushing towards us with weapons drawn.

As I backed up, a short middle aged woman opened the door of a restaurant. “Come in, come in!” she yelled in a panic. She ushered in people on the street to save them from the chemical weapons.

We crowded into the restaurant. The owner paced back and forth in tears. Outside her window we saw a scene out of a warzone.

Over the next two hours, a pattern emerged. ICE agents would launch an assault down Eat Street, launching countless chemical weapons and flashbangs at protestors, then they would tackle and arrest people, seemingly at random. Then, they would retreat back to the intersection of 26th and Nicollet to resupply. Protesters would reconverge at the intersection, and the spectacle would repeat through the restaurant window.

We stayed in the restaurant, which became a makeshift refuge site. “I just wanted people to be safe,” the owner told me later. “I want businesses to do what I do, give water, let people come in.”

People did keep coming in, between the spurts of dispute. “I saw three [arrests],” a young woman told me, she was documenting on her phone. “One man looked unconscious when they dragged him in.” A backpack was brought in, the owner had been arrested. We searched it for identifying information, but found nothing.

Each time terrified people rushed into the restaurant, the owner would offer bottled water or hot water in plastic glasses. There were phone chargers, food, hugs. She waved away any attempt to pay her. It was in that restaurant I learned that Alex Pretti had died.

During yet another skirmish outside, a woman came in sobbing. We witnessed from the window her partner being tackled and snatched by ICE. Julia started making calls to lawyers to help, as she had when I had been arrested the week before. Today, the lawyer’s first question was: Were they a witness to the shooting? One woman who had seen it later said in a sworn affidavit that she heard ICE was looking for her.

Gas victims kept being brought to the restaurant, “like a field hospital,” as I overheard a passerby describe it. Their heads were tilted back and bottled water poured into their eyes. I watched a medic spray a man with saline solution, while another medic treated a man with frostbite, at tables that would normally be set for lunch.

A man whose eye was swollen shut was brought to a chair. He had to wait for a medic because they were busy. I offered him water and waited with him. He told me he’d only been on the scene for 10 minutes when he was sprayed from close range. If Alex, the 37-year-old ICU nurse had still been alive, if he had made it into this restaurant, he probably could have offered real help. All I could offer was water.

Later, outside, I talked to another volunteer medic who had helped two protestors that were having a severe allergic reaction to the gas. And I asked how many people he treated.

Around 12:40 p.m., someone came into the restaurant and told us, “ICE are gone, it’s safe now.” There was a palpable diffusion of tension.

Outside, Minneapolitans were cleaning up the gas canisters ICE left behind and hugging each other. A man was trying to put up some trash bins that had been knocked over, and re-string police tape to form a perimeter. I started to help him, only then realizing we were blocking off the site of Pretti’s shooting. He told me ICE had knocked over the police tape during one of their advances, and no police or first responders remained. I wasn’t sure if it was a crime scene or not, and no officials remained. We did our best to cordon off the area so no one would walk through.

Believe your federal government, not your own eyes. If you are big on the right to bear arms, make an exception this time. These are the Trump administration’s messages after a horrible Saturday in Minnesota.

Homeland Security agents shot 37-year-old Minneapolis ICU nurse and researcher Alex Pretti dead on Saturday morning in broad daylight. A few things are already clear from the best video angle out now: Pretti was directing traffic on a Minneapolis street. He was filming agents out in public, as is his undisputed right. An agent approached Pretti and then shoved a woman, hard, into a snowbank. Pretti put his hand up as he went to assist the woman. The masked agent who threw the woman to the ground draped himself over Pretti, then was joined by several of his colleagues. They got Pretti to the ground, struggled for a moment, and shot him until he was dead. Was this death sentence the result of sheer incompetence by agents who had no idea how to handle conflict? Was it a summary execution? Or, as the Trump administration would have you believe, did the dead man have it coming?

Pretti had a gun on him. An administration that once wrapped Kyle Rittenhouse in a loving embrace after he brought a rifle to a protest and killed two men took an interesting view of that fact. “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” an unsigned Homeland Security post said. “An assassin tried to murder federal agents,” Stephen Miller said. (JD Vance, the heir apparent to the Republican presidential nomination, reposted Miller.)  And what about the man who is nominally still running the country? Donald Trump pointed to a picture of Pretti’s handgun, confiscated by the agents, and noted it was loaded and “ready to go – What is that all about?”

Perhaps we will learn more in the coming days about what exactly happened when. But the early videos are already quite clear, as is what Trump and Miller and Vance are not saying. Nobody argued that Pretti brandished the gun before agents shot him several times. Moreover, no one argued that Pretti wasn’t allowed to have the gun. Minnesota allows people to carry a gun if they have a permit, and the Minneapolis police chief told reporters that Pretti had one. He had no criminal history beyond traffic tickets.

But the Trump administration has already told you what happened. One, the man had a gun, which is bad now. Two, the man was out to kill federal agents, which is obvious, because he had a gun.

We all have to decide for ourselves what we’ll believe about this case.

On the one hand, Pretti was a nurse who worked at the Veterans’ Administration. (If there’s one job that screams “disrespect for federal officers,” it’s “nurse at the VA.”)  Pretti was reaching for a woman whom an anonymous federal agent had just launched into a snowbank in frigid weather. It even looks like if anyone fired Pretti’s gun, it was a federal agent who had disarmed him and accidentally shot it into the pavement. And, fine, the physical altercation was initiated entirely by the agents, who put the woman on the ground and mobbed Pretti before shooting him to death.

But on the other hand, Stephen Miller says the man was an assassin. Would Stephen Miller lie?

Then there’s the matter of the gun itself. As Trump noted, the gun was “ready to go.” Pretti, though, had a legal right to carry that gun, thanks in large part to the gun-rights movement that has been part of Trump’s base for his entire political career. And most people who carry guns also carry bullets for those guns, as bullets are the primary projectile that guns send flying through the air.

But on the other hand, Alex Pretti had a gun. And would any American carry a gun in public without the intention to murder federal agents in cold blood? Remember, the sum total of violent crimes this ICU nurse had been charged with in his life was zero.

Miller says Pretti was a “domestic terrorist,” a label the administration also applied to the also-37-year-old Renee Good after one of its agents shot her through her car’s side window. The feds left their victim’s body splayed out on the road after taking the life from it, but they were at least a bit more dignified with him in one way. Nobody appears to have called Pretti a “fucking bitch,” as Good’s killer did right after shooting her.

You might get the impression from this series of federal killings that the real crime against this administration is opposing it in any way. But can you really trust yourself?

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, Slate’s weekly politics newsletter that needs to seriously ramp up its war crimes, and soon, if we’re going to snag a Board of Peace seat.

This week, oh brother. We’ll just say upfront that there was so much Minnesota/ICE stuff to consider that we decided to not include any of it (this is called “news judgment”), though we would refer you to other excellent Slate content here. We do however talk about the Minnesota Senate race, and observe how Bill and Hillary Clinton are going to jail for a million years (unconfirmed). Plus, an old-fashioned look at Trump’s poll numbers, one year in.

But first, Canada: Can we trade you for Mark Carney??

Most contemporary political speeches are terrible, flattened into pablum and crowd-pleasing safety, delivered by empty vessels, then forgotten within the hour. Yet the address from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a collected and poised former central bank head, will, we fear, be remembered for a long time. While he didn’t mention names, he did speak quite precisely of the recent “rupture” in the world order in which “great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.” In other words, the great powers—such as the neighbor to which Canada’s economy has been deeply linked for decades—have begun to throw their weight around unreliably and turn on their own partners. That means it’s time for “middle powers,” like Canada or major European countries, to orbit around different suns, to diversify, and to work together outside the restraints of the broken American-led order. We encourage you to read it yourself. (Once you’re done with the Surge—no clicking away!)

This, in a nutshell, is the risk of Donald Trump. While it was good that Trump called off the dogs on a hostile takeover of Greenland—for the moment—in his own Davos address the next day, the damage was already done. You can only threaten NATO, threaten global institutions, threaten or implement tariffs, and threaten the sovereign territory of your allies so much before they’ll deem you an unreliable partner and begin to turn away. It’s just a rational response. Trump has a psychological need—wholly unfixable, at this point—to push buttons and wield power recklessly until it causes a stock market dip, at which point he walks it back. The stock market reverses, but the long-term damage to America’s brand doesn’t.

Congratulations to everyone for making it a full year through Donald Trump’s second presidency! How many years are left? Eh, counting is for nerds. Let’s review how Trump’s political standing has changed over the past year. If you’ll recall, Trump’s favorability rating down the stretch of the 2024 election and leading into his inauguration was the highest it had ever been. That revealed new strengths about his second coalition, as it had made great strides with previously Democratic constituencies like young people and nonwhite voters.

One very exciting year later, all of that is back in the dumps. His job approval is lousy, hovering just north of 40 percent on average. And, as a New York Times/Siena poll this week demonstrated, much of that hemorrhaging support comes from the new blocs of voters he had acquired last year. Nearly 70 percent of registered voters under 30 disapprove of Trump, along with nearly 60 percent of Hispanic voters. Democrats, meanwhile, lead the generic congressional midterm ballot by 5 points—something that’s about in line with the polling average leading into this fall. This is in spite of Democrats, still, being historically loathed. Democrats will have to fix themselves ahead of 2028. (Who knows how!) But the midterms will primarily be a referendum on Trump, and it’s shaping into a horror story for the GOP. Trump’s reaction to the NYT poll was to threaten legal action against the Times.

Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy voted to convict Trump during his 2021 impeachment trial. This made political life challenging for Cassidy after Trump retook the presidency. To succeed in the 2026 primary in his solid red state, Cassidy would need Trump’s support, or at least his neutrality. So Cassidy spent the past year as one of Trump’s biggest cheerleaders. Even when he had a chance to block the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose overt agenda was to destroy everything Cassidy had learned in his career as a physician, Cassidy held his nose and offered his support.

It was all for naught. Last weekend, Trump urged Rep. Julia Letlow to challenge Cassidy and offered her his endorsement. Reporting suggests this was always Trump’s plan, and he just wanted to get through peak legislating season before he risked alienating Cassidy and his vote. Cassidy has pledged to remain in the race for now, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee will have his back as it always does with incumbents. But his fate may have been sealed when he cast that impeachment vote. He should wear that as a badge of honor and speak out against the administration more frequently in 2026—though we’re not holding our breath.

Last September, Trump forced out a U.S. attorney in the D.C. area who was trying to do his job honestly and replaced him with Lindsey Halligan, an insurance lawyer from Florida, who was willing to defy all career prosecutors’ advice and indict the president’s enemies. She indicted a couple of them—former FBI Director Jim Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James—only to have those indictments tossed out when a federal judge determined in November that Halligan had been illegally appointed to her job. Halligan nevertheless kept showing up to work, as a sort of Schrödinger’s U.S. attorney.

Halligan’s tenure came to an end this week when federal judges humiliated her out the door. A federal judge in Richmond concluded that “this charade of Ms. Halligan masquerading as the United States Attorney for this District in direct defiance of binding court orders must come to an end,” struck her title from all filings, and said the only reason it would refrain from “referring her for further investigation and disciplinary action” was because she “lacks the prosecutorial experience that has long been the norm for those nominated to the position of United States Attorney in this District.” A separate judge, meanwhile, directed the clerk to publish a job listing for Halligan’s vacant role in local newspapers. What do you think, should the Surge apply?

This week, the NRSC announced with great fanfare its latest recruit: former NFL sideline reporter turned conservative political commentator Michele Tafoya will run for the Minnesota Senate seat left vacant by Sen. Tina Smith’s retirement. This effectively closes out the NRSC’s offensive map for 2026, as it plans to contest Democratic seats in Georgia, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Minnesota. Their argument for the Minnesota seat is that Trump came within 4 points of winning it in 2024, and state Democrats have suffered from scandals surrounding mass social services fraud.

Uh huh. The national environment in 2026 is shaping up to be much different than it was in 2024, and those state scandals’ impact on Dems might be offset by the Trump administration’s more recent decision to send in Immigration and Customs Enforcement and, potentially soon, the military to Minnesota. But! At least a quality recruit could force Democrats to spend some cash in Minnesota. So is Tafoya a quality recruit? Time will tell, though her name recognition will be high. Yet we can’t help but be tickled by her initial message. “For years, I walked the sidelines when the stakes were the highest, and that job taught me how leadership really works,” Tafoya’s team wrote in a social media post alongside her launch video. Her qualification for leadership is that she was quite literally on the sidelines while leadership (in football) was happening nearby. By that logic, we must remind you that the Surge has interviewed former football coach Tommy Tuberville. Do we get a Minnesota Senate seat now?

The House Oversight Committee, which has been conducting its own investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, voted to hold Bill and Hillary Clinton in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas to testify. This came after a lengthy back-and-forth between the Clintons’ lawyers and the Oversight Committee about whether the committee’s subpoena was merely an effort to embarrass them, given that the Clintons have already shared what “little information” they know. It’s now a question of whether—when, really—the contempt resolution gets a full House vote, and then whether the Justice Department pursues charges.

Is Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer trying to embarrass the Clintons and turn some of the main-boss energy in the Epstein saga away from Trump? Of course. But what was most catching about the vote was how nine Democrats on the committee joined Republicans to hold Bill Clinton in contempt, while three voted to hold Hillary Clinton in contempt. There’s a couple of political factors at play here. First, Democrats do not want to appear, at this stage in the Epstein saga, to be protecting their own from consequences as they pursue the truth. Second, Democrats pursued quite a few contempt resolutions when they held the House in the Biden years, and giving up on their righteous indignation about the importance of complying with congressional subpoenas wouldn’t smell right. Anyway: Bill and Hillary to serve as inaugural prisoners at the reopening of Alcatraz? (Remember that?)

As of Thursday, the House has passed all 12 appropriations bills to fund the federal government, at new levels and reflecting new needs, for the remainder of the fiscal year—and only four months behind schedule, which isn’t too bad! The Senate, assuming senators can ax their way past treacherous ice demons and through the Capitol doors, expects to vote on the final few bills next week. This is the first time since the Biden administration that Congress has passed all new appropriations bills; the government has been running on a series of continuing resolutions, extending old funding levels, since 2024.

So how did this happen? There was bipartisan recognition among appropriators—led by Rep. Tom Cole on the Republican side and Rep. Rosa DeLauro on the Democratic—that they needed to if they wanted to be taken seriously anymore. Passing another CR reflecting old needs, and ceding a proactive congressional power of the purse, would have further emboldened the executive branch and anti-government Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought to do with federal spending as he pleased. “If we wouldn’t have been able to do this, then Congress would have been, frankly, diminished in a way that would have been bad for our republic,” GOP Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart told reporters. Now Congress is back, and the republic is saved!

Remember to salt your steps and walkways, the last thing anyone needs this weekend is a broken neck. Cheers!

The evidence is mounting that ICE is not only unbothered by moral boundaries, but immigration and customs enforcement agents acting on behalf of President Trump believe they are not constrained by constitutional red lines, either. According to a super-secret internal memo flagged in a whistleblower complaint this week, the Fourth Amendment simply doesn’t apply to ICE. That sense of impunity is also clear in a growing chamber of horrors from their enforcement operations; from masked agents taking a child in a blue bunny hat, to the shooting of Renee Good. Worryingly, this sweeping concept of immunity is kind of true—though maybe not for the reason you think. This week on Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick talks with Alex Reinert, the Max Freund Professor of Litigation & Advocacy at Cardozo School of Law. He is also the director of the Center for Rights and Justice and Co-Director of the Floersheimer Center for Constitutional Democracy. Alex explains the origins of qualified immunity—a legal theory that allows law enforcement officers to be free from consequences for their actions—why ICE’s lawlessness is not a new phenomenon (even if it is a phenomenon in hyperdrive under Trump), and what we can do about the obvious problem of maximal impunity for the people who have the most power to inflict harm.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">feature Applied Digital CEO Wes Cummins said when his company decides on a location for a datacenter, he asks town officials to sign non-disclosure agreements to stop politicians from leaking insider information.

“Each one of these projects is still a big deal for us,” Cummins told The Register. “When we do NDAs, it&#39;s really specifically about trading in our public shares. We’re trying to protect people from the insider trading laws of the country because not everyone knows that, &#39;Hey, I&#39;ve got insider information on a company,&#39; and then they go trade in it, and then you get in trouble.”

The practice is increasingly common among tech companies, with Amazon frequently criticized for using them. It&#39;s become controversial for locking voters out of discussions about large, community-shaping projects that sometimes bring jobs, but can also come with tax breaks, environmental impacts, and energy and water usage that erode the upsides.

“Wealthy tech companies talk a big game about economic development. In reality, they’re using NDAs to quietly secure massive tax breaks and public subsidies, depriving local communities of critical resources,” Deanna Noel, campaign director with the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, told The Register. “The public shouldn’t be expected to pay the price for datacenter expansion, and we deserve a seat at the table—not to be blocked by NDAs.”

Cummins, co-founder of Applied Digital, is currently juggling at least 11 datacenter projects in sites across the US, navigating construction costs, power generation, and the sale of long-term leases to the world’s largest and most valuable companies.

Between that and hosting quarterly earnings calls for his Nasdaq-listed company, a former crypto-mining outfit with a market cap of $10.6 billion, a portion of his time last year was spent at town meetings convincing locals in Harwood, North Dakota, a community of about 800, that his $3 billion project to build a 280 MW datacenter was a good idea.

“They overwhelmingly supported the project,” he said. “I sat in and answered questions around people who had legitimate concerns that what was next door to them, talked about exactly what it was. And I would say the people, from a percentage perspective, 98 or 99% of the people really wanted the project there, but you had a whole bunch of interveners, not from a legal perspective, but people who had a lot of opinions that did not even live in that state, and so, you deal with that.”

There was pushback around noise, the 900-acre plot size, water use and energy costs. There was anger directed towards local officials, including Mayor Blake Hankey, for signing NDAs with Applied Digital, which prevented them from sharing details about the project with the voters who elected them.

Hankey did not respond to several messages seeking comment, but he told a local news affiliate that he first learned of Applied Digital’s plans in July, a month before the public was told. He signed an NDA to keep the datacenter under wraps until it was announced on August 19.

“Because they’re a publicly traded company, they’re subject to SEC violations, so I did have to file a non-disclosure agreement. So I was not allowed to talk about it until it was announced publicly,” he told KMSP-TV Fox 9 during an interview.

Pat Garofalo, director of state and local policy at the American Economic Liberties Project, and author of The Billionaire Boondoggle: How Our Politicians Let Corporations and Bigwigs Steal Our Money and Jobs, said that explanation doesn’t hold up.

“My view is that the use of non-disclosure agreements in these deals is corrupt. Full stop,” he told The Register on Friday. “You are requiring public officials whose duty is to the public, whose duty is to being good stewards of public resources and making the right decisions for the community, and you are making it explicit that they cannot tell their constituents who voted for them, who pay their salaries, what is going to happen in the community.”

Datacenters are the latest instance in which NDAs are used to quell potential dissent, but he said Amazon and Google – companies that Applied Digital has said it is either courting or working with – have also used the same method. Garofalo, who has been studying the topic for a decade, said tying the NDAs to SEC disclosures is a new justification.

“That’s very cute that they’re getting into these insider trading allegations,” he said. “From what I’ve experienced and from what I’ve seen, the very explicit purpose of these non-disclosure agreements is so that the community doesn’t know what’s happening until it’s too late in places where they think there will be pushback on one of these projects.”

Noel cowrote a research paper, Reining in Big Tech: Policy Solutions to Address the Data Center Buildout, last year. She told The Register that companies hide behind NDAs to “milk communities dry.”

“NDAs act as community gag orders, giving some of the world’s richest corporations carte blanche to build what they want, where they want, and how they want — often in lockstep with a Trump-administration agenda focused on expanding fossil fuel production while blocking the clean energy transition,” she said via email. “State and local policymakers must prohibit or strictly limit NDAs in datacenter deals. Communities deserve to know who’s building in their backyard — and what the consequences will be.”

Cummins disagrees, telling us in response to these allegations, &quot;We don&#39;t sneak around to try to get deals done.&quot;

Applied Digital hosts public meetings, carries out site assessments, and impact surveys to judge how construction and ongoing operations might play out in the community, also taking into account school schedules, traffic patterns, and environmental concerns.

“The impact is wildly positive overall, but are there going to be some headaches during construction? A hundred percent,” he said. “We go in there with plans that are very detailed, because people who live there want that detail. Where are the routes that the trucks will run through? Where are we going to see congestion? How are you dealing with it? What time of day?”

In Harwood, after a heated public meeting that moved to larger rooms to accommodate the crowds, Applied Digital won the zoning approvals needed to begin construction. But Cummins said the community reaction has changed his approach to the company&#39;s next projects.

This week, Applied Digital announced that it has broken ground on a 430 MW datacenter, however this time the only information about the location is that it is in a southern US state. He said the outfit would share more information in February.

“You’ll see we’re not circumventing public comments or anything of that nature,” he said.

Cummins, whose company is building or has plans to build in North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, as well as some unnamed southern US states, said he grew up in a small town and said he understands the concerns.

“So far all of the towns that we go to have been the same slowly dying places that are struggling to pay for their own infrastructure. And then these projects completely reverse the fortunes of a town, by the way, without changing the makeup of the town,” he said. “We bring a few hundred permanent jobs, which is the perfect sizing for this. We don’t bring in 10,000 which would completely transform that. People live there for a reason. They just want it to be a little better. They want the infrastructure paid for. They want the school paid for. And what we do, does all that. There is some headache around construction, though.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emmabuntüs is just another Linux distro, but it&#39;s one guided by ethics more than tech. With exceptional help, documentation, beginner-friendly tooling and accessibility, there&#39;s a lot to like.

The Emmabuntüs collective is a group of mostly French Linux folks which has been maintaining its eponymous Linux distribution for about 15 years. The collective has multiple goals, including helping several non-profit groups – notably, Emmaus International – an international humanitarian charity, headquartered in France, which aids people around the world. The goals of the Emmabuntüs collective are to help the reuse of old computers, to help beginners and newcomers to discover Linux, and to reduce electronic waste by keeping old computers useful.

The project got its name because the first four releases of Emmabuntüs, between 2012 and 2015, were based on Ubuntu – but since Emmabuntüs DE in 2016, the collective switched their basis to Debian. It released the latest Emmabuntüs DE 6 a month ago, and this one is especially focused on improving accessibility. It has built-in screenreaders for both the graphical desktop and text console, available from the first boot; it supports both Braille displays and Braille embossers (the equivalent of printers); it has additional sound effects and tools for visually impaired users, for example to notify of USB device insertion, tools to make it easier to eject and safely remove media, as well as options to do things like simplify the screen display.

Emmabuntüs defaults to Xfce 4.20 but post-install you can opt for LXQt if you prefer - click to enlarge

There&#39;s plenty here for people who are not disabled yet too. The underlying tech behind Emmabuntüs is nothing exceptional: it&#39;s Debian 13 &quot;Trixie,&quot; with a live medium that also lets you boot straight into the Debian installer. It uses the latest Xfce 4.20 as the default desktop, set up with a single top panel and a snazzy looking Cairo dock along the bottom of the screen. Saying that, you can choose LXQt 2.1 instead if you want something even lighter weight. It installs onto a plain old ext4 partition with a separate swap partition – there&#39;s no fancy immutable setup or anything here. It has Flatpak support pre-installed, but no Flatpaks by default.

What impressed us is the range of extra tools provided: the distro goes above and beyond almost any other Debian derivative we&#39;ve seen in how much it tries to help out newbie users. There&#39;s a good range of solid tools in most categories installed: updated ESR versions of Firefox and Thunderbird, and Firefox is preconfigured with UBlock Origin for ad-blocking. There&#39;s also Falkon for anything that might not work right in Firefox, plus other handy tools like Pidgin, Jitsi for free video-conferencing, file-download and file-sharing apps and more. Most of the dock is filled with groups of apps: Communications, Office, Audio, Video, Photo, Burn, Interests, Education, Utilities, Maintenance, Accessibility, and Help.

There&#39;s a lot of documentation pre-installed locally – as part of the design, you don&#39;t need an internet connection to install the OS and get up and running. There are tools like BleachBit for cleaning up your files, DWService for free remote-control, Reg FOSS desk favorite Ventoy for making boot media, and so on.

It also helps newbies tweak their desktop settings, too: it goes out of its way to hold your hand - click to enlarge

This isn&#39;t unprecedented, but it&#39;s good to see. Some other distros, such as the Arch-based Garuda Linux or the systemd-optional MX Linux come with lots of custom tools to help fairly clued-up Linux users who might not yet be masters of the command line – applets to install packages and drivers, optionally switch to performance-tuned kernels, and other handy advanced features. This is all good stuff, and there&#39;s a place for that.

Emmabuntüs does that, but is aimed more at new Linux users and migrants from Windows. It has lots of pre-installed apps, and as well as the GNOME Software store (and the GNOME graphical Packages manager). There are installers for handy non-FOSS extras such as Microsoft&#39;s free fonts and some additional audio and video codecs. As well as this, the app-launch menu is populated with entries for handy extras such as Steam and WINE. The apps are not pre-installed, but clicking these links offers to do that for you.

After installation, a series of welcome screens appears, which helps a new user customize their setup: switching desktop environments, adding languages and, interestingly, removing unused or unwanted ones, which is handy. Other screens help choose the desktop layout, wallpaper, screensaver, type of Xfce launch menu, and so on. Every one has a check-box at the bottom, asking if the tools should run next time – so once you&#39;ve made your choices, you can stop seeing them. Finally, there&#39;s a Welcome screen, with links to documentation, tools, settings, a user forum, instructional videos, and more.

Both web browsers default to the French Lilo search engine which donates its income to various environmental and humanitarian causes.

When the post-install setup is finally done, there&#39;s a friendy welcome screen and lots of app choices - click to enlarge

There&#39;s a lot to like here. It&#39;s not perfect, and it doesn&#39;t look as smooth and polished as, say, Ubuntu, or even Linux Mint or Zorin OS. The screen is a little cluttered, and because it cheerfully picks up tools from multiple different desktops, not all the applications have a uniform look and feel – fonts and themes and things don&#39;t all match. Very occasionally, some things do pop up in French.

But in our experience, introducing Windows users to Linux for the first time, most people are so impressed by the variety of free stuff they can have that they&#39;re not too bothered about whether it looks very polished or not. For people more bothered about how shiny it looks, there are more polished distros out there, such as the very pretty AnduinOS, based on Ubuntu but stripped out and heavily customized.

If you want lots of useful apps pre-installed, then the paid-for Zorin OS Pro comes with tens of gigabytes of the leading Linux flagship apps, all in Flatpak form.

Emmabuntüs is not a super-lightweight distro. It took about 11 GB of disk space and idles at about ¾ GB of RAM. It&#39;s much lighter than any modern GNOME or KDE Plasma desktop, though, and there is a lot to like: a rich collection of apps here, plenty of help to get you started, build confidence, and set you on the way to expert status. All this, and excellent accessibility too. ®

            <h2>Future of UK's multibillion Ajax armored vehicle program looks shaky</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-25</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/25/uk_defence_grapples_with_ajax/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The future of the British Army&#39;s troublesome Ajax armored vehicle program has again been called into question after the official in charge was removed and use of Ajax halted over its effects on personnel.

Initial operating capability (IOC) of the tracked reconnaissance vehicle was declared in November last year, despite ongoing concerns over excessive noise and vibration impacting Army personnel using it.

Now the Minister for Defence Readiness and Industry Luke Pollard MP has disclosed in a statement to Parliament that he had been given written assurances by senior Ministry of Defence (MoD) personnel that Ajax was &quot;demonstrably safe.&quot;

Since that guarantee was given, 35 service personnel reported symptoms consistent with noise and vibration effects during a training exercise, causing him to order an indefinite pause of the use of Ajax for training, while safety investigations are carried out.

A ministerial review into the advice that Pollard and other senior officials were receiving concluded that people had been raising issues with the Ajax program, but those issues were not being &quot;elevated to an appropriate level.&quot;

In response, the Senior Responsible Owner of the Ajax program has been removed, and Pollard says he has passed oversight to the National Armaments Director. The latter is a civil servant, Rupert Pearce, who was appointed last year with a brief to reform defense procurement.

As for Ajax itself, Pollard said the MoD is working with the contractor, General Dynamics, to identify problems and solutions, adding that &quot;we will need to decide on the platform&#39;s future shortly.&quot;

This seems to suggest that the UK government may be preparing to cancel Ajax if the issues cannot be fixed, but that would open up a whole new can of worms, as the program is already years behind schedule and the multibillion-pound budget for it has already been spent.

It has been suggested that the MoD should consider buying the CV90 instead, which is already in service with several other European armies, but the MoD is said to be facing a £28 billion ($38 billion) funding &quot;black hole&quot; over the next four years, as it stands.

Meanwhile, the government has just committed £650 million ($880 million) to upgrade the RAF&#39;s fleet of Typhoon fighter jets, as some ask whether more of these should be procured instead of the troublesome F-35 stealth aircraft.

About £453 million ($612 million) is going on fitting European Common Radar System (ECRS) Mk2 kit [PDF]. This is said to be able to simultaneously detect, identify, and track multiple targets in the air and on the ground, while providing a high-powered jamming capability in contested environments.

Another £205 million ($277 million) is going on specialist engineering support by QinetiQ to help upgrade the Typhoon&#39;s weapon systems, the MoD says.

But both Turkey and Germany recently placed orders for 20 new-build Typhoons apiece, in the latter case to replace aging Tornado aircraft. At the time, MPs questioned in Parliament why the UK isn&#39;t buying any more itself, especially as the Royal Air Force (RAF) has retired many of its oldest Tranche 1 models, leaving it with about 107 Typhoons in service.

Instead, the government last year decided to buy 12 F-35A fighters capable of carrying nuclear weapons, despite the fact these can&#39;t be refueled by the RAF&#39;s own tankers and the nukes they would carry are owned by the US.

The RAF and the Royal Navy also operate the F-35B version of the jet, as a replacement for the Harrier in the Navy&#39;s case, and the Tornado in RAF service.

Pressure will likely grow for the government to change its mind on a Typhoon purchase, especially in light of recent events that have led many to question whether the US can be considered a reliable partner.

Spain last year cancelled plans to buy the F-35, opting for the Typhoon instead.

In addition, the maker of the F-35, Lockheed Martin, has dragged its heels on supporting UK weapons such as the Spear and Meteor missiles, a capability not expected before 2031, five years behind schedule.

However, the UK is already committed to developing the Typhoon&#39;s replacement, as part of the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) project with Italy and Japan. Codenamed Tempest, this is expected to be in service by 2035, which means the UK may see little point in ordering new Typhoons now. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">feature Bernard Lambeau, a Belgium-based software developer and founder of several technology companies, created a programming language called Elo with the help of Anthropic&#39;s Claude Code.

Starting on December 25, 2025, he published a series of posts about the project. The first post names Claude as a co-author.

&quot;In roughly 24 hours of collaboration, we built a complete expression language with a parser, type system, three compilers, a standard library, a CLI tool, and a documentation website. Not bad for a day&#39;s work,” Lambeau and Claude wrote.

&quot;Elo isn&#39;t just a demonstration that AI can write code. It&#39;s a demonstration that humans and AI can build together – each contributing what they do best,” they added.

As an expression language that compiles to JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL, Elo is intended as a portable way to handle form validation, e-commerce order processing, and subscription logic.

Lambeau, founder and CTO of Klaro Cards and CEO of app consultancy Enspirit, is not the first to develop a programming language with the help of AI.

Steve Klabnik performed a similar feat last year with the Rue programming language. In September 2025, Geoffrey Huntley enlisted Claude to write a programming language called Cursed. And before that, Avital Tamir published a Claude-authored repo for the Server programming language, with the caveat that the code is not intended for actual use.

Claude Code isn&#39;t the only AI-assisted programming method having a moment. AI biz Cursor created a rudimentary browser using OpenAI&#39;s GPT-5.2. And developer Ola Prøis used Cursor, powered by Claude, to create a Rust-based text editor called Ferrite.

Claude users generally acknowledge that their pair partner makes mistakes. But those committed to AI assistance find it worthwhile to clean up after their helper.

&quot;Claude Code knows almost every tech stack (and can search the web), knows the Linux commands that matter (search code, search & replace, compile, test, etc.), and does that 10x faster than I can do myself,&quot; Lambeau told The Register in an email interview.

Claude, he said, allows him to use technology he hasn&#39;t mastered.

&quot;I was already a full-stack developer (on languages, frameworks & reusable libraries I knew); I&#39;m now a full-stack++ dev because I can also use languages, frameworks, and reusable libraries I barely know, if at all,&quot; he explained.

&quot;Claude Code falls short if you don&#39;t have a great methodology. It needs feedback loops to work fine; otherwise, it derails. One possible feedback loop is a human reviewing code and testing manually. But there&#39;s a better/complementary approach if you want it to work autonomously. On both Elo and Bmg.js, I&#39;ve started by making sure the testing methodology was effective and scientifically sound. Claude writes the tests, executes them, discovers where it&#39;s wrong, and corrects itself. Impressive.&quot;

Lambeau said he still needs to review some of Claude&#39;s output.

&quot;But if I read the tests, agree with them, and can check myself that they run fine, I&#39;m 95 percent sure it&#39;s already correct as a black box (not even reading the code),&quot; he explained. &quot;Then I can check the architecture and code quality as a white box by having a general look at the code, but I don&#39;t have to understand every detail.&quot;

Notably, Lambeau documented the series of prompts he used to create the language. The repo includes more than 100 tasks used to direct the AI model. In addition, Lambeau has published a video that describes his AI pair programming process.

&quot;I started in a setting where Claude Code asked for permissions every 20 seconds and I was checking everything it did,&quot; Lambeau explained. &quot;After a few successes, I quickly set up safe environments to be able to let Claude Code run in full autonomy (isolated computer & isolated Linux user, or running in a Docker image).&quot;

Lambeau said he still uses plan mode for complex tasks that require conversation with Claude.

&quot;I review the plan, make sure we have a test strategy that&#39;s sound, then switch Claude to autonomous mode and look at the tests, code & results afterward,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s very similar to a lead-dev/CTO + QA role, btw; it&#39;s just much faster than with human devs.&quot;

Lambeau, who has a PhD in software engineering and 30 years of experience as a developer, said both experts and novices can benefit from Claude Code, though he added that a service like Lovable might be more approachable for those not already acclimated to the command line.

&quot;Now, when it comes to real software/product engineering, I think Claude Code requires experts (so far),&quot; he said. &quot;You still need to guide it a lot to keep the quality high enough. You need very strong expertise to do it effectively. Currently (Claude will still improve a lot), if you don&#39;t have the expertise, you certainly end up with a big mess of unmaintainable code.&quot;

Many developers have said as much about AI tools. They&#39;re more useful as an amplifier of expertise than as a replacement for it. The situation is analogous to the introduction of sequencing software, digital synthesizers, and drum machines half a century ago. These tools enabled a lot of people who weren&#39;t great musicians to make music. But they didn&#39;t instill musical skill, and they produced the most interesting work in the hands of practiced musicians.

The cost to do this, Lambeau said, has been a Claude Max subscription that he purchased in December for €180 a month. In that time, he says, he wrote Elo (https://elo-lang.org), completed Bmg.js (https://github.com/enspirit/bmg.js), completed Bmg&#39;s documentation (https://www.relational-algebra.dev), and created the first version of the Try page (https://www.relational-algebra.dev/try).

&quot;It&#39;s all personal research and open-source projects,&quot; he said. &quot;It would have required several weeks to do the same manually myself, and several months to ask another developer to do it. The cost would be mostly because of the scientific & technical knowledge transfer about the data language I envision. Strangely enough, it&#39;s very cheap with Claude Code. There&#39;s something true about the fact that those LLMs have a PhD.&quot;

Lambeau explained that Elo isn&#39;t just a way to test Claude Code. He also sees it as an extension of his academic work in software engineering and his personal interest in the Relational Model – he&#39;s served as a lecturer for database courses at Belgium’s UCLouvain.

&quot;I&#39;m absolutely convinced that we need better/safer/simpler programming languages inside no-code tools and when interconnecting them (e.g. Zapier, Make, n8n, etc.),&quot; he said. &quot;Mainstream programming languages are very complex, error-prone, sometimes dangerous, and the programs are difficult to review for non-experts.&quot;

&quot;More importantly, they are cumbersome to use for even simple data tasks. I mean, even validating the schema and constraints of a data file at runtime tends to be a nightmare in existing languages. It&#39;s not built-in in any mainstream language; you immediately need validation libraries; most of them are limited in what they can easily check, so you need to add dedicated boilerplate code.&quot;

In a world where non-technical people will have the opportunity to write untrustworthy code with the help of AI, he said, we need to be able to run that code safely.

&quot;Elo aims at providing a safe & simple alternative,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be a limited language (non-Turing-complete, as we say) but super safe & simple, and usable in 80 percent of common data use cases. The very first no-code tool to integrate it will be Klaro Cards, of course.&quot; ®

            <h2>Bill Gates-backed startup aims to revive Moore's Law with optical transistors</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/24/neurophos_hopes_to_revive_moores_law/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Moore&#39;s Law slows to a crawl and the amount of energy required to deliver generational performance gains grows, some chip designers are looking to alternative architectures for salvation.

Neurophos is among those trying to upend Moore&#39;s Law and make good on analog computing&#39;s long-promised yet largely untapped potential.

The Austin, Texas-based AI chip startup says it&#39;s developing an optical processing unit (OPU) that in theory is capable of delivering 470 petaFLOPS of FP4 / INT4 compute — about 10x that of Nvidia&#39;s newly unveiled Rubin GPUs — while using roughly the same amount of power.

Neurophos CEO Patrick Bowen tells El Reg this is possible in part because of the micron-scale metamaterial optical modulators, essentially photonic transistors, that the company has spent the past several years developing.

&quot;The equivalent of the optical transistor that you get from Silicon Photonics factories today is massive. It&#39;s like 2 mm long. You just can&#39;t fit enough of them on chip in order to get a compute density that remotely competes with digital CMOS today,&quot; he explained.

Neurophos&#39; optical transistors, Bowen says, are roughly 10,000x smaller. &quot;We got our first silicon back in May demonstrating that we could do that with a standard CMOS process, which means it&#39;s compatible with existing foundry technologies.&quot;

Using these transistors, Neurophos claims to have developed the optical equivalent of a tensor core. &quot;On chip, there is a single photonic tensor core that is 1,000 by 1,000 [processing elements] in size,&quot; he said.

This is quite a bit bigger than what&#39;s typically seen in most AI accelerators and GPUs, which employ matrix multiplication engines that are at most 256x256 processing elements in size.

However, rather than having dozens or even hundreds of these tensor cores, like we see in Nvidia&#39;s GPUs, Neurophos only needs one. Bowen tells us the tensor core on its first-gen accelerator will occupy roughly 25 mm2.

The rest of the reticle-sized chip is &quot;the boondoggle of what it takes to support this insane tensor core,&quot; Bowen said.

Specifically, Neurophos needs a whack-ton of vector processing units and SRAM to keep the tensor core from starving for data. This is because the tensor core itself — and yes, again, there&#39;ll only be one of them on the entire reticle-sized die — is operating at around 56 gigahertz.

But because the matrix-matrix multiplication is done optically, Bowen notes that the only power consumed by the tensor core is what&#39;s needed to drive the opto-electrical conversion from digital to analog and back again.

Neurophos says its first OPU, codenamed the Tulkas T100, will feature a dual reticle design equipped with 768 GB of HBM that&#39;s capable of 470 petaOPS while consuming 1 to 2 kilowatts of power under load.

As impressive as all this sounds, it&#39;s important to remember that these figures are more like goal posts at this point. The chip is still in active development with full production not expected to begin until mid-2028. Even then, Bowen doesn&#39;t expect it to ship in large volumes. &quot;We&#39;re talking thousands of chips. Not tens of thousands of chips.&quot;

While Neurophos believes its optical tensor cores can address a broad array of AI inference workloads, it expects its first chip will be used primarily as a prefill processor.

As we&#39;ve previously discussed, LLM inference can be broken into two phases: a compute intensive prefill stage in which input tokens are processed, and a memory bandwidth bound stage in which output tokens are generated.

Over the past year or so, we&#39;ve seen chip designers like Nvidia disaggregate prefill and decode into separate pools of GPUs. For its latest generation of GPUs, Nvidia has developed a dedicated prefill accelerator that it calls Rubin CPX.

Bowen envisions the Tulkas T100 filling a similar role as Rubin CPX. &quot;The current vision, which is subject to change, is basically we would put one rack of ours, which is 256 of our chips, and that would be paired with something like an NVL576 rack,&quot; he said.

Long-term, Bowen aims to tackle the decode phase as well, but notes that a variety of technologies, including co-packaged optics, will need to be developed before the startup is ready to take on token generation.

While the Tulkas T100 won&#39;t ship until at least 2028, Bowen says the company is actively working on a proof of concept (PoC) chip to validate the compute and power densities it&#39;s claiming.

This week, Neurophos completed a $110 million Series-A funding round led by Gates Frontier, with participation from Microsoft&#39;s venture fund and other investors, which Bowen says will fund development of this PoC. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/24/home_office_small_boats/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK Home Office is spending up to £100 million on intelligence tech in part to tackle the so-called &quot;small boats&quot; issue of refugees and irregular immigrants coming across the English Channel.

The Whitehall department&#39;s Border Security Command (BSC) is on the hunt for a &quot;maritime situational awareness system&quot; it says should &quot;autonomously detect, track, and identify small boats and non-cooperative vessels at range.&quot;

The official prior information notice marks engagement with vendors for a system set to fuse &quot;data from land-based and Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS)&quot; drones with existing platforms.

The continued flow of refugees, asylum seekers, and irregular immigrants has become a major focus of UK politics in recent years, with successive governments keen to be seen to act in response to adverse publicity.

The Home Office notice said it had decided to combine its requirement for a real-time view from land-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) with the Joint Maritime Security Centre (JMSC) of the Maritime Domain Awareness service, which provides security and regulatory enforcement data and was already the subject of a separate procurement.

It now plans to merge the two into a single procurement: the Coastal Maritime ISR Service.

The Home Office said that under the deal, suppliers would &quot;strengthen the UK&#39;s response to clandestine entry and wider maritime security by delivering a scalable, managed service that provides enhanced domain awareness and supports operational decision-making.&quot;

&quot;The solution will autonomously detect, track, and identify small boats and non-cooperative vessels at range, fusing data from land-based and Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) sources with existing platforms,&quot; it said. BVLOS is shorthand for piloting drones without being able to directly see them.

The winning bidder will be expected to integrate data from satellite-based automatic identification, radar, and drone-based sensors to create a &quot;Tracks as a Service&quot; in near real-time via an API to the Royal Navy Maritime Domain Awareness Programme (MDAP) and connect to the Home Office, a &quot;common operating picture accessible to key decision-makers and first responders.&quot;

&quot;A supplier portal will provide camera feeds, alternative track displays, and alerts, ensuring flexibility to meet short-notice operational requirements across the UK, Crown Dependencies, and British Overseas Territories,&quot; the notice said.

The contract is set to last between three and five years, including any extension periods, and could be worth £100 million for the full five-year term.

Research from campaign group Progressive International claims private companies won around £3.5 billion in contracts for UK border security since 2017, including &quot;contracts specifically related to the regulation of people moving across the English Channel in small boats.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Even the most seemingly apolitical creators have had enough.

Even the most seemingly apolitical creators have had enough.

It’s not surprising when the guy who’s been yelling about the horrors of late-stage capitalism on Instagram for the last five years turns his ire towards ICE. But something different has been happening over the week or so, following the most recent shootings of civilians by federal agents — even accounts that stay laser focused on golfing, chopping wood, and playing cats like bongos have started to speak out.

The tenor on social media and Reddit took an even sharper turn yesterday, following the killing of Alex Pretti by ICE. Even the moderator of normally politics-free r/catbongos (a subreddit “Where gentlemen, gentlewomen, and gentlethems of quality gather to watch cats being played like bongos”) spokeout in a post where they declared that “If you still support Trump/ICE even slightly, you’re not welcome in this sub.”

That quilters on Instagram or a Facebook account dedicated to New England gravestones have decided enough, is enough, is one thing. But, judging from the comments, it seems like the government has lost the support of r/military as well. The subreddit is filled with angry posters decrying that “this is exactly what tyranny looks like” and sharing memes mocking Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. One poster claiming to be an active member of the U.S. Army who has served for 21 years said, “these guys are against all we stand for as Americans. Modern day brownshirts.”

All across Reddit, subs are being inundated with anti-ICE posts. From r/Fauxmoi, to r/NFCNorthMemeWar, and r/DungeonCrawlerCarl. There’s even been some limited signs of revolt among the members of r/conservative, some of whom have taken issue with Kristi Noem’s description of Alexi Pretti as a “domestic terrorist,” and suggested that she should “just be quiet for a while.” And arguments have broken out among community members over perceived hypocrisy around the Second Amendment.

Some big names have also joined the chorus, including Joe Santagato of The Basement Yard podcast, who posted that what was occurring on the streets of Minneapolis was “legit horrifying.” And when someone told him to “Stay out of politics,” and “get back to spitting water out of your mouth and de-jumbling words with your idiot friends.” He shot back, “De-jumble this: ksuc ym slalb.”

Canadian wrestlers and social media influencers Chris and Patrick Vörös have spoken out previously about their anti-ICE views, but took the opportunity to remind people of the only two ICE agents they support. Educational YouTube channel Primer also took to X to say this is no longer about politics, but about the “fabric of society.”

Synthfluencers and music gear YouTubers have also spoken out, including Benn Jordan, Randall Taylor (Amulets), and Jason Mays, one of the hosts of Working Class Music. The United Musicians & Allied Workers has also called for the abolition of ICE. Many manufacturers have also thrown their support behind the people of Minneapolis, even if it turns off some of their potential customers, including Drolo, Chase Bliss, and Hungry Robot.

Canadian musician bbno$ decided to break his silence, even if it risked his visa and his current U.S. tour, to throw his support behind the abolish ICE movement. Even Thoren Bradley, the Axe Man himself, whose whole schtick is being a ripped rural dude who chops wood, has decided to call out the hypocrisy of the Christian conservatives to his 10.7 million followers.

That creators like Hank Green are speaking out is no surprise. But when fitness influencers, duck-painting TikTokers, football subreddits, bourbon Instagramers, and even Second Amendment rights activists have finally broken their silence, it seems like the government has lost control of the narrative. No matter how hard they try to spin it.

Let us know in the comments what other creators and communities have begun to speakout in the comments.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">﻿What is the point of law enforcement that doesn’t follow the law?

Shortly after federal agents killed Alex Pretti Saturday morning, the Department of Homeland Security began to run with the story that the dead man had been armed and dangerous. He had a gun, DHS said. (A Bellingcat analysis of the video concludes that Pretti was unarmed when he was shot.) He had approached the agents holding the gun, DHS said. (He was holding a phone, The New York Times reports.) Pretti died on his knees, surrounded by armed Border Patrol agents, with shot after shot unloaded in his direction.

America’s Second Amendment is beloved by conservatives. Minnesota allows open carry with a permit. Pretti lived in a city where people are regularly being assaulted and even killed by the masked and armed men he was busy observing. So why has so much ink been spilled over the minutiae of his behavior? Why is it so normal for law enforcement — those who are supposed to be keepers of law and order — to kill Americans? And why is the only question at the end of the day how much their victims deserved to die?

In July 2020, DHS sent in over a hundred federal officers from various agencies to my city of Portland, Oregon. They flooded downtown with a thick fog of brownish tear gas. This didn’t neutralize the crowds — it merely hurt and enraged them. The city understood it was being intentionally tormented by sadists and chose to walk into the tear gas out of spite.

Throughout the protests, politicians and media figures fixated on whether Portland and other cities were the site of “protests” or “riots.” The distinction was drawn solely based on the behavior of the protesters, whose actions were treated as if they occurred in a vacuum. But on the ground in Portland, that felt as if it was missing the point.

The protesters’ actions blurred the definition of nonviolence. They came wearing gas masks and carrying shields. People brought leaf blowers and intentionally blew the tear gas straight back at the agents who threw the canisters. They chucked plastic water bottles at the feds because they hated them and thought it might be funny to bonk them on their militarized helmets. No one was trying to murder the feds, but nevertheless, it was not the same as linking arms and walking down the streets of Selma while singing.

But if a riot was occurring in Portland, the feds had instigated it — preemptively escalating the situation with rubber bullets and pepper balls and gas canisters, weapons that don’t simply blur the definition of “nonlethal” but literally contradict it.

These unequal expectations were unfair to civilians. And they are being applied again, with greater weight and brutality, to the people of Minneapolis.

It is obvious that ICE’s presence in Minnesota is a source of conflict and anxiety. As feds leave disorder and fear in their wake, Minnesotans without training or state-issued protective gear are being asked to behave with greater restraint than the armed agents who are supposed to be upholding the law.

Early reporting would suggest that Pretti was violently killed while engaging nonviolently with federal law enforcement. Videos show that he was holding a phone and moving to help a protester when agents grabbed him by the legs and wrestled him to the ground. The agents shout that he has a gun only after they’ve pinned him to the ground.

Why must the victims of state violence be entrusted with the task of not escalating a situation?

But whatever happened, the physical coordinates of Pretti’s purported gun in the few seconds leading up to his killing are far less relevant than the ongoing siege of the Twin Cities. What, in the face of this aggression, is so relevant about his demeanor or his attitude or how he approached the agents right before his death? Why must the victims of state violence be entrusted with the task of not escalating a situation, when they’re not drawing a salary or health insurance or pension on the taxpayer’s dime?

The people are being charged with keeping the peace, asked to stand firm against the federal agents who are disrupting it. This is a sick form of double taxation — your paycheck gets docked so that a guy in a mask can beat you up while you try to calm him down. “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” Renee Good told ICE agents moments before they shot her through the side window of her car. Did she deserve to die because she did an inadequate job of tempering their feelings?

What is the point of pinning someone to the ground before pouring pepper spray in his face? What is the point of all of this, except to anger the public, and then to respond to that anger with even more force? ICE, CBP, and Border Patrol have proven themselves incapable of obeying the law, let alone enforcing it for others; unable to self-soothe, let alone keep the peace. ICE and its ilk are not an answer to a problem, but a problem with only one solution. They are malignant, they are worthless, and they should not exist.

﻿The M4’s magnetic mount securely sticks to your phone but sometimes struggles to stay attached to the actual controller.

As a retro gaming fan, I was thrilled when Apple opened its App Store to emulators in 2024, but I’ve yet to find a controller that makes me want to fully embrace retro gaming on my phone.

Clamp-on controllers like the Backbone Pro are a bit too bulky, and I don’t want to prop my phone up somewhere to use a standalone gamepad. The Abxylute M4 seemed exactly what I was looking for when it debuted a few months ago. It’s a compact wireless gamepad that uses a magnetic mount to attach to my iPhone. It’s a clever design, but one that’s let down by stiff thumbsticks and a magnetic mount that doesn’t always feel like it’s securely supporting my phone.

There are two components to the Abxylute M4: a retro-looking rectangular gamepad that connects to your smartphone over Bluetooth, and a Q-shaped mount that attaches the controller to your phone so it feels like you’re playing a handheld console. The mount is compatible with MagSafe iPhone models and the Google Pixel 10 Series. I primarily tested it with an iPhone 16 Pro, but Abxylute includes an adhesive metal ring you can stick to the back of any phone to make it compatible.

The ring of magnets on the M4’s mount stuck to the back of my iPhone as securely as any MagSafe accessory or Qi2 charger I’ve ever used. It’s not going to come off until you want it to. It also features a smooth finish, allowing you to rotate the mount and attach the gamepad so that it completely hides behind your phone instead of hanging off the side. But the whole thing ends up being too bulky and thick to slip into a pocket, so I’ve been removing it entirely when not playing.

One limitation of the M4’s design is that when attached, it can only be used to play games in a landscape orientation. In a vertical mode, the controller doesn’t protrude far enough for all its controls to be accessible. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but as a decades-old Game Boy fan, I tend to prefer playing games vertically. Recently announced mobile controllers like the GameSir Pocket Taco and the 8BitDo FlipPad support that.

A far bigger issue with the M4’s design, and a potential deal-breaker, is the connection between the mount and the controller. It also relies on a strong magnet that makes the controller snap into place when attached to the mount. But the connection doesn’t feel strong enough to always keep the mount securely connected to the controller while your phone’s attached.

The connection between the mount and controller feels secure enough when I’m holding the M4 and my phone up in front of me while playing a game. But at some angles, or when I accidentally bump my phone, the mount can separate from the gamepad. The two will also consistently disconnect if you absentmindedly turn the whole thing upside down, sending the phone and the attached mount falling. Thankfully, all my testing was done on a soft sofa.

I’m not the only one to experience this behavior. Retro Dodo’s Brandon Saltalamacchia did, too. The connection might fare better with a lighter phone, like the iPhone Air, but given smartphones are now a significant investment (my iPhone 16 Pro cost just shy of CA$1,500 here in Canada, or around $1,100 US), I’m not comfortable using the M4 as it’s designed.

The M4 isn’t entirely dependent on its magnetic mount. It can be used as a standalone controller with phones, consoles, or any device that supports Bluetooth gamepads. I was surprised at how comfortable it was to use with my gigantic hands. Its square-shaped design lets me reach the M4’s shoulder buttons without contorting my index fingers, and the build quality feels solid.

The controller’s four action buttons are small but have a satisfying amount of resistance. They’re paired with a large D-pad that’s a bit mushy and prone to registering inputs from multiple directions, but adequate for pick-up-and-play gaming sessions. Choose a different controller if you’re chasing high scores.

Abxylute includes two analog joysticks, a feature rarely found on controllers this size. They use a sliding disc design similar to what Nintendo used on the 3DS — but less effective. The sliding joysticks on the M4 are stiff and uncomfortable, making subtle movements nearly impossible. My thumb ached after just a handful of races in Mario Kart World, and I can’t see myself using either of the joysticks again.

As compact controllers go, the $49 Abxylute M4 is good, but far from great. But that’s not why people are going to buy it. Its promise of turning a smartphone into a handheld console helped the company raise over $300,000 from nearly 6,000 backers on Kickstarter — a lot of whom I think will be frustrated or disappointed if they’re not extra cautious while using it. Trusting your $1,000 mobile device to the M4 requires a leap of faith that’s a bit too far for me.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Doxxing is not a good reason to have faceless police.

﻿Doxxing is not a good reason to have faceless police.

Americans do not like masked secret police. There is really no other way to put it. The reasons why are manifold: accountability, trust in law enforcement, and just plain overall vibes. More concretely, not being able to tell who’s a cop and who’s not is dangerous. An assassin masquerading as law enforcement killed Minnesota legislator Melissa Hortman and her husband last year. How is anyone supposed to tell whether they’re being dragged out of their home in their underwear by ICE or by mere amateur thugs?

Last year, California passed the No Secret Police Act, which restricts masking for federal law enforcement, alongside the No Vigilantes Act, which requires law enforcement to wear some form of identification. The Department of Homeland Security immediately sued to enjoin the law on constitutional grounds; a judge has not yet ruled on whether to grant a preliminary injunction.

State legislatures all over the country continued to introduce their own anti-masking bills

Bills that ban masks on ICE agents have been introduced in Congress — from the identically named No Secret Police Act in the House to the VISIBLE Act in the Senate — but with Republican majorities in both chambers, neither of these bills is expected to become federal law. State legislatures have moved ahead without waiting for Washington, DC. Even after DHS sued to block California’s law, state legislatures all over the country continued to introduce their own anti-masking bills.

State legislatures that introduced bills last summer have slowly begun moving on them; just this past month, states like Maryland, Vermont, Washington, and Georgia introduced new bills. Los Angeles passed a city ordinance; the city of St. Paul is considering one as well. A Minnesota lawmaker says she will introduce her own bill when the session opens in February. Besides California, at least 15 state legislatures have their own anti-masking bills pending.

For their part, ICE has clung to the gaiters like life support. In an interview on Face the Nation last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused moderator Margaret Brennan of “doxxing” Jonathan Ross, the man who has been identified as the ICE agent who shot Renee Good despite his use of a face-obscuring gaiter in the many videos taken during the shooting.

“Don’t say his name, for heaven’s sakes. We shouldn’t have people continue to doxx law enforcement when they have an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against them,” Noem scolded Brennan. When Brennan pointed out that his name was public knowledge, Noem responded, “I know, but that doesn’t mean it should continue to be said.”

“The threats to federal officers are serious and potentially deadly,” the US Department of Justice claimed in its lawsuit to enjoin the No Secret Police Act. A list of such threats includes “taunting” and “online doxxing.”

A press release on the Department of Homeland Security website claims that death threats against ICE agents have increased 8,000 percent and that assaults have increased 1,300 percent. The webpage consists mostly of a lot of blurry screenshots of X posts. There are a handful of photos of injuries supposedly suffered by ICE agents — two photos of a hand bleeding from what is supposed to be a bite, and another photo (face partially obscured) of an agent with a busted lip.

This 1,300 percent increase in the kind of blood loss you’d get from a minor skateboarding injury is not a particularly compelling reason to allow law enforcement to wear masks. Noem sounds like a clown when she goes on about ICE agents getting doxxed. But she’s a clown with the law on her side.

California’s No Secret Police Act faces an uphill battle in the courts. For one thing, the law targets federal law enforcement but doesn’t apply the same requirements to local police. If that were the only problem, that would just be a matter of fixing the wording. But unfortunately for the 15 similar bills that are pending in other state legislatures, the most fundamental issue at play — the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution — gives the feds an advantage. States have a very limited capacity to affect how the feds do their jobs: that is sort of the point of federalism, after all. One legal expert claims that it is “clear” that the No Secret Police Act is constitutionally invalid; another makes the much more optimistic assessment that “under existing precedent, mask bans are neither clearly prohibited nor clearly permissible.”

But this being an open question of law is a bizarre insult to the conscience. It’s not just that it’s perfectly legal for ICE to mask themselves, it really might be illegal for the state of California to try to stop them.

Normal people despise the masks. Only 31 percent of Americans think ICE agents should be allowed to wear them. Even the sheltered, shrinking bubble of Republicans — whose approval of ICE floats somewhere between 70 and 80 percent — falters in enthusiasm when it comes to what ICE agents are wearing. (Sixty-three percent of Republicans are okay with the masks, but a majority of Republicans think agents should be in uniform.) After a Reagan-appointed federal judge heard out the reasoning for the masks, he called it “disingenuous, squalid and dishonorable,” saying that “ICE goes masked for a single reason — to terrorize Americans into quiescence.”

Most judges aren’t weird little internet forum trolls for whom doxxing is the greatest imaginable threat

When faced with the Trump administration’s single-minded obsession with “doxxing,” judges have often been either bemused or enraged. Part of this may be that most judges aren’t weird little internet forum trolls for whom doxxing is the greatest imaginable threat anyone can face. But more importantly, a federal judge — whose name and face are a matter of public record — frequently makes decisions likely to piss off very dangerous and violent people. The idea that an officer of the law must be faceless to do their job is an insult to their own line of work.

Cops, too, are not entirely sold on the masks — the International Association of Chiefs of Police issued a resolution warning against the use of face masks. In an interview with NPR last year, the head of the organization called face coverings “a real slippery slope,” saying that the masks undermined police legitimacy. “We feel strongly that the face coverings are inappropriate in most cases in policing in a democratic society in 2025,” he said.

This comes up in California’s defense of the No Secret Police Act and No Vigilantes Act — showing a face and a badge has long been a standard practice for policing at both the federal and local level. “Before January 2025, when the practice of conducting civil immigration enforcement in masks and without identifiers began, officers generally wore an ‘ICE’ or ‘ICE POLICE’ insignia with visible badge and number,” the state of California wrote in its response to Homeland Security’s lawsuit.

The state conceded that “while all law enforcement agents should be entitled to protection from harassment and doxxing,” it charged DHS with offering “no evidence that masking or refusing to wear a badge or identification number—practices virtually unheard of before 2025—does anything to ameliorate this risk.”

The masks aren’t normal. Americans don’t like them. The fact that California’s attempt to ban them is in dicey legal territory is a strong indicator that things have gone seriously sideways.

Policy ought to reflect the will of the people in a democratic society. California should not be in court defending its law from the Supremacy Clause because it should not have had to pass the law in the first place. In a saner world, Congress would have passed a federal version of the No Secret Police Act; in an even saner one, the executive branch would be at all responsive to the objections of voters and would have stopped the practice entirely.

Faceless officials with guns and body armor are crying about how scared they are of having their names on the internet, while shooting unarmed Americans in the face. The American system of government was not meant to be this unmoored from reality; normal constitutional workings are under strain because the federal government is too internet-addled to tell the difference between doxxing and murder. California’s No Secret Police Act is the backup generator turning on because the entire grid has collapsed. If it does manage to survive in court, it won’t be enough to save our democracy. And if it is struck down — well, there’s no backup for the backup generator.

The Sony LinkBuds Clip are the company’s first clip earbuds. They follow the innovative donut-hole LinkBuds and LinkBuds Open and, like their predecessors, allow you to listen to music or podcasts, make phone calls, or be active outdoors while still maintaining awareness of your surroundings. The clip design has become more popular over the past couple of years, and while the LinkBuds Clip have a solid design and good sound, there’s nothing significant that sets them apart from competitors, especially at their $229.99 price.

Like other open earbuds, the LinkBuds Clip wrap around your ear helix like an ear cuff. The small spherical speaker enclosure is positioned just outside your ear canal and is connected by a flexible band to a larger capsule-shaped housing that rests on the outside. I like the look of the Clip buds, with their slightly glossy enclosures and selection of subdued color tones, including lavender, green, greige (a grayish beige), and black. Some might prefer a bolder, flashier look, but I like the green sample Sony provided. You can also mix and match five different case covers — black, green, blue, coral, and lavender — to customize them.

Excellent call qualityComfortable fitLong battery lifeGood sound for open earbuds

More expensive than competitorsMissing some expected features

The Clip are intended to sit midway up your ear, but since everyone’s ears are different, there could be some adjustment to find the most comfortable spot for you (for me, it’s a little lower on my ear). Once you find the sweet spot, putting the earbuds on is quick and easy, although I found the fit a bit loose. The band isn’t as flexible as the one on the Shokz OpenDots One, which fit more securely around my ear. Instead, Sony includes silicone “cushions” that fit around the band. (Color-matching cushions come with the additional top case covers.) They gave me the secure fit I was looking for, and I was able to wear them for nearly an entire workday without discomfort. I even forgot I was wearing them at times, since they let in ambient sound. Those with larger ears might feel more of a pinch from them, even without the cushions attached.

While I preferred the fit of the LinkBuds Clip with the cushions, using them affected the sound balance. The cushions caused the speakers to sit just a bit farther away from my ear canal, which resulted in less bass performance. And the Clip — and really every pair of open earbuds — are a bit light on thumping bass. There are three primary listening modes: standard, voice boost, and sound leakage reduction.

Standard mode sounds the most natural, with a clear midrange that doesn’t overpower the higher frequencies. Voice boost added a bit too much vocal presence that became oppressive over longer music listening sessions, but added good clarity for podcasts and news programs. The sound leakage reduction mode cuts out much of the high-end response, limiting potential disturbances to those around you, but it also makes the music sound muffled and dull. And there wasn’t a significant amount of leakage anyway, even in standard and voice boost modes.

There are some presets in Sony’s Sound Connect app, as well as a 10-band equalizer, if you want to boost or cut a specific frequency range. For some of my more rocking tracks — Soundgarden’s “Spoonman,” for instance — I pumped up the bass and low mids a bit. There’s also Sony’s DSEE, which improves the sound of compressed audio a little bit.

The LinkBuds Clip really shine when on calls. They have a new AI noise-reduction chip and bone-conduction sensor that allow them to focus on the wearer’s voice and isolate it from the noise around them. During multiple calls while walking down the busier streets in my Los Angeles neighborhood, my friends could easily hear me, while the traffic around me was suppressed. There were occasional moments where they commented about hearing a gust of wind or the sirens of a nearby police car, but they were fleeting. It was during those moments, though, that I had some trouble hearing them because of the Clip’s open design.

I was a bit surprised at some of what was missing with the LinkBuds Clip, especially for $230. While they have good battery life at nine hours per charge (and another 28 hours with the case), the case doesn’t have wireless charging. The earbuds support the standard SBC and AAC codecs, but Sony’s own high-res LDAC is missing. They also don’t have audio sharing, which is available on the WF-1000XM5 and can now be found for only $25 more than the Clip.

The touch controls can be finicky. You use multiple taps for different controls — two taps on the right side to pause and play, three taps for the next song, and four taps to raise the volume (or lower the volume on the left earbuds). But the spot to tap on the band has a small margin of error, so if my finger was off target at all, the taps wouldn’t register. It was even harder while jogging. I’d need to slow down to a fast walk to get better control.

You can set up scene-based listening in the Sound Connect app, which allows you to customize the earbuds’ functionality based on your activity or location. So you can have a specific playlist start when you start running, or when you arrive home, the app can switch to your favorite music streaming service. You can also have the app read out notifications in your ear. It’s an interesting feature if you have certain routines and invest in the time to set it up.

It makes sense that Sony came out with the Clip, especially since it helped popularize the open earbuds trend with the original LinkBuds. And the Clip are good earbuds that look cool, sound pretty good, and are comfortable. But for $230, there’s nothing that sets them apart from other recent open earbuds like the Shokz OpenDots One and EarFun Clip, both of which are cheaper. Once they come down in price or go on sale, they’ll be much more of an enticing purchase. But until then, unless you’re in love with the LinkBuds Clip look, it’s better to wait.

            <div id="article-text">﻿New Jersey just approved a wildly out-of-step new law that restricts all e-bikes, regardless of speed or power capabilities. Will other states follow?

This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on the e-bike movement, follow Andrew J. Hawkins. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.

Last week, I did something I don’t typically do, which is call up one of my elected officials and yell at them about a new bill.

New Jersey’s car-brained lawmakers had just passed legislation that would impose heavy restrictions on e-bike ownership in the state, and I was livid. Obviously there’s been a lot of concern about the growing number of teenagers being injured and killed while riding e-bikes, many of them powerful, high-speed ones that are more akin to motorcycles than bikes. Lawmakers claim they’re just trying to bring some order to what is increasingly becoming a wild, unregulated market.

But the bill needlessly lumps together high-powered e-motos with low-speed pedal-assist bikes, often used by food delivery workers or parents who want to take their kids to school without using a car. Forcing someone who owns an e-bike without a throttle that can’t go faster than 20mph to register their bike with the DMV, acquire a license, and buy insurance seems ridiculous on its face, and will absolutely harm efforts to encourage more sustainable transportation modes in the state. And for that reason, I called up my governor and asked him to veto the bill.

Now, New Jerseyeans will be forced to reckon with one of the nation’s most restrictive e-bike laws. Bike advocates are aghast at how this bill sailed through the legislature and was signed into law at the eleventh hour by an outgoing governor. And they worry that other states will follow New Jersey’s lead, given the rising panic around teenagers riding e-bikes.

New York City recently capped e-bike speeds at 15mph, which is painfully slow and robs an e-bike’s ability to outmaneuver multi-ton SUVs and trucks on busy city roads. And now some Manhattan residents are calling for an outright ban on e-bikes in Central Park, citing a handful of collisions between pedestrians and e-bikes. Meanwhile, lawmakers in California have proposed a bill that would ban the sale of e-bikes with motors that exceed 750W of power.

To be sure, lawmakers are certainly getting an earful from their constituents about the proliferation of high-powered, high-speed e-bikes in their communities. Dip into any town’s Facebook group, and you’re likely to find a lot of pearl-clutching about teenagers riding e-bikes. And often their concerns are warranted, given the increasing rate of injuries and fatalities related to e-bikes. This is a problem that’s solvable with better infrastructure and more safety education, both for parents and their kids.

But when these complaints result in disastrous legislation, like in New Jersey, it adversely affects the broader community of people who want to use a low-cost, environmentally friendly mode of transportation to replace car trips — teens included. Multiple studies have shown that e-bikes are ridden more often than traditional bikes, and are typically used to replace car trips, which results in lower carbon emissions and cleaner, healthier communities. But rather than support and promote this mode of transportation by building bike lanes to protect riders, lawmakers are becoming more reactionary, which fails to address the real safety issues that contribute to the rising number of fatalities and injuries on our roadways: cars.

Bike advocates are scrambling to fix the glaring problems with New Jersey’s e-bike law, hoping to redirect the energy toward stricter rules around kids and e-motos. Their success is no guarantee.

But in the meantime, misinformation about e-bikes is proliferating online. My colleagues at the Montclair Bike Bus are being inundated with negative comments from people illogically equating all e-bikes with death and danger, failing to grasp the enormous difference between a 40mph electric dirt bike and a throttleless pedal assist bike that maxes out at 20mph.

None of this is surprising. In a country as car dependent as the US, we sometimes fail to grasp the need to promote better, more sustainable modes of transportation, instead of just working within the same, broken, car-centric system. There are many names for this phenomenon — windshield bias, car brain, motonormativity — the view that all decisions should be in service of the automobile. Lawmakers are especially prone to these biases.

It’s true that some e-bikes are a menace, just like some cars. But treating all e-bikes as the same, regardless of power capabilities and speed, fails to account for the enormous potential of e-bikes. I can’t help but think that e-bikes are victims of their own success. I’ve seen nasty comments from drivers annoyed about having to slow down for an immigrant delivery worker or a mom with her kids on a cargo bike, or about a new bike lane in their town. E-bikes are just as polarizing as they are popular, so maybe it was inevitable that car drivers, who can’t countenance any delay, no matter how slight, would strike back.

For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. The big question is: can the obvious risks of using AI for health-related queries be mitigated enough for them to be a net benefit? Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry.

Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy. The move marked a victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead. Read our story about what’s on the horizon.

This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance. Read the full story.

            <h2>America’s coming war over AI regulation</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/23/1131559/americas-coming-war-over-ai-regulation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.

Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.

While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance.

After all, wastewater contains saliva, urine, feces, shed skin, and more. You could consider it a rich biological sample. Wastewater analysis helped scientists understand how covid was spreading during the pandemic. It’s early days, but it is starting to help us get a handle on measles.

Globally, there has been some progress toward eliminating measles, largely thanks to vaccination efforts. Such efforts led to an 88% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that “nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine” since 2000.

Still, an estimated 95,000 people died from measles in 2024 alone—most of them young children. And cases are surging in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Last year, the US saw the highest levels of measles in decades. The country is on track to lose its measles elimination status—a sorry fate that met Canada in November after the country recorded over 5,000 cases in a little over a year.

Public health efforts to contain the spread of measles—which is incredibly contagious—typically involve clinical monitoring in health-care settings, along with vaccination campaigns. But scientists have started looking to wastewater, too.

Along with various bodily fluids, we all shed viruses and bacteria into wastewater, whether that’s through brushing our teeth, showering, or using the toilet. The idea of looking for these pathogens in wastewater to track diseases has been around for a while, but things really kicked into gear during the covid-19 pandemic, when scientists found that the coronavirus responsible for the disease was shed in feces.

This led Marlene Wolfe of Emory University and Alexandria Boehm of Stanford University to establish WastewaterSCAN, an academic-led program developed to analyze wastewater samples across the US. Covid was just the beginning, says Wolfe. “Over the years we have worked to expand what can be monitored,” she says.

Two years ago, for a previous edition of the Checkup, Wolfe told Cassandra Willyard that wastewater surveillance of measles was “absolutely possible,” as the virus is shed in urine. The hope was that this approach could shed light on measles outbreaks in a community, even if members of that community weren’t able to access health care and receive an official diagnosis. And that it could highlight when and where public health officials needed to act to prevent measles from spreading. Evidence that it worked as an effective public health measure was, at the time, scant.

Since then, she and her colleagues have developed a test to identify measles RNA. They trialed it at two wastewater treatment plants in Texas between December 2024 and May 2025. At each site, the team collected samples two or three times a week and tested them for measles RNA.

Over that period, the team found measles RNA in 10.5% of the samples they collected, as reported in a preprint paper published at medRxiv in July and currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal. The first detection came a week before the first case of measles was officially confirmed in the area. That’s promising—it suggests that wastewater surveillance might pick up measles cases early, giving public health officials a head start in efforts to limit any outbreaks.

There are more promising results from a team in Canada. Mike McKay and Ryland Corchis-Scott at the University of Windsor in Ontario and their colleagues have also been testing wastewater samples for measles RNA. Between February and November 2025, the team collected samples from a wastewater treatment facility serving over 30,000 people in Leamington, Ontario.

These wastewater tests are somewhat limited—even if they do pick up measles, they won’t tell you who has measles, where exactly infections are occurring, or even how many people are infected. McKay and his colleagues have begun to make some progress here. In addition to monitoring the large wastewater plant, the team used tampons to soak up wastewater from a hospital lateral sewer.

They then compared their measles test results with the number of clinical cases in that hospital. This gave them some idea of the virus’s “shedding rate.” When they applied this to the data collected from the Leamington wastewater treatment facility, the team got estimates of measles cases that were much higher than the figures officially reported.

Their findings track with the opinions of local health officials (who estimate that the true number of cases during the outbreak was around five to 10 times higher than the confirmed case count), the team members wrote in a paper published on medRxiv a couple of weeks ago.

There will always be limits to wastewater surveillance. “We’re looking at the pool of waste of an entire community, so it’s very hard to pull in information about individual infections,” says Corchis-Scott.

Wolfe also acknowledges that “we have a lot to learn about how we can best use the tools so they are useful.” But her team at WastewaterSCAN has been testing wastewater across the US for measles since May last year. And their findings are published online and shared with public health officials.

In some cases, the findings are already helping inform the response to measles. “We’ve seen public health departments act on this data,” says Wolfe. Some have issued alerts, or increased vaccination efforts in those areas, for example. “[We’re at] a point now where we really see public health departments, clinicians, [and] families using that information to help keep themselves and their communities safe,” she says.

McKay says his team has stopped testing for measles because the Ontario outbreak “has been declared over.” He says testing would restart if and when a single new case of measles is confirmed in the region, but he also thinks that his research makes a strong case for maintaining a wastewater surveillance system for measles.

McKay wonders if this approach might help Canada regain its measles elimination status. “It’s sort of like [we’re] a pariah now,” he says. If his approach can help limit measles outbreaks, it could be “a nice tool for public health in Canada to [show] we’ve got our act together.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.

Though ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives.

Some doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety [and] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”

The release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance.

But those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.

Pinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.

Sirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.

A different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.

For people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.

Since Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.

Some studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.

OpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.

An LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.

Even if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.

Lederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.

It’s supposed to be frigid in Davos this time of year. Part of the charm is seeing the world’s elite tromp through the streets in respectable suits and snow boots. But this year it’s positively balmy, with highs in the mid 30s, or a little over 1°C. The current conditions when I flew out of New York were colder, and definitely snowier. I’m told this is due to something called a föhn, a dry warm wind that’s been blowing across the Alps.

I’m no meteorologist, but it’s true that there is a lot of hot air here.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump arrived in Davos to address the assembly, and held forth for more than 90 minutes, weaving his way through remarks about the economy, Greenland, windmills, Switzerland, Rolexes, Venezuela, and drug prices. It was a talk lousy with gripes, grievances and outright falsehoods.

One small example: Trump made a big deal of claiming that China, despite being the world leader in manufacturing windmill componentry, doesn’t actually use them for energy generation itself. In fact, it is the world leader in generation, as well.

I did not get to watch this spectacle from the room itself. Sad!

By the time I got to the Congress Hall where the address was taking place, there was already a massive scrum of people jostling to get in.

I had just wrapped up moderating a panel on “the intelligent co-worker,” ie: AI agents in the workplace. I was really excited for this one as the speakers represented a diverse cross-section of the AI ecosystem. Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG had the macro strategic view; Enrique Lores, HP CEO, could speak to both hardware and large enterprises, Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh has the inside view on workforce training and transformation, Manjul Shah CEO of Hippocratic AI addressed working in the high stakes field of healthcare, and Kate Kallot CEO of Amini AI gave perspective on the global south and Africa in particular.

Interestingly, most of the panel shied away from using the term co-worker, and some even rejected the term agent. But the view they painted was definitely one of humans working alongside AI and augmenting what’s possible. Shah, for example, talked about having agents call 16,000 people in Texas during a heat wave to perform a health and safety check. It was a great discussion. You can watch the whole thing here.

But by the time it let out, the push of people outside the Congress Hall was already too thick for me to get in. In fact I couldn’t even get into a nearby overflow room. I did make it into a third overflow room, but getting in meant navigating my way through a mass of people, so jammed in tight together that it reminded me of being at a Turnstile concert.

The speech blew way past its allotted time, and I had to step out early to get to yet another discussion. Walking through the halls while Trump spoke was a truly surreal experience. He had truly captured the attention of the gathered global elite. I don’t think I saw a single person not starting at a laptop, or phone or iPad, all watching the same video.

Trump is speaking again on Thursday in a previously unscheduled address to announce his Board of Peace. As is (I heard) Elon Musk. So it’s shaping up to be another big day for elite attention capture.

I should say, though, there are elites, and then there are elites. And there are all sorts of ways of sorting out who is who. Your badge color is one of them. I have a white participant badge, because I was moderating panels. This gets you in pretty much anywhere and therefore is its own sort of status symbol. Where you are staying is another. I’m in Klosters, a neighboring town that’s a 40 minute train ride away from the Congress Centre. Not so elite.

There are more subtle ways of status sorting, too. Yesterday I learned that when people ask if this is your first time at Davos, it’s sometimes meant as a way of trying to figure out how important you are. If you’re any kind of big deal, you’ve probably been coming for years.

But the best one I’ve yet encountered happened when I made small talk with the woman sitting next to me as I changed back into my snow boots. It turned out that, like me, she lived in California–at least part time. “But I don’t think I’ll stay there much longer,” she said, “due to the new tax law.” This was just an ice cold flex.

Because California’s newly proposed tax legislation? It only targets billionaires.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. Read the full interview.

In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now. The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid.

Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again. What happens next could have big implications for mining and battery technology. Read the full story. This story first appeared in The Spark, our newsletter all about the tech we can use to combat the climate crisis. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Wednesday.

Cement hides in plain sight—it’s used to build everything from roads and buildings to dams and basement floors. But it’s also a climate threat. Cement production accounts for more than 7% of global carbon dioxide emissions—more than sectors like aviation, shipping, or landfills.

One solution to this climate catastrophe might be coursing through the pipes at Sublime Systems. The startup is developing an entirely new way to make cement. Instead of heating crushed-up rocks in lava-hot kilns, Sublime’s technology zaps them in water with electricity, kicking off chemical reactions that form the main ingredients in its cement.

But it faces huge challenges: competing with established industry players, and persuading builders to use its materials in the first place. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amsterdam-based hospitality tech platform Mews has raised €255 million (about $300 million) in a Series D funding round as it pushes deeper into automation and AI-powered workflows for hotels around the world.

The round was led by EQT Growth with new participation from Atomico and HarbourVest Partners, alongside existing backers including Kinnevik, Battery Ventures and Tiger Global. The investment values the company at roughly $2.5 billion.

Founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr and Matt Welle, Mews builds a cloud-native “operating system” for hotels  software that ties together reservations, check-ins, housekeeping, payments and more in one platform.

Its technology is designed to replace legacy systems that many hotels still rely on, offering a more flexible, connected way to manage day-to-day operations.

The new funding will be used to expand the company’s AI and automation capabilities at the core of its product.

That includes embedding agent-driven systems that can take on complex routine tasks, reduce manual work for staff and streamline how hotels handle everything from guest interactions to revenue management.

Mews says its platform already supports more than 15,000 properties in 85 countries, and in 2025 it processed nearly 42.3 million check-ins and handled nearly $20 billion in transaction volume.

The software also helped generate over $500 million in additional revenue for hoteliers through features like its Mews Spaces module.

In a statement, CEO Matt Welle said the new capital will help Mews build an operating system that handles operational complexity so hotel teams can focus on guest experience rather than juggling disparate tools.

“We are engineering an operating system that is changing how hoteliers interact with their guests,” CEO Matt Welle said, adding that the goal is to lighten the cognitive load on staff and make everyday operations smoother.

Industry observers say the round is one of the largest ever in hospitality software and reflects broader investor interest in infrastructure-level platforms that bring AI and fintech together for real-world business operations.

As hotels embrace digital transformation, technology that can automate workflows and personalise guest experiences  without adding complexity is increasingly in demand.

For Mews, the challenge now is execution: turning generous funding into tangible upgrades that deliver value for hoteliers of all sizes.

But with strong adoption, a global footprint and a growing suite of automation tools, the company is positioning itself as a central technology partner at a time when hotels are looking to modernise their operations and enhance guest satisfaction.

            <h2>How Flippa Is Removing the Language Barrier from Global Deal-Making</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-flippa-is-removing-the-language-barrier-from-global-deal-making">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, access to high-quality deal flow and sophisticated M&A infrastructure has been largely designed for well-connected investors and industry giants. Small businesses and independent founders, particularly those operating outside English-speaking markets, may often find the barriers even higher. Language, geography, and limited access to networks could mean that opportunity stops at the border.

Amidst this trend, Flippa, a platform for buying and selling digital businesses, is rewriting the script and dismantling those barriers. Under the leadership of CEO Blake Hutchison, the company has connected buyers and sellers across continents, linguistic differences, and price points, closing deals from $100,000 up to $10 million. Now, with the launch of its AI-powered multi-language Deal Room, Flippa is addressing what it sees as one of the last major points of disadvantage in global business deals and M&A, calling it the “Language Tax.”

Founded in 2009, Flippa has grown into a global marketplace where entrepreneurs can buy and sell digital assets ranging from e-commerce stores and SaaS businesses to YouTube channels, online communities, and mobile applications. According to Hutchison, the platform supports users from 189 countries, attracting over 450,000 new buyers in the last two years alone. “Our internal data shows that cross-border transactions now account for approximately 85% of all deals completed on the platform,” Hutchison says. “That growth has been especially pronounced in Europe. As a highly fragmented market with high cross-border trade volume but multiple operating languages, I believe Europe often faces structural friction in cross-border dealmaking.”

He notes that European businesses are increasingly being acquired by international buyers, with US-based acquirers representing a significant share of demand. Yet, as deal volumes continue to decline, Hutchison believes that language barriers have historically slowed or derailed otherwise viable transactions.

The company’s new multi-language Deal Room is designed to remove that friction entirely. Within the Deal Room, Hutchison notes that buyers and sellers can now negotiate and transact in their preferred languages. “For example, a French seller can communicate in French with an Italian or English-speaking buyer, who receives the message instantly translated into their own language,” he says, explaining how replies can be translated back in real time, while preserving the original message for verification and clarity.

Hutchison states, “Our goal is to make deal-making as efficient and approachable as possible. Whether you are a SaaS founder in Paris or an e-commerce operator in Berlin, you should be able to negotiate your exit in the language of your choice.”

Alongside the Deal Room translation tool, Flippa has also launched a fully localized French version of its platform, with Spanish scheduled to follow shortly. The expansion reflects the user demand and the reality that French and Spanish are not only widely spoken across Europe, but globally. Spanish is spoken by 550 million people globally, and is spoken widely across the US and Brazil. Similarly, French, being the 5th most widely spoken language in the world, has 321 million speakers, with 61.8% of those speakers living in parts of North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, significantly extending the global reach of European-founded businesses.

According to Hutchison, this shift comes as Europe’s M&A market continues to rise again, with an estimated USD412 billion in deal value, with mid-market and digital-first businesses representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Flippa’s role, according to Hutchison, has been to create infrastructure for businesses to source deals with greater reach than elite investment banks, but with a fraction of the cost.

“We often describe Flippa as the investment bank for the 99%,” Hutchison says. “The difference now is that geography and language no longer define who gets access. The demand for cross-border deals was already there. The technology simply needed to catch up.”

Flippa continues to integrate AI-driven discovery, valuation, and outreach tools through its proprietary LaurenAI engine. “The model is trained on more than 200,000 historical listings and transactions,” he explains. “The system then helps buyers identify opportunities, estimate enterprise value, and initiate conversations at scale.” It autonomously indexes the web to identify businesses across SaaS, e-commerce, apps, publishing, and next-generation media.

Human expertise remains embedded in the process, with certified brokers and M&A professionals supporting transactions once a match is made. As Hutchison puts it, “LaurenAI gives people the ability to access off-market deals and build pipelines the same way Wall Street players do, but without the barriers of capital or connections.”

He notes that entrepreneurs who may not feel confident negotiating complex deal terms in English can now access global liquidity without intermediaries or external advisors. At the same time, international buyers can gain visibility into high-quality European businesses that were previously difficult to source or engage.

As digital entrepreneurship continues to globalize, Flippa is positioning itself at the center of a more inclusive M&A ecosystem, one where language is no longer a tax on ambition and opportunities. Flippa’s multi-language Deal Room represents a structural shift in how global deal-making can be done. For founders and buyers alike, it signals a future where the next meaningful transaction can begin in any language, from anywhere in the world.

            <h2>French fintech Pennylane raises €175M</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/french-fintech-pennylane-raises-e175m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-based fintech Pennylane has just pulled off one of Europe’s most noteworthy funding rounds of the year, announcing €175 million in new capital to accelerate its push into artificial intelligence and expand its footprint across the continent. 
The round was led by growth investor TCV, with participation from Blackstone Growth and a group of existing backers that includes Sequoia Capital, DST Global, CapitalG and Meritech Capital.

What makes this raise stand out isn’t just the size of the cheque, though €175 million is hard to ignore in a selective funding market, but the strategic timing and purpose behind it. Pennylane says it didn’t need the capital to survive; it chose to raise now to double down on AI product development and prepare for a phase of market consolidation in European financial software.

Since its founding in 2020, Pennylane has positioned itself as more than just an accounting tool. It has built what it calls a financial operating system for small and mid-sized businesses and the accountants who serve them, bringing invoicing, payments, bookkeeping, and cash-flow management into a shared platform.

That unified approach taps a persistent pain point in Europe’s SME economy, where many companies still stitch together separate systems to manage their finances.

The new funds will support expanded R&D, particularly in generative AI, with early efforts already focused on building intelligent assistants that help accountants interpret data, automate routine bookkeeping, and deliver richer insights to their clients.

The company is also gearing up for regulatory shifts, including electronic invoicing mandates rolling out across several EU countries and refining localisation for key markets like Germany.

Pennylane’s latest round reportedly values the company at about $4.25 billion (€3.6 billion), reinforcing its unicorn status and standing among Europe’s higher-valued fintech startups. That valuation reflects both investor confidence and the company’s growing footprint: Pennylane is used by thousands of accounting firms and hundreds of thousands of businesses across several European markets.

This deal also underscores a broader trend in European tech: AI is moving beyond buzzy chatbots and large language models into critical business infrastructure.

Fintech tools, compliance software, and productivity platforms are increasingly weaving machine learning and automation into once manual workflows. For accountants juggling multiple clients in different jurisdictions, AI isn’t a luxury; it’s a practical way to keep up with regulatory complexity and expectations for real-time financial insights.

Strategically, Pennylane’s timing matters. European financial software is under pressure to modernise rapidly as digital tax reporting and e-invoicing standards become the norm rather than the exception.

By raising capital now, even without immediate pressure,  Pennylane is planting a flag as these shifts accelerate. The presence of heavyweight global investors like TCV and Blackstone signals that international capital still sees promise in Europe’s SaaS and AI stack.

But there’s a deeper dynamic at play. In Europe, fintech innovation often means balancing diversification with consolidation. Investors backing Pennylane now are betting that the company can serve as a common platform for both accountants and SMEs across borders, a role that gets harder as local regulatory regimes and market expectations diverge.

Generative AI, if deployed thoughtfully, could be what ties all those variations together, letting the platform adapt to local tax rules or reporting needs without keeping teams chained to repetitive work.

From Berlin to Barcelona, founders and investors alike are watching to see whether this latest bet on AI financial tooling pays off. In a funding landscape where some sectors have tightened, and valuations have been scrutinised, Pennylane’s ability to attract major global backers while maintaining founder control and avoiding unnecessary dilution signals that Europe’s fintech scene still has room to grow.

For businesses and accountants alike, the surge in capital behind AI-first tools could translate into more seamless workflows, smarter insights, and faster decision-making.

And if Pennylane’s vision plays out, it might not just be a win for one French unicorn, but a sign that European software can innovate too, not by mimicking Silicon Valley, but by solving problems that are uniquely local, and increasingly global.

            <div id="article-text">In October 2021, the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn interpreted the first movement of Beethoven’s 10th unfinished symphony, which was completed with the use of artificial intelligence.

A team of computer scientists, music historians, musicologists, and composers developed the ‘Beethoven AI’ to analyze Beethoven’s music style and life, using the sketches he left behind of the 10th symphony, plus works from other composers that had a notable influence on his life, such as Johann Sebastian Bach, to generate pieces that reflect what he would have composed.

Beethoven AI, as others AI composition programs, produces music in the same way ChatGPT produces outcomes. It uses machine learning and algorithms to analyse musical data and patterns, and generative models to produce music based on inputted prompts.

Hence, the AI tool was trained by the team of experts and provided with all the necessary information for it to understand, be contextualized, and finally, be able to create something that Beethoven himself could have written.

This milestone raises an important question that becomes more relevant day by day: as technology becomes increasingly capable of initiating creativity, what remains distinctly human in the classical music world?

Can AI replace the sensitivity and humanity needed to compose, interpret, convey the emotions, or communicate the composer’s intended message?

Classical music has historically been a niche domain. It was born in the house of Jesus as the natural successor after choral music.

Whatsoever, only the most privileged ones, those of noble background or family with ties to music, could dedicate their lives to the study of an instrument or composition, and only those part of the aristocracy had the privilege to enjoy it.

Over time and thanks to globalization and the massive spread of information, classical music has expanded, allowing millions of people around the world to be delighted by it.

Digital platforms like Spotify and YouTube offer all audiences the opportunity to access an immense variety of compositions and recordings across history, democratizing classical music.

Simultaneously, social media allows traditional or innovative artists to showcase their interpretation of it, whether it is a classical performance of Campanella by Paganini or a modern version of The Four Seasons by Vivaldi, played as a trap variation.

The introduction of modern technologies has represented an opportunity for the classical music industry to find innovative ways to remain relevant in a fast-paced world.

The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has launched a digital concert hall, a streaming platform for users to access multiple recordings and content on demand. Similarly, the Philharmonia Orchestra uses Virtual Reality to create an immersive experience, allowing the audience to enjoy the concerts onstage, among the players.

However, the new technologies also symbolize a challenge and introduce concerns about the future of human creativity for the creative industries, including the classical music world.

AyseDeniz Gokcin, a Turkish pianist, uses AI to arrange pieces from iconic composers, adapting them to modern trends or to what they might have produced if they lived today, which risks displacing contemporary composers trying to establish their own voices.

From a symphony finished with AI, to the experience of listening to an orchestra being onstage with them, or to have the possibility of listening to your favorite composer in a modern, personalized style, technology brings clear advantages to the classical music industry.

A study in ‘Music Composition with AI’ made by the World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews (WJARR) highlights how AI technologies can improve efficiency and accessibility, preserve and enhance historical pieces, and unlock new possibilities for innovation in performance and education. Y

et, it also challenges the role of human artistry and raises concerns about the lack of emotional depth, ethical and legal issues, and the livelihoods of today’s musicians and composers.

AI can be a powerful tool and ally for those who are willing to work with it as an extension of human creativity and as a means to explore new ways of expressing themselves.

While those who see it as a threat can focus on seeing AI as a digital instrument that will never replace the touch of mankind, since it depends on artists to create, replicate, and generate outcomes.

Lastly, it is on us, creators and audiences, to make a conscious choice in how we use new technologies and to preserve humanity in a rapidly evolving world.

            <h2>Op-Ed: Can Europe’s Digital Networks Act deliver for AI and Startups?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Europe races into the AI era, its policymakers are laying new pipes for the continent’s digital future. The European Commission’s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) promises to rewire the EU’s telecom landscape, with big implications for artificial intelligence infrastructure, connectivity equity, and the startup ecosystem.

Exposed as part of a broader push to make Europe “fit for the Digital Age,” the draft law aims to modernize how networks are built and regulated, from 5G towers in rural villages to fiber links between data centers.

I have to say it’s a bold vision of a more connected, innovative Europe, but one that must navigate a thicket of competing interests and unanswered questions.

For years, EU leaders have urged the creation of a true single market for digital services. The DNA is a centerpiece of that strategy, aligning with Europe’s Digital Decade goals for universal high-speed internet by 2030.

How can we translate this? Well, I think Brussels wants to turn the patchwork of 27 national telecom systems into one seamless network. The Act’s core objective is to “harmonise the EU connectivity sector by addressing delays, inconsistencies, and fragmentation”, removing barriers to cross-border operations and stimulating investment in very high-capacity networks.

This mirrors the logic behind earlier EU tech regulations;  just as the Digital Markets Act tackled Big Tech gatekeepers, the Digital Networks Act targets the digital plumbing beneath them.

This reform doesn’t come out of the blue.

A Commission white paper in 2024 warned that without cutting-edge digital infrastructure, Europe’s digital economy would stall. It painted vivid scenarios: doctors unable to perform remote surgery, smart farms and self-driving cars hamstrung by slow connections.

Secure and sustainable networks are one of the “cardinal points” of the EU’s 2030 digital agenda.

The DNA is Brussels’ attempt to meet those needs by boosting investment, standardizing rules, and making sure that every corner of Europe can plug into the opportunities of the digital age.

At its core, the Act hands telecom operators some long-sought gifts. One headline measure would grant carriers unlimited radio-spectrum licenses, ending the era of auctions that force telcos to periodically renew their rights.

For Europe’s big mobile providers, this change offers certainty: they can invest in 5G and future 6G networks without fearing their spectrum will expire.

Regulators argue this will “increase investment predictability” and accelerate network roll-out.

In theory, more cell towers could now reach remote areas, and companies might more freely trade or lease unused frequencies to new players.

The DNA couples permanent licenses with “use-it-or-share-it” obligations to prevent hoarding. If an incumbent isn’t using its spectrum in, say, a rural region, it could be forced to share it or lose it,  allowing a competitor or community network to serve that area.

It’s a nod to connectivity equity: Europe doesn’t want scarce wireless spectrum lying fallow while some communities remain underserved.

Broadband for all is the mantra, and long license tenures will come with accountability to deliver on coverage.

Another provision tightens the oversight of dominant firms. Under current plans, if a telecom operator holds significant market power (SMP) in one market (for example, fixed broadband), regulators could extend that designation to a closely related market (like mobile services).

In practice, this means big incumbents might face extra obligations, from transparency to price controls, across their range of services. The idea is to prevent giants from leveraging their dominance in one domain to squelch competition in another.

That could open space for smaller internet providers or innovative ISPs to compete, a boon for consumer choice and startup entrants.

A cohort of six member states,  including France, Germany and Italy, has pushed back, urging Brussels not to centralize control over frequencies and mergers.

Spectrum auctions have long been jealously guarded as national turf (they can fill state coffers, after all), and capitals are wary of one-size-fits-all rules emanating from the EU.

These governments also worry that encouraging pan-European telecom mergers (another idea floated in the reform) could reduce competition at home. In their joint memo, they caution that while a level playing field between telecoms and tech firms is a laudable goal, “this does not necessarily imply the same regulations should apply”to both sectors.

It’s a reminder that the DNA, for all its single-market ideals, must reckon with political realities: Europe’s telecom revolution won’t happen without consensus among very different national markets.

Perhaps the most contentious debate surrounding the Digital Networks Act has been over who pays for the next-generation networks. Telecom giants have spent years lobbying for a “fair share” contribution from Big Tech, arguing that bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix, YouTube, and cloud platforms should chip in to finance the infrastructure that carries their content.

The draft Act steers clear of any direct “network usage fee” on content providers. Instead, it reaffirms Europe’s commitment to net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic must be treated equally by providers.

Any cooperation with Big Tech will rely on voluntary “best practice” discussions moderated by EU regulators, not on legally mandated payments.

This decision followed intense pushback from many sides. Over the summer, consumer groups and tech industry alliances publicly warned against reviving the “fair share” idea under any guise, noting it had been “clearly rejected in previous consultations” for threatening consumers, competition and innovation.

Even a U.S.–EU trade agreement in late 2025 extracted a pledge from Brussels “not [to] adopt or maintain network usage fees”, highlighting the geopolitical stakes of singling out mostly American tech firms.

On the other hand, startups and digital rights advocates breathed a sigh of relief at the Commission’s stance. Allied for Startups, a coalition of European entrepreneurs, argued that net neutrality is essential for startup growth, preventing a two-tier internet that would “favour dominant players” and raise barriers for newcomers.

In their view, a “traffic tax” isn’t just about Google or Amazon’s bottom line, it would set a harmful precedent that could box out the little guys who rely on affordable, equal-access bandwidth to innovate.

By keeping the DNA free of explicit network fees, Europe is signaling that the open internet won’t be collateral damage in the drive for better infrastructure.

Beyond telecom boardrooms and Silicon Valley balance sheets, the Digital Networks Act is ultimately about the kind of digital society Europe wants to build.

A major motivation is preparing for a future where artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT devices are ubiquitous, and will demand unprecedented bandwidth and low latency.

The Commission’s own analysis stresses that only with the “highest performance” networks will transformative technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, remote health care, and smart grids reach their potential.

In simple terms: if data is the new oil, Europe needs better pipes to pump it.

The Digital Networks Act sits alongside Europe’s broader tech push by focusing on the infrastructure AI needs to scale. Beyond regulating AI, the EU is investing in next-generation networks, from fiber to 5G and 6G, through initiatives such as the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.

Faster rollout of these networks would underpin everything from AI-driven industry to cloud services, all of which depend on high-capacity, cross-border connectivity.

The Act also addresses connectivity equity. While Europe’s digital goals assume universal gigabit access and widespread 5G, large parts of the continent still lag behind.

The proposal combines simpler deployment rules with tougher coverage obligations, while allowing flexibility where older networks cannot yet be switched off. The aim is to expand access without letting rigid deadlines slow progress.

Whether this works will depend on execution. Investment still favors dense urban markets, and rural coverage remains a challenge. If the Act can meaningfully lift fiber and 5G reach across Europe, it could help ensure the AI economy extends beyond major tech hubs to the rest of the continent.

From the perspective of Europe’s startups and innovators, the DNA is a double-edged sword that tilts promisingly toward opportunity. On one side, the Act’s push to harmonize telecom rules could tear down barriers that have long frustrated young companies.

Today, a cloud services startup or an IoT device maker in Europe must navigate a maze of national regulations when scaling up, from differing network standards to separate certification hoops in each country.

By creating a more unified framework (for instance, common rules on spectrum and infrastructure access), the DNA could make it easier for a startup in Portugal to expand its services to Poland or Finland without running into 27 different regulatory roadblocks.

Startups rely on an open and predictable internet, and on this front the Commission’s approach offers some reassurance. By preserving net neutrality and rejecting new network tolls, the Act allows young companies to reach users on equal terms, without the risk that deeper-pocketed rivals can buy preferential treatment.

For small fintech or AI startups, avoiding additional network costs matters, and under the current proposal they won’t be asked to shoulder them.

At the same time, founders are reading the fine print carefully. Proposals around a “level playing field” raise concerns that telecom-style regulation could spill over onto digital services, including smaller platforms.

The balance remains fragile: regulate too little and dominant players squeeze out challengers; regulate too broadly and compliance costs can smother the next generation of European tech companies.

As an ambitious blueprint for Europe’s digital infrastructure, the Digital Networks Act embodies a careful balancing act. It must entice telecom operators to spend the billions needed to upgrade networks for an AI-driven future, yet not at the expense of the open internet or new challengers.

It seeks to unify Europe’s connectivity market while respecting that one size may not fit all in a Union of 27. In the coming months, EU lawmakers and member states will debate and tweak the proposal, and the stakes are high.

The outcome will shape not just who foots the bill for Europe’s next-gen networks, but also who can innovate on those networks in the years ahead.

There will be bumps on this road, resistance from powerful telecom lobbies, wrangling between capitals and Brussels, and possibly even transatlantic frictions.

In the end, the Digital Networks Act is about Europe’s place in the digital world. A continent that pioneered GSM mobile standards and championed data privacy now wants to set the standard for equitable, innovation-friendly networks.

Striking a balance between investment and fairness, between scale and competition, won’t be easy. But it’s essential. If the EU succeeds, the reward could be a resilient digital backbone capable of supporting AI breakthroughs and economic growth across all its regions, without leaving its core values behind.

If it stumbles, Europe risks buffering on the sidelines while others surge ahead.

The coming debate will reveal whether Europe can indeed reshape its digital DNA for the better, or if old divides will slow down this grand connectivity project.

Either way, the world will be watching the EU’s next move in this high-stakes telecom reboot.
