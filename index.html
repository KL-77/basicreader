            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/apps-like-grok-are-explicitly-banned-under-googles-rules-why-is-it-still-in-the-play-store/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s xAI recently weakened content guard rails for image generation in the Grok AI bot. This led to a new spate of non-consensual sexual imagery on X, much of it aimed at silencing women on the platform. This, along with the creation of sexualized images of children in the more compliant Grok, has led regulators to begin investigating xAI. In the meantime, Google has rules in place for exactly this eventuality—it’s just not enforcing them.

It really could not be more clear from Google’s publicly available policies that Grok should have been banned yesterday. And yet, it remains in the Play Store. Not only that—it enjoys a T for Teen rating, one notch below the M-rated X app. Apple also still offers the Grok app on its platform, but its rules actually leave more wiggle room.

App content restrictions at Apple and Google have evolved in very different ways. From the start, Apple has been prone to removing apps on a whim, so developers have come to expect that Apple’s guidelines may not mention every possible eventuality. As Google has shifted from a laissez-faire attitude to more hard-nosed control of the Play Store, it has progressively piled on clarifications in the content policy. As a result, Google’s rules are spelled out in no uncertain terms, and Grok runs afoul of them.

Google has a dedicated support page that explains how to interpret its “Inappropriate Content” policy for the Play Store. Like Apple, the rules begin with a ban on apps that contain or promote sexual content including, but not limited to, pornography. That’s where Apple stops, but Google goes on to list more types of content and experiences that it considers against the rules.

“We don’t allow apps that contain or promote content associated with sexually predatory behavior, or distribute non-consensual sexual content,” the Play Store policy reads (emphasis ours). So the policy is taking aim at apps like Grok, but this line on its own could be read as focused on apps featuring “real” sexual content. However, Google is very thorough and has helpfully explained that this rule covers AI.

The detailed policy includes examples of content that violate this rule, which include much of what you’d expect—nothing lewd or profane, no escort services, and no illegal sexual themes. After a spate of rudimentary “nudify” apps in 2020 and 2021, Google added language to this page clarifying that “apps that claim to undress people” are not allowed in Google Play. In 2023, as the AI boom got underway, Google added another line to note that it also would remove apps that contained “non-consensual sexual content created via deepfake or similar technology.”

Taken together, Google’s description of bannable apps describes Grok’s app to a tee. Google made these additions as new threats became apparent, knowing that developers would try to publish AI-undressing apps in the Play Store. The company did not, apparently, think the world’s richest person would be the one pushing digital humiliation tools on its platform. And Google’s response to this situation so far has been to do nothing.

The backlash to xAI’s loosened restrictions prompted the company to limit access to image editing slightly. You can no longer edit images on X without paying for a premium plan. However, the Grok app does not have that limitation. Anyone who downloads Grok can use it to create non-consensual sexual content.

Since the app is cleared for teens, even devices with parental controls enabled will permit 13- to 17-year-olds to download Grok. There is no paywall, and you don’t even have to log in before editing your first image. The app does ask the user to confirm their birth year, but teenagers would never lie about that, right?

This is not xAI’s first problem with non-consensual sexual content. Last year, the AI was widely used to create fake Taylor Swift nudes. However, in that case, users were simply prompting the bot with the singer’s name—Grok can create entirely new images of famous people because the training data includes real images of them. Grok’s newer ability to “edit” images of people is a different and more insidious feature because it can turn anyone into an AI plaything.

Ars has reached out to Google to ask why Grok has not been removed and why it has retained a Teen rating. The company has declined to make a statement at this time. So we’re left with a policy that explicitly bans apps like Grok, but Google is taking no action to enforce those policies, allowing impressionable teenagers and unsavory weirdos to use it to sexualize real people.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasas-newest-telescope-will-play-an-outsize-role-in-finding-earth-2-0/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Among other things, the James Webb Space Telescope is designed to get us closer to finding habitable worlds around faraway stars. From its perch a million miles from Earth, Webb’s huge gold-coated mirror collects more light than any other telescope put into space.

The Webb telescope, launched in 2021 at a cost of more than $10 billion, has the sensitivity to peer into distant planetary systems and detect the telltale chemical fingerprints of molecules critical to or indicative of potential life, like water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane. Webb can do this while also observing the oldest observable galaxies in the Universe and studying planets, moons, and smaller objects within our own Solar System.

Naturally, astronomers want to get the most out of their big-budget observatory. That’s where NASA’s Pandora mission comes in.

The Pandora satellite rocketed into orbit early Sunday from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. It hitched a ride with around 40 other small payloads aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, launching into a polar Sun-synchronous orbit before deploying at an altitude of roughly 380 miles (613 kilometers).

Over the next few weeks, ground controllers will put Pandora through a series of commissioning and calibration steps before turning its eyes toward deep space. Pandora is a fraction of the size of Webb. Its primary mirror is about the size of the largest consumer-grade amateur telescopes, less than one-tenth the dimension of Webb’s. NASA capped Pandora’s budget at $20 million. The budget to develop Webb was more than 500 times higher.

So what can little Pandora add to Webb’s bleeding-edge science? First, it helps to understand how scientists use Webb to study exoplanets. When a planet passes in front of its parent star, some of the starlight shines through its atmosphere. Webb has the sensitivity to detect the filtered starlight and break it apart into its spectral components, telling astronomers about the composition of clouds and hazes in the planet’s atmosphere. Ultimately, the data is useful in determining whether an exoplanet might be like Earth.

“I liken it often to holding a glass of wine in front of a candle, so that we can see really what’s inside,” said Daniel Apai, a member of Pandora’s science team from the University of Arizona. “We can assess, basically, the quality of the wine. In this case, we use the light that filters through the star’s [atmosphere] through the planetary atmosphere to judge what chemicals, gases in particular, may be present. Water vapor is one that we are the most sensitive to.”

But there’s a catch. Stars shine millions to billions of times brighter than their planetary companions, and starlight isn’t constant. Like the Sun, other stars have spots, flares, and variability over hours, days, or years. Hot spots and cool spots rotate in and out of view. And the star’s own atmospheres can contain some of the same molecules scientists are seeking to find on exoplanets, including water vapor.

Therefore, a star’s spectral signature easily outshines the signal coming from a nearby planet. Astronomers discovered this signal “contamination” when they started looking for potentially habitable worlds, injecting confounding uncertainties into their findings. Were the promising spectra they were seeing coming from the planet or the star?

“One of the ways that this manifests is by making you think that you’re seeing absorption features like water and potentially methane when there may not be any, or, conversely, you’re not seeing the signatures that are there because they’re masked by the stellar signal,” said Tom Barclay, deputy project scientist and technical lead on the Pandora mission at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.

The problem became apparent in the 2010s as astronomers used more powerful telescopes to see the finer details of exoplanets.

“This is something that we always suspected as a community,” Apai told Ars. “We always suspected that stars are not perfect. At some point, it becomes a problem. But it was not recognized how serious a problem that is until, I would say, about 2017 or 2018.”

Scientists quickly got to work looking for a solution, and NASA selected the Pandora mission for development in 2021, just months before the launch of Webb.

“When we’re trying to find water in the atmospheres of these small Earth-like planets, we want to be really sure it’s not coming from the star before we go tell the press and make a big stink about it,” said Elisa Quintana, Pandora’s lead scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “So we designed the Pandora mission specifically to solve this problem.”

From low-Earth orbit, Pandora will observe exoplanets and their stars simultaneously, allowing astronomers to correct their measurements of the planet’s atmospheric composition and structure based on the ever-changing conditions of the host star itself. Webb could theoretically do this work, but scientists already fill every hour of Webb’s schedule. Pandora will point and stare at 20 preselected exoplanets 10 times during its one-year prime mission, collecting 24 hours of visible and infrared observations with each visit. This will capture short-term and longer-term changes in each star’s behavior.

SpaceX launched Pandora into a so-called “twilight orbit” that follows the boundary between day and night on Earth, allowing the satellite to keep its solar panels illuminated by the Sun while performing its observations.

“We can send this small telescope out, sit on a star for a really long time, and sort of map all the star spots, and really disentangle the star and planet signals,” Quintana said in a recent panel discussion at NASA Goddard. “It’s filling a really nice gap in helping us to sort of calibrate all these stars that James Webb is going to look at, so we can be really confident that all of these molecules that we’re detecting in planets are real.”

“I think this is really the most important scientific barrier that we have to break down to fully unlock the potential of Webb and future missions,” Apai said.

Ben Hord, a member of Pandora’s science team at Goddard, singled out one example in a presentation at an American Astronomical Society meeting last year. This planet, named GJ 486 b, is a “super-Earth” discovered in 2021 circling a relatively cool red dwarf star. Hord said astronomers had trouble determining if the planet has a water-rich atmosphere based on Webb’s observations alone.

“We want to know if water is in the atmospheres of these exoplanets, and this stellar contamination from the spots on the star can mask or mimic features like water,” Hord said. “Our hope is that Pandora will help James Webb data be even more precise by providing context and understanding for these host stars and these planetary systems.”

Planets around small dwarf stars are some of the best candidates for finding a true Earth analog. Because these stars put out a fraction of the heat of the Sun, a potentially habitable planet could lurk very close to its host, completing a year in a handful of days. This allows astronomers to see the planet repeatedly as it passes in front of its star, rapidly building a dataset on its size, structure, and environment.

Scientists hope they can extend the lessons learned from Pandora’s observations of a sample of 20 exoplanets to other worlds in our galactic neighborhood. As of late last year, astronomers have confirmed detections of more than 6,000 exoplanets.

“With a well-corrected spectrum, we can say there’s water, there’s nitrogen,” Quintana said. “So with every mission, as we evolve, we’re chipping away and taking bigger and bigger steps toward that question of, ‘OK, we know Earths are out there. We know they’re abundant. We know they have atmospheres. How do we know if they have life on them?’”

A mission like Pandora was not possible until recently, certainly not on the $20 million budget NASA devoted to the project. With Pandora, the agency took advantage of a fast-growing small satellite industry churning out spacecraft at a fraction of what it cost 10 or 15 years ago.

The Pandora spacecraft weighed approximately 716 pounds (325 kilograms) at launch and likely would have required a dedicated rocket to travel to space before SpaceX started offering shared rides on its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket. NASA did not disclose what it paid SpaceX to launch Pandora, but publicly available pricing suggests SpaceX charges a few million dollars to launch a satellite of the same size. Before the rideshare option became available, NASA would have paid tens of millions of dollars for the launch alone.

The Pandora mission is part of NASA’s Astrophysics Pioneers program, an initiative set up to solicit ideas for lower-cost astronomy missions.

“It’s been very, very challenging to try and squeeze this big amount of science into this small cost box, but that’s kind of what makes it fun, right?” Barclay told Ars. “We have to be pretty ruthless in making sure that we only fund the things we need to fund. We accept risk where we need to accept the risk, and at times we need to accept that we may need to give up performance in order to make sure that we hit the schedule and we hit the launch [schedule].”

It helps that Pandora’s 17-inch (45-centimeter) telescope comes from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, which had the technology on the shelf from a national security program. Pandora uses a small satellite platform from Blue Canyon Technologies, a Colorado company.

“There is no way we could have done Pandora 10 years ago,” Barclay said. “The small launch capabilities that come from companies like Rocket Lab and SpaceX and others meant that now the vendors of spacecraft buses and spacecraft instruments are able to push their costs down because they know that there’s a market for small missions out there. Other parts of the government are investing heavily in small spacecraft, and so that allows us on the science side to make use of that economies of scale.”

For comparison, the European Space Agency launched an exoplanet observatory about the same size as Pandora in 2019 at a cost of more than $100 million.

There are companies now looking at how to scale up production of larger satellites, too. Cheaper, heavy satellites could launch on new heavy- and super-heavy rockets like SpaceX’s Starship or Blue Origin’s New Glenn.

“I think it is an amazing capability to have for astrophysicists because science is moving fast,” Apai said. “Exoplanet science is changing. I would say every three or four years, we have breakthroughs. And the product keeps changing. We push the boundaries, and if you ever have to work with 20- or 25-year-long mission lifetimes, that really just limits progress.”</div>

            <h2>Apple chooses Google’s Gemini over OpenAI’s ChatGPT to power next-gen Siri</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/01/apple-says-its-new-ai-powered-siri-will-use-googles-gemini-language-models/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The “more intelligent” version of Siri that Apple plans to release later this year will be backed by Google’s Gemini language models, the company announced today. CNBC reports that the deal is part of a “multi-year partnership” between Apple and Google that will allow Apple to use Google’s AI models in its own software.

“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” reads an Apple statement given to CNBC.

Today’s announcement confirms reporting by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman late last year that Apple and Google were nearing a deal. Apple didn’t disclose terms, but Gurman said that Apple would be paying Google “about $1 billion a year” for access to its AI models “following an extensive evaluation period.”

Bloomberg has also reported that the Gemini model would be run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, “ensuring that user data remains walled off from Google’s infrastructure,” and that Apple still hopes to improve its own in-house language models to the point that they can eventually be used instead of relying on third-party models.

Although Apple’s iPhones and iOS compete with Google’s Android operating system and the many smartphones that use it, the companies still cooperate in plenty of other areas. Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (though that deal has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years).

Apple’s announcement is a blow to OpenAI and the many versions of its ChatGPT model, which Apple has used elsewhere in iOS and macOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple also tested OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude models before deciding to go with Gemini. ChatGPT came out ahead of Gemini in tests that Ars ran using earlier versions of the models, but Google’s models have apparently improved enough (and amassed enough users) to worry OpenAI; CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red” last month and pushed back several planned ChatGPT features so that the company could better respond to Google’s Gemini 3 release.

Apple originally promised the improved, AI-powered Siri for 2024’s iOS 18 release, but ultimately delayed the feature because it didn’t work reliably enough. The new version of Siri should arrive in an update to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 Tahoe later this year.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Six and a half years ago—after a failed corporate sale attempt, massive financial losses, and the departure/layoff of many key staff—I wrote about what seemed at the time like the “imminent demise” of GameStop. Now, after five years of meme stock mania that helped prop up the company’s finances a bit, I’ll admit the video game and Funko Pop retailer has lasted much longer as a relevant entity than I anticipated.

GameStop’s surprisingly extended run may be coming to an end, though, with Polygon reporting late last week that GameStop has abruptly shut down 400 stores across the US, with even more closures expected before the end of the month. That comes on top of 590 US stores that were shuttered in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January 2025) and stated plans to close hundreds of remaining international stores across Canada, Australia, and Europe in the coming months, per SEC filings.

GameStop still had just over 3,200 stores worldwide as of February 1, 2025, so even hundreds of new and planned store closures don’t literally mean the immediate end of the company as a going concern. But when you consider that there were still nearly 6,000 GameStop locations worldwide as of 2019—nearly 4,000 of which were in the US—the long-term trend is clear.

The reason for that downward trend has been equally clear for years now: downloadable games. We made note back in 2017 when more than half of Destiny 2’s game sales came via download rather than disc, and things have only accelerated from there. Physical game sales now represent just 3 percent of overall PlayStation revenue, for instance, compared to 20 percent for digital full-game software sales, 17 percent for subscription-based “network services” like PlayStation Plus, and 29 percent for digital “add-on content” like DLC. Some major games are skipping physical releases altogether these days, while Nintendo is selling data-free Switch 2 Game Key Cards that merely act as a key for a downloadable copy of the game.

Just as Tower Records couldn’t continue to exist in a world where almost all music was being downloaded or streamed, a chain devoted to selling games on physical discs can’t sustain itself in a world where the vast majority of game spending is now online.

Seeing the writing on the wall, GameStop has made a number of attempts to rebrand around something other than selling (or re-selling) physical video games. Anyone else remember the chain’s abortive attempt to restructure around “high margin immersive experiential gaming content” like esports? How about the rollout of “GameStop Retro” locations that sell games and hardware dating back to the last century? Or the much-hyped NFT marketplace that GameStop quietly wound down in 2023?

The latest attempt at a GameStop corporate pivot seems to be toward collectible trading cards, via in-store partnerships with card-grading agencies and a “Power Pack” program combining digital and physical card sales in some novel ways. But a world where GameStop is the place to trade in a $30,000 Pokémon card isn’t at all the same as the one where millions of people traded in Madden 09 discs for a couple of bucks of GameStop store credit.

So even though GameStop has lasted longer than I expected, I’m still relatively confident in predicting that the end is coming for the retailer sooner rather than later. Who knows, though, maybe I’ll be writing another article like this in 2033, marveling at how a once-lumbering giant in the world of video game sales is somehow continuing to limp along.</div>

            <h2>UK probes X over Grok CSAM scandal; Elon Musk cries censorship</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/uk-investigating-x-after-grok-undressed-thousands-of-women-and-children/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s X is currently under investigation in the United Kingdom after failing to stop the platform’s chatbot, Grok, from generating thousands of sexualized images of women and children.

On Monday, UK media regulator Ofcom confirmed that X may have violated the UK’s Online Safety Act, which requires platforms to block illegal content. The proliferation of “undressed images of people” by X users may amount to intimate image abuse, pornography, and child sexual abuse material (CSAM), the regulator said. And X may also have neglected its duty to stop kids from seeing porn.

“Reports of Grok being used to create and share illegal non-consensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material on X have been deeply concerning,” an Ofcom spokesperson said. “Platforms must protect people in the UK from content that’s illegal in the UK, and we won’t hesitate to investigate where we suspect companies are failing in their duties, especially where there’s a risk of harm to children.”

X is cooperating with the probe, Ofcom said, noting that X met a “firm” deadline last week to explain what steps it’s taking to comply with the UK law. Ofcom declined Ars’ request to share more details about possible changes X has already made to either limit Grok in the UK or more broadly, since the investigation is “live.”

Grok has already been blocked in Indonesia and Malaysia, as the chatbot remains unchecked. The UK could be next to block Grok if X fails to comply with the Online Safety Act. Additionally, X could face fines of up to 10 percent of its global revenue.

It’s unclear how long the probe will take to conclude. Ofcom’s spokesperson told Ars that the agency will progress the investigation “as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process.” The probe will end “as soon as reasonably possible.”

X will have an opportunity to respond to Ofcom’s preliminary ruling before any final decision is made.

Ars could not reach X to comment on the probe, but Musk has complained that Grok critics are looking for an “excuse for censorship,” the BBC reported. X has previously said that it will report harmful outputs to law enforcement and permanently suspend accounts that are abusing Grok to nudify images that X deems to be illegal content. The platform also started charging some users to edit images, instead of blocking outputs.

Shortly after Ofcom announced the probe, UK Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the country would be bringing a new law into force that makes it illegal for companies to supply tools designed to create sexualized images, the BBC reported.

Before Kendall’s announcement, it seemed possible for X to escape the investigation unscathed due to “gaps” in the Online Safety Act, according to the chairwomen of the UK Parliament’s technology and media committees, the BBC reported.

“There are doubts as to whether the Online Safety Act actually has the power to regulate functionality—that means generative AI’s ability to nudify someone’s image,” Caroline Dinenage, chairwoman of the culture, media, and sport committee, told the BBC.

Chairwomen suggested that the UK may need to update the law to better explain platforms’ duties to remove or prevent the making and sharing of sexualized deepfakes. In a document defining illegal content, however, Ofcom emphasizes that deepfakes can count as both CSAM and intimate image abuse, suggesting X could face penalties under the Online Safety Act for some of Grok’s outputs, even if Ofcom cannot require changes to Grok’s functionality.

Ofcom noted that in its view, CSAM does include “AI-generated imagery, deepfakes and other manipulated media,” which “would fall under the category of a ‘pseudo-photograph.’” As Ofcom explained, “If the impression conveyed by a pseudo-photograph is that the person shown is a child, then the photo should be treated as showing a child.”

Similarly, “manipulated images and videos such as deepfakes should be considered within the scope” of intimate image abuse, Ofcom said. “Any photograph or video which appears to depict an intimate situation” that a real person would not want publicly posted should “be treated as a photograph or video actually depicting such a situation.”

Some Grok fans think that the chatbot’s outputs that undress people and put them in skimpy bikinis or underwear isn’t abuse. However, the UK law further details that an “intimate situation” could be an image where a person’s “genitals, buttocks, or breasts” are “covered only with underwear” or “covered only by clothing that is wet or otherwise transparent.”

It’s unclear how long Ofcom may take to reach its decision, but the regulator acted urgently to intervene. And UK officials who were shocked by the scandal have confirmed that they are quickly moving to protect people in the UK from being targeted by Grok’s worst outputs.

While Ofcom does not directly refer to Musk’s comments on censorship, the regulator takes a defensive stance in its announcement—likely preparing to fight X’s argument by pointing out that X would be the one in charge of deciding what is illegal content and what should be removed.

“The legal responsibility is on platforms to decide whether content breaks UK laws, and they can use our Illegal Content Judgements Guidance when making these decisions,” Ofcom noted. “Ofcom is not a censor—we do not tell platforms which specific posts or accounts to take down.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/the-chevrolet-bolt-is-back-but-for-how-long/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new Chevrolet Equinox EV is a solid entry into the compact crossover market, and with a (just) sub-$35,000 starting price, it also counts as affordable by the standards of 2026. But if you think that’s too rich for your blood, or that the Equinox is still too large for your needs, take heart—the Chevrolet Bolt is back in dealerships now as well.

The Bolt was GM’s first modern electric vehicle, following on from the hand-built, pre-lithium ion EV1 and the compliance car that was the Spark EV. We’re big fans of the Bolt here at Ars Technica. It offered well more than 200 miles of range in a mass-produced EV at a reasonable price well before Tesla’s Model 3 started clogging up our roads, it got more efficient over time, and it managed to be fun to drive in the process.

General Motors (which owns Chevrolet) probably feels less well-disposed toward the Bolt. It lost thousands of dollars on each car it sold, even before the entire fleet had to be recalled for a costly battery replacement. The issue was due to improperly folded tabs on some cells that could cause a battery fire, giving GM (and its battery partner LG) plenty of bad press in the process. That recall alone cost $1.8 billion.

The Bolt also predated GM’s big investment into the battery platform it used to but no longer calls “Ultium.” As the automaker began to ready a larger portfolio of new EVs (including the aforementioned Equinox EV), it decided the Bolt would have to go to make room for production of other, more profitable vehicles. The announcement was made in April 2023 and helped make the Bolt GM’s bestselling EV by a large margin.

The outcry from Bolt fans was loud and vociferous, and in July 2025, GM CEO Mary Barra announced that it would be coming back, with a new Ultium-based battery pack. But only in the Bolt EUV body style—if you prefer the original hatchback, you’re out of luck.

Reengineering the Bolt for a new battery pack wasn’t a quick process. The cells, modules, and electronics are all different but had to fit in the same size space with the same mounting points as the original. And GM’s own LFP factory won’t be producing cells until sometime next year. Which means for now, GM is importing LPF cells from CATL in China, paying costly tariffs in the process.

In October, Chevy released pricing: $28,995 (plus a $1,395 delivery charge) for the Bolt LT, or $32,995 for the Bolt RS. In time—we’re not sure when—there’s supposed to be a stripped-out model that starts at less than $28,000. For the record, this is more expensive than the Bolt EUV we reviewed in late 2022, particularly once you take trim levels into account. And of course, there’s now no way to cast your Apple or Android phone to the new infotainment system. And the model-year 2027 Bolt makes far less torque than the Bolts we were used to driving, which may well mean a very different on-road experience, given how important that tidal wave of torque is to how an EV feels.

Now, Chevy has released the all-important info: 262 miles (422 km) of range according to the EPA test, a slight improvement on the 249 miles (398 km) of range from the old Bolt EUV. Better news is that fast charging is almost three times more powerful. Where the old Bolt topped out at 55 kW, often infuriating other EV drivers waiting for them to hurry up at overcrowded charging stations, the new car will reach rates of up to 150 kW, meaning a 10–80 percent charge should take as little as 26 minutes, not close to an hour.

Chevy says that the new Bolt is already in dealerships, in both LT and RS trims. But its inventory checker won’t search for MY27 vehicles yet, so we haven’t been able to confirm that. The company has also said that the car is only back “for a limited time only.” Although with no elaboration on what “limited” means in this context, we can’t tell you how many cars the automaker will actually build.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Economic uncertainty is continuing to have devastating effects on the availability of jobs. Last year, the US labor market reeled from slowing wages, layoffs, and a notable lack of hiring, leading to the highest unemployment rate in the country in four years toward the end of 2025.

And while debate swirls about whether AI is actually replacing jobs in any serious numbers, many tech startups are trying to make it a reality. As the Wall Street Journal reports, a buzzy San Francisco-based AI company called Mercor is hiring desperate job-seekers for a particularly ghoulish task: training AI models to one day do the work they used to do.

It’s a depressing new reality as concerns over AI replacing jobs en masse continue to grow. Late last year, computer scientist and AI “godfather” Geoffrey Hinton predicted that AI would continue to “replace many, many jobs” in 2026 as the tech “gets even better.”

An MIT study also found last year that more than 20 million Americans’ work can be replaced with today’s AI, representing $1.2 trillion in wage value.

Paying those who are already struggling to find work in a disastrous job market to train their future replacements is a twisted new reality in the age of AI, leading to plenty of dark humor.

“I joked with my friends I’m training AI to take my job someday,” 30-year-old video editor Katie Williams, who has been captioning and rating video clips for Mercor for six months, told the WSJ.

Automotive journalist Peter Valdes-Dapena, who was laid off in 2024, has been critiquing AI-generated news articles for Mercor. The irony doesn’t escape him, but he rationalizes it away.

“I didn’t invent AI and I’m not going to uninvent it,” he told the newspaper. “If I were to stop doing this, would that stop it? The answer is no.”

Mercor hired tens of thousands of contractors last year after signing partnerships with AI industry stalwarts including OpenAI and Anthropic. Job security and a stable income appear to be hard to come by, with the company suddenly firing thousands of data labelers last year, for instance — only to hire them back on for a similar project, but for considerably less pay.

As a spokeswoman told the WSJ, contractors need to install time-tracking software on their computers to make sure they aren’t cutting corners. She said that some were even caught using AI to rate AI model outputs.

Some, however, remain skeptical of the tech’s ability to replace human workers wholesale. Lawyer Sara Kubik, who has been supplementing her income by working for Mercor, told the newspaper that the work has “taught me the limitations of AI.”

Indeed, researchers have already found that companies may be massively overestimating what AI can do. For instance, a Carnegie Mellon University study found that even the best AI models available at the time failed to complete real-world office tasks 70 percent of the time.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Using early data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is set to kick off full operations later this spring, an international team of astronomers has discovered an asteroid that spins so fast, it should’ve torn itself apart.

The unusual cosmic lump — dubbed 2025 MN45, 2,300 feet in diameter and located in the Main Asteroid Belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter — completes a full rotation every minute and 53 seconds, as detailed in a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

While that may not sound like all that fast at first blush, it’s an astonishing feat considering the object’s sheer bulk. The centrifugal forces involved should’ve already overcome its estimated structural integrity, the researchers found, especially if it were a “rubble pile” made up of smaller rocks, like many other asteroids in the Main Belt.

It’s an especially surprising finding, considering that most distant asteroids were thought to be spinning at much slower rates, as Science Alert points out.

“For objects in the main asteroid belt, the fast-rotation limit to avoid being fragmented is 2.2 hours; asteroids spinning faster than this must be structurally strong to remain intact,” the paper reads. “The faster an asteroid spins above this limit, and the larger its size, the stronger the material it must be made from.”

The team used data collected during the Rubin Observatory’s commissioning phase in the spring of last year to discover 2025 MN45, one of three “ultrafast rotators” that complete a full rotation in less than five minutes. They also found 16 “superfast” rotators with periods between 13 minutes and 2.2 hours. All 19 are larger in diameter than the length of an American football field.

“Clearly, this asteroid must be made of material that has very high strength in order to keep it in one piece as it spins so rapidly,” said Sarah Greenstreet, study lead and assistant astronomer at the National Science Foundation National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab), in a statement. “We calculate that it would need a cohesive strength similar to that of solid rock.”

“This is somewhat surprising since most asteroids are believed to be what we call ‘rubble pile’ asteroids, which means they are made of many, many small pieces of rock and debris that coalesced under gravity during Solar System formation or subsequent collisions,” she added.

Asteroids beyond the orbit of Mars are very faint and extremely hard to spot. But thanks to the Rubin Observatory’s extremely light-sensitive sensors, the team was able to discover the most distant fast rotators ever spotted.

It’s the first peer-reviewed study that’s based on data from the observatory, and a sure sign that many more discoveries from it are still to come.

“As this study demonstrates, even in early commissioning, Rubin is successfully allowing us to study a population of relatively small, very-rapidly-rotating main-belt asteroids that hadn’t been reachable before,” Greenstreet said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A dead star 730 light years away appears to be forming a powerful structure around itself — and despite their best efforts, astronomers aren’t sure how.

The cosmic corpse, designated RXJ0528+2838, is an incredibly dense stellar remnant known as a white dwarf, with a Sun-like star orbiting around it. This binary arrangement isn’t uncommon throughout the universe, but what is strange is the structure surrounding the former body: a highly energetic and luminescent cloud known as a nebula, even though there doesn’t appear to be anything that could be forming it.

“Our observations reveal a powerful outflow that, according to our current understanding, shouldn’t be there,” said Krystian Iłkiewicz, a researcher at the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center in Warsaw, Poland, and co-lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature Astronomy, in a statement.

White dwarfs are what’s left over when stars of moderate mass like our Sun exhaust all their fuel, shed their outer layers, and expose a dense core.

In many cases of binary systems, the white dwarf starts stealing material from its stellar companion. As it does so, the stolen matter forms a luminous ring around itself known as an accretion disc. Then, as the star slowly revolves around the galactic center and moves through space, it creates a shock wave in the nebula called a bow shock, which is a “curved arc of material, similar to the wave that builds up in front of a ship,” explained coauthor Noel Castro Segura, a researcher at the University of Warwick in the UK, in the statement.

RXJ0528+2838 defies this common understanding, however, because it doesn’t show any sign of having an accretion disc. Moreover, the team’s images taken with the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope also rules out that it was caused by a thermonuclear explosion called a nova that commonly occurs when enough stolen material accumulates on the white dwarf’s surface and explodes. Adding to the incredible nature, the size of the bow shock suggests that the white dwarf has been producing an outflow for at least 1,000 years, which seems improbable for a dead star.

“The surprise that a supposedly quiet, discless system could drive such a spectacular nebula was one of those rare ‘wow’ moments,”  said co-lead author Simone Scaringi, an associate professor at Durham University in the UK, in the statement.

Everything points to the star siphoning material from its stellar companion but without forming a disc around itself. The researchers’ best guess is that this has something to do with the white dwarf’s powerful magnetic field somehow powering the outflows.

“Our finding shows that even without a disc, these systems can drive powerful outflows, revealing a mechanism we do not yet understand,” Iłkiewicz said. “This discovery challenges the standard picture of how matter moves and interacts in these extreme binary systems.”

            <div id="article-text">Despite an economy that’s booming on paper, economists are warning that the middle class is being squeezed as new jobs aren’t materializing fast enough to make up for the ones we’re losing.

It’s a grim economic outlook for those who are already struggling to make ends meet. At the same time, sports betting is taking off, with experts warning of a surge in gambling addiction. And online “prediction market” platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are taking things even further, allowing practically anybody to bet their hard-earned cash on dubious predictions, like whether the US will invade Venezuela — without any meaningful regulatory oversight to protect them from scams, insider trading, and financial ruin.

Even cable television is embracing the worrying trend. Case in point, CBS‘ 83rd Golden Globes award show showed a live ticker of Polymarket predictions for various awards during its Sunday evening broadcast of the event — actively encouraging viewers to gamble on the platform.

Some predictions turned out totally wrong, with “Sinners” taking a clear front lead on Polymarket for Best Drama, only for “Hamnet” to take the prize. Others triumphed, with the majority of users correctly betting on Paul Thomas Anderson winning Best Director for “One Battle After Another.”

Bets for the evening closed up at 7 am Sunday morning on Polymarket, which means live viewers were unable to get in on the fun. Nonetheless, onlookers were appalled at the pointed inclusion, turning the storied awards show into a glorified gambling ad. Many pointed out that the Golden Globes had already struggled with viewership in recent years, amidst a series of scandals involving corruption, racism, and even sexual assault.

In other words, encouraging crypto-based gambling was the cherry on top.

“‘The Golden Globes Best Podcast odds presented by Polymarket’ is a new low for this humiliating awards show,” tweeted Semafor senior social media editor Josh Billinson.

“The Golden Globes incorporating Polymarket betting ON SCREEN is genuinely disgusting, and we need to push back on these pocket casinos at every opportunity,” online celebrity Matt Bernstein wrote.

“We’re so deep into capitalism that the Golden Globes are showing [P]olymarket betting odds on award winners… we’re so cooked,” another user.

The Golden Globes’ owner, Penske Media Corp., announced the eyebrow-raising pairing-up between the Donald Trump Jr.-funded prediction platform and the Larry Ellison-run broadcaster last week.

“Our partnership with Polymarket unlocks a groundbreaking new frontier, redefining how audiences engage with and connect to the content they love,” said president Craig Perreault in a statement. “Deepening the connection between fans and their favorite films, shows, and actors strengthens the entertainment industry and highlights the award-winning content celebrated at the Golden Globes.”

Penske-owned publications, including Variety,Deadline, and The Hollywood Reporter, breathlessly promoted the partnership, as The Wrap reports, suggesting a troubling degree of editorial influence.

The timing of the partnership couldn’t have been worse. The news comes just days after Polymarket became embroiled in a major insider trading scandal after a mystery trader made more than $400,000 by making incredibly well-timed bets on the United States’ attacks on Venezuela — just hours before the US invaded the South American country.

In a certain sense, the Golden Globes flap is fitting; the awards show has long garnered a reputation for being pay-to-play, giving preferential treatment to those willing to line Penske’s pockets.

To many, directly encouraging users to bet on awards during an awards ceremony is not just irritating; it’s a sign of the times we live in, as gambling becomes a mainstay part of Americans’ everyday lives.

“This is like watching a car crash in real time,” one user lamented.

“Polymarket odds on the telecast of the Golden Globes,” another wrote. “Just push me in front of a bus at this point.”

Others poked fun at Penske achieving a new low.

“Heartfelt congratulations to Penske Media for achieving its highest state of being,” author Mark Harris wrote mockingly on Bluesky.

            <h2>Red Hot Christmas Toy Crashes So Badly That Kids Can’t Actually Use It</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Parents were left scrambling on Christmas day after the hot toy of the season appeared to crash and burn, in a perfect cautionary tale about the era of connected gadgets that can easily brick if their delicate infrastructure is put under strain.

The toy, called the Tin Can, is basically a stripped down landline phone that places calls over WiFi. The devices are styled after colorful tin cans — like an old school tin can telephone, an archaic toy so thoroughly ancient that kids today presumably have no idea it ever existed — with twirly cords just like the landlines of yore.

The pitch is that the Tin Can allows parents to set up a sort of closed network of other Tin Can users, making it a nice compromise for kids who are too young for a cell phone, but who still want to communicate with their friends and family members. It’s free to call other Tin Can users, or parents can pay a $10 monthly subscription to make outside calls.

Yet when kids rushed to phone their friends over the holidays to schedule playdates and sledding runs, they found the string had been cut.

“Call volume on Christmas Day increased more than 100x from the start of the month, which impacted people’s abilities to set up their devices or make calls,” Tin Can’s founder Chet Kittleson told Business Insider in an interview. “Despite spending months and months preparing for it, we didn’t get it all right.”

“It worked great, the kids were using it,” Maria Pahuja, a parent from Virginia, told the publication. “Then, Christmas morning, it stopped working. Sometimes you’d pick it up, and there would be a dial tone, you would call, and nothing would happen. Once in a while, a call would go through, and then two minutes later another call wouldn’t.”

In other words, kids probably would have had a better chance of connecting with their friends with an actual tin can telephone, operated via vibrationson a string, on Christmas morn’.

By now, things seem to be back up and running, though there are still some issues with call quality popping up, BI reports. A January 8th status update on the company’s website — and, tellingly, a banner on the very top of its home page — advises parents that “we’re continuing to see very positive signs of recovery, but we’re still working through some lingering issues.” The company began in Seattle “with a handful of families and has since grown to serve families across more than 30 states,” its site says. BI reports the company has successfully raised $15.5 million since its launch in Autumn of 2024 — resources which apparently weren’t enough to prevent the toys from turning into a corded lump of coal at the exact moment they were supposed to make a great first impression.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cosmetic surgeons have turned to using a “fat filler” harvested from dead people in order to give patients new breasts, sexier buttocks and other body contouring tweaks, according to reporting by Business Insider — in a practice that not even “Frankenstein” author Mary Shelley could have dreamed up in her day.

The hot new product in question is called alloClae, manufactured by biomedical science business Tiger Aesthetics, and it’s become increasingly popular in plastic surgery circles despite its gruesome origins and aggressive price tag — ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per procedure, according to BI — because it allows dramatically less healing time and doesn’t require patients being put under general anesthesia.

“People are paying for the convenience,” New York City plastic surgeon Sachin Shridharani told the site.

Historically, plastic surgeons have relied on implants or siphoning fat from another section of your body and injecting it into another part in order to perform body contouring. Using alloClae gives them a flexible new option.

Another reason why it’s become popular is that weight loss GLP-1 agonists drugs like Ozempic have made faces and bodies saggy — and that has them clamoring for specialists like Shridharani to fix their body issues.

“In their own words, ‘I’ve got no ass,&#39;” Shridharani said. “‘My trousers look like they’re falling off.&#39;”

So how does somebody’s fat end up in a plastic surgeon’s syringe?

What typically happens is that people donate their bodies to science, with organs going to donation or scientific research. Tissue banks also harvest fat calls from dead people’s abdomen’s, though, and Tiger Aesthetics buys it and processes the fat cells into alloClae.

“As of the beginning of 2026, we’ll be producing a ton more alloClae so that we can service the real demand that’s out there,” Tiger Aesthetics preident Caroline Van Hove told BI.

The practice isn’t entirely unprecedented. There’s already a product called Renuva, for instance, with the same origin but used for facial injections.

Is it weird to have your body sculpted with the fat from a dead person? Maybe, but you clearly can’t argue with results — or the horror of body issues.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropics-new-cowork-tool-offers-claude-code-without-the-code/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, Anthropic announced a new tool called Cowork, designed as a more accessible version of Claude Code. Built into the Claude Desktop app, the new tool lets users designate a specific folder where Claude can read or modify files, with further instructions given through the standard chat interface. The result is similar to a sandboxed instance of Claude Code, but requires far less technical savvy to set up.

Currently in research preview, Cowork is only available to Max subscribers, with a waitlist available for users on other plans.

The new tool is inspired in part by the growing number of subscribers using Claude Code to achieve non-coding tasks, treating it as a general-purpose agentic AI tool. Cowork is built on the Claude Agent SDK, which means it’s drawing on the same underlying model as Claude Code. The folder partition gives an easy way to manage what files Cowork has access to, and because the app doesn’t require command-line tools or virtual environments, it’s less intimidating for non-technical users.

That opens up a new world of potential use cases. Anthropic gives the example of assembling an expense report from a folder of receipt photos — but Claude Code users have also put the system to work managing media files, scanning social media posts, or analyzing conversations.

Similar to Claude Code, Cowork is designed to take strings of actions without user input — a potentially dangerous approach if the tool is given vague or contradictory instructions. In a blog post announcing the new tool, Anthropic explicitly warns about the risk of prompt injection or deleted files, recommending that users make instructions as clear and unambiguous as possible.

“These risks aren’t new with Cowork,” the post reads, “but it might be the first time you’re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation.”

Launched as a command-line tool in November 2024, Claude Code has become one of Anthropic’s most successful products, leading the company to launch a string of new interfaces in recent months. A web interface launched in October, followed by a Slack integration just two months later.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since Ronald Reagan was president, the Environmental Protection Agency has assigned a value to human life. If you think too long about it, it’s a bit crass, but the upshot was to provide some cost-benefit analysis of pollution controls. Lowering pollution can prolong human life, so if the health benefits of reducing pollution outweighed the costs, then there was an economic argument to be made in favor of those reductions.

Every administration since has assigned some value to human life when determining how to regulate air pollution.

The Trump administration is planning to throw decades of accepted practice out the window, according to a report in the New York Times. If the EPA follows through on its plans, then it would no longer count the value of human health when regulating ozone and fine particulate matter pollution.

The risks of air pollution have been known for decades, which was part of the reason the EPA was founded under President Richard Nixon in the first place.

Ozone and fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5, have long been linked to cardiovascular ailments like asthma, heart disease, and emphysema.

Ozone high in the atmosphere protects us against UV radiation. But when it forms close to the ground, as happens when oxides of nitrogen are emitted by everything from cars to power plants, it can create smog. On particularly smoggy days, it can be deadly to vulnerable populations.

PM2.5 might be even more pernicious. Recent research has connected PM2.5 to a broader range of illnesses, including Parkinson’s, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, dementia, and type 2 diabetes. Even the tiniest, youngest infants aren’t spared, since a mother’s exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to low birth weight. Worldwide, as many as 10 million people per year die from fine particulate matter pollution annually. MAHA indeed.

The policy change comes at a time when data centers have been increasingly reliant on dirtier sources of electricity. Elon Musk’s xAI, for example, used dozens of unpermitted natural gas turbines to power its Colossus data center near Memphis, Tennessee, a region the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America said was already an “asthma capital” due to pollution from transportation and industry.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is welcoming the Trump administration’s policy change. “We appreciate the efforts of this administration to rebalance regulations with a common-sense approach. We look forward to examining the proposal from E.P.A,” Marty Durbin, president of the chamber’s Global Energy Institute, told the New York Times.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon offered a bit more insight into how it sees its AI platform competing in the real world at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. Namely, Amazon plans to leverage the extensive footprint its devices already have in the home as well as consumers’ existing familiarity with its Alexa brand.

“Ninety-seven percent of devices we ever shipped can support Alexa+,” noted Amazon Alexa and Echo VP Daniel Rausch in an interview at CES. He said the latest figures Amazon has on hand indicate the company has sold more than 600 million devices, and the “vast majority” will support its revamped AI assistant, Alexa+.

Announced early last year, Alexa+ is Amazon’s future in the generative AI market, offering more expressive voices, access to world knowledge similar to other AI assistants, and AI agents that perform tasks on behalf of the customer — like calling an Uber or ordering food. The company has been steadily rolling out access to the AI platform, with more than 1 million Alexa customers gaining access by last June, and now, “tens of millions” can opt in to upgrade to the AI assistant.

Amazon doesn’t have an exact date for when Alexa+ will be available to everyone; the company is focusing first on bringing the AI to all Prime members.

What Amazon soon has to prove, beyond availability, is whether customers will actually use its AI. That’s where Rausch believes Alexa’s existing footprint will help.

“I think that there’s going to be a whole range of AI out there for customers. I think that Alexa will be one of the foundational assistants,” he said. While he believes there will always be some specialist AIs on the market, like those that focus on one thing, like being a legal assistant, there will be a few “nameable, foundational AIs that are highly capable,” which is where Alexa slots in.

“I think some of the advantages Alexa has is the familiarity of customers, the tens of millions of customers already engaging continuously,” Rausch said. “It’s in the home, ambiently available, in voice, in the most natural interface. I do believe that that’s our opportunity to grow,” he added.

Alexa’s plans for the home come as Apple announced it’s teaming up with Google’s Gemini for Siri, as other AI chatbots, like ChatGPT and Claude, compete across a variety of use cases ranging from research to healthcare to coding and more.

Just ahead of CES, Amazon announced a way to access Alexa on the web and a redesigned Alexa app that puts a chatbot-style interface front and center. At the conference, Amazon partners like Samsung, BMW, and Oura showed off their Alexa integrations.

The company also promoted its recent acquisition of Bee, an AI wearable that lets you record conversations and gain insights. Customers can engage with Bee via text or voice chat.

In the future, Rausch says Alexa and Bee will become more integrated. But, he added, Bee has value as its own standalone brand, calling it a “an important and lovable experience.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Automated investment platform Betterment has confirmed that hackers broke into some of its systems last week and accessed the personal information of an undisclosed number of its customers.

In an email sent on Monday, which TechCrunch has seen, Betterment said that hackers gained access to some company systems on January 9 by way of a social engineering attack, which involved “third-party platforms” that the company uses for marketing and operations.

The company said customer names, email and postal addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth were compromised in the attack.

With this access, hackers were able to send a fraudulent notification to users, claiming to triple the value of their crypto by sending $10,000 to a wallet controlled by the attacker, as reported by The Verge.

Betterment, which allows customers to invest in crypto, also published an announcement about the breach on its website, but did not disclose how many customers were targeted, nor how many had their personal information accessed, stolen, or seen by the hackers.

Betterment added that it detected the attack on the same day and “immediately revoked the unauthorized access and launched a comprehensive investigation, which is ongoing,” with the help of an unspecified cybersecurity firm. Betterment also said it has reached out to the customers targeted by the hackers and “advised them to disregard the message.”

“Our ongoing investigation has continued to demonstrate that no customer accounts were accessed and that no passwords or other log-in credentials were compromised,” Betterment wrote in the email.

Representatives for Betterment did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for more details about the attack.

As of the time of publication, Betterment’s security incident web page contains a hidden “noindex” tag in its source code, which tells search engines to ignore the page, making it more difficult for anyone searching the web to discover information about the data breach.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple services had a “record-breaking year,” according to a blog post by senior vice president Eddy Cue.

In 2025, Apple had 850 million average weekly App Store users (up from 813 million in 2024), over $100 billion in Apple Pay merchant sales, and a 36% increase in monthly Apple TV engagement.

Apple Music also had its best year ever for listenership and new subscriber growth, which is impressive amid Spotify’s longstanding dominance of the market.

Apple has less frequently disclosed figures about App Store payouts over the last several years, but the company shared that it has now paid $550 billion to developers since its launch in 2008. This indicates significant growth, as Apple last reported that as of 2021, it had paid out $260 billion to developers, up from the $200 billion it reported in 2020.

The App Store generally takes a 30% commission from in-app purchases, though it offers small businesses (developers making under $1 million annually) a reduced 15% fee. This section of Apple’s business has been the target of heavy regulatory scrutiny, with international courts investigating it for monopolistic practices.

Apple’s entertainment products are making strides, too. Apple TV eclipsed all prior viewership records in December 2025, the company says, and Apple Music achieved record highs in listenership and new subscribers.

Apple TV’s growth comes alongside the debut of new hits like “Pluribus” and “The Studio,” as well as ongoing successes like “Severance.” Apple TV also struck major streaming deals with Major League Soccer and Formula 1. “F1,” Apple TV’s movie about the sport, became Apple Studios’ highest-grossing film yet, as well as the highest-grossing film of star Brad Pitt’s career.

Apple credits its karaoke-like “Sing” feature, partnerships with companies like GM and Chase, and other new developments for its growth. It notes that Shazam generated over 1 billion recognitions per month, which could have funneled growth into its Music service.

But it’s also possible that Apple benefited from controversy around Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s business ventures.

Ek’s investment firm led a €600 million investment in European defense tech company Helsing, which makes AI-powered military software and strike drones. Artists like Xiu Xiu, Sylvan Esso, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Deerhoof, and others removed their catalogs from Spotify in protest.

Spotify has faced other controversies over the last several years, from its platforming of COVID-19 misinformation via Joe Rogan’s podcast (formerly a Spotify exclusive) to its artist payout metrics.

On the other hand, Apple Music could be growing because it’s simply making a product that is better suited for some listeners (I wrote about my decision to switch from Spotify to Apple Music as I became increasingly suffocated by algorithmic recommendations).

It could also be a financial decision amid uncertain economic times — Apple Music lures new subscribers with its three-month free offer, which comes alongside the purchase of most new Apple devices.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s official. Apple has chosen to work with Google, a longtime partner, to power AI features like Siri.

“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” Apple and Google said in a statement.

The partnership confirms previous reporting on a deal with Google. Neither Apple nor Google have confirmed the price tag, but previous reports indicate Apple could be paying Google around $1 billion for access to its AI technology. The deal also comes after Apple spent some time testing the technology of competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic.

The multi-year partnership will involve Apple using Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology for future Apple foundational models. The deal is not exclusive, per a source familiar with the matter. Apple has historically focused on vertical integration, relying on its own hardware and software.

The iPhone-maker has faced a fair amount of public chatter criticizing it after its AI efforts, particularly its assistant Siri, lagged behind competitors. That’s not to say Apple hasn’t been quietly building powerful foundational models. The company released the first versions of Apple Intelligence in 2024, which adds AI to existing OS functions like searching for photos and summarizing notifications. Apple has also focused on privacy with its AI rollout, with much of the processing happening on-device or through tightly controlled infrastructure. Apple says it will maintain those privacy standards throughout its partnership with Google.

The firm’s strategy has resulted in a subtle, sometimes invisible, occasionally resented form of AI — one that doesn’t have the same wow factor as ChatGPT or Gemini. It also stops short of delivering the kind of Siri overhaul many users have been waiting for.

Apple has delayed the rollout of its “more personalized Siri” voice assistant several times, but a spokesperson told TechCrunch an upgrade is coming this year. Previous reports indicate the overhauled Siri is expected to launch in the spring.

Apple’s partnership with Google also comes as the search and adtech giant is in the midst of multiple antitrust lawsuits, including one that put its relationship with Apple front and center. In August 2024, a federal judge ruled that Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search by paying companies like Apple to present its search engine as the default on its devices and web browsers. Between 2021 and 2022, Google paid Apple about $38 billion to secure default search placements.

In December 2025, Judge Amit Mehta issued his final remedies on the case, which include banning Google from entering into exclusive, default agreements like the one it had with Apple “unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.”

            <h2>The Soul of the Grateful Dead</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/bob-weir-grateful-dead-obituary/685586/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the summer of 1968, three years into the Grateful Dead’s existence, the band fired singer and rhythm guitarist Bob Weir. Jerry Garcia, the band’s other guitarist and its reluctant leader, and bassist Phil Lesh had decided that Weir and keyboardist Ron “Pigpen” McKernan were dragging the band down musically. Weir was just 20 years old, the youngest member of the group and the least technically accomplished. But Garcia didn’t have the heart to pull the trigger himself, and he made the band’s manager do the deed. Or at least he tried to. “It didn’t take. We fired them, all right, but they just kept coming back,” Garcia remembered later.

The failure was auspicious. A few months later, the band performed the shows that would be released as Live/Dead, one of the greatest psychedelic albums ever. The first sound heard on the record is Weir’s guitar, which methodically builds “Dark Star” up, sewing together Garcia and Lesh’s riffing. Weir’s place in the Dead was never again in doubt. When the group disbanded after Garcia’s death in 1995, Weir continued to lead or co-lead iterations of the band for another 30 years, culminating in a three-night 60th-anniversary celebration in San Francisco this past August. He died Saturday at 78, from complications of cancer.

Weir lived his entire adult life in the shadow of Garcia, a formidable genius who died too young, but he was more than just a backing musician. Garcia gave the band virtuosity; Lesh, with his avant-garde training, gave it ambition. Weir gave it soul and fun, and his underappreciated guitar playing was the glue that held the whole Dead sound together.

In a group of scruffy hippies, Weir was a bit of a misfit—ironically, by virtue of being normal. He was a prep-school kid, adopted by a well-off family from Palo Alto, California. But he was also perpetually getting kicked out of schools for misconduct—perhaps a side effect of his undiagnosed dyslexia—and his personal struggles helped lead him to Garcia. (It’s also how he met John Perry Barlow, a boarding-school classmate who would become his songwriting partner as well as an internet pioneer.)

Weir’s age made him the band’s little brother, and like many younger siblings, he could be embarrassing. In contrast to Garcia, who was famously impassive onstage, Weir had front-man energy. He sometimes came off as a pretty boy, and had a tendency to hit a helium falsetto in moments of excitement. After Pigpen’s death, he became the band’s standard-bearer for its lecherous blues songs. His flirtation with slide guitar in the late 1970s and ’80s was mediocre at best. And the less said about those short shorts, the better.

The magic of a band, though, comes from looking past any member’s individual foibles to see how they contribute to the whole, and it’s impossible to imagine the Dead functioning without Weir. During concerts, the set list would customarily alternate between songs sung by Garcia and songs sung by Weir, which was essential to maintaining interest and dynamism across their hours-long shows. Weir was the more conventionally talented singer, and sometimes what you need after the mawkish Garcia dirge “Wharf Rat” is Weir’s euphoric and randy “Sugar Magnolia.” (This change of vibe might be especially urgent and welcome if, like many attendees at Dead shows, you were experimenting with psychedelic drugs.)

Part of the Dead’s greatness resided in their integration of nearly the full breadth of American music: jug bands, modal jazz, Charles Ives, Motown. Weir’s role was often to inject swagger or grease, delivering signature renditions of songs by the likes of Chuck Berry, Merle Haggard, the Reverend Gary Davis, and Marty Robbins as well as upbeat originals such as “Greatest Story Ever Told.” But Weir wasn’t adept in only bluesy numbers. A ballad such as “Looks Like Rain” and “Black-Throated Wind” can grab you by the chest. My top criterion for judging a tape of a Dead show is usually the presence and quality of a rendition of Weir’s “Playing in the Band,” which elevates a boring trope—a song about being a rock and roller—into transcendence, with long, proggy passages.

Less obvious than his singing, but more singular, was Weir’s guitar playing. A typical rhythm guitarist aims to keep a song moving with chunky chords that outline the harmony of a song but also maintain the beat. The Grateful Dead had different needs: The group had to provide effective backing for Garcia’s solos, and it had to be able to morph from one song to another via collectively improvised jams. But it also had two drummers rather than one; an exploratory, meandering bassist; and a rotating cast of keyboardists. Standard rhythm playing would only have cluttered the sound.

Weir responded by developing a style unlike any previous rock guitarist, and one that even most contemporary jam bands can’t replicate. In place of steady strumming, Weir played arpeggios, single notes, little riffs, and odd, jazzy chords. One reason I and many other Deadheads favor concert recordings from the early 1970s is that drummer Mickey Hart’s temporary departure from the band left more room to hear and appreciate Weir’s playing. His model, he liked to say, was the jazz pianist McCoy Tyner’s work in the John Coltrane Quartet. This is also a fitting analogy for Weir’s relationship with Garcia: Both Weir and Tyner rose to fame playing behind immortals, but that in no way detracts from either musician’s individual brilliance.

Weir also never succumbed to the bad habits of many of his bandmates, or at least never so deeply. McKernan’s drinking killed him at 27. Garcia’s drug abuse contributed to his death at 53. Lesh required a kidney transplant because of drug use. Keyboardist Brent Mydland overdosed at 37. But Weir lived more cleanly and, in later life, became something of an Instagram fitness influencer. When Garcia’s drug use caused his consistency and abilities to falter in the 1980s and ’90s, Weir helped carry the band.

In addition to leading his own bands, including RatDog and the Wolf Bros, Weir was involved in a series of projects that kept the repertoire alive. There was Furthur, then the Other Ones (a pun on a Dead song title), and later the Dead. After that came Dead & Company, in which he traded licks and songs with the pop singer John Mayer, who improbably won over many Deadheads. Hardly anyone could have been surprised that Dead & Company was booked as one of the first bands to have a residency at the Sphere, the elaborate Las Vegas venue. The Sphere promised “immersive” experiences; with the Dead, Weir had been delivering those for decades. Deadheads—those old enough to remember the Summer of Love and those born well after Garcia’s death—flocked to Vegas to partake.

In the past few years, many fans had noted that Weir’s pace had slowed—sometimes literally, as he throttled classic Dead tunes down to somnolent tempos. Over time, his appearance morphed from babyfaced to Yosemite Sam; he grew a bushy white beard late in life. Even so, that Weir might be gone so soon seemed unthinkable. After all, he was the youthful, energetic one; his passing feels like the end of an era, just as Garcia’s did. (With Weir’s death, only drummers Hart and Bill Kreutzmann survive as core members of the Dead.)

Even at an age when he’d earned the right to retire, Weir continued to write, record, and perform to adoring crowds, as though compelled to go on. Last August, in one of the final Dead & Company concerts, he performed a song that might have been a personal mission statement. The 77-year-old Weir sang words he’d written at 24: “I can’t stop for nothing / I’m just playing in the band.” It was never just playing, though.</div>

            <h2>The Best Flu Drug Americans Aren’t Taking</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/better-flu-drug-than-tamiflu/685585/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Antiviral drugs for influenza, the best known of which is Tamiflu, are—let’s be honest—not exactly miracle cures. They marginally shorten the course of illness, especially if taken within the first 48 hours. But amid possibly the worst flu season in 25 years, driven by a variant imperfectly matched to the vaccine, these underused drugs can make a bout of flu a little less miserable. So consider an antiviral. And specifically, consider Xofluza, a lesser-known drug that is in fact better than Tamiflu.

The culprit behind this awful flu season is subclade K, a variant of H3N2 discovered too late to be incorporated into this year’s flu vaccine. Early data suggest the shot likely does confer at least some protection against this variant, but the jury is still out on whether that protection is much eroded from usual. What is undeniable, though, is a recent explosion of influenza cases. In New York, which was hit early and hard, the number of people hospitalized for flu broke records. Across the rest of the country, cases have been going up a “straight line,” nearly everywhere all at once, which is highly unusual, Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan who has been studying influenza for some 60 years, told me last week. Cases seem to be finally leveling off now, but much misery still lies ahead.

For flu, antivirals are a second but oft-overlooked line of defense after vaccines. “We are dramatically and drastically underutilizing influenza antivirals,” Janet Englund, a pediatric-infectious-disease specialist at the University of Washington, told me. Even the older, more commonly prescribed drug Tamiflu reaches only a tiny percentage of flu patients every year. Actual numbers are hard to come by, but compare the estimated 1.2 million prescriptions for Tamiflu and its generic form in 2023 with the some 40 million people who likely got the flu in the winter of 2023–24. Xofluza is even less popular, and exact prescription numbers even harder to find. But they are possibly somewhere from just 1 to 10 percent that of Tamiflu.

The two antivirals are equally effective at allaying symptoms, both shortening the duration of flu by about a day. But Xofluza, which was approved in 2018, offers some tangible benefits over Tamiflu.

First, Xofluza is simply more convenient, a single dose compared with Tamiflu’s 10, which are taken over five days, twice a day. It also causes fewer of the gastrointestinal side effects, such as vomiting and nausea, that patients on Tamiflu will sometimes experience. All in all, a course of Xofluza might be easier for you—or your kid already queasy from the flu itself—to get down and keep down. (That is, if they are old enough to take it: Xofluza is approved for kids ages 5 and up in the United States, but ages 1 and up in Europe; only Tamiflu is recommended for kids down to newborn age as well as for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.)

Second, Xofluza makes you less contagious to the rest of your family. It drives down the amount of virus spewed by sick patients more quickly than Tamiflu, possibly because of differences in how the two drugs work. Whereas Xofluza stops the virus from replicating, Tamiflu can only prevent already replicated viruses from exiting infected cells to infect others. In a study that Monto led last year, Xofluza cut household transmission by almost one-third compared with a placebo. Tamiflu might reduce transmission too, according to other studies, but probably to a lesser degree than Xofluza.

Third, Xofluza is better at heading off serious post-flu complications such as pneumonia or myocarditis. Patients on Xofluza needed fewer ER visits and hospitalizations than did those on Tamiflu, according to studies of large real-world data sets from insurance claims and medical records. This means that Xofluza should be the antiviral of choice for high-risk patients, including those over 65, who are most prone to these complications, Frederick Hayden, a flu expert at the University of Virginia who led one of the original Xofluza trials, told me. (Hayden has consulted on an unpaid basis, aside from travel expenses, for the companies behind Xofluza.)

The fourth advantage is less relevant to this season because the dominant subclade belongs to the influenza A family. But Xofluza is noticeably more effective against influenza B than Tamiflu, which tends to falter against this family of viruses.

Despite these benefits, awareness of Xofluza remains low. “It hasn’t been used as much as it should be,” Monto said, for reasons of cost and accessibility. Tamiflu, first approved in 1999, is available as a generic for less than $30 even without insurance. Xofluza is still patented and runs $150 to $200 a person. Because it’s less popular, pharmacies are less likely to stock it, making doctors less eager to prescribe it, and so on. In October, though, the company that markets Xofluza in the U.S. launched a direct-to-customer program that sells the drug for the comparably bargain price of $50 without insurance, along with same-day delivery in some areas. Even the flu-drug experts I spoke with, though, were not all aware of this new, more accessible route. The CDC still lists Tamiflu first and foremost in its recommendations, too.

For flu antivirals to be more widely used would also require better testing. Both Xofluza and Tamiflu are most effective within the first 48 hours of symptoms, and the earlier the better. Traditionally, a sick person would have to get to a doctor, get a flu test, get a prescription, and finally get to a pharmacy—which can easily put them past the first 48 hours. But COVID popularized at-home rapid testing, and combination COVID-flu tests have landed on pharmacies shelves recently. With telehealth and home delivery, you can get an antiviral without ever leaving the house.

Still, the at-home tests are expensive, Englund pointed out, about $20 a pop here, compared with just a couple of bucks in Europe. The expense can add up for a whole family. In Japan, where antivirals are widely used, nearly everyone with a flu-like illness gets a routine rapid test and, if necessary, antivirals, both largely covered by the public health-care system. (Xofluza was developed by the Japanese company Shionogi, which also makes Xocova, a promising COVID antiviral my colleague Rachel Gutman-Wei has written about that is not available in the U.S.)

If the U.S. were better at using antivirals, especially in the high-risk patients, the number of Americans dying of flu—roughly 38,000 last year—would likely drop, Cameron Wolfe, an infectious-diseases expert at Duke, told me. Doctors recommend that people at high risk for flu take antivirals prophylactically, upon exposure to anyone with flu, before symptoms appear. Both Xocova and Tamiflu as prophylaxis can cut the chances of getting sick by upwards of 80 percent.

For healthy people who fall ill, antivirals can ease the burden of flu, which is nasty even when it is not deadly. “I don’t want you to be out of work longer than you need to be. I don’t want you to not be a caregiver for your kids,” Wolfe said. “Maybe you have business travel coming up, and I don’t want you to be sick still on that plane.” With challenges around access to antivirals, he said that “the best drug is the one you can get.” Both Tamiflu and Xofluza can make this historically bad flu season a little more bearable.</div>

            <h2>Why Vance Committed So Hard to the Minneapolis Shooter</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/vance-defends-minneapolis-shooter-ice-maga-symbol/685584/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">More than Donald Trump, more than Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, more than anyone in ICE’s leadership, J. D. Vance has made himself the lead defender of the killing in Minnesota. Why?

The day after the shooting, Vance announced a new administration effort to prosecute welfare fraud in Minnesota and elsewhere. Vance’s message started hot and got hotter. He blamed immigrants in general—and Somali immigrants in particular—for cheating taxpayers and raising the cost of child care for Americans. Then he launched into a denunciation of Renee Nicole Good, the woman shot dead in Minneapolis. He accused her of intentionally attacking a federal agent with her car. He alleged that she belonged to a broader network of activists who plotted “to attack, to dox, to assault” federal law enforcement. He blasted media outlets for covering her killer unsympathetically.

Nick Miroff: From “I’m not mad at you” to deadly shots in seconds

Vance’s words were not a spontaneous reaction to an unexpected question. They were planned, the message he arrived to drive. He did not wait for all of the facts. He did not bother with any notes of compassion for the dead woman and her grieving family.

The vice president next took to X, first to promote a video from the shooter’s point of view, then to mix it up with a journalist about that video (“He is allowed to discharge his weapon in self-defense”).

He did not have to do any of that. He could have expressed support for law enforcement more generally. He did not have to malign the victim. He did not have to champion the shooter. He did not have to insert himself as the main character in a story that was still only just coming into view.

That he did so may seem especially bold given the political context. According to a poll taken the same day as the shooting in Minneapolis, the public has turned against ICE’s often-brutal methods. A majority of Americans condemn ICE as “too forceful.” Vance began his term as perhaps the least popular new vice president in the history of polling. Identifying himself with ICE at its deadliest might seem a hazardous move for such a disliked politician.

But there is a logic to Vance’s combative stance. Vance clearly understood what ICE means to Trump’s base.

For MAGA America, ICE is an instrument for cleansing violence. Visit ICE social-media accounts and you’ll see, again and again, videos of armed force against unarmed individuals, against a soundtrack of pumping music. There’s a montage of aggressive arrests in Minnesota of unarmed, nonwhite men, many of them thrown to the ground and cuffed, set to the 1977 hit “Cold as Ice”: “Someday you’ll pay the price.” A dozen heavily armed and armored agents round up a single unarmed woman in a T-shirt and two similarly defenseless men in California. In Indiana, armored agents throw handcuffs and ankle chains on a big haul of men and shove them in a cell, where they can be seen pacing, weeping, or with their heads plunged in their hands.

Rarely do these videos present a situation that couldn’t be managed with a couple of plainclothes officers bearing holstered sidearms. The point is to prove that the fearsome power of the American state is being wielded by righteous MAGA hands against despised MAGA targets.

On the afternoon of January 9, the DHS X account posted an image of a lone cowboy riding through some Western landscape while a stealth bomber flies overhead. Across the image are the words “We’ll have our home again.” You may not recognize the phrase. It’s a lyric of a song that’s popular on the nationalist far right:

In our own towns, we’re foreigners now, our names are spat and cursed The headlines smack of another attack, not the last, and not the worst Oh my fathers they look down on me, I wonder what they feel To see their noble sons driven down, beneath a coward’s heel

Oh by God we’ll have our home again, by God we’ll have our home By blood or sweat, we’ll get there yet, by God we’ll have our home

That is not a paean to law enforcement. MAGA Republicans do not reliably care about laws or the people who enforce them. One of Trump’s first actions upon entering office was to pardon more than 1,500 people charged in connection with the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, including many convicted of violent offenses against the police. He has denigrated the FBI and transformed the agency into a tool of retribution, and he regularly disparages prosecutors and law-enforcement officials if they fail to comply with his will.

The only law-enforcement agency the administration consistently champions happens to have a particularly grim record of violent overreactions. According to The Trace, which tracks gun violence generally, Good was one of four people who have been killed by ICE since the crackdown began in June, and the organization has identified more than 30 incidents in which immigration agents have either opened fire or held someone at gunpoint. Border Patrol agents have also shot at least three people who were simply observing or documenting immigration raids, including a 30-year-old American woman in Chicago, at whom an agent shouted “Do something, bitch” before opening fire with an assault rifle. She was hit five times but somehow survived.

Caitlin Dickerson: How ICE lost its guardrails

This count doesn’t include the many reported incidents of physical assaults without guns, such as choking and body slams, including of elderly men and women. More and worse scenes have been recorded in Minnesota this past weekend.

ICE is violence-prone in part because the agency has lowered its training standards and ditched much of its background vetting to meet the president’s grandiose deportation targets. But more fundamentally, ICE is violence-prone because its main purpose has become theatrical. Under present leadership, ICE is less a law-enforcement agency than it is a content creator.

Americans want borders enforced. They want foreign criminals apprehended and deported. They want unfounded asylum claimants to be removed promptly. But most Americans don’t thrill to spectacular acts of six-on-one violence aimed at DoorDash delivery men. ICE’s approval ratings have duly plummeted.

Again and again, ICE agents are encountering members of the public who reject their protection and sympathize with the supposed invaders. Yet ICE’s powers against U.S. citizens are limited. Americans can record ICE operations, follow ICE motorcades, and vex and annoy ICE personnel, and there’s not much that ICE or Border Patrol agents can legally do to stop them—hence the turn to unlawful force instead.

That’s the mentality the whole world saw in videos of the killing of Good in Minneapolis, including the one seemingly recorded by the shooter himself. The ICE agent will likely argue that he opened fire on Good—who was unarmed and driving away—to save his own life. But the videos also raise the possibility that he fired because he felt disrespected by a person who—in his opinion—owed him deference. ICE agents who use violence may be counting on superiors to back them up, because they feel disrespected too, and by the whole ungrateful country. Which returns us to Vance and his don’t bother me with the facts defense of the ICE shooter.

MAGA is many things, but above all it’s a movement about redistributing respect away from those who command too much (overeducated coastal elites) to those who don’t have enough (white Americans without advanced degrees who feel left behind). You see that redistribution at work in the Trump administration’s project to devalue medical experts and empower wellness gurus and vaccine skeptics, and in its dismissal of “deep state” national-security professionals in favor of TV pundits.

Nowhere does the demand to redistribute respect come into starker view than when guns start firing. In Trump’s first term, Kyle Rittenhouse—who shot and killed two men and injured a third during protests against police brutality in Wisconsin in August 2020—became a MAGA hero largely because he was enforcing the MAGA vision of respect due. Many Americans saw him as a trigger-happy 17-year-old vigilante, but to the MAGA faithful he was a brave soldier in the larger war against MAGA enemies, real and imagined.

The ICE agent who killed Good is Trump’s second-term Kyle Rittenhouse. Of course the agent could have walked away and left everyone unharmed. By law, perhaps he should have walked away: It’s generally illegal for a law-enforcement officer to kill a civilian seeking to escape, more so if the civilian is unarmed, and even more so if the civilian is not a criminal suspect of any kind. But letting protesters drive off unscathed, without punishing them for their disrespect, would let them “get away with it.” And that would be an intolerable affront to the MAGA vision of who must submit to whom.

Idrees Kahloon: The return of MAGA’s favorite forbidden book

By coming so vociferously to the shooter’s defense, Vance full-throatedly committed himself to the MAGA mission of enforcing respect by any means necessary. Because there’s always such a strong whiff of cynical calculation and inauthenticity about Vance, he has to say more and go further than many natural MAGA personalities do. He has to pay moral cash where others might be trusted on moral credit. If the Minneapolis shooter is the next Kyle Rittenhouse, Vance dared not delay before thrusting himself at this new MAGA hero’s side.

This is how we arrive at a moment when the country’s highest-ranking officials are endorsing a lethal shooting on the basis of claims refuted by the evidence. Failure to heed the MAGA campaign to redistribute respect is insolence punishable by death.</div>

            <h2>The Court Case That Is Allowing ICE to Stop Just About Anyone It Wants</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For 30 years, law-enforcement officers have been empowered to be “clever”—and that cleverness has today become the cover for abusive actions by ICE.

In 1996, the Supreme Court decided Whren v. United States, which came about when plainclothes vice officers patrolling in the District of Columbia passed a truck in a “high drug” area and “their suspicions were aroused.” They had a hunch that the truck was involved in a drug operation. They chose to wait until it had violated a traffic ordinance (turning without a signal) and then used that violation as an excuse to stop the truck. In the course of searching the truck, they found crack cocaine.

The Supreme Court said that the temporary detention of a motorist “upon probable cause to believe that he has violated the traffic laws” did not violate the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable seizures, even if the officer would not have stopped the motorist absent some additional law-enforcement purpose. The Court developed a rule of objective intent. Under this theory, if the officers had a valid reason for acting—an objectively reasonable intention, in the Court’s terminology—then their true motive and subjective intent was of no constitutional consequence. A pretextual traffic stop to search for drugs was just fine with the Court.

Adam Serwer: Conservatives want the antebellum Constitution back

That decision, though couched as an application of the Fourth Amendment’s “reasonableness” standard, was grounded on two premises that were plausible at the time. First, that the discretionary authority granted to the police would be used against genuine criminals such as drug dealers. Second, that the occasional misuses of that discretion would be few, far between, and manageable by the court system through robust testing and oversight. Any harm that could possibly occur was outweighed by the good that would be achieved.

Whren has long plagued minority communities, leading to countless incidents of racial profiling. The current use of Whren in the immigration context takes these abuses further yet, singling out people not on suspicion of criminal behavior but for noncriminal immigration enforcement. Both of the premises in Whren, if they ever were accurate, are now manifestly false. Officer discretion is not being deployed solely against possibly malevolent actors, and the misuse of that discretion is causing more harm than good, not only to those illegally present, but also to those here legally, including U.S. citizens.

The confluence of Whren and ICE is easily captured anecdotally. In Washington, D.C., for example, the U.S. Park Police (a federal police agency) is responsible for enforcing traffic laws on Rock Creek Parkway, a piece of federal land. Since the ICE crackdown began, the park police have begun pulling over commercial trucks for technical violations—say, obscured license plates or driving on the noncommercial parkway—and then allowing ICE to arrest those suspected of immigration violations. To the same effect in D.C., delivery drivers are at risk of being stopped for traffic violations and then being sucked into the immigration-enforcement machine. It’s not just D.C.; the crackdown is nationwide. ICE detentions start with minor traffic violations in Phoenix. In Florida, they begin at truck inspection checkpoints. Or, in Montana, with a broken taillight. Unsurprisingly, the traffic crackdown is not race-neutral. In South Florida, for example, ICE is targeting specific types of work trucks typically driven by people of color.

Even 30 years ago, the Court’s view rested on shaky empirical foundations. It adopted the rule of objective intent despite understanding that, at least sometimes, the subjective intent of the officer might be invidious. The Court recognized that instead of targeting suspicious vehicles in a high-crime area, an officer might have been the sort who targeted a car filled with Black Americans simply because of their skin color. But the Court had a general view that the police were typically trustworthy and honest, and it wrote a rule based on that assumption.

This rule was attractive to the Court because subjective intent is much more difficult to assess than objective factors. It is hard to know what someone else is really thinking, even if you know them quite well. Many judges know that they are particularly ill-suited to assess spur-of-the-moment motivation when sitting in the quiet of their chambers. Worse yet, adopting a rule that asks an officer to explain his motivation is just a formula to solicit perjury—a rule that relies on subjective intent would give any officer an incentive to shade the truth and embellish on his thought process.

But the incentives for officers to shade the truth are really no different under either the objective standard or the subjective one. Just as a law-enforcement officer may sometimes gild the lily in describing his thought process, he may also do so in describing the objective facts that he has observed. I had one case, many years ago, in which my client was suspected of engaging in a drug transaction. The police broadcast a lookout for his car, and he was pulled over for a traffic violation. His offense? Allegedly driving faster than 15 miles per hour in a mall parking lot. But given the configuration of the lot and the presence of other parked cars, the officer’s contention that the car was speeding was dubious at best. Still, he had offered an objectively valid ground for the stop, and my client was duly convicted based on the drugs found in his car.

Whren’s logic has always been a formula for abuse, but that abuse has come especially to the fore today, when acted on by ICE agents who, far from investigating federal crimes, are deploying their authority in the service of noncriminal immigration enforcement to satisfy Trump’s deportation quota. Without any actual knowledge that a crime may have been committed, ICE officers can convert an everyday occurrence that almost every person in America does routinely (rolling through a stop sign, say) into the pretext for arrest that can lead to banishment.

Listen: Federal agents are violating the rights of Americans

Whren’s most fundamental error was the Court’s implicit assumption that malicious intent by law-enforcement officers was a rare subset of justified traffic stops. Back then, the Court might plausibly have given law enforcement the benefit of the doubt. Today, the current conduct of federal law enforcement—and most particularly ICE investigations where criminal activity is not generally at issue—seems to be different both in degree and in kind from what the law might reasonably have anticipated decades ago.

It is, no doubt, too much to hope that the Court, as currently constituted, will revisit this unwise decision. But if there ever comes a time when reconsideration is possible, Whren should be scrapped, and a rule of subjective intent should be adopted that is more aligned with what we now know about the possibility of authoritarian abuse. ICE’s conduct, if it has taught us anything, has taught us not to blindly trust the good intentions of law enforcement.</div>

            <h2>Banana Republicanism</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-desperate-powell-investigation/685583/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration has opened a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on grounds so flimsy and transparently hypocritical that it is difficult to know whether anybody is supposed to take the charges at face value. When a respected public servant is being accused of wasting taxpayer dollars and lying to Congress by a president whose extravagant White House renovation has already doubled in cost in just three months, and whose inexhaustible capacity for lies has essentially broken every fact-checking medium, one almost wonders if the criminal allegation was chosen for its absurdity, to demonstrate that Donald Trump can make the law mean whatever he wants it to.

Trump’s gambit is more likely to fail than it is to succeed. Powell’s term ends in four months, a timeline so brief that it wouldn’t be hastened by even a well-founded criminal charge, which this is not. In theory, harassing Powell with trumped-up charges could intimidate him into backing down, but the Fed chair responded with a defiant statement. Republican Senator Thom Tillis vowed not to support any new nominees to the Federal Reserve board “until this legal matter is fully resolved.” And even if Trump were to manage to install sufficiently pliant figureheads at the agency, the Fed’s demonstrable lack of independence would be apt to weaken its influence over monetary policy and make the economy worse, not better.

What’s more, Trump is gambling that his control over the Republican Party is so unshakable that he can extend his banana republicanism to a policy domain that matters deeply to his wealthy partisan allies. Those conservative economic elites who don’t actively cheer on Trump’s authoritarianism and corruption have learned to live with both, because he delivers the goods in the policy realms that matter to them: tax cuts, deregulation, and other conservative economic priorities.

Every affluent Republican, from the tech right to fossil-fuel owners to heirs managing their inherited portfolios, has a direct and visible interest in stable and competent monetary policy. The Republican Party’s respect for the Fed’s independence is already evident in a recent Supreme Court ruling, in which the conservative majority appears to be seeking to create a special exemption for the Federal Reserve from the Court’s general doctrine that presidents are entitled to fire the heads of independent agencies. When Trump messes with the Fed, he is defecating where his wealthy donors eat. Perhaps they will go along with this, too, but he is testing the limits of their acquiescence.

Rogé Karma: Trump is getting closer to having an ‘infinite money pit’

The apparent source of this desperate gamble is that Trump seems keenly aware that the public disapproves of his presidency and his economic policy making. But rather than move to the center and try to allay the concerns of his wavering supporters, Trump’s response to adversity has been to try to seize as much economic and political power as he can, as fast as possible.

Thus the invasion of Venezuela, which he hopes will provide him with a windfall source of petro-dollars. (Sunday night, Trump shared on Truth Social a mock biography describing himself as “Acting President of Venezuela.”) After floating a proposal to cap credit-card interest rates that stands little chance of passage in Congress, he told reporters on Air Force One that firms that fail to comply with his target by January 20—before any law capping interest rates can conceivably make it through the House and Senate—will be “in violation of the law.”

In normal times, private companies could simply laugh off a president’s threat that they have “violated” a law that does not exist. But since Trump has amply demonstrated his eagerness to redefine the law as synonymous with his own whims, his threats may well contain real power.

Trump’s clumsy legal intimidation of Powell mirrors tactics used by regimes such as those of Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. This is not a list of the most prosperous economies in the modern world. What these states have in common (with the exception of Argentina, which has rebuilt its economic and political systems from the setbacks they suffered under disastrous Trump-style experiments) is an entrenched elite that hoards wealth and control.

Caitlin B. Tully: The Court has an easy answer on the Fed

The administration is fond of accusing immigrant communities of importing dysfunctional political cultures from the developing world. “If these societies all over the world continue to fail, you have to ask yourself, if you bring those societies into our country and then give them unlimited free welfare, what do we think is going to happen? You’re gonna replicate the conditions that they left,” Stephen Miller recently told Fox News.

The global South may be cursed with more than its share of regimes in which economic success depends on political access and the rule of law is a bitter joke. However, it is not the desperate refugees fleeing poverty and oppression who are importing their political culture, but Trump himself.</div>

            <h2>What <em>Black Swan</em> Knew About Leaning In</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/black-swan-women-workplace-movie/685564/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 film, Black Swan, fit into a lot of boxes. It was a psychological thriller, a body-horror flick, a character study, a coming-of-age saga. It was a cautionary tale about ballet culture, helicopter parenting, and perfectionism. Rewatching it roughly 15 years after its release, though, I’ve come to see it as something else: a workplace drama, about an ambitious woman navigating a hypercompetitive environment, contorting herself to please the mercurial boss who holds her fate in his hands.

The ballet world is, of course, unique—a field that requires uncommon athletic and artistic mastery, as well as more commitment and sacrifice than most 9-to-5 jobs. The path to success for a dancer doesn’t necessarily look the same as that of a corporate employee. Yet Black Swan’s central character, Nina Sayers, played by Natalie Portman, struggles in ways that feel broadly relatable.

Like many young strivers, Nina has wound up with her identity entirely entangled in her job. When she lands her dream role in Swan Lake, playing both the innocent White Swan loved by a prince and the seductive Black Swan who attempts to steal him away, she throws herself into her work. But recognition always seems out of reach. The company’s director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), keeps telling Nina she’s too “frigid” and sexless to play the Black Swan. The other dancers covet her part and make her feel unworthy of it. (In any industry, sparse opportunities can lead to hungry, cutthroat workers.) Nina has no mentor to look up to; Beth, the former prima ballerina played by Winona Ryder, has been ruthlessly excised from the company for being too old. The film implies that Beth is still as capable as ever of performing beautifully; the company simply wants a “fresh face,” as Thomas puts it, to draw audiences. Here as in so many workplaces, employees are expendable, valued not for their personhood but for their present contribution to the bottom line.

On top of all that, Thomas keeps coming on to Nina, arguing that she needs to loosen up to get in touch with her inner Black Swan. He asks if she’s a virgin, tells her to masturbate (homework), and kisses her (more than once). This of course puts her in an impossible position: If she protests, she’ll be proving his point that she’s too uptight; if she relents, she’ll be proving right the other dancers’ suspicion that she exploited his attraction to get the part. Thomas’s fiefdom seems similar to that of many real-life dance companies in that power is concentrated in a man with few checks on his behavior. His harassment evokes some of the abuse accusations that have rocked the ballet world—but also the kind of #MeToo stories that have emerged in numerous fields. And as Nina struggles to focus, Thomas keeps telling her, cruelly: “The only person standing in your way is you.”

That idea—and the disturbing question of whether it’s true—is one that I imagine haunts many working women. Around the time Black Swan came out, high-powered female executives were making headlines, and Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Women could see that incredible professional success was possible—but this didn’t mean they were in a position to achieve it. In 2013, Sheryl Sandberg, then the chief operating officer of Meta, delivered a diagnosis in her best-selling book Lean In: Women tend to deny themselves career success, she argued, because they internalize the idea that they should be meek and deferential, and thus take “their foot off the gas,” as she put it in one TED Talk. Instead, she asserted, they need to be bold: speak up in meetings; ask for that raise. Sandberg’s philosophy, I realized, is rather Thomas-esque. In one scene, seemingly testing Nina, he tells her that she won’t be getting the main role in Swan Lake—then berates her for accepting his decision rather than fighting him on it. “You could be brilliant,” he tells her later. “But you’re a coward.”

Though Lean In was a hit—people like to feel that they have agency—it also stirred immediate controversy for its insistence that women could change their circumstances through sheer force of will. Sandberg eventually gave more credence to the structural causes of professional inequity and acknowledged that she hadn’t truly understood the plight of, say, working single moms. But three years before her book was published, Black Swan had already captured one of the problems with holding yourself entirely responsible for your own success: It can turn you against yourself. In a sense, Thomas’s warning that Nina is getting in her own way is a self-fulfilling prophecy. She becomes her own worst enemy.

Aronofsky has said that he based Black Swan on Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s short 1846 novel The Double, about a struggling low-level civil servant who finds that a man has joined his office who looks exactly like him—but who is far more charming and well liked by their colleagues. They become nemeses, naturally. (The Double was also made into its own movie, starring Jesse Eisenberg, in 2013.) In Black Swan, Nina is surrounded by creepy mirror images. Sometimes, her reflection, in the studio’s great glass wall, stops mimicking her actions. Sometimes she hallucinates that people walking down the street or dancing across from her have her face. Primarily, though, Nina’s double—the far more charming, better-liked version of her—is a dancer named Lily (Mila Kunis), a clear Black Swan to Nina’s White one. When Nina despises Lily, she is despising herself. Eventually Nina grows paranoid, losing her grip on what’s real and what’s not. Her breakdown is far more dramatic than what most people will ever experience, but it illustrates the way in which endless, lonely toil can alienate a person from herself. It’s the extreme but logical conclusion of adopting a bootstrap mentality under conditions that don’t actually allow you to pull yourself up.

The path for ambitious women today may be even more obscure than it was upon Black Swan’s release. Politicians, academics, pundits, and influencers are challenging not only the idea that women should be CEOs but also that they should be in the workforce at all (or able to vote). McKinsey’s annual Women in the Workplace study of corporate America—co-conducted by Sandberg’s LeanIn.org and published last month—found that “women are as dedicated to their careers as men” but that they tend to receive less mentorship at work and, in senior positions, remain outnumbered by men. Some companies, according to McKinsey’s report, had recently cut programs designed to support women; many had curtailed remote- or flexible-work options, which are generally a boon to moms trying to keep their jobs. For the first time since McKinsey began conducting its study, female participants reported less desire for promotion than male participants did.

Yet when men and women receive similar amounts of support from senior colleagues, the report found, any ambition gap between the sexes disappears. Women, this suggests, care plenty about what they do and whether they’re seen. Only when they feel undervalued or have little hope of advancement are they more likely to pull back.

Something that struck me when I rewatched Black Swan was all the little reminders that Nina once really loved ballet, before the job wore her down. And I wondered: What if she’d had a less predatory director in a less punishing environment? What if she’d had someone to help her tap into that love without losing her mind? One of the saddest parts of Black Swan is seeing Nina’s passion for dance draining out of her. Thomas keeps telling her to feel the music, to not just to go through the motions. By the time he’s got his grip on her, it’s too late.

LOL! I feel ya! Nevertheless, Batman and the OG Star Trek are still some of my all time favorite shows that I can watch on repeat indefinitely. Sooooo much fun

I am but a wee lad of 62, and we didn&#39;t get ABC at the time, so I only saw Batman much later, on afternoon reruns.

My first real memory of the show was the movie they made in &#39;66.

I think I&#39;ll break out the old boxed set this evening and have some campy fun. Penguin for Mayor! Pengy, the people&#39;s pick!

Ok, so I have a favorite character; stemming from the fact that Burgess Meredith is one of my all time favorite actors. In fact, the movie they shot between seasons 1 and 2 is where my screen name came from. Want to buy a diesel powered surplus pre-atomic submarine but you&#39;re a super villain? You&#39;ll need a clever alias, Mr. P. N. Gwen :D

When my daughter was growing up, I used to watch Fairly Oddparents with her. One of my favorite characters was &quot;Adam West&quot;, who was voiced by ... Adam West! In the Fairly Oddparents universe, Adam West was an elderly actor known for playing the role of &quot;Catman&quot; - and who had at best a tenuous grip on reality.

It&#39;s always fun when well-known actors are willing to make fun of themselves. (also in this camp - Jon Voight&#39;s and Raquel Welsh&#39;s appearances on Seinfeld).

It&#39;s always fun when well-known actors are willing to make fun of themselves. (also in this camp - Jon Voight&#39;s and Raquel Welsh&#39;s appearances on Seinfeld).

On the other hand, it&#39;s sad when a perfectly &#39;fine&#39; actor gets so badly typecast that all they can do for the rest of their career is make fun of themselves.

The Batman: The Animated Series episode &#39;Grey Ghost&#39; was the only one that actually treated West and his Batman history with respect and dignity.

I didn&#39;t need molded plastic to improve my physique. Pure. West. [youtube.com]

West had a great second act in voice work, truly the man was game for anything.

I met Burt Ward at a car show in Memphis in the late 70&#39;s.

I was six years old and took the show very seriously.

Once I forgot to watch it and wept bitter tears.

&quot;Holy Astringent Plum-Like Fruit!&quot; (google it)

I seem to recall that I could resize windows in Windows 3.11 and fvwm Maybe there was a lot to be desired in other aspects, but the core functionality seemed present 30 years ago.

Maybe Microsoft didn&#39;t design the software with you in mind?

how do you get money back when it comes preloaded on a laptop?

And why have the &#39;X&#39; right at the corner?  There&#39;s one pixel between resize and close.  Dumb.  The whole rest of the title bar is unused.

I liked the aesthetics of BeOS with just a little tab with the title and window buttons, instead of this huge unused bar.

Actually grabbing onto such a window when it is buried in a messy pile can be a bit of a challenge, but there are ways around that with sane modifiers to &quot;grab&quot; windows.

I agree regarding Mac OS.  Windows peaked with Windows 10.  XP was better than 8, though.  Windows 11 is better in some ways than 10 but worse in the privacy aspect.  Windows 11 stable and highly usable.  Ubuntu/Linux desktop has gotten a lot better, but anything serious requires a command line, which is a pain in the ass.

You mean with always on spyware and ads in the start menu? GTFO.

I&#39;ve been on 26 for a while.. (months, when did it come out?) And I didn&#39;t even know this was a thing. And yes I do resize windows a lot, and would definitely notice some annoying shit like that.

I&#39;m on 26.3 right now (developer beta) and I have used each iteration of 26 Tahoe along the way. I&#39;ve had no problem resizing windows.

Janky how? First off, I hardly even noticed that I was dragging in empty space when I resize a window in MacOS 26. I think I did realize it once or twice before, but not as a big deal. Muscle memory directed me to the corner of the windows and I drag it. Maybe in my brain the window is still &quot;square&quot; except that corner is transparent. I&#39;m struggling to see what the problem is. You can still resize windows. If you want to argue nerd-level UX/UI technicalities: if they made it such that you could click within

Apple removed the visible resize grippy-strip from window corners in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion in July 2011.What chaps me is the mouse cursor, which does not change, not one iota, over about 90% of that grippable area. If we got a &#39;resize&#39; cursor image over the territory that could be grabbed, all of this would be a non-issue. Instead, the cursor flips over 1/n the width of the human hair, with n=the number of people bloody sick of interface changes for no damned reason.

Instead, the cursor flips over 1/n the width of the human hair, with n=the number of people bloody sick of interface changes for no damned reason.

Why doesn&#39;t the cursor change when it is on the point where one can resize the window?

I understand why electron apps reinventing the wheel fuckup basic UI guidelines (and for example forget triangle filters so menus become almost unusable), but how can a native UI on macOS fail to change the cursor when it is at the point for resizing the window?

Im on an MacOS 26 machine now and it definitely does, if the cursor hasn&#39;t changed I can&#39;t resize the window and when it does change I can.  I have a reasonable space both inside and outside the window to resize.

Sure the grippy thing is gone but it doesn&#39;t seem any harder to resize a window and I certainly get visual feedback

&quot;Why doesn&#39;t the cursor change when it is on the point where one can resize the window?&quot;

It does change on my 26.2 Macs. It changes from the usual pointer to what appears to be two diagonal arrows. And it does this for approx. 1/4 in square in the bottom right on my MB Pro 14 in. screen, M3.

I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re considering popular, because in my testing of &quot;popular&quot; Linux distros with various desktop environments I have never had something like this. GNOME and KDE, the two most popular environments regardless of distro, both have plentifully large zones for resizing.

Yes, large ZONES.  However the resize TARGET is often very small.  On Ubuntu Mate it&#39;s 2 pixels on my desktop (which is scaled 200% so the default is probably 1 pixel).  The target is the UI element you aim your mouse at.  That&#39;s the visible window border.  The resize zone only extends PAST that target and very annoyingly not before it.  If I look closely there&#39;s a shadow along the edge of the window (not visible with darker windows/wallpaper behind it) and that entire shadow is the resize zone.

I disabled window decorations for flux/openbox on Linux years ago because using a key and mouse was more effective and made my desktop completely distraction free, as well as eliminated the space waste of the title bar.I no longer have to aim every time for that thin line on which I have to click and hold.

How is a line, that keeps the text of one window from looking like it runs into another window, distracting?

MacOS has always had an ugly UI with poor usability and design choices. Apple has literally never understood anything about software development or UI design, or even hardware design.

To me MacOS has always had a nice UI and they made good design choices. Who doesn&#39;t understand UIs is MS and whatever the Unix/Linux crowd uses.

Clearly you don&#39;t know good UI design either, just like you don&#39;t know anything about Linux - since Linux mostly uses either GNOME which looks and functions almost exactly like MacOS, and KDE which looks and functions similar to Windows 10-ish; though there are other environments too. Microsoft always like halfway understands good UI design. Microsoft&#39;s issue is they&#39;ll get it close to good and then abandon it for something new in the next version but still have some weird amounts of leftover old UI. Like w

I move the mouse to the corner, it changes shape, and I click and drag.  Done.

I&#39;ve never even noticed that this happens outside the window.

Scroll bars -- well they are a while other story.

I&#39;m going to call this a PEBCAK issue in the author.

Scroll bars -- well they are a while other story.It&#39;s possible I&#39;m missing what you&#39;re referring to here, since I always stay 1-2 major versions behind on macOS. But, assuming it&#39;s the &quot;hide/show scroll bars automatically&quot; mal-feature... at least you can disable that (and I always do).

I wasn&#39;t aware you could click on the inside until I tried it just now. I never thought about it too hard but always thought of it as grabbing the outside edge and stretching the window like a sheet of rubber or something.
  My guess is they looked at user data and the vast majority of users do this as well?

I don&#39;t need more window space if I can&#39;t use the product. Not only is this happening with OS&#39;s but it&#39;s happening with browsers and webpages with scroll bars. I&#39;d rather be able to find the scroll bar than save 4-12 pixels worth of screen space, which is usually 1/2 to 1/4 the size of a font in the app. Is it worth it? No. The problem is OS&#39;s are mature and the UI people still need a job, so what do they do? Keep changing things that don&#39;t need to be changed.

These &quot;UX&quot; people are always trying to justify their employment; to be fair, it&#39;s habit as they had to fight to exist in the 1st place. Since UI has been broadened to UX, you&#39;d think they would expand outside of breaking what works already!

The other problem is the psychologists who pioneered most everything are gone and the kiddies have so little background understanding. Even if you do study and find a slight benefit, the existing userbase&#39;s habits undoes those changes...  Sure people resist change and you

I have a related problem with most the MATE/GNOME 2 desktop themes.  The window borders are 1 pixel wide making it exceptionally difficult to resize them.  I try to hand-edit the desktop theme to widen them.

That said, I&#39;ve seen the single pixel resize problem on some Linux machiens and some test software I have to run on Windows XP. But it&#39;s weird that we created an entire new career of UX Designer and all they ever seem to do is hide things and make things worse.

It&#39;s the Garfield effect; it happens to every commercial product eventually.

First, the designers run out of &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; that they can harvest to enhance the product... but sales still needs a new version every 6-12 months, or they can&#39;t market the product, so the designers are forced to make changes that improve the product only marginally.

The thing that always, always frustrated me about MacOS was that there was no maximize in the sense of &quot;fill the entire desktop with the window&quot;. Double-clicking on the title bar of the application doesn&#39;t do what you want?

I use Hammerspoon and a custom ini file to resize and reposition my windows using keyboard shortcuts. That is especially useful on a larger monitor like the 49&quot; Samsung Odyssey G9.

I often place partition the screen vertically: one window in the left quarter, one in the right quarter, and the main window in the center half of the screen, all with a few quick keyboard shortcuts.

Then the problem is to get active if you are depressed. It&#39;s next to impossible.

Ugh this. My job is difficult and depressing. After a day of it I just want to distract myself from existence.

I invested in a rowing machine to use at home and it made all the difference as I was never going to get myself to a gym on a regular basis. Dont know if that would be a useful idea for you or not though.

I chose a rowing machine out of all of the single exercise machines out there because it does the closest to a full body workout of any of them in case you or anyone was wondering.

I have been more or less depressed since I was a child.

In my late 30s, I started walking a lot, hitting my 10k nearly every day. I am in my late 40&#39;s now and my depression is quite manageable. I am consistently in a much better mood than I was in my earlier years. I have also lost quite a bit of weight (went from 250-270 to 200-210) and my lower back pain is nearly gone too.

So, there you go. Just get outside (preferably; vitamin D is very important) or get on the treadmill. You don&#39;t need to run or jog, just walk, that&#39;s it.

You don&#39;t need to run or jog, just walk, that&#39;s it.That only works in places where agreeable weather is a frequent occurrence.  Most of the year, the weather outdoors in Florida is actively trying to kill you.  Going outside pretty much requires being inside an air conditioned car.

Medicine is as effective as exercise for depression?

I bought a concept2 rowing machine and some weights about 4 years ago.I row 4 days a week adding up to just over 16km, tracked on my phone which I find motivational and am up to about 2300km

I suffered from the black dog on and off for a long time but having read this article have just thought, wow been long time since I’ve been depressed!Interesting. Now I’ve just got to stop weekend drinking!

I lift weights.  12 ounces at a time.It isn&#39;t the weight that counts, it&#39;s the reps. I salute you

It isn&#39;t the weight that counts, it&#39;s the reps. I salute you

That&#39;s why you can use headphone and/or watch TVs at the gym.  Accomplish two time wasting things at once and you can justify each by pretending you&#39;re being efficient with your time.

Or think like a rich bastard.  Record yourself at the gym and put it online as a &#39;workout with me&#39; small business.  Now your gym membership becomes a business expense and you can tell everyone you&#39;re a business owner.  Get financing.  Using AI to change the backgrounds of your few workout videos and re-post them.  Now you can s

The executive summary seems to be to just get out and walk more (or whatever exercise that you choose).Having been a long time Disney annual passholder, my own personal experience is that the walking part of visiting the parks never stops sucking.  If I could just teleport myself around to the various attractions and snack kiosks, I would.  Yeah, I realize they do rent those mobility scooters, but they&#39;re expensive and people give you judgey looks for not walking (which kind of tells you how they feel about having to walk all day, too).People who claim to genuinely enjoy exercise either are wired differently

Correct.  But it&#39;s more and more looking like inflammation or an inflammation-related effect.  All of the random depression treatments are also anti-inflammatory or high-energy use.

Magnesium cured my multi-decades long clinical depression.  That treatment is take magnesium supplements for 3 weeks and you&#39;ll either be cured or not.  My depression simply faded away around week 2 and now it&#39;s impossible for me to dwell in those oddly comforting yet depressive thoughts.  When depressed, it feels &#39;good&#39; to wallo

Anything that represents taking control of some component of your life will have this effect. Exercise is one of these. For others it might be cleaning the home that is neglected while depressed. Taking control of the environment surrounding you helps to take a bit of control over your internal environment. Basically any thing that pulls some control back from the universe and into yourself has great benefit.

I&#39;m not saying it was wasteful to study. It&#39;s not. Good for them. But the conclusion can be found rampant through literature on mental health.

It&#39;s a self-perpetuating cycle.  Depression makes it very hard to take control and do things.  People think of it as an illness of sadness but that&#39;s not really what it is.  Depression and ADHD both have a lot in common with relation to serotonin and dopamine.  Executive dysfunction is the umbrella term for not being able to initiate even simple tasks that bring happiness.  Medication is a good way to get you started, but modern medical practice tends to just stay with medicine instead of using something el

Great, it works on depression.  I can vouch for that.

So, how to get motivated to work out when the depression&#39;s got you by the yarballs?

Ahahha.... no answer for that one, right?

Sometimes I feel the psychology and psychiatry fields are populated with naught but charlatans.

So, how to get motivated to work out when the depression&#39;s got you by the yarballs?

Maybe it is the other way around. At the time when the depressions starts to lift, people can get around to be more active, and also do more exercise. Once the depression is over, they look back and see that as soon as they started exercising, things started to get better.

Maybe it is the other way around. At the time when the depressions starts to lift, people can get around to be more active, and also do more exercise.That&#39;s basically like those &quot;diet soda makes you fat&quot; studies.  Because if you have the willpower to stick to a diet of rice cakes and kale, you&#39;d probably be able to kick the soda addiction, too.Exercise requires a mind-over-matter mentality to enjoy, because exerting physical effort for no immediate reward, sucks.  Anyone who has managed to get themselves into that state of mind probably is already on the path to overcoming depression.

No the causation is pretty damn clear in this case. You can measure the chemical response in the body from exercise. Exercise releases endorphins (this has been known for over 4 decades), and endorphins are mood elevators (this has been known for 6 decades).

The only thing new about this study is the comparison between exercise and medication.

It&#39;s bidirectional. Being depressed often is accompanied by losing control of your evnvironment/health/fitness. Reasserting control over these things in small steps can move you away from depression.

The Wyoming Supreme Court struck down its state’s sweeping abortion ban on Tuesday, preserving access to reproductive health care by a 4–1 vote. Its opinion found that Wyoming had (perhaps inadvertently) enshrined a right to abortion access when it ratified the freedom to make medical decisions in 2012 as part of a backlash to Obamacare. The majority also dismantled lawmakers’ justifications for its draconian abortion restrictions, reflecting a sensitivity toward the complexity of pregnancy that stands in stark contrast to the U.S. Supreme Court. Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the ruling, its ironic backstory, and its clear-eyed refutation of SCOTUS on this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus. An excerpt from their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This is a pretty bold ruling, coming from a court in an extremely red state. Can you just talk us through how Wyoming, of all places, wound up with such incredibly robust protection for reproductive freedom?

Mark Joseph Stern: The Wyoming Supreme Court’s five justices are all Republican appointees. But the Wyoming Constitution explicitly declares that “each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.” How did a ruby-red state wind up enshrining that fundamental right? Well, when Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act back in 2010, GOP politicians and activists decided they were going to fight back by banning socialized medicine in state constitutions. They claimed they were worried that the government would force everyone into a state-run health care system in which bureaucrats dictated exactly what would be provided. So they pushed for these constitutional amendments that would preserve private insurance and give everyone the right to access and pay for medical treatment.

As Michigan State University College of Law professor Quinn Yeargain has documented, five states ultimately enacted those amendments, including Wyoming in 2012. But their proponents wrote them in broad language rather than framing them as an explicit rebuke to Obamacare. So Wyoming’s amendment begins by granting every adult this sweeping right to make their own health care decisions, and it shields that right from “undue government infringement.” Everybody ignored that this was part of the state constitution until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Then the Wyoming Legislature passed a ban on virtually all abortions at every stage of pregnancy. A group of doctors sued and said: These abortion bans violate the right to medical decisionmaking secured in our state constitution. And on Tuesday, the Wyoming Supreme Court said they were correct.

I can hear the woodwinds and strings in your ode to creative lawyering in the states. But I think it’s really worth flagging that, as you said, these are not rabid lefty judges. They are Republican appointees. And you could certainly imagine conservative judges finding a way to get the results they wanted by saying: Look, this was all about Obamacare. This has nothing to do with abortion. This decision does not take the easy route. It says that words have meaning.

I’ll note two things. First, even though these are not flaming liberal judges, Wyoming does have a merit-based judicial-selection system. So these are also real judges who are committed to trying to figure out what the law means. Second, the key move here is the court’s holding that terminating a pregnancy is a health care decision. The state of Wyoming argued that it wasn’t. It said: Abortion isn’t health care, so it doesn’t fall under this provision whatsoever. And the majority said that that was wrong; given the often detrimental impact of pregnancy on an individual’s health, the choice to terminate is clearly a health care decision. That means all restrictions on it must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.

This led to another interesting analytical move, which Mary Ziegler wrote about in Slate: The court held that Wyoming’s ban was not narrowly tailored to protect “fetal life.” And it did so by pointing to its lack of meaningful, coherent exceptions. So, for instance, state law allows termination for lethal fetal defects only if the baby would die within hours or days of birth. But the plaintiffs had doctors testify that they could not know for certain whether an infant with these defects would live for days, weeks, or maybe even a few months before suffering a painful death. So the majority said: Look, it’s illogical for the state to make patients carry a doomed high-risk pregnancy just because that infant might live a few more days or a few more weeks before inevitably dying. In legal terms, the law was tailored in a very arbitrary way, seemingly to prolong the suffering of women, as well as fetuses who were not going to survive if they were born.

The majority also pointed to Wyoming’s exception for rape, which is barely an exception at all, and noted that it really violates the logic of the ban: If Wyoming has an obligation to protect life from conception, as the state claims, how can it deem a life unworthy of protection because it was the product of sexual assault? The majority also pointed out that rape victims can terminate a pregnancy only if they report their assault—but many victims do not file a police report for a variety of reasons, including fear of retaliation by the perpetrator, who is often a family member. This is especially perverse because a minor who becomes pregnant from rape is not, under Wyoming law, allowed to request an abortion herself; she has to go through her parents or guardians. And if her parent or guardian is the person who raped her, they can veto her attempt to terminate the resulting pregnancy.

The majority said this was all deeply irrational and unworkable, and not remotely tailored to serve the state’s alleged interest. That is just solid legal analysis that really should not have a partisan or ideological slant. It’s just rooted in reason and the real world.

What you are describing is the anti-Dobbs opinion, right? This is a rebuke to Justice Samuel Alito and his completely inane analysis about the complexity of pregnancy. But it’s also a rebuke to state lawmakers who think they understand how medicine works, and to the entire pro-life industrial complex, which keeps treating pregnancy as though it’s a simple, check-the-box enterprise. This is an opinion that deeply honors the fact that pregnancies are complicated. They are fraught. They are a big deal. It sweeps in questions of rape and abuse and power differentials and reporting and how the criminal justice system works. It sweeps in granular questions about when life begins and whose life matters.

This is not the kind of thing that Alito can just imagine away, because he likes the idea of fetuses above all. What you’re describing is a court that is really sensitive to the principle that Alito missed completely in Dobbs, which is that when the government tries to regulate pregnancy and abortion in simpleminded cartoonish ways, women are oppressed and tortured. But then there’s the other piece of this that I want you to just amplify, which is that this is a court doing actual, principled, Scalian textual analysis. I’ve almost forgotten what that looks like, because you sure as hell don’t see it at the Supreme Court.

Those are the two pieces that braid together so nicely. This is a court saying that constitutional language has consequences and courts can’t just pretend that the words in the Constitution don’t exist because they’re inconvenient. This amendment, whatever its intent, was ultimately approved by the voters of Wyoming. We don’t know exactly what those voters thought they were approving when they enshrined this into their founding charter. People had different ideas. You can’t read their minds. Maybe a lot of them thought it was about socialized medicine. But what they ended up doing was create a fundamental right to make health care decisions. And because that right still exists, the state Supreme Court felt an obligation to enforce it.

That meant striking down Wyoming’s whole anti-choice regime—which, as you say, collapsed under its own internal contradictions. What the court did was say: This is a fundamental right, so we have to apply real, meaningful scrutiny to it. And once you do that, you see how horrible and irrational these abortion laws are on the ground. Forcing minors to get approval from the parent who raped them in order to terminate the resulting pregnancy. Forcing doctors to tell a patient: Sorry, you have to give birth to this doomed fetus because I can’t certify that it’ll die within days rather than weeks. All of these realities of pregnancy on the ground that Alito totally glossed over are front and center in this opinion.

I find that to be the ultimate kind of rejoinder to Dobbs, because in Dobbs, there are no acknowledged victims. The victims of that decision are concealed and hidden. It’s presented as this great win for “fetal life” and democracy. And the women who die because they can’t get a medically necessary abortion? The women whose lives are forever altered in a terrible way because they are forced to carry a pregnancy with lethal defects to term? The rape victims who cannot terminate a pregnancy that results from assault? Alito pushes them under the rug. But this Wyoming Supreme Court opinion brings them out and says they matter too. And that is the opinion that I felt I needed to read since the day the Dobbs draft leaked. And I’m just shocked that it came from Wyoming.

On Friday, the Supreme Court decided Bowe v. United States, a procedural case that will meaningfully reshape how federal prisoners challenge unlawful convictions and sentences. The court held that a key restriction Congress imposed on state habeas petitions does not apply to federal prisoners, and that federal prisoners may seek Supreme Court review when courts of appeals deny permission to file successive post-conviction motions. Together, the pair of holdings loosens a set of procedural choke points that have blocked many federal habeas claims from merits review even when the underlying law has shifted decisively in a prisoner’s favor. In practice, it means more prisoners will have the opportunity to secure post-conviction relief when new law is established that supports their claims, even after previously failed appeal bids.

The case emerged from Michael Bowe’s mandatory 10-year added sentence—on top of an initial 14-year sentence—under a federal firearms statute that applies only when a defendant commits a qualifying “crime of violence.” His predicate offenses were conspiracy and attempted Hobbs Act robbery. After Bowe was sentenced, the Supreme Court dismantled the legal basis for treating those crimes as violent. In 2019, the court followed with United States v. Davis, which struck down part of the “crimes of violence” statute as unconstitutionally vague. In 2022, the court followed with United States v. Taylor, holding that attempted robbery, as defined in the Hobbs Act, does not qualify under the remaining part of the statute. The 11th Circuit has also held that conspiracy does not qualify, either. If Bowe were sentenced today, his firearm enhancement would almost certainly disappear.

But post-conviction law does not move in straight lines. Federal prisoners typically get one opportunity to challenge their convictions or sentences. A second or successive motion is permitted only if the prisoner can show either newly discovered evidence establishing innocence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court. Statutory interpretation decisions, standing alone, do not open the gate.

That framework created a procedural trap for Bowe. After Davis, he sought relief arguing that his firearm conviction rested on an unconstitutional basis. The 11th Circuit rejected the claim because, at the time of his conviction, circuit precedent still treated attempted Hobbs Act robbery as a qualifying crime for a sentence enhancement even under Davis. Even if the portion of the statute struck down in Davis was an invalid reason for sentence enhancement, the court concluded, the conviction survived anyway under the separate portion of the statute. Then Taylor arrived and eliminated that fallback theory. When Bowe returned to court, the 11th Circuit blocked him again, this time on procedural grounds. His Davis claim had already been raised once in a prior motion and was therefore barred as an old claim. His Taylor argument could not open the door because it was statutory rather than constitutional. The sequencing of Supreme Court decisions left him trapped between two doors that would never open at the same time.

The Supreme Court granted review to resolve two questions that had divided the lower courts. First, the court addressed whether it had jurisdiction to review denials of authorization to file successive federal habeas motions. A provision of federal law bars Supreme Court review of authorization denials in state habeas cases. Several circuits had treated that bar as extending to federal prisoners as well. The court rejected that reading. The statute speaks in terms of state habeas “applications,” while federal prisoners file post-conviction “motions” under a different statute. Congress did not clearly withdraw the court’s jurisdiction over federal authorization decisions, and absent a clear statement, the court declined to read its own authority away. That holding restores a meaningful layer of appellate oversight in an area that had become largely insulated from review.

The decision reinforces the value of Supreme Court review itself in a corner of the legal system where access to any forum is often vanishingly thin. Post-conviction litigation frequently turns not on whether a claim has merit, but on whether any court remains available to hear it at all. When authorization denials become effectively unreviewable, legal error hardens into permanence by default. In a system built on layered review, preserving a path to Supreme Court review keeps open a forum of last resort in cases where liberty depends on whether the courthouse door has closed forever.

The second holding addressed the mechanism that had blocked Bowe’s claim. The statute that bars repeat claims applies, by its terms, only to second or successive habeas petitions filed by state prisoners under a specific section of the statute. Federal prisoners proceed under a different section, which contains its own gatekeeping rules. Some courts had imported the state-law old-claim bar into federal practice by assumption and policy reasoning. The Supreme Court refused to do so. Congress used different language in the two statutes for a reason. Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor confirmed that courts cannot graft additional restrictions onto the federal scheme simply because they think the result would be cleaner or more restrictive.

That correction matters because it removes the procedural device that trapped Bowe. Without the old-claim bar, federal prisoners are no longer automatically foreclosed from re-presenting claims that were previously rejected under legal assumptions the Supreme Court has since repudiated. Bowe may now again seek authorization to file a successive motion based on Davis, using Taylor to show that once the unconstitutional residual clause is removed, no valid predicate remains.

Importantly, though, the decision does not dismantle the draconian framework for seeking renewed appeal. Prisoners must still satisfy the strict requirements for successive motions. Statutes of limitations remain in force. Courts of appeals continue to screen habeas filings aggressively. While Bowe leaves unchanged the existence of barriers, it eliminates a uniquely arbitrary one that punished prisoners for the timing of legal change rather than the legality of their sentences.

More broadly, the case corrects a distortion in post-conviction law. Constitutional doctrine and statutory interpretation often evolve in stages. When procedural rules freeze prisoners at an intermediate moment in that evolution, legal error becomes permanent by accident of timing. Bowe restores coherence by allowing federal prisoners to return to court when later developments reveal that earlier denials rested on conclusions the Supreme Court has since rejected.

For Michael Bowe, the ruling offers another opportunity to challenge a decade of imprisonment that may no longer be legally justified. For the federal system and similarly situated prisoners, it reopens a path that had narrowed over time and ensures that procedural rules in federal post-conviction practice do not entrench legal error simply because the law evolved in stages.

I don’t know exactly what I should be doing right now, as a person who lives in the United States in 2026 and cares about others. But I know I’m falling short. I think about this often: When I’m sobbing over a news report about a toddler orphaned after his parents are swept up in an ICE raid, asking myself, “How are you helping, other than donating money here and there and sharing Instagram stories?” When I’m imagining what I’ll one day tell my children I did for the people who were scared and suffering back in 2026, when I’m reading a post that commands me to reject hopelessness and get involved in my community, I immediately start to hear my own excuses about work and kids and energy and time.

It feels awful to disappoint myself. What feels worse is my feeling that Renee Good, who was killed by a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis during a raid on Wednesday, was the kind of person I want to be, and as a result, she’s dead.

When I say she was the kind of person I want to be, I’m talking specifically about her presence at the scene of the immigration raid. The New York Post reported that she was involved with an “ICE Watch” group; though the tabloid claims that such groups “can turn confrontational,” their purpose is to help prevent immigrants from being suddenly swept into detention centers. It is exceedingly clear that Good was not threatening agents when she was shot. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR that Good was “anything but” a domestic terrorist, despite the claims of Trump administration officials who say she was interfering with the ICE agent’s work. Instead, he said, she was a “compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors.”

If that’s the case, it means she must have felt the same horror I feel when I see how so many people in this country are living through pain I can’t imagine—and then she did something. Instead of taking a break from the news, or fantasizing about leaving the county, or despairing over the world her kids will inherit (or who knows, maybe she did these things too!), maybe she thought, How can I help?

She didn’t have the power to change the outcome of the election, or change the minds of all the people who voted for this horrifying reality, or even to stop ICE from chasing down the people in her community, or to reunite kids with their parents. But she still showed up, to be the kind of person we all hope will be there if we’re having the worst day of our life. I imagine that, before she was killed, her presence was a comfort that showed that someone was watching and that someone cared.

“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known,” her mom told the Minnesota Star Tribune (she also disputed the idea that her daughter was involved in any kind of protest against ICE). “She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.” It is very easy to leave to others the job of showing up when people are in danger—the job of documenting and witnessing. Memes about how the world is terrible but being a mother is enough (evolutionary, even!) appear often in my Instagram feed. I understand why I’m seeing them. My algorithm is undoubtedly shaped by two kinds of content. The first: Reels about things like the way 3-year-olds yell at their parents for singing, and how 1-year-olds do gymnastics while breastfeeding. The second: Footage documenting the unspeakable suffering of kids in Gaza, stats about the number of people around the world who will face hunger or die as a result of this administration’s policies, and reporting on people in Latino neighborhoods in Chicago who form a walking school bus for kids whose parents are too afraid of ICE to leave the house. So I’m served content perfectly tailored to someone peeking out from the working-mom-with-two-little-kids trenches, looking around, and despairing over the world—until someone needs a snack or the potty or the kind of comfort I wish I could give to all the kids in the headlines.

These messages about how I’m doing my part by raising kind humans are always beautifully illustrated with whimsical drawings and pleasant fonts. I really do appreciate them and the comfort they bring to others. But these “You’re enough when you feed your child breakfast” messages just don’t resonate with me. Maybe it’s because my kids, while very sweet, are still young enough that they’d walk through an active crime scene to get to a veggie straw, so it’s just hard to picture them fixing the world. Maybe it’s because I think of myself as a decent person, but I wonder if I am really contributing if I raise people who are every bit as empathetic as I am, but I fail to give them the example of what to do with that empathy. Or maybe it’s because I know that plenty of women throughout history have had just as much on their plates as—and the same clichéd struggle to work and parent and shower—and still managed to try to make the world outside their homes better.

Women like Renee Good. She was the mother of three, including of a 6-year-old whom she dropped off at school Wednesday morning. Afterward, she could have filled her time with countless other things: laundry, a summer camp lottery, taking down holiday decorations, finding a lost glove. Or maybe she could have done something for herself: calling a friend, getting a haircut, or finally doing that 10 minute daily meditation or 25 minutes of weight-bearing exercise that are supposed to solve so many of our problems if we can squeeze them in. Instead, something brought her to a residential street in south Minneapolis where some of her neighbors were living through a nightmare and others were trying to help.

What I keep thinking about isn’t that she was killed even though she was a good person (many good people have been killed, and ICE isn’t supposed to kill bad people either!). I believe she was killed because she was a good person. Because she decided to be there. She’s gone now, her kids don’t have a mom, and the world is missing the kind of woman who found the time to go stand in the street and let her neighbors know they weren’t alone. She should still be alive. But because she’s not and I am, I hope I can honor her memory by being more like her.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which if officially BACK from hiatus and is ready to see if the news is now “good” again. [Checks out the ol’ news.] Ah well.

We may be a little rusty, so bear with us. This week, Donald Trump fantasized about which Western Hemisphere landmasses he can conquer next. Tim Walz can’t catch a break ever since he inserted himself into national politics. A solution for expired health care subsidies remains mired in the limbo of a dreaded Senate working group.

And while we were hoping to lead with a “fun one” in this return edition, that wasn’t in the cards.

On Wednesday in Minnesota, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was in her car, perpendicular to traffic, during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis. An agent approached her and demanded she get out of the car. As that officer began trying to open her door, another approached from the other side. Good tried to drive away, turning her wheels right to avoid the officer who had approached from the other side. As the officer tried to get out of the way, he fired multiple shots from feet away and killed Good. We can’t predict how a court of law would judge the officer’s self-defense argument. But the naked eye tells that this was an overuse of force.

This administration, though, can’t afford you believing the naked eye. It has a lot riding on ICE. Anti-immigrant zealot Stephen Miller, who runs White House policy—or, really, just runs the White House—pushed with all of his might to secure a mammoth expansion of ICE capacity and personnel in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A supersized ICE is Miller’s tool to implement mass deportations. And so, a scandal in which an ICE officer unnecessarily shoots someone in the face, which could threaten public support for Miller’s grand ICE project, is not something the administration can afford.

This is why the administration went from zero to she was a terrorist in about 10 seconds. Miller described Good’s driving as “domestic terrorism,” intended to run over officers, a line echoed by the Department of Homeland Security’s spokesperson and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem herself. Vice President J.D. Vance performed a hammy scolding of the media for daring to question the officer’s actions during Thursday’s White House press briefing. The response was quick and well over-the-top. It was high-stakes crisis communications to protect Miller’s dream for America.

Feeling his imperialist oats after having kidnapped a head of state so that he could take the country’s natural resources, Trump has once again turned his attention to Greenland, a large ice sheet controlled by the Kingdom of Denmark that Trump wants to annex because it looks really big on a distorted map. Trump reiterated early in the week that “we need Greenland” and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, observed that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option” that Trump could use to secure it. Our good friend Stephen Miller, meanwhile, gave a characteristically unhinged interview, saying that the U.S. has a right to take Greenland because “we live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Buddy, this is CNN, not an Xbox headset.

At least there’s been reasonable pushback, with European leaders formally condemning the saber-rattling and observing that an attack on Greenland would mean the end of NATO (perhaps a feature, for elements of Trump’s administration). Senate Republicans, by Senate Republican standards, have also been forceful in their rejection of the idea. One possible defense of what Trump’s doing, though, is making threats as a means of getting Denmark to put Greenland up for sale. Can we observe, before the savvy negotiator spin takes hold, that purchasing Greenland would also be absurd? It could cost in the trillions at a time when the federal budget is calamitous, higher interest rates and inflation have returned, and there are better things—really, anything else—to spend trillions of dollars on. There are real national security interests and economic interests involved in Greenland. The way to manage that is not to conquer the island but to reach an agreement with Denmark, which was our friend up until about 10 minutes ago.

The Minnesota governor used to have a nice life. He put a solid 12 years into the House of Representatives then cruised to a comfy couple of terms as governor. Then, in 2024, he had to have the dotty idea to throw himself into contention for the vice presidency. Not good! It’s not just that he’ll forever be associated with a catastrophic presidential race for Democrats. It’s that the scrutiny returned home with him when he returned to Minnesota.

Walz withdrew his bid for a third gubernatorial campaign this week amid various social services fraud scandals in the state that have drawn national media attention and a federal probe from the Trump administration. (Fortunately for Minnesota Democrats nervous about scandals engulfing the party in the midterms, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who always puts up strong margins in statewide races, may swoop into the governor’s race.) That decision hardly allows Walz to slink away from the spotlight, though, as now Minnesota is embroiled in an escalating standoff with the administration over ICE. His peace and quiet are another long year away.

As the Surge wrote in a separate piece this week, the long-standing battle between interventionist Sen. Lindsey Graham and isolationist Sen. Rand Paul for Trump’s heart and mind took a dramatic turn in Graham’s favor when Trump sent the military into Venezuela to abduct its leader. Graham was waltzing around the Capitol with a grin on his face all week as if he had won the 250-year chess match of American politics once and for all. He even went out of his way to neener-neener Rand Paul, who was rather upset by the president’s interventionist turn, on social media.

Paul did have one move up his sleeve, though. He, along with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, forced a vote on a war powers resolution that would block the president from further military action in Venezuela barring congressional approval. The measure, somewhat surprisingly, advanced on a procedural vote on Thursday as five Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting it. This infuriated Trump, who said that those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Graham, meanwhile, said that he would try to convene a meeting of the Senate GOP “regarding Democrats’ efforts to restrict President Trump’s authority as Commander in Chief under the War Powers Act” concerning “the constitutional effect of the War Powers Act and the damage it will do to our national security.” Graham has had just about enough of Congress, the Article I branch of government to which Graham belongs, having a say in foreign policy.

Last year, Sen. Mark Kelly joined a handful of other Democrats in Congress in a video telling members of the military that they can refuse illegal orders. The administration took that personally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened Kelly’s retirement rank and pension for having the … the … the nerve to suggest that anyone could refuse to obey his illegal orders, calling it “seditious.” Earlier this week, then, Hegseth followed up and posted that the department had, in fact, “initiated retirement grade determination proceedings.” Most delightful, though, was his “letter of censure” to Kelly listing a bevy of offenses (various criticisms of the Trump administration) that disgraced the military. The censure letter, bless its heart, includes the line, “I hereby formally CENSURE you.” It’s a light and airy read.

The letter is more than a window into the Trump administration’s deep and dangerous insecurities. Mark Kelly was nearly selected to be Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election and, having dodged that bullet, must maintain some presidential ambitions. His flaw has always been that he’s a bit dry, though. So what better way to elevate his profile and spice up his credentials ahead of a Democratic presidential primary than a letter of censure (CENSURE) from the try-hard fitness instructor running the Pentagon?

With Nick Maduro sitting in the clink in Brooklyn, who’s going to run Venezuela? (Under the watchful eye of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, of course). The administration’s plan, at least for now, is to leave the existing Chavista regime in place under Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, so long as she does everything the United States wants. When Trump was asked early in the weak why he wouldn’t push to install the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, instead, he said that while “she’s a very nice woman,” she “doesn’t have the support within, or the respect within, the country.”

The administration’s overriding interest is in restructuring Venezuela as a colony, not making it a democracy, and the CIA determined that replacing the existing regime right now would be more trouble than it’s worth. But it didn’t break Trump’s heart to deny Machado control of the country. Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year after Trump had campaigned for it. The Washington Post, citing sources close to Trump, reported that this effectively killed her chances of running Venezuela after Maduro’s ouster. “If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ ” one source said, “she’d be the president of Venezuela today.” Trump and Machado are nevertheless expected to meet soon, and Machado has said she would be willing to present her prize to Trump to express her gratitude. Trump liked the sound of that and said it would be a “great honor” to accept it. The world could not be more odd right now.

On Thursday, 17 House Republicans joined all Democrats to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for another three years. This vote was made possible through use of a discharge petition, through which a majority of members can force a vote on a bill against House leadership’s wishes, and allows vulnerable Republican members to at least say that they tried. And while this particular bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, it does put pressure on Senate Republicans to address rising premiums in some way—or absorb the political blowback from failing to.

So what is Senate Majority Leader John Thune to do? The Senate has convened bipartisan working group trying to develop an extension that tightens subsidy eligibility. One of the stickiest points, as ever with ACA subsidies, is abortion. Republicans want more stringent Hyde Amendment protections in ACA plans to ensure that federal dollars would never even consider comingling with payments for abortion services. How does this get resolved? Perhaps with some browbeating from Trump. “You have to be a little flexible on Hyde, you know that,” Trump told House Republicans at a gathering this week. We’re not sure they know that at all.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It may finally be time to take AI on the iPhone siri-ously. Apple and Google on Monday announced a multi-year partnership that will see Apple Foundation Models standing on the shoulders of Google Gemini models, one that will return a small portion of the roughly $20 billion Google pays annually to be Apple&#39;s default search provider.

Terms of the tie-up have not been disclosed, but Bloomberg previously reported that Apple was planning to pay about $1 billion per year to utilize Google&#39;s AI technology.

&quot;After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google&#39;s AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users,&quot; the two companies said in a joint statement. &quot;Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple&#39;s industry-leading privacy standards.&quot;

Apple&#39;s home-grown machine learning, despite some effort to show off rather than hide behind the usual secrecy, has been beset by unkept promises and staff departures. An updated Gemini-flavored version of Apple Intelligence is expected to debut later this year.

The deal looks like a setback for OpenAI, brought in to buttress Siri in 2024 with support for ChatGPT as a Siri extension. Last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly declared a &quot;Code Red&quot; to signal the urgency of responding to improvements in Google&#39;s Gemini model family.

Apple, in theory, has some strong cards to play in the AI game, specifically hardware suited for running local models and its public commitment to privacy, which like security has been something of an afterthought among commercial AI model makers.

Apple&#39;s Private Cloud Compute system for handling AI queries in a way that protects private data proved compelling enough that Google announced a similar scheme dubbed Private AI Compute more than a year later.

That might mean more if customers demanded AI device integration, but so far interest in AI hardware has been tepid. AI PCs are not exactly flying off the shelves and Dell reportedly downplayed AI features at CES 2026.

Part of the issue is that, while local models may eventually be a thing, the trade-offs required for on-device inference, particularly on mobile devices, keep people looking to cloud-based AI services for the time being.

Demand for AI on mobile devices is further complicated by public disinterest in AI phone features. A survey of 2,000 smartphone users in late 2024 found that 73 percent of iPhone customers and 87 percent of Samsung customers said AI added little or no value to their devices.

Samsung, for its part, appears to be pushing back on that narrative by noting that people don&#39;t recognize how much they already use AI-powered functions on their phones. A Samsung survey of 2,000 adults conducted by Talker Research found that 90 percent of Americans use AI on mobile devices. But only 38 percent of respondents recognize how many device features have AI elements, such as weather alerts, call screening, autocorrect, voice assistants, auto brightness, and photo editing features.

By the time Apple rewires Siri to work with Gemini, maybe the company will have figured out how AI can add value for customers in a way they recognize and appreciate. ®

            <h2>Nvidia, Eli Lilly just say yes to making drugs together, using Vera Rubin GPUs</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/nvidia_eli_lilly_ai_drug_lab/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nvidia has teamed up with pharmaceutical heavyweight Eli Lilly to plow up to $1 billion into a research lab over the next five years to advance the development of foundation models for AI-assisted drug discovery.

Announced at the JPMorgan Healthcare conference on Monday, the collaboration will span the infrastructure, talent, and compute necessary to develop these biology and chemistry models using Nvidia&#39;s BioNeMo software platform and Vera Rubin accelerators.

Introduced in fall 2022, just months before ChatGPT kicked off the AI arms race, BioNeMo is an open source framework for building and training deep learning models for use in drug discovery.

Located in the San Francisco Bay Area, the so-called co-innovation lab will bring together Eli Lilly&#39;s top biologists and chemists to work alongside Nvidia&#39;s software engineers and model devs, when it opens later this year.

&quot;Combining our volumes of data and scientific knowledge with Nvidia&#39;s computational power and model-building expertise could reinvent drug discovery as we know it,&quot; Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said in a canned statement.

Once operational, Nvidia says the lab&#39;s first order of business will be to create a &quot;continuous learning system that tightly connects Lilly&#39;s agentic wet labs with computational dry labs.&quot; The GPU slinger claims that this will enable &quot;24/7 experimentation.&quot;

We&#39;ve reached out to Nvidia to ask what that actually means, but reading between the lines, it sounds like the teams will be building the equivalent of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for AI-assisted drug research. The idea is that, when the scientists go home for the evening, the compute resources can go to work preparing for the next day&#39;s experiments.

From there, the two companies will harness Nvidia&#39;s newly unveiled Vera Rubin compute platform. Announced at CES last week, the system promises a fivefold increase in performance over Nvidia&#39;s prior-gen Blackwell GPUs. These chips will provide the computational grunt necessary to train new foundation models based on the lab&#39;s research.

This suggests the lab will be among the first to get its hands on the chips, which aren&#39;t expected to be available in any significant numbers until the second half of this year.

In the meantime, it&#39;s not like Eli Lilly is hurting for compute. At GTC DC last October, the pharmaceutical giant revealed it had deployed a Blackwell Ultra-based SuperPOD complete with 1,016 B300 GPUs to support its exploration into computational biology and chemistry.

The lab&#39;s sole focus won&#39;t be limited to AI drug discovery, however. Researchers will also explore applications for AI in clinical development, manufacturing, and commercial operations.

For example, Eli Lilly is also investigating Nvidia&#39;s Omniverse Robotics platforms as a means to optimize its manufacturing plants and increase production of high-demand drugs. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Memory shortages will likely stunt PC shipments in 2026, as available supplies will not be able to meet demand thanks to memory makers chasing the lucrative AI infrastructure market instead.

Overall PC market performance in 2025 was healthy, according to research biz Omdia, but it notes that memory and storage supply was already tightening, with associated upward price pressure emerging around the middle of last year.

By December, PC vendors were signaling their expectations of price increases, and this is dampening expectations for the volume of shipments during 2026.

&quot;Between Q1 and Q4 2025, mainstream PC memory and storage costs rose by 40 percent to 70 percent, resulting in cost increases being passed through to customers,&quot; said Omdia Principal Analyst Ben Yeh.

As The Register recently reported, shortages are being caused by the memory chip manufacturers reallocating manufacturing capacity to output more of the high-margin server DRAM and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips instead of mainstream DDR. Those components are in high demand to kit out AI servers and the accelerators needed for the AI investment boom.

PC makers such as Dell and Lenovo were also warning in December of &quot;unprecedented cost increases&quot; that meant they were planning to up the price tags on their products. The alternative is to ship configurations with less memory, which risks disappointing buyers who may find that their PC&#39;s performance doesn&#39;t match expectations.

&quot;Given tight 2026 supply, the industry is emphasizing high-end SKUs and leaner mid- to low-tier configurations to protect margins,&quot; Yeh added.

But with memory supplies unable to meet demand, something will have to give.

&quot;Actual shipment performance will hinge on vendors&#39; memory and storage procurement and negotiating leverage; beyond scale, their track records and credibility with suppliers will be a decisive factor in determining their success in navigating this period of complexity,&quot; Yeh said.

If we&#39;re reading that right, it means there is going to be stiff competition between the PC makers for whatever memory is available, and that typically means those prepared to pay the most are likely to win, again pushing up prices.

As a result, Taiwanese market watcher TrendForce has reduced its global projection for laptop shipments in 2026 to indicate a 5.4 percent decrease compared with 2025, making for an estimated 173 million units in total.

This could have an impact on Windows 11 uptake, as the platform is more demanding than the previous version, Windows 10, and buyers may be put off trading in their old laptop by the high cost of a replacement system. Windows 11 has not significantly increased its market share over the older version since support for it ended in October.

Typically, when memory prices start rising as demand is outstripping supply, the chip manufacturers increase production to capitalize on it. The upshot is that prices fall again, and there may eventually be a glut of memory chips – the so-called boom-bust cycle.

However, analysts think this is this unlikely to happen this time.

Despite this crunch, a November 2025 poll by Omdia of B2B channel vendors found that 57 percent were still forecasting growth during 2026. Optimism reigns supreme.

Last year, Lenovo was the top PC vendor in terms of shipments, accounting for just over a quarter of the market. HP was second, with just over 20 percent, while Dell made up 15 percent, Apple just under 10 percent, and Asus 7.2 percent. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Windows activation is a tricky thing, particularly for digital signage that should be directing customers to in-store bargains but instead shows passersby that someone has yet to give Microsoft their pound of flesh.

Today&#39;s bork was spotted by a Register reader in Virginia&#39;s Danville Mall. The screen is affixed to a wall, but whatever&#39;s driving it is having a very bad day indeed.

Judging by the taskbar and the old-school buttons, this is an older iteration of Windows, and the activation notification carries a distinct whiff of something unsupported.

Windows activation warnings tend to appear after installing the operating system or after changing specific components. A hardware-based hash is generated, and if that hash changes too much, Windows starts bleating about activation.

In the past, it was possible to activate Windows by telephone. Indeed, back in the days of XP and its ilk, there was no guarantee that a device would be connected to the internet. One of the brains behind Windows activation (in its earlier incarnations), former Microsoft engineer Dave Plummer, told us that having a user key in numbers using a telephone keypad presented problems of its own. &quot;Phone activation,&quot; he said, &quot;is always going to limit the amount of information that can go back and forth and so will always be an attack vector and likely the easiest one for hackers to target.&quot;

Today, things have changed. Microsoft has retired the telephone procedure and now directs users to its Product Activation Portal.

For whoever is running the Danville screen, a click on the activation message and a visit to Microsoft&#39;s portal should do the trick. With luck, there is a screen in an office somewhere with the same message being shown to a tired IT professional. Otherwise, having to climb a ladder to stop Windows from complaining about activation feels a step too far. Perhaps a return to simpler signage is required before a harassed techie ends up breaking a bone or two for the sake of Windows activation. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The number of organizations that have implemented methods for identifying security risks in the AI tools they use has almost doubled in the space of a year.

Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of all business leaders who participated in the World Economic Forum&#39;s (WEF) Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2026 said that they assessed AI tools&#39; security risks before deploying them.

The finding represents a steep rise compared with last year&#39;s 37 percent figure, and underlines how much of a priority AI security has become for organizations worldwide.

Nearly all respondents (94 percent) said that AI will be the most significant driver of cybersecurity change in 2026, and 87 percent believe that the associated vulnerabilities have increased – more than any other type of threat.

It&#39;s true that The Reg was busy last year covering AI vulnerabilities. Prompt injections were the main culprits – there were lots of them – while AI code assistants were seen making expert devs worse, and in December, Google was called in to fix the security issues created by Gemini.

The WEF&#39;s findings, published a week before its annual Davos meeting, offer a more positive view on the state of AI security across the world than the show of hands suggested at the NCSC&#39;s annual conference in May.

In a room full of roughly 200 security professionals, not a single one could claim that they had a strong grasp of the security of their organization&#39;s AI systems.

For leaders, the most common fear concerning AI right now is data leaks, the WEF survey noted. Coming in just behind is the advancement of adversarial capabilities, which makes sense given that the report also found that geopolitically motivated attacks were the most common feature of leaders&#39; risk strategies.

Sixty-four percent of organizations reported that geopolitical matters played the biggest role in shaping their cyber risk strategies, topping the list for consecutive years.

Geopolitics was far more of a concern for larger organizations, those with more than 100,000 employees, with 91 percent reporting that their security plans changed as a result, compared to just 59 percent for those with fewer than 1,000 staffers.

Gartner reached similar conclusions after surveying European CIOs and other IT leaders in 2025, finding that many were considering opting for a local cloud provider as data sovereignty fears escalate.

Geopolitics most commonly influences cybersecurity and cybercrime when it comes to the conflicts between major adversaries.

It is not uncommon for UK or US organizations to be pelted with DDoS attacks from Russian cyber troublemakers, for example.

Russia also has a history of targeting major sporting events, so organizations in the US may be preparing for politically-motivated cyberattacks later this year, as the world&#39;s eyes will be on the FIFA World Cup this summer.

For CEOs, however, the threat from hacktivists is not even on their radars. Cyber-enabled fraud, such as phishing and social engineering, is the number-one concern, followed by AI vulnerabilities and exploits of software flaws.

Ransomware was the chief worry of 2025, and supply chain disruptions were third on the list last year, but both dropped out of the top three in 2026.

Ransomware remains the prime fear for CISOs, though. Both ransomware and supply chain attacks remain at ranks one and two, respectively, in security chiefs&#39; lists of nightmares.

The key to preventing the worst outcomes is for all organizations to pursue a heightened state of cyber resilience.

&quot;Cyber resilience&quot; is a phrase that&#39;s repeated time and again by national security authorities for a good reason. It refers to an organization&#39;s ability to minimize the impact of a cyberattack, should one penetrate its systems.

The majority of respondents to the WEF&#39;s survey (64 percent) claimed that they met the minimum requirements for cyber resilience, while only 19 percent believed that they are exceeding those baseline standards.

Major attacks, such as those on JLR and M&S, high-profile events that led to extensive and costly periods of downtime for both businesses, illustrate the issues with minimizing cyberattacks that organizations continue to face. ®

            <h2>Don’t bother with the retailer’s website, says Google: Gemini can shop for you</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/google_gemini_agentic_ai_shopping_protocol/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google is aiming to turn Gemini into a one-stop personal shopper with what it hopes will become a global standard for agentic AI commerce, and it&#39;s already persuaded major retailers to let Google handle transactions without sending users to their websites.

Google announced a new Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) on Sunday, alongside some other agentic AI shopping features, that it said is designed to act as &quot;a common language for agents and systems to operate together across consumer surfaces, businesses and payment providers.&quot;

What that essentially means, Google explained, is that agents won&#39;t need unique connectors in order to facilitate digital transactions, so Gemini&#39;s end-user shopping agents should communicate with other agentic AI more easily. It&#39;s yet another agentic AI protocol from Google, and the company says it&#39;s compatible with its other AI protocols, including Agent2Agent, the Agent Payments Protocol, and the Model Context Protocol.

In practice, that means online shoppers buying through retailers that opt to support UCP will soon be able to use a forthcoming checkout feature in AI Mode in Search and the standalone Gemini app, &quot;allowing shoppers to check out from eligible U.S. retailers right as they&#39;re researching on Google,&quot; the Chocolate Factory explained.

Speaking to the US National Retail Federation over the weekend, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made it clear what the game is all about: Google is tired of just being the highway on which most of the internet travels to ecommerce outlets and it wants in.

&quot;Looking at retailers alone, we were processing 8.3 trillion tokens on our API in December 2024. A year later, we were processing over 90 trillion tokens,&quot; Pichai said. The natural evolution of that increase, he continued, is a highway one never has to leave in order to make purchases.

&quot;Our goal is to build a future of retail where the opportunity space expands for everyone,&quot; the Google boss said before getting to the heart of the matter. &quot;One where customers can use Google products they love as part of a seamless shopping experience.&quot;

Surprisingly enough, and in contrast to other websites that have suffered as Google has gobbled up their content to keep visitors inside its ecosystem, major retailers are at least willing to let Big G handle more of the shopping experience through Google&#39;s own surfaces, rather than insisting every click end at their virtual storefronts.

According to the company, UCP was developed with input from major retailers including Shopify, Target, Walmart, and Wayfair, and is supported by major payment networks such as Mastercard, American Express, and Visa, with PayPal checkout slated to arrive &quot;soon.&quot;

Google has even somehow managed to convince customers like hardware chain Lowe&#39;s, craft store Michaels, Reebok, and others to begin using its AI Business Agent, also announced on Sunday, which allows users to &quot;chat with brands, right on Search.&quot; More advanced features - including training the agent on a retailer&#39;s own data - won&#39;t arrive until &quot;the coming months,&quot; according to the company.

As Google is &quot;continuing to test ads in AI Mode,&quot; it&#39;s also working with retailers to embed user-specific discounts, dubbed &quot;Direct Offers,&quot; into its never-leave-Google AI shopping ecosystem, delivering sales to &quot;shoppers who are ready to buy&quot; to help them close sales.

Whether or not the rest of the retail world will be thrilled with another Google strategy to keep users away from their websites is anything but certain. If retailers react in a similar manner to publishers, they&#39;re likely to be unhappy, though reducing website overhead by offloading shopping to a Google AI may be beneficial, provided they&#39;re willing to agree to Google&#39;s terms.

Of course, Google is also likely making the move to better compete with companies like OpenAI and Perplexity, both of whom have made inroads into AI-based online shopping - can&#39;t lose that slice of the pie, after all.

We reached out to Google to learn more about its new AI agent ecommerce strategy, including whether it&#39;d be charging companies whose sales are processed via Gemini, but didn&#39;t hear back. ®

If you’re planning on traveling at all this year, the Baseus EnerCore CG11 Universal Travel Adapter is worth a look. The adapter can power up to six devices at once, and now through the end of today, January 12th, it’s on sale for just $34.19 (about $36 off) at Amazon, matching the all-time low price we last saw at the end of November.

Baseus’ handy wall adapter supports four different plug types so you can use it in more than 200 countries, including the US, UK, much of Europe, Australia, India, and South Africa. Instead of requiring you to pack a separate cable, it also includes a built-in USB-C cable that extends up to 27 inches. The braided cord can deliver up to 70W of power and retracts into the adapter, too, making it easy to carry.

In addition to the aforementioned built-in cable, the EnerCore CG11 features three USB ports on the bottom: one USB-C port that delivers up to 60W, a USB-A port that delivers up to 60W, and a USB-A port that delivers up to 5W. That means you can charge your phone, tablet, camera, tablet, earbuds, and even a laptop — albeit slowly — without having to carry multiple chargers with you while you travel.

Despite its versatility, the adapter weighs about half a pound and can fit in the palm of your hand, so it won’t add a ton of unnecessary bulk to your backpack or luggage. You can even take it on a cruise, as it doesn’t include surge protection, a feature that’s often banned on cruise ships.

Creating non-consensual intimate deepfake images will be a criminal offense, and platforms will have to take ‘proactive action’ to stop it.

The UK is bringing a law into force that makes creating non-consensual intimate deepfake images, like the ones that have proliferated on X because of the Grok AI chatbot, a criminal offense, as reported by the BBC.

“The Data Act, passed last year, made it a criminal offence to create – or request the creation of – non-consensual intimate images,” according to a statement from Liz Kendall, the UK’s Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology. “And today, I can announce to the House that this offence will be brought into force this week and that I will make it a priority offence in the Online Safety Act too.” As a priority offense, “services have to take proactive action to stop this content from appearing in the first place.”

Ofcom, which regulates communications industries in the UK, announced earlier today that it is formally investigating X over Grok’s deepfakes. Should Ofcom find X in violation of the Online Safety Act, it could require the platform to take certain steps to comply and impose fines of “up to £18 million or 10% of qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is greater.”

“The government expects Ofcom to set out a timeline for the investigation as soon as possible,” Kendall says. “The public – and most importantly, the victims of Grok’s activities – expect swift and decisive action. So this must not take months and months.”

xAI didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. On January 3rd, X said, “We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary. Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”

Last week, X also placed some limits on the ability to generate an image using Grok, making tagging the chatbot in a reply to generate an image publicly a feature just for paying subscribers. However, The Verge found there were still free ways to use Grok to edit and create images, including sexualized ones.

            <div id="article-text">One Last Adventure is about as far as you can get from ‘conformity gate.’ But at least you can see Vecna in headphones.

One Last Adventure is about as far as you can get from ‘conformity gate.’ But at least you can see Vecna in headphones.

It’s a weird time in the Stranger Things community. Following a monthslong lead-up to a finale that was so big it screened in theaters, the show’s superfans have been spending their time dissecting the fifth season in order to prove that a hidden ninth episode is coming that represents the true ending of Stranger Things. So far that hasn’t happened — but that doesn’t mean Netflix is done with the series. The streamer just released One Last Adventure: The Making of Stranger Things 5, a two hour-long documentary about, well, the making of season 5. And while it’s far removed from a secret episode and provides little in the way of new conspiracy fodder, it does provide some insights into how the creative team wrapped up Netflix’s biggest show.

My biggest takeaway from watching One Last Adventure is the sheer scale of the final season. Obviously Netflix was going to go big here, but even still it’s impressive to see; the Duffer brothers used 12 stages for filming, including a backlot where the team built downtown Hawkins, and that’s in addition to scenes filmed on location. It’s especially cool seeing some of the craftspeople work on the bigger set pieces, like building and painting the massive, pulsing tendrils that make up Vecna’s lair, or figuring out how exactly to design an office building that is also melting while characters move through it. There are a number of sequences in the doc where the crew stress over just how they’re going to pull off the ideas the Duffers have.

My second biggest takeaway: this season came together on the fly. Despite being in the works for so long — there are shots of table reads dating back to 2023 — the final episode was actually being filmed while the script was still being written. The reason, it seems, is because of the pressure of wrapping up Stranger Things. “There’s always a sense of panic that it’s not going to come together,” Ross Duffer explains early on in the doc. There are a few moments where you can see the writers struggling with what to do. For example, one of the reasons the abyss in the finale is largely devoid of creatures is because the team worried about “demogorgon fatigue.” They also intensely debated how to approach Eleven’s faith in the last episode. “You have to keep toying with the audience,” Ross says, in reference to whether or not El will live.

Aside from that, there isn’t much in the way of revelations, but One Last Adventure does have some fun details. The Duffers hired their own high school drama teacher to play the Hawkins High School principal, and a lot of thought went into how much blood Karen Wheeler needed to lose in her fateful fight with a demogorgon. Even better, there’s a shot of Vecna wearing over-ear headphones that has the potential to be a new meme template, albeit maybe not as much as the time he had an iced coffee.

So yeah, this documentary isn’t the return to Hawkins that many were hoping for, and it’s a pretty standard look behind the scenes of a major production. But it’s also a welcome change of pace: in the age of streaming, behind-the-scenes featurettes have dwindled alongside the physical media that used to house them. So in that way, much like Stranger Things itself, One Last Adventure is a bit of a throwback — and one I hope Netflix leans into more as it pushes into its post-Hawkins future.

            <div id="article-text">The new feature debuted today in research preview.

The new feature debuted today in research preview.

Anthropic wants to expand Claude’s AI agent capabilities and take advantage of the growing hype around Claude Code — and it’s doing it with a brand-new feature released Monday, dubbed “Claude Cowork.”

“Cowork can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post. The company is releasing it as a “research preview” so the team can learn more about how people use it and continue building accordingly. So far, Cowork is only available via Claude’s macOS app, and only for subscribers of Anthropic’s power-user tier, Claude Max, which costs $100 to $200 per month depending on usage.

Here’s how Claude Cowork works: A user gives Claude access to a folder on their computer, allowing the chatbot to read, edit, or create files. (Examples Anthropic gave included the ability fo “re-organize your downloads by sorting and renaming each file, create a new spreadsheet with a list of expenses from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft of a report from your scattered notes.”) Claude will provide regular updates on what it’s working on, and users can also use existing connectors to link it to external info (like Asana, Notion, PayPal, and other supported partners) or link it to Claude in Chrome for browser-related tasks.

“You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,” Anthropic wrote. “Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel. It feels much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker.”

The new feature is part of Anthropic’s (and its competitors’) bid to provide the most actually useful AI agents, both for consumers and enterprise. AI agents have come a long way from their humble beginnings as mostly-theoretically-useful tools, but there’s still much more development needed before you’ll see your non-tech-industry friends using them to complete everyday tasks.

Anthropic’s “Skills for Claude,” announced in October, was a partial precursor to Cowork. Starting in October, Claude could improve at personalized tasks and jobs, by way of “folders that include instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude can load when needed to make it smarter at specific work tasks — from working with Excel [to] following your organization’s brand guidelines,” per a release at the time. People could also build their own Skills for Claude relative to their specific jobs and tasks they needed to be completed.

As part of the announcement, Anthropic warned about the potential dangers of using Cowork and other AI agent tools, namely the fact that if instructions aren’t clear, Claude does have the ability to delete local files and take other “potentially destructive actions” — and that with prompt injection attacks, there are a range of potential safety concerns. Prompt injection attacks often involve bad actors hiding malicious text in a website that the model is referencing, which instructs the model to bypass its safeguards and do something harmful, such as hand over personal data. “Agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude’s real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry,” Anthropic wrote.

Claude Max subscribers try out the new feature by clicking on “Cowork” in the sidebar of the macOS app. Other users can join the waitlist.

            <div id="article-text">Gov. Kathy Hochul made new requirements meant to protect kids online a centerpiece of her plan for state policy.

Gov. Kathy Hochul made new requirements meant to protect kids online a centerpiece of her plan for state policy.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is making kids’ online safety a cornerstone of her administration, and she’s eyeing a platform that has often flown under the radar: Roblox.

As progress in Congress has stagnated, states have become the primary drivers of internet reforms meant to protect kids, including age verification laws and new requirements for online platforms. Hochul announced a sweeping plan to expand online parental controls and age verification, which she’ll tout at her State of the State on Tuesday. It notably pulls from a piece of legislation crafted by state Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Nily Rozic meant to plug a gap in earlier state legislation in order to encompass online gaming. Gounardes told The Verge in a 2024 interview when he first introduced the legislation as the New York Children’s Online Safety Act (NYCOSA) — now the Stop Online Predators Act — that the idea came from parents who wondered whether his earlier kids safety legislation would cover Roblox, the social gaming platform that is extremely popular with children.

Drawing from the bill, Hochul’s plans include expanding requirements for platforms to verify their users’ ages to include online gaming platforms like Roblox. She also wants platforms to keep kids’ accounts on the highest privacy settings by default so that they can’t be seen or contacted by unknown accounts, and to disable AI chatbot features for kids. The plan also includes requirements for parents to be able to limit financial transactions on their kids’ accounts.

“There’s no reason platforms like Roblox should be different”

New York state leaders don’t want Roblox, for which more than 40 percent of users are reportedly under age 13, to be left out of new protections. “From toys to food to cars, we regulate all sorts of products to keep children safe. There’s no reason platforms like Roblox should be different,” Gounardes said in a statement ahead of the State of the State. “Online platforms like Roblox are enabling unsafe environments for children, including allowing predators to send explicit messages to children,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “We urgently need to pass crucial online safety protections to stop predators from exploiting children and create safer online environments for children to play.”

Roblox did not immediately provide comment on the State of the State proposal, but Roblox spokesperson Eric Porterfield told The Verge after Gounardes unveiled the legislation in 2024 that the company is a “COPPA compliant gaming platform that is designed for all ages,” referring to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). Porterfield said Roblox has “gone beyond COPPA-compliance and built safety tools and systems that address the unique needs of children and do not support photo uploads or other features specific to social media platforms.” The company has since rolled out new requirements for users to undergo a facial scan to estimate their age in order to access its chat features.

States have been at the forefront of such discussions as Congress has largely failed to pass new protections

The kids online safety proposals were the first of the State of the State plans that Hochul previewed last week, underscoring how important an issue that internet safeguards for kids has become in states like New York. States have been at the forefront of such discussions as Congress has largely failed to pass new protections since the 1990s. The proposals come alongside offline actions to address kids’ mental health, including expanded mental health clinics in schools, and an advisory board that includes 11-to-17-year-olds to inform youth mental health policy. They build on earlier legislation passed in New York state, including the Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) For Kids Act, which requires social media companies to obtain parental consent for using “addictive feeds” on kids.

But some of the proposals, like age verification, come with their own risks that opponents ranging from industry players to civil liberties groups oppose on the grounds that they could require more data collection, and potentially chill adults’ speech online. The Supreme Court recently opened the door to some age verification of porn sites, breaking from earlier decisions, but age-gating platforms that host a wide variety of speech raises even thornier questions. Courts across the country have struck down a variety of laws seeking to impose age verification at the platform and app store level, raising questions of constitutionality under the First Amendment. But states have continued to try to enact different kinds of age verification laws nonetheless, creating the potential for a fractured landscape state to state should some courts eventually uphold them.

Still, many advocates for more online safeguards are praising Hochul’s plans. “The online games kids play and the social media platforms they use for hours and hours a day have become veritable hunting grounds for predators,” Common Sense Media CEO Jim Steyer said in a statement. “Kids and teens need these new protections now more than ever.”

The Nintendo Switch 2 can be enjoyed right out of the box, but it’s even better with the right accessories. Some of these add-ons are more crucial than others, especially if you’re deciding what to buy early on. For example, a case and a screen protector can keep your console safe from scuffs, scratches, and drops, so both are what I’d consider to be essential. If you’re not a fan of how the Joy-Con 2 feel to use, a cheap but good wireless controller wouldn’t hurt, either.

On the other hand, a microSD Express card lets you add even more digital games to your library, although the console’s somewhat generous 256GB of internal storage means you may not need one right away (unless you buy a lot of games that are 50-70GB each, such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Madden 26). Some other accessories don’t add enough to the gaming experience to justify the cost. Those Joy-Con 2 steering wheel accessories? You can pass on those.

The Switch 2 and its games are expensive enough, so we’ve assembled this guide with picks that are a great value. You don’t need to spend hundreds on accessories — many of us at The Verge certainly aren’t. No matter your budget, we’ve included numerous categories, beginning with a starter kit of recommendations we think everyone should consider.

Our list of the best Switch 2 controllers is always evolving. It started with just a few alternatives to Nintendo’s great, yet imperfect Switch 2 Pro controller that costs $90. Now it’s full of options covering a range of budgets. There’s one thing that ties all of the candidates together: they have better internal hardware than the Switch 2 Pro. At a bare minimum, you’ll get a gamepad that has Hall effect or TMR joysticks that won’t eventually develop stick drift. There are also options that offer features that let you play exactly how you want, with add-on rear paddles, triggers with customizable pull distances, swappable face buttons, and more.

Currently, the best wireless controller for most Switch 2 gamers is the EasySMX S10. It offers comfort, great-feeling rumble, it includes a floating eight-way direction pad, and has support for motion controls and amiibo. It’s the total package, but I have minor complaints. The home, GameChat, and screenshot buttons are placed awkwardly, and not everyone will dig the design or the gritty texture on the grips.

It’s technically not a controller, but I’m a broken record when it comes to recommending 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2 for households already with more than one console. In the case that you have an Xbox or a PS5 and would rather not buy a bespoke Switch 2 controller, just buy this $20 adapter instead, and use it to connect a wireless controller you already own.

This adapter goes into the Switch 2’s dock (or directly into the console, if you have a USB-A to C adapter). Connecting your controller is as easy as putting it into pairing mode, then ensuring that the “Pro Controller Wired Communication” option is turned on within the console’s settings. Click and hold the adapter’s coin-shaped button to initiate pairing, then you should be good to go. The DualSense’s rumble and motion controls work seamlessly, for example, and you can remap buttons as you please within the console’s OS like you would an official Switch controller. GuliKit’s Hyperlink 2 wireless adapter works similarly, and is usually a couple dollars cheaper ($16.99 at the time of publishing). I’m still in the process of testing it, but it was easy to pair a DualSense to a Switch 2 and the connection was reliable, with motion control and rumble support.

The Killswitch is a great Switch 2 companion, whether you’re someone who primarily uses the console in handheld mode or while it’s docked. It’s a case that wraps around the Switch 2’s back, with detachable components that snugly grip onto each Joy-Con 2, adding some extra bulk that makes them more comfortable to hold. Above all else, it’s a great way to protect your console from scratches and slightly more significant damage. What’s also great is that it doesn’t limit its flexibility as a hybrid console.

Each Killswitch ships with a USB-C dock adapter that is inserted into the Switch 2 dock. Since the case-equipped console can no longer fit in Nintendo’s dock, this adapter lets you connect it to your TV without taking off the case. It’s tougher to correctly align the Switch 2’s USB-C jack with this adapter than it is to put it in the dock, but it gets easier with practice.

The Dbrand KillSwitch is worth the cost for people who can afford it. It’s more comfortable to use in handheld mode than other options, and it’s great to be able to detach the Joy-Cons when I want to. Jsaux’s ModCase is a great runner-up, though. The foundation of the accessory pack is the wrap-around case that the console fits into (you can’t remove the Joy-Con or use the kickstand once it’s on), which adds bulkier grips that make it more comfortable to hold. There’s a protrusion on the rear of the case, which is where its batch of “mods” can be attached.

The basic $29.99 kit includes a kickstand (which works better on tables than laps) and a watch-like strap for holding a power bank during charging. The $59.99 Ultimate kit that Jsaux sent for testing includes those, plus a few other extras. You get a faceplate for the console to protect its screen when not in use, as well as a phone mount with a magnet that lets you attach, say, your iPhone so you can view it while you play games. Lastly, it includes a USB-C dock extender with a silicone stand. It’s like a dock for your dock, which looks more cumbersome than Dbrand’s also-clumsy-looking solution. But, hey, it all works as intended.

The best, slimmest zip-up case you should buy is made by Tomtoc. Compared to the Belkin hard zip-up case that I got my hands on before the Switch 2’s launch, the Tomtoc FancyCase slim case feels more durable; anecdotally, it holds up much better to being squeezed by hand. It even has more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2 sticks, so it’ll never press them in on accident. Like most zip-up cases, it features a screen cover that doubles as cartridge storage. This one can hold 12 cartridges.

I’m confident that it’ll absorb more potential damage over time than other cases I’ve tried. Plus, it just looks cooler, with low-profile designs for gamers who don’t want to draw attention to their console. That said, its “Froz Edition” has ice cream-inspired looks that are a lot more expressive.

When I’m relaxing after putting our kid to sleep, I want everything to be easy. Like, I don’t even want to hold a Switch 2 while I play, if at all possible. The console’s kickstand is nice, but Mechanism’s Gaming Pillow is better, since its articulating arm can suspend the console at eye level while its plush bottom rests on my lap. You can detach the Switch 2’s Joy-Con and hold them where it’s most comfortable, or better yet, just connect a wireless controller that offers better ergonomics. The Gaming Pillow works with many other devices, too, whether it’s a PlayStation Portal, an Xbox ROG Ally, or even a Kindle with the right adapter.

Jsaux is among the first companies to launch a compact, all-in-one wall charger that doubles as a dock for the Switch 2 and other handhelds. The OmniCentro dock — which comes with a USB-C port, a USB-A port, and an HDMI cable — retails for $39.99 at time of writing, which isn’t a bad price given its specs. Its USB-C port tops out at 65W, which is more than enough for a Switch 2 and most other gaming handhelds. The adapter supports 4K resolution at 60 frames per second with HDR, or 1440p and 1080p at up to 120 frames per second. You can also use it as a compact hub for your tablet or laptop, as its USB-A port comes in handy for wireless dongles or for charging small accessories.

If you use Nintendo’s GameChat feature, you might want a webcam to show your face to friends. The best webcam that you can get for your Switch 2 should be the cheapest one you can find that’s guaranteed to work with it. Almost all of Logitech’s webcams support the Switch 2, and Elgato has updated its Facecam MK.2 to support it, as well. Elgato’s model is pricier than we recommend most people spend, but it’s a solid option if you also have a PC to use it with. It’s worth knowing that the Switch 2 displays low-fidelity video feeds during gameplay, so unless you plan to use the webcam with your PC as well, it’s not worth spending a lot for a model that promises great video quality.

The Switch 2 is more powerful than the original Switch. However, it doesn’t require all that much more power to charge, even while you’re playing games. While new phones and tablets are breaking new ground with fast charging speeds, getting a power bank that can deliver at least 20W is totally sufficient to get the fastest-possible charging speeds with the Switch 2 in handheld mode.

By using a display-equipped USB-C cable with a wattage reading, I was able to see that the Switch 2 usually pulls a maximum of about 15-17W of power (sometimes less) from a USB-C battery during gameplay. When the system was asleep, the rate went down to between 8-13W, fluctuating at different points during the charging process. From a totally dead state, the console took almost 90 minutes to reach 69 percent with a 20W battery plugged into it. You’ll likely drain your USB-C battery more quickly if you’re playing as you charge.

Thankfully, your options for compatible batteries are plentiful. You’ll likely be paying for more power than you’ll need with the Switch 2, but more power (and especially more ports) are never a bad thing to have too much of.

The Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards of up to 2TB, even though models with that amount of storage aren’t yet available for purchase. Most brands make cards in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations, and some offer 1TB cards as well. I’d suggest grabbing the cheapest microSD Express card you can find, as so far they all offer similarly fast read/write speeds. Right now, Samsung’s P9 is one of the most affordable models you can get, with the 256GB version going down to $34.99 sometimes.

If you travel often or just really want heightened immersion, AR glasses are a good purchase to consider. Instead of using a TV or a monitor, they put the screen right up to your eyeballs, and modern models offer head-tracking to let the screen follow your movements, as well as sensors that let you lock the screen in place virtually. There’s more than one good set of AR glasses out there, too. Viture’s $499 Luma Pro and its Pro mobile gaming dock, which is necessary for connecting a Switch 2 and HDMI-based consoles, are a solid pair that offer both great contrast and brightness. Better yet, they offer physical myopia adjustment dials, giving you another way besides prescription lenses to achieve the clarity you’re looking for.

Xreal’s $449 1S are also worth considering. They require the Xreal Neo mobile dock to connect a Switch 2, but the Neo is actually smaller and slicker than Viture’s competing dock (the Luma Pro also work great on the Neo). Performance, resolution, features, and comfort are nearly identical between the two Xreal and Viture models; however, with Xreal, you’ll have to settle for software-based interpupillary distance adjustments instead of a hardware-based solution. In other words, you might need prescription lenses with the 1S if you require glasses to see clearly for any reason.

There are two extra items that I think most people should consider buying for their Switch 2. The first is a screen protector. As I mentioned at the top of the post, the console’s screen is its most fragile component, so spend the $10 or so necessary to get a multipack of tempered glass protectors so you don’t have to think about it again. Many brands make them, but I’ve had great experiences with stuff from amFilm.

The other accessory is a USB-C-to-Ethernet adapter. It’s possible that you may get a ton of usage out of this, especially if you play online multiplayer games and you want to nip latency in the bud. Or, if you’re like me, you’ll just plug it in when it comes time to download a game. The Switch 2’s Wi-Fi is awfully slow when it comes to downloading large files, even when you have fast internet. Plugging this accessory into either of its USB-C ports greatly increases download speeds.

Update, January 12th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability and several products, including Jsaux’s OmniCentro dock, Mechanism’s Gaming Pillow, and two pairs of video glasses.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1131193/ces-showed-me-why-chinese-tech-companies-feel-so-optimistic/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.”

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

A place for comfort, fun and distraction to brighten up your day. (Got any ideas? Drop me a line or skeet &#39;em at me.)

+ I enjoyed this heartwarming story of love across the generational divide ❤️ + It turns out you can cook an egg in an air fryer. The big question is—should you?+ Of course Japan has a real-life Pokémon Fossil Museum.+ If you haven’t already, make 2026 the year you get a hobby. Your life will be all the richer for it.

            <h2>Securing digital assets as crypto crime surges</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1129479/securing-digital-assets-as-crypto-crime-surges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2025, cyberattackers thought to be linked to North Korea executed a sophisticated supply chain attack on cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. By targeting its infrastructure and multi-signature security process, hackers managed to steal more than $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum in the largest known digital-asset theft to date.

The ripple effects were felt across the cryptocurrency market, with the price of Bitcoin dropping 20% from its record high in January. And the massive losses put 2025 on track to be the worst year in history for cryptocurrency theft.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins have established themselves as benchmark monetary vehicles, and, despite volatility, their values continue to rise. In October 2025, the value of cryptocurrency and other digital assets topped $4 trillion.

Yet, with this burgeoning value and liquidity comes more attention from cybercriminals and digital thieves. The Bybit attack demonstrates how focused sophisticated attackers are on finding ways to break the security measures that guard the crypto ecosystem, says Charles Guillemet, chief technology officer of Ledger, a provider of secure signer platforms.

”The attackers were very well organized, they have plenty of money, and they are spending a lot of time and resources trying to attack big stuff, because they can,” he says. “In terms of opportunity costs, it&#39;s a big investment, but if at the end they earn $1.4 billion it makes sense to do this investment.”

But it also demonstrates how the crypto threat landscape has pitfalls not just for the unwary but for the tech savvy too. On the one hand, cybercriminals are using techniques like social engineering to target end users. On the other, they are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities to exploit at different points in the cryptocurrency infrastructure.

Historically, owners of digital assets have had to stand against these attackers alone. But now, cybersecurity firms and cryptocurrency-solution providers are offering new solutions, powered by in-depth threat research.

One of the advantages of cryprocurrency is self custody. Users can save their private keys—the critical piece of alphanumeric code that proves ownership and grants full control over digital assets—into either a software or hardware wallet to safeguard it.

But users must put their faith in the security of the wallet technology, and, because the data is the asset, if the keys are lost or forgotten, the value too can be lost.

”If I hack your credit card, what is the issue? You will call your bank, and they will manage to revert the operations,” says Vincent Bouzon, head of the Donjon research team at Ledger. &quot;The problem with crypto is, if something happens, it&#39;s too late. So we must eliminate the possibility of vulnerabilities and give users security.”

Increasingly, attackers are focusing on digital assets known as stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the value of a hard asset, such as gold, or a fiat currency, like the US dollar.

Stablecoins rely on smart contracts—digital contracts stored on blockchain that use pre-set code to manage issuance, maintain value, and enforce rules—that can be vulnerable to different classes of attacks, often taking advantage of users&#39; credulity or lack of awareness about the threats. Post-theft countermeasures, such as freezing the transfer of coins and blacklisting of addresses, can lessen the risk with these kinds of attacks, however.

Software-based wallets, also known as “hot wallets,” which are applications or programs that run on a user’s computer, phone, or web browser, are often a weak link. While their connection to the internet makes them convenient for users, it also makes them more readily accessible to hackers too.

“If you are using a software wallet, by design it&#39;s vulnerable because your keys are stored inside your computer or inside your phone. And unfortunately, a phone or a computer is not designed for security.” says Guillemet.

The rewards for exploiting this kind of vulnerability can be extensive. Hackers who stole credentials in a targeted attack on encrypted password manager application LastPass in 2022 managed to transfer millions worth of cryptocurrency away from victims in the subsequent two or more years.

Even hardware-based wallets, which often resemble USB drives or key fobs and are more secure than their software counterparts since they are completely offline, can have vulnerabilities that a diligent attacker might find and exploit.

Tactics include the use of side-channel attacks, for example, where a cycbercriminal observes a system’s physical side effects, like timing, power, or electromagnetic and acoustic emissions to gain information about the implementation of an algorithm.

Guillemet explains that cybersecurity providers building digital asset solutions, such as wallets, need to help minimize the burden on the users by building security features and providing education about enhancing defense.

For businesses to protect cryptocurrency, tokens, critical documents, or other digital assets, this could be a platform that allows multi-stakeholder custody and governance, supports software and hardware protections, and allows for visibility of assets and transactions through Web3 checks.

As the threat landscape evolves at breakneck speed, in-depth research conducted by attack labs like Ledger Donjon can help security firms keep pace. The team at Ledger Donjon are working to understand how to proactively secure the digital asset ecosystem and set global security standards.

Key projects include the team’s offensive security research, which uses ethical and white hat hackers to simulate attacks and uncover weaknesses in hardware wallets, cryptographic systems, and infrastructure.

In November 2022, the Donjon team discovered a vulnerability in Web3 wallet platform Trust Wallet, which had been acquired by Binance. They found that the seed-phrase generation was not random enough, allowing the team to compute all possible private keys and putting as much as $30 million stored in Trust Wallet accounts at risk, says Bouzon. “The entropy was not high enough, the entropy was only 4 billion. It was huge, but not enough,” he says.

To enhance overall safety there are three key principles that digital-asset protection platforms should apply, says Bouzon. First, security providers should create secure algorithms to generate the seed phrases for private keys and conduct in-depth security audits of the software. Second, users should use hardware wallets with a secure screen instead of software wallets. And finally, any smart contract transaction should include visibility into what is being signed to avoid blind signing attacks.

Ultimately, the responsibility for safeguarding these valuable assets lies on both digital asset solution providers and the users themselves. As the value of cryptocurrencies continues to grow so too will the threat landscape as hackers keep attempting to circumvent new security measures. While digital asset providers, security firms, and wallet solutions must work to build strong and simple protection to support the cryptocurrency ecosystems, users must also seek out the information and education they need to proactively protect themselves and their wallets.

            <div id="article-text">Our reporters and editors constantly debate which emerging technologies will define the future. Once a year, we take stock and share some educated guesses with our readers. Here are the advances that we think will drive progress or incite the most change—for better or worse—in the years ahead.

Sodium-ion batteries, made from abundant materials like salt, are emerging as a cheaper, safer alternative to lithium. Backed by major players and public investment, they’re poised to power grids and affordable EVs worldwide.

AI coding tools are revolutionizing how we write, test, and deploy code, making it easier and faster to build sophisticated websites, games, and other applications than ever before. Just be sure to double-check what they come up with.

Nuclear power already provides steady electricity to grids around the world, without producing any greenhouse-gas emissions. New designs rely on alternative fuels and cooling systems or take up less space, which could get more reactors online faster.

From molten salt to TRISO fuel, here’s how technological advancements could upend an old power technology.

Every day, millions of people interact with AI chatbots. Some of them form what feel like close, personal bonds with the bots. There’s mounting evidence that this can be dangerous, and politicians are finally waking up.

When he was just seven months old, baby KJ became the first person to receive a personalized gene-editing treatment. A clinical trial is now planned, and bespoke gene-editing drugs could be approved within the next few years.

Growing banks of gene information on extinct creatures are providing clues to new treatments and suggesting solutions to climate change—and may help save endangered species.

Nobody knows exactly how large language models work, which means we don’t have a clear idea of their limitations. But that’s changing: Clever research techniques are giving us the best glimpse yet of what’s really going on inside the black box.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

Space tourism may seem fanciful, but this might be the year paying customers can finally check into a room with a galactic view. The shiny new modules will also support research missions by scientists and space agencies.

Screening embryos for genetic diseases is relatively common practice in fertility clinics today, and it can give potential parents some peace of mind. Now, though, new startups are making bold claims about using similar techniques to predict certain traits, including intelligence.

The race for AI supremacy has supercharged data centers. Hyperscale AI data centers pack powerful computer chips into synchronized clusters that work like giant, high-speed supercomputers—sizzling hot, power-hungry behemoths pushing infrastructure to its limits.

MIT Technology Review’s annual list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies aims to help our audience know which emerging technologies are really worth paying attention to right now. Our editors and reporters pitch advances that they think should make the list, and we discuss and debate the merits of each over the course of several months.

We look for breakthroughs that will have a broad impact and make meaningful differences in our lives and work. We give equal consideration to those that we think will have a positive effect or bring negative consequences. Every year, we have to pass on many worthy candidates. Here’s what didn’t make the list this year.

This is the 25th year we’ve produced this list. Predicting the future is tough and we don’t always get it right. Look back through our archives to see what’s worked out—and what hasn’t. Or read this special analysis by an MIT researcher about some of the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every year, MIT Technology Review publishes a list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies. In fact, the 2026 version is out today. This marks the 25th year the newsroom has compiled this annual list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning.

We ask these MIT students to find some of the “flops” from breakthrough lists in the archives and consider what factors or decisions led to their demise, and then to envision possible ways to “flip” the negative outcome into a success. The idea is to combine critical perspective and creativity when thinking about technology.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. It reveals how factors outside what is narrowly understood as technology play a role in its success—factors including cultural context, social acceptance, market competition, and simply timing.

In some cases, the vision behind a breakthrough was prescient but the technology of the day was not the best way to achieve it. Social TV (featured on the list in 2010) is an example: Its advocates proposed different ways to tie together social platforms and streaming services to make it easier to chat or interact with your friends while watching live TV shows when you weren’t physically together.

This idea rightly reflected the great potential for connection in this modern era of pervasive cell phones, broadband, and Wi-Fi. But it bet on a medium that was in decline: live TV.

Still, anyone who had teenage children during the pandemic can testify to the emergence of a similar phenomenon—youngsters started watching movies or TV series simultaneously on streaming platforms while checking comments on social media feeds and interacting with friends over messaging apps.

Shared real-time viewing with geographically scattered friends did catch on, but instead of taking place through one centralized service, it emerged organically on multiple platforms and devices. And the experience felt unique to each group of friends, because they could watch whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted, independent of the live TV schedule.

Here are a few more examples of flops from the breakthroughs list that students in the 2025 edition of my course identified, and the lessons that we could take from each.

The DNA app store (from the 2016 list) was selected by Kaleigh Spears. It seemed like a great deal at the time—a startup called Helix could sequence your genome for just $80. Then, in the company’s app store, you could share that data with third parties that promised to analyze it for relevant medical info, or make it into fun merch. But Helix has since shut down the store and no longer sells directly to consumers.Privacy concerns and doubts about the accuracy of third-party apps were among the main reasons the service didn’t catch on, particularly since there’s minimal regulation of health apps in the US.

Elvis Chipiro picked universal memory (from the 2005 list). The vision was for one memory tech to rule them all—flash, random-access memory, and hard disk drives would be subsumed by a new method that relied on tiny structures called carbon nanotubes to store far more bits per square centimeter. The company behind the technology, Nantero, raised significant funds and signed on licensing partners but struggled to deliver a product on its stated timeline.Nantero ran into challenges when it tried to produce its memory at scale because tiny variations in the way the nanotubes were arranged could cause errors. It also proved difficult to upend memory technologies that were already deeply embedded within the industry and well integrated into fabs.

Light-field photography (from the 2012 list), chosen by Cherry Tang, let you snap a photo and adjust the image’s focus later. You’d never deal with a blurry photo ever again. To make this possible, the startup Lytro had developed a special camera that captured not just the color and intensity of light but also the angle of its rays. It was one of the first cameras of its kind designed for consumers. Even so, the company shut down in 2018.

Ultimately, Lytro was outmatched by well-established incumbents like Sony and Nokia. The camera itself had a tiny display, and the images it produced were fairly low resolution. Readjusting the focus in images using the company’s own software also required a fair amount of manual work. And smartphones—with their handy built-in cameras—were becoming ubiquitous.

Many students over the years have selected Project Loon (from the 2015 list)—one of the so-called “moonshots” out of Google X. It proposed using gigantic balloons to replace networks of cell-phone towers to provide internet access, mainly in remote areas. The company completed field tests in multiple countries and even provided emergency internet service to Puerto Rico during the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. But the company shut down the project in 2021, with Google X CEO Astro Teller saying in a blog post that “the road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped.”

Sean Lee, from my 2025 class, saw the reason for its flop in the company’s very mission: Project Loon operated in low-income regions where customers had limited purchasing power. There were also substantial commercial hurdles that may have slowed development—the company relied on partnerships with local telecom providers to deliver the service and had to secure government approvals to navigate in national airspaces.

While this specific project did not become a breakthrough, the overall goal of making the internet more accessible through high-altitude connectivity has been carried forward by other companies, most notably Starlink with its constellation of low-orbit satellites. Sometimes a company has the right idea but the wrong approach, and a firm with a different technology can make more progress.

As part of this class exercise, we also ask students to pick a technology from the list that they think might flop in the future. Here, too, their choices can be quite illuminating.

Lynn Grosso chose synthetic data for AI (a 2022 pick), which means using AI to generate data that mimics real-world patterns for other AI models to train on. Though it’s become more popular as tech companies have run out of real data to feed their models, she points out that this practice can lead to model collapse, with AI models trained exclusively on generated data eventually breaking the connection to data drawn from reality.

And Eden Olayiwole thinks the long-term success of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm (a 2021 pick) is in jeopardy as awareness grows of the technology’s potential harms and its tendency to, as she puts it, incentive creators to “microwave” ideas for quick consumption.

But she also offers a possible solution. Remember—we asked all the students what they would do to “flip” the flopped (or soon-to-flop) technologies they selected. The idea was to prompt them to think about better ways of building or deploying these tools.

For TikTok, Olayiwole suggests letting users indicate which types of videos they want to see more of, instead of feeding them an endless stream based on their past watching behavior. TikTok already lets users express interest in specific topics, but she proposes taking it a step further to give them options for content and tone—allowing them to request more educational videos, for example, or more calming content.

It’s always challenging to predict how a technology will shape a future that itself is in motion. Predictions not only make a claim about the future; they also describe a vision of what matters to the predictor, and they can influence how we behave, innovate, and invest.

One of my main takeaways after years of running this exercise with students is that there’s not always a clear line between a successful breakthrough and a true flop. Some technologies may not have been successful on their own but are the basis of other breakthrough technologies (natural-language processing, 2001). Others may not have reached their potential as expected but could still have enormous impact in the future (brain-machine interfaces, 2001). Or they may need more investment, which is difficult to attract when they are not flashy (malaria vaccine, 2022).

Despite the flops over the years, this annual practice of making bold and sometimes risky predictions is worthwhile. The list gives us a sense of what advances are on the technology community’s radar at a given time and reflects the economic, social, and cultural values that inform every pick. When we revisit the 2026 list in a few years, we’ll see which of today’s values have prevailed.

            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.
