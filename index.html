            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/heres-why-nasa-and-the-space-force-are-interested-in-pizza-shaped-satellites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four small satellites rode a Rocket Lab Electron launch vehicle into orbit from Virginia early Thursday, beginning a government-funded technology demonstration mission to test the performance of a new spacecraft design.

The satellites were nestled inside a cylindrical dispenser on top of the 59-foot-tall (18-meter) Electron rocket when it lifted off from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility at 12:03 am EST (05:03 UTC). A little more than an hour later, the rocket’s upper stage released the satellites one at a time at an altitude of about 340 miles (550 kilometers).

The launch was the starting gun for a “proof of concept” mission to test the viability of a new kind of satellite called DiskSats. These satellites were designed by the Aerospace Corporation, a nonprofit federally funded research and development center. The project is jointly financed by NASA and the US Space Force, which paid for DiskSat’s development and launch, respectively.

“DiskSat is a lightweight, compact, flat disc-shaped satellite designed for optimizing future rideshare launches,” the Aerospace Corporation says in a statement.

The DiskSats are 39 inches (1 meter) wide, about twice the diameter of a New York-style pizza, and measure just 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) thick. Made of composite carbon fiber, each satellite carries solar cells, control avionics, reaction wheels, and an electric thruster to change and maintain altitude.

“The launch went perfectly, and the DiskSat dispenser worked exactly as designed,” said Darren Rowen, the project’s chief engineer, in a statement. “We’re pleased to have established contact with all four of the DiskSats, and we’re looking forward to the rest of the demonstration mission.”

The Aerospace Corporation has a long history of supporting of the US military and NASA since its founding in 1960. A few years ago, engineers at the center came up with the DiskSat concept after surveying the government’s emerging needs in spaceflight.

CubeSats have been a ubiquitous part of the satellite industry for nearly a quarter-century. They are based on a cube-shaped design, measuring about 10 centimeters per side, but can be scaled from a single cube “unit” to three, six, 12, or more, depending on mission requirements. The CubeSat standard has become a popular choice for commercial companies, the military, NASA, and universities looking to build small satellites on a tight budget.

By one measure, nearly 3,000 CubeSats have launched since the first one soared into orbit in 2003. After originally being confined to low-Earth orbit, they have now flown to high-altitude orbits, to the Moon, and to Mars.

While CubeSats are now prolific, engineers at the Aerospace Corporation saw an opportunity to improve on the concept. Debra Emmons, Aerospace’s chief technology officer, said the idea originated from Rich Welle, a scientist recently retired from the center’s Experiments Lab, or xLab, division.

“They were asking questions,” Emmons recounted in an interview with Ars. “They were looking at CubeSat studies and looking at some alternatives. The typical CubeSat is, in fact, a cube. So, the idea was could you look at some different types of form factors that might be able to generate more power … and offer up benefit for certain mission applications?”

Aerospace’s research team arrived at the DiskSat design. Emmons said the stackable flat-panel format is easier to pack for launch than a CubeSat. The concept is similar to SpaceX’s pioneering approach to launching stackable Starlink Internet satellites, but DiskSats are significantly smaller, lighter, and adaptable to different kinds of missions.

DiskSats have several advantages over CubeSats, according to the Aerospace Corporation. Each of the four DiskSats launched Thursday has a mass of about 35 pounds (16 kilograms), less than that of a typical 12U CubeSat. But a DiskSat has more than 13 times the surface area on a single side, providing valuable real estate for developers to load up the satellite with power-generating solar arrays, sensors, antennas, or other payloads that simply won’t fit on a CubeSat.

SpaceX’s current generation of mass-produced Starlink V2 satellites, by comparison, each have a mass of more than 1,100 pounds, or 500 kilograms.

DiskSat’s design offers “a power-to-weight ratio unmatched by traditional aluminum satellites,” the Aerospace Corporation says. In a research paper published earlier this year, engineers from the Aerospace Corporation claimed DiskSat can generate five to 10 times more power than a CubeSat.

What kinds of missions might DiskSat be useful for? One idea involves placing a large radar antenna—too big to fit on any other low-mass satellite—on the broadside of a DiskSat to collect all-weather surveillance imagery. Similarly-sized antennas on other DiskSats could support high-bandwidth communications.

With this demo mission, the Aerospace Corporation will test the performance of the DiskSat platform in space for the first time. Engineers will initially look at how the satellites function at 340 miles, then use their electric thrusters to gradually step down to lower altitudes, where another aspect of DiskSat’s design will shine.

Flying edge-on, the satellite’s pancake shape will minimize aerodynamic drag as the DiskSats encounter thicker air below 250 miles. Continual pulsing from the satellites’ electric thrusters will allow the DiskSats to maintain altitude as they glide through the uppermost layers of the atmosphere.

“The primary mission is to demonstrate and to understand the performance, functionality and maneuverability of the DiskSat buses on orbit, particularly in low-Earth orbit, or LEO, and very low-Earth orbit, or VLEO,” said Catherine Venturini, DiskSat’s principal investigator.

“In theory, I think you could operate down to 200 kilometers (124 miles) with electric propulsion,” Emmons said. That is two to three times closer to Earth than most commercial radar imaging satellites. Other satellite operators are also assessing the viability of flying remote sensing missions in VLEO.

Flying closer to the ground delivers higher-resolution imagery, bringing cities, ships, airports, and military bases into sharper view. So it’s easy to see why the Space Force is interested in the DiskSat concept.

DiskSat’s engineers acknowledge there are drawbacks to the format. With such a large surface area, it’s more difficult to manage the temperature extremes of low-Earth orbit than it is with a conventional cube-shaped satellite. While DiskSats carry a lot of oomph to change altitude, their shape makes them somewhat clunky and hard to turn, and engineers say they aren’t well suited for missions requiring agile pointing.

The Aerospace Corporation is a research center, not a commercial satellite manufacturer. Officials at the nonprofit are looking to hand over the DiskSat design to industry through a technology transfer agreement. “The plan is to release or license the technology to partners once it is flight-proven,” the Aerospace Corporation says on its website.

“We think this new technology will be disruptive to the small spacecraft enterprise and ecosystem,” said Eric Breckheimer, DiskSat’s program manager.

DiskSat’s stackable design makes it possible to launch a fleet of high-power, low-mass satellites in one go, according to Emmons.

Following the trend toward bigger CubeSats, the DiskSat format could also grow larger to take advantage of heavier rockets. “There’s a key scalability aspect, and with that in mind, you could bring an entire constellation of DiskSats with you in a single launch,” Breckheimer said.</div>

            <h2>Parasites plagued Roman soldiers at Hadrian’s Wall</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/study-roman-soldiers-battled-parasites-at-hadrians-wall/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It probably sucked to be a Roman soldier guarding Hadrian’s Wall circa the third century CE. W.H. Auden imagined the likely harsh conditions in his poem “Roman Wall Blues,” in which a soldier laments enduring wet wind and rain with “lice in my tunic and a cold in my nose.” We can now add chronic nausea and bouts of diarrhea to his list of likely woes, thanks to parasitic infections, according to a new paper published in the journal Parasitology.

As previously reported, archaeologists can learn a great deal by studying the remains of intestinal parasites in ancient feces. For instance, in 2022, we reported on an analysis of soil samples collected from a stone toilet found within the ruins of a swanky 7th-century BCE villa just outside Jerusalem. That analysis revealed the presence of parasitic eggs from four different species: whipworm, beef/pork tapeworm, roundworm, and pinworm. (It’s the earliest record of roundworm and pinworm in ancient Israel.)

Later that same year, researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of British Columbia analyzed the residue on an ancient Roman ceramic pot excavated at the site of a 5th-century CE Roman villa at Gerace, a rural district in Sicily. They identified the eggs of intestinal parasitic worms commonly found in feces—strong evidence that the 1,500-year-old pot in question was most likely used as a chamber pot.

Other prior studies have compared fecal parasites found in hunter-gatherer and farming communities, revealing dramatic dietary changes, as well as shifts in settlement patterns and social organization coinciding with the rise of agriculture. This latest paper analyzes sediment collected from sewer drains at the Roman fort at Vindolanda, located just south of the defense fortification known as Hadrian’s Wall.

An antiquarian named William Camden recorded the existence of the ruins in a 1586 treatise. Over the next 200 years, many people visited the site, discovering a military bathhouse in 1702 and an altar in 1715.  Another altar found in 1914 confirmed that the fort had been called Vindolanda. Serious archaeological excavation at the site began in the 1930s. The site is most famous for the so-called Vindolanda tablets, among the oldest surviving handwritten documents in the UK—and for the 2023 discovery of what appeared to be an ancient Roman dildo, although others argued the phallus-shaped artifact was more likely to be a drop spindle used for spinning yarn.

Per the authors of this latest paper, analyzing fecal matter (paleoparasitology) from Roman Britain  has thus far largely been done at urban centers such as London and York, and the only site where it has been done along Hadrian’s Wall is Carlisle. Vindolanda’s exceptional preservation makes it a prime candidate for learning more about the transmission of parasites and resulting gastrointestinal diseases among the Roman military manning the northern frontiers at that time.

The material was collected in 2019 from the main drain carrying latrine waste from the bath house toilet down to the stream and valley to the north. The team also excavated what was left of a 17th-century farmhouse, where they found sealed deposits from a previous third-century bath house drain at the site. They collected and analyzed 58 samples of sediment from those drains, as well as one sample collected from a nearby fort ditch circa 90 CE.

The analysis revealed that 28 percent of the samples contained eggs from either roundworms or whipworms, intestinal parasites typically spread as a result of poor sanitation, either via food, drink, or hands that come in contact with fecal matter. The first-century fort sample also contained roundworms and whipworms. Using a biomolecular method that binds antibodies to proteins produced by single-cell organisms, they found traces of a microscopic protozoan parasite called Giardia duodenalis. According to the authors, this suggests Roman solders regularly suffered from diarrhea and malnutrition.

Even having communal latrines and a sewer system apparently didn’t prevent parasitic transmission. “While the Romans were aware of intestinal worms, there was little their doctors could do to clear infection by these parasites or help those experiencing diarrhoea, meaning symptoms could persist and worsen,” said co-author Marissa Ledger of the University of Cambridge. “These chronic infections likely weakened soldiers, reducing fitness for duty. Helminths alone can cause nausea, cramping and diarrhea.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A couple of hours after a judge formally swore in private astronaut Jared Isaacman as the next administrator of NASA on Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order outlining his space policy objectives for the next three years.

The executive order, titled “Ensuring American Space Superiority,” states that the country must “pursue a space policy that will extend the reach of human discovery, secure the nation’s vital economic and security interests, unleash commercial development, and lay the foundation for a new space age.”

There is nothing Earth-shattering in the new executive order, as much of it builds on previously announced policies that span multiple administrations. There are some notable points in the document that clearly reflect the White House’s priorities, though, and Isaacman’s leadership of NASA.

Strikingly, there is no mention of a concrete plan to send humans to Mars in this document. There are just two references to the red planet, both of which talk about sending humans there as a far-off goal. One source recently told Ars that as soon as Trump learned there was no way humans could land on Mars during his second term, he was no longer interested in that initiative.

Also absent from this document is much reference to space science, with only a mention of “optimizing space research-and-development investments to achieve my Administration’s near-term space objectives.”

The architect of the Trump Administration’s proposed deep cuts in space science (which Congress has largely forestalled) was Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget. It’s probably not a great indicator for science missions that Isaacman is directed to coordinate with Vought’s office to achieve policy objectives in the executive order.

All told, the policies Trump signed are generally forward-looking, seeking to modernize NASA’s exploration efforts. Isaacman will face many challenges, including landing humans on the Moon by 2028 and working with industry to develop an on-time successor to the International Space Station. Whether and how he meets these challenges will be an intriguing storyline in the coming months and years.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What’re professional team sports without a good shoving match? Basketball star Kyrie Irving got into one recently — though not on the court, but with a humanoid robot.

In a video shared by the Dallas Mavericks social media page, a Unitree G1 android shows off its slick karate moves in front of the team, before Irving approaches and squares it up. The diminutive 4’2″ robot displays better survival instincts than most humans and nervously skitters away from the imposing athlete, who is two feet taller.

But it was to no avail. Irving shoves it in the chest, and the robot stumbles with human-like agility — or lack thereof — before falling flat on its back. Onlookers howl in laughter as it lies paralyzed on the ground, utterly motionless.

“My apologies, I thought I could push him a little harder,” Irving says, while the robot’s operators attend to it like courtside medics. “My bad.”

Maybe next time he can shoot hoops with one instead.

Back falls are no joke. Irving and the others try to lift the bot back on its feet, but it remains unresponsive, its limbs flopping around. Later, Irving comes back to check on it one last time, but it’s still out cold.

The Unitree G1 has become a cultural sensation with its surprising spryness and cute stature, with influencers using them for all kinds of slapstick stunts and “GONE WRONG!” videos. Some have become their own mini-celebrities, like “Jake the Rizzbot,” which is known for slinging Gen-Z slang and coming out as gay, whatever that means for a robot.

One way Unitree bots often shows off their adroitness is by performing martial arts moves, a trend that other robotics companies have eagerly jumped on (with some interesting iterations.) The flipside is that they also make tempting punching-bags for humans. No doubt that it’s hilarious to see them ragdoll on the ground after getting laid out, but they can only take so much abuse. The owners of Jake the Rizzbot, for instance, are currently suing the popular streamer IShowSpeed for allegedly wrecking their little celebrity after he punched it in the face, pinned it to a couch, and threw it to the ground during a stream.

As it stands, it’s unclear what condition the Mavericks robot is in after Irving made it eat pavement. But we hope it’s okay — if not for its sake, then for our own.

“Skynet will remember that,” a commenter joked.

            <h2>When Asked to Generate an Alphabet Poster for Preschoolers, the Latest Version of ChatGPT Just Flails Wildly</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On December 11, OpenAI release ChatGPT 5.2, the latest version of the widely used AI chatbot.

As it does every time it releases a minor update, the company hailed its latest version as a “significant improvement in general intelligence,” calling it the “best model yet for real-world, professional use.” In a further display of hubris, OpenAI even went so far as to claim 5.2 is their “first model that performs at or above a human expert level.”

Yet when we ran it through an incredibly simple prompt — to generate an alphabetized chart of animals for school children — the world-beating AI model came up laughably short.

The ABC deficiency was first noticed by BCA Research chief global strategist Peter Berezin. Using ChatGPT 5.1, which was released back in November, Berezin asked the AI to “draw [a] poster where you say A is for an animal that starts with the letter A, B for an animal that starts with B, all the way to Z.”

That version thought for six seconds, and spat out an image with 25 letters, as opposed to the standard English alphabet which uses 26. Already off to a rocky start, 5.1 does an okay job with “A” through “I,” but falls off the rails as soon as it gets to “K,” which it says “is for Lion.”

It goes on like this: “O is for jellyfish,” while “Q is for penguin” and “R is for snake.” By the time it gets to the end, “Z” is for “urba” — a turtle, apparently — followed by “B,” along with a picture of a pig.

“Still needs more capex,” Berezin quips, referencing the $1.15 trillion OpenAI has committed to spending on hardware in 2025 alone.

We were curious how ChatGPT 5.2 stacked up to its month-old predecessor — and sure enough, it didn’t disappoint.

Though the latest version of ChatGPT did a bit better with individual animals, it still only identified 24 letters in the English alphabet, forgetting “U” and “Z.” Instead, 5.2 listed “Y” for “Yak” right after “T.” This particular alphabet ends with “X,” which of course stands for “X-ray fish,” but is illustrated by a Zebra.

Its illustrations were also a bit suspect, with Kangaroos sporting a weird limb, an Iguana with two tails, a Narwal with a strange mash of eyes and fins as well as a bird’s beak, and a hedgehog with a cat’s face, to name a few weak points.

A follow-up prompt only spread the spill around. This time, there are 25 letters total. “Y” is still a problem area, taking the place of “U,” only this time it stands for “Unicorn,” which isn’t a real animal in the first place. By the end, there are two entries for “X,” one of which “is for fish,” followed by another “X,” again for “X-ray fish,” but with the same Zebra illustration.

The second poster also starts to scramble the instructions, injecting bits of the prompt into the poster title: “A is for alligator, B is for bear…”

As some users on X-formerly-Twitter pointed out, results are the same for Google’s Gemini, and as a quick glance at Grok shows, Elon Musk’s AI engine isn’t even close. But while ChatGPT might be the best at making an animal poster, it still comes up laughably short — and certainly not at the level of any “human expert” we’ve ever met.

            <div id="article-text">You don’t share the road with robotaxis — the robotaxis munificently share the road with you.

This week, one of Waymo’s fully driverless cabs was spotted blundering down the wrong side of a street in Austin, Texas, causing the human motorists driving in the correct direction to cautiously come to a halt, not unlike hikers encountering a bear.

The incident was captured in footage uploaded to Reddit. For a split second, it shows the Waymo flash its emergency signal, before switching to its turn signal. The robotaxi then turns in the opposite direction indicated by its blinker and pulls into a gas station, taking its sweet time.

“Just another day in Austin,” the uploader wrote in the caption.

Local news site My San Antonio reports that the incident took place on a stretch of frontage road next to the Interstate 35 highway in downtown Austin.

It’s another example of robotaxis acting with the kind of impunity to traffic laws you might expect from someone playing Grand Theft Auto. In fact, it’s not even the first time they’ve been caught driving on the wrong side of the road. Waymo may boast an impressive safety record, but its driverless cabs can still go off the rails in ways that can be comical, baffling, or genuinely dangerous.

This month, for example, Waymo recalled a software patch after its robotaxis were caught blowing past stopped school buses with active warning lights and stop signs, including at least one incident where a Waymo drove right by students who were disembarking. Twenty of these incidents were reported in Austin alone, MySA noted, prompting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to open an investigation into the company.

It’s not just school buses: the cabs don’t always stop for law enforcement, either. Earlier this month, a Waymo careened into an active police standoff, driving just a few feet away from a suspect who was lying facedown in the asphalt while cops had their guns trained on him.

In San Francisco, Waymo sparked outrage in the community after one of its robotaxis killed a beloved bodega cat known to locals as Kit Kat. Another ran over a dog that witnesses say was playing in the street.

These come as Waymo has been updating its cars’ software to drive more aggressively like a human motorist.

“Safety is our highest priority at Waymo, both for people who choose to ride with us and with whom we share the streets,” a spokesperson told MySA in a statement. “We take situations like this seriously and are committed to improving road safety through our ongoing learnings and experience.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok has reached a deal to cede a substantial portion of its U.S. operation to a group of American investors, thus ending a years-long tussle in which the federal government has sought to force the platform to do just that.

The new partnership is described as a “new TikTok U.S. joint venture” in an internal memo from ByteDance CEO Shou Chew, which was viewed by TechCrunch.

That arrangement will see major American investors take over significant control of the U.S.-based business. The newly formed investor group includes cloud giant Oracle, the tech-focused private equity firm Silverlake, and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm focused on AI. Together, those companies will own 45% of the U.S. operation, while ByteDance retains a nearly 20% share, the memo states. The new entity formed by this partnership has been dubbed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.”

That new entity will be responsible for overseeing the app, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance, the memo states. “A trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction,” the document says.

The closing date for the deal is listed as January 22, 2026. The news was originally reported by Axios.

Much of the deal, as it has been described in the memo, parallels the language in an executive order signed by President Trump in September. That memo similarly approved the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group. CNBC previously reported that Oracle, Silverlake, and MGX would be the primary investors in the deal. Until now, ByteDance had not divulged details of such a deal, except to say that it would abide by U.S. law to ensure that TikTok remained available to U.S. users.

The U.S. government has long sought to cleave TikTok’s U.S.-based business away from its Chinese parent company, espousing national security concerns as the rationale.

            <h2>Apple becomes a debt collector with its new developer agreement</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/apple-becomes-a-debt-collector-with-its-new-developer-agreement/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers’ behalf, among other methods.

The change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.

The changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.

Apple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)

In its new developer agreement, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.

Additionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.

The agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.

The types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.

The updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.

These changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.

These are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.

Of interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.

To be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Instacart will pay $60 million in refunds to settle allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it deceived consumers with false advertising. The federal agency alleged Instacart misled consumers with unlawful tactics, causing them to pay higher fees while also denying refunds.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated Instacart’s “free delivery” claims are misleading because customers are still required to pay a mandatory service fee, which can add up to 15% to their total order.

The agency also said the delivery platform’s “100% satisfaction guarantee” promise is false because it implies it will provide full refunds when consumers are not fully satisfied with their orders, which is typically not the case when people receive late deliveries or unprofessional service.

Additionally, Instacart hid the refund option from the “self-service” menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, making people believe they could only get a credit toward a future order rather than a refund, the FTC claimed.

Instacart also failed to clearly disclose terms relating to the Instacart+ membership enrollment process, the agency said. The sign-up process for the free trial of the subscription service did not disclose consumers would be charged once the trial ended, which allowed Instacart to charge people without their informed consent. These consumers will be receiving refunds as a result of the settlement, the FTC said.

“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.

Instacart acknowledged the settlement in a blog post and denied “any allegations of wrongdoing.” The company also said it believes “the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed.”

The settlement comes as Instacart is currently under fire over a recent study that revealed its AI-powered pricing tool is causing some customers to receive different prices for the same items at the same stores. Instacart responded to the controversy by stating that retailers determine their own prices, and any pricing tests conducted through its AI tool are random and not influenced by user data. Reuters reported on Wednesday the FTC has begun an investigation into the delivery platform’s AI pricing tool.

            <h2>Millions of Americans May Soon Face Huge Costs</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2025/12/trump-affordability-health-care-costs/685328/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

The president took a few moments out of his scattershot address to the nation last night to shield his party from blame over high health-care costs. If federal subsidies for the Affordable Care Act lapse at the end of the year, premiums may rise for more than 20 million Americans, dramatically worsening the affordability issues that are now top of mind for both parties. “It’s the Unaffordable Care Act,” Trump said. And a health-care system in crisis is “the Democrats’ fault.”

In fact, Democrats have consistently pushed to extend the subsidies; it was House Speaker Mike Johnson who said on Tuesday that the House would not vote on whether to continue funding the credits before the House’s holiday recess. Yesterday, a few GOP dissenters lent their signatures to a Democrat-led effort to force a vote, but they were outflanked by party members who oppose the credits (mostly on grounds that it costs too much and enables insurance fraud). Even if the House did put it to a vote before current funding for the subsidies expires on December 31, the Senate has already rejected the plan. Barring some drastic intervention, health-care costs will go up.

A month ago, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries predicted that either those subsidies would be renewed “or the American people will throw Republicans out of their jobs next year and end the speakership of Donald J. Trump once and for all.” His theory is about to be tested. When funding lapses in the new year, some Americans will see their costs double or triple. The average affected enrollee will see their costs rise by more than $1,000 annually. An education consultant in Chicago told NPR that her plan would increase from $180 a month to $1,200 a month. Many enrollees may no longer be able to pay for coverage at all; nearly 5 million people could become uninsured. An Ohio family said on MS NOW that because their new plan would cost $1,500 monthly with a $15,000 deductible, they are having to forgo coverage altogether. At a moment when the majority of Americans are dissatisfied with Trump’s stewardship of the economy, millions could soon be hit with a huge new expense.

That’s when the second part of Jeffries’s prediction starts to kick in. The 2026 midterms are almost a year away, so there’s plenty of time for public opinion to rebound—but as of now, Americans trust Democrats more than Republicans to handle the economy, per PBS, and the cost of living remains the top priority for Republicans and independents ahead of the midterms. Backlash to the Republican stance on the Affordable Care Act contributed to House Democrats’ resurgence in the 2018 midterms. Now GOP lawmakers will have to contend with the possibility that it could happen again.

During the recent government shutdown, which was largely caused by disagreements over whether to extend the ACA credits, Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Georgia representative and former Trump ally, broke rank. “When the tax credits expire this year my own adult children’s insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district,” she wrote in October. Among the four centrist Republicans who defied Johnson yesterday by signing a Democrat-led discharge petition was Michael Lawler, the first Republican to represent his New York district since the early 1980s (he’s up for reelection next year). Also on the list is Brian Fitzpatrick, a representative for a battleground district in Pennsylvania. “I know my people back home care tremendously about this,” he said last week.

That sentiment extends well beyond Pennsylvania. Recent polling shows that 57 percent of Americans support the Affordable Care Act, and 74 percent support extending the credits. Responding to broader concerns about health-care costs, Trump recently unveiled TrumpRx, a new initiative to let consumers buy drugs directly from manufacturers at lower prices. But that can only do so much to offset a major insurance-premium spike. Health care involves more than just drugs—decreasing the sticker price for weight-loss and migraine medications won’t do much to cover a trip to the hospital for a broken leg.

Another tactic the administration is considering is simply handing out checks, which could help mitigate the impact of those expiring subsidies. In his speech yesterday, Trump announced a onetime bonus of $1,776 for all members of the military, and he has contemplated sending every American a neat sum of $2,000—part of his doubling down on affordability messaging. But these are Band-Aid solutions to long-term problems that have been exacerbated over the past year. Trump’s tariffs have played a large role in raising prices on all kinds of consumer goods. When the health-care cutbacks of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act go into effect next year, millions of Americans could be forced off Medicaid, opening them up to sky-high hospital bills. And even though Trump hasn’t spearheaded the fight against health-care credits, he said last month that he’d “rather not” extend them.

If insurance premiums rise, they will do so on Trump’s watch. Although it’s too early to know how that will affect next year’s midterms, come January, the affordability crisis could get even worse—and the GOP will have to confront its choices.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Warren Buffett has long been known and admired around the world for doing something that is, at its essence, mundane. He is not a brilliant artist or a great inventor or a record-setting athlete. Instead, his brilliance—a low-key, midwestern type of brilliance—found expression in the prosaic art of investing: buying this stock and avoiding that one. Buffett himself has called this task “simple, but not easy.” While millions upon millions of people buy and sell investments every day, no one has a record of doing it better than he has, as consistently as he has, and for as long as he has.

Explore. Lindsey Vonn and Philip Rivers show what can happen when athletes keep competing into their 40s, Sally Jenkins writes.

Read. In his newest book, Joe Sacco worries about what political violence might lead to, Robert Rubsam writes.

            <h2>The Risk of Trump’s Marijuana Order</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/12/weed-rules-rescheduling-donald-trump/685329/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For more than 50 years, America’s official position on marijuana has been seen as nonsensical. By classifying pot as a Schedule I drug, the federal government has lumped it with heroin and LSD as substances with “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” In 1972, two years after marijuana was relegated to the most restrictive category of drugs in America, a government report found that weed’s “actual impact on society does not justify a social policy designed to seek out and firmly punish those who use it.”

Even with the federal classification, states have been experimenting with marijuana legalization for nearly three decades. These laws have led to fewer marijuana-related arrests without dramatic increases in crime, and they haven’t substantially spiked the rate of illicit adolescent cannabis use. Although fully legalizing recreational marijuana remains controversial, it’s clear that smoking a joint from your local dispensary is not the same as using heroin.

Now America’s marijuana policies are getting a bit more in line with the actual science. Today, Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the government to move the drug to Schedule III, a classification for substances with “moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.” As the president emphasized in the Oval Office, the action “doesn’t legalize marijuana in any way, shape, or form.” Selling marijuana without a prescription will still be a federal crime, just as trafficking anabolic steroids (also a Schedule III drug) is illegal.

The biggest impact from today’s action will likely be on medical research. Marijuana studies have been stymied because researchers who want to experiment with Schedule I drugs need to be closely vetted by the federal government. During the signing ceremony for the executive order, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. argued that the new classification will let scientists better understand the drug. That’s the hope of Ryan Vandrey, a cannabis researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Vandrey’s lab was cleared to do cannabis research while marijuana was still in Schedule I, but he hopes that this loosening of restrictions will open up “a huge number of possibilities for us to get at both the health benefits and health risks of cannabis as a whole,” he told me.

At the same time, by rescheduling the drug, the government runs the risk of signaling that marijuana is no big deal. “We need to be very clear in our messaging—especially to young people—that rescheduling does not mean cannabis is harmless,” Scott Hadland, a professor at Harvard Medical School and a pediatrician who treats adolescent addiction, told me. The government needs to figure out a way to tell Americans that even though marijuana is not as dangerous as heroin, it’s still an addictive drug. That’s not an easy message to communicate. Prior to signing the executive order today, the president touted the purported benefits of marijuana for certain medical conditions, but he also echoed the “Just Say No” drug campaign of decades past. “Unless a drug is recommended by a doctor for medical reasons, just don’t do it,” he said. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment.)

When talking about the risks of marijuana, you can easily to come off as a scold. Roughly 50 percent of Americans have tried the drug, and according to a 2024 study, the number of people using cannabis daily or near daily now eclipses the number who drink alcohol at a similar frequency. (Trump emphasized today that weed rescheduling polls well.) Even so, the risks of marijuana are real. The CDC estimates that three in 10 cannabis users exhibit some signs of dependency.

It doesn’t help that marijuana isn’t the same as when it was first scheduled, back in 1970. The drug has become significantly stronger over the past several decades. The average joint in the ’70s contained about 2 percent THC, the main psychoactive component of marijuana. In 2025, dispensaries regularly stock joints that have more than 35 percent THC. Studies have shown that use of higher-concentration marijuana is associated with serious mental-health outcomes, such as psychosis. In 2017, there were more than 100,000 hospitalizations for pot-linked psychosis, one study found. Vandrey said that he hopes rescheduling will help researchers better interrogate the “very strong correlation” between heavy marijuana use and psychosis.

None of this is to say that marijuana should stay a Schedule I drug, as it has for decades. In spite of this classification, millions of Americans have continued to use it. The government is now finally backing away from a misguided position about the risks of pot. But it still has to contend with the drug’s complications.</div>

            <h2>Rescheduling Marijuana Is an Enormous Mistake</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/trump-marijuana-rescheduling-tax/685317/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump signed an executive order today that committed the Justice Department to “rescheduling” marijuana. Although the order won’t legalize pot, it will relax a series of restrictions that the federal government has long enforced. The move has a broad coalition of supporters, including many progressives, who say that it will enable medical research and alleviate mass incarceration. But in reality, rescheduling marijauna will do little more than hand a tax break to the corporations that spent millions of dollars lobbying for it.

The term rescheduling comes from the Controlled Substances Act, the legal foundation of America’s drug-control regime. Under the CSA, controlled drugs (as opposed to uncontrolled ones, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen) are sorted into five schedules. For decades, the government has listed marijuana under Schedule I, which it reserves for drugs that have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. If the administration’s plan goes through, marijuana will shift to Schedule III, a classification for drugs that have a medical use and a relatively low potential for abuse or dependence.

Jonathan Caulkins and Keith Humphreys: Legal weed didn’t deliver on its promises

Such a move would clearly defy the current science on marijuana. Contrary to conventional wisdom, pot—especially today’s highly potent product—is both addictive and harmful. Figures vary, but the CDC estimates that about 30 percent of users become addicted. Moreover, research has linked marijuana use to a range of health risks. Recent meta-analyses have found strong and persistent associations between marijuana use and heart disease, stroke, lung disease, loss of IQ, psychotic events, and schizophrenia. Overdosing on marijuana may be all but impossible, but the drug is no less risky than mescaline and certain psychoactive components of khat, both of which the government classifies under Schedule I.

What about marijuana’s medical applications? Forty states already permit doctors to recommend marijuana, and many Americans use it for a variety of issues, including insomnia and chronic pain. But scientific research simply doesn’t back up the claim that marijuana is medicine. A recent paper published in The Journal of the American Medical Association looked at more than 30 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and concluded that “evidence from randomized clinical trials does not support the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for most conditions for which it is promoted.” Some marijuana patients may find relief because of a placebo effect or temporary intoxication. But the assertion that the cannabis plant can treat underlying pathologies is, at best, premature.

Trump and others at today’s signing ceremony claimed that rescheduling marijuana will facilitate greater research, which may well show that pot has genuine medical uses. But even though Schedule III substances are generally easier to study than Schedule I substances, reclassifying marijuana won’t make researching it much easier. This is because a law that Congress passed in 2022 to ease marijuana research already supersedes the restrictions imposed by the drug’s schedule status, as the Congressional Research Service observed last year. If marijuana is rescheduled, Congress would need to modify or repeal that law to actually make researchers’ lives easier—a heavier political lift. Alternatively, the administration could use its ample statutory power to facilitate marijuana research without rescheduling the drug.

Some may expect that rescheduling marijuana will help keep its users out of prison. Indeed, Schedule III drugs are generally subject to lighter penalties than are Schedule I drugs. But as the Congressional Research Service has noted, many of the penalties for marijuana offenses apply regardless of its schedule status, so reclassification won’t soften pot-related laws, which result in few prison sentences anyway.

If rescheduling won’t make research easier or keep people out of prison, why do it at all? One answer: money. Marijuana giants such as Trulieve, whose CEO has enjoyed significant access to the White House, stand to make billions from rescheduling thanks to an obscure provision of the tax code, 26 USC 280E. According to that clause, businesses cannot deduct from their taxes any expense accrued from trafficking a controlled substance. That’s why some state-legal marijuana conglomerates pay effective tax rates of up to 70 percent. Importantly, though, 280E applies only to Schedule I and II substances. Move pot to Schedule III, and that tax burden vanishes. (This may explain why the administration didn’t move marijuana to Schedule II even though it has repeatedly acknowledged that pot is dangerous.) In other words, an industry worth an estimated $34 billion is about to get an enormous tax cut.

Dan Brooks: The lonely new vices of American life

Marijuana companies have spent big to get to this point. They poured at least $1 million into Trump’s inauguration, paid for a $1-million-a-plate dinner with the president, and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to get MAGA influencers to advocate for rescheduling. Trump, a teetotaler whose brother suffered from addiction, has expressed plenty of skepticism about pot. But industry executives seem to have persuaded him: Some of them were reportedly on a call with the president when he said that he would move forward with rescheduling.

Today’s executive order will empower an often-predatory industry that sells addictive and hazardous products to millions of Americans. Business is already booming: As of 2022, some 18 million Americans use marijuana daily or almost daily, and about 19 million have a “cannabis use disorder,” according to federal survey data. In addition to the previously mentioned health harms, these users are also at risk of social isolation, disconnection, and family struggles, as Annie Lowrey documented in The Atlantic in 2018.

Rescheduling will not lead to meaningfully more research, more healing, or more Americans avoiding prison. But it will likely lead to more people living with a dangerous habit. And it will certainly lead to more money for a massive industry. Big Marijuana is about to get even bigger.</div>

Remember, Trump bankrupted four casinos. [politifact.com]

You&#39;re missing the point.  This is all about bribing Trump and scamming people.  Just like his crypto is not a moneymaker for anybody but him and his cronies, this is the same.  The Saudis will come in and invest billions.  Trump will sell and pocket massive amounts of cash.,

I don&#39;t think Trump even runs the social media anyway, it&#39;s some guys who pay him to use the name. He can&#39;t lose.

I doubt the guy even cares. If he lasts until the end of his term in 2029, he&#39;ll be 82. He has money. His kids have money. Anything he manages to pull off is just icing on the cake. If I were him, which I obviously am not, I wouldn&#39;t give two shits about money at this point. I agree with some of what he is doing, but seriously I don&#39;t understand the guy&#39;s motivations.

The other thing he has is dementia. The constantly bandaged right hand is from Leqembi injections which must be done intravenously. He might be alive in 2029 but he&#39;ll be entirely demented. However, no one will notice.

He&#39;s a narcissist.  I think quietly disappearing isn&#39;t really his vibe.  More money is a facet of the ego trip alongside tacky golden things, having his name on hotels and getting likes on social media.

More rationally (if he is ever rational), it&#39;s often hard to properly retire (see most African dicators etc) as the next guy might come after your wealth or liberty.  Admittedly, and a touch surprisingly, he has developed a next generation that could protect him while he plays golf.

Nobody in history has managed to solicit bribes so well, billions upon billions through crypto and scummy deals like these.

But the populace of trumpistan is really taking it calmly and without much concern. Sadly, the practice also sends terrible signals across the world.

Is TAE even considered to be one of the frontrunners in the fusion race? It seemed like Helion and CFS were expected to be the top dogs.  Regardless, if TAE reaches commercial milestones, it would help torpedo the coal and petroleum sectors.  Which would be a funny thing for Trump to back financially.

Like Trump cares.  This is all about the cashout.  Companies invest.  He cashes out.  He and his family get richer and richer.  Art of the bribe.

Isn&#39;t that how most investors are nowadays? Invest, demand raising of price at the expense of long-term viability, cash out before the butcher&#39;s bill comes. Suckers who didn&#39;t sell quick enough are left holding the bankruptcy bag.

who are obnoxious, vile trolls here on Slashdot.My dude. You might be the first accout I&#39;ve seen where almost every post is marked -1 TROLLI&#39;d suggest sitting with that fact for a while, but I know your not here to think are you champ?

We&#39;ll have successful nuclear fusion on day one.

It&#39;s going to take decades to figure out all the corruption over the last year.

Not really.  He&#39;s doing most of it out in the open.  His followers are so fucking stupid, they think anything done in the open is legitimate, because what kind of crazy person would do bad shit out in the open?

In an AI fight, this is probably the most worthless defense.

They’re not after the body.  They’re not even after the human.  They want the likeness.

Oh, and imitation is flattery.  Or some shit.

Maybe we&#39;ll finally see a return to real film. I&#39;ll dig up my ole, trusty 500C/M from the basement just in case.

Right. All four. And people you&#39;ve never heard of to boot, like for example:

Andrew Scott, Anthony Hopkins, Bella Ramsey, Benedict Cumberbatch, Bill Nighy, Carey Mulligan, Catherine Tate, Charles Dance, Christian Bale, Cillian Murphy, Claire Foy, Daniel Craig, Daniel Day-Lewis, David Tennant, David Walliams, Dawn French, Damson Idris, Derek Jacobi, Dev Patel, Eddie Redmayne, Emilia Clarke, Emily Blunt, Emma Corrin, Emma Thompson, Ewan McGregor, Felicity Jones, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Gemma Arterton, Geor

They are actors, not supermodels. They can always scan other willing individuals and then make a composite of the features they want to make a new &quot;actor&quot;. The appearance of an individual is just about the least important part if they want to replace you with AI.  That said, I understand it and would vote the same way.

At this point, I&#39;m a bit confused why they don&#39;t generate a large amount of motion capture data to create segments, actions, reactions, etc. before stringing them together into what they want

Actor unions have standard contracts.  This should definitely be part of it.    Especially for the low level actors.  They get paid a small amount - when the producers feel like it.  There are lots of stories of people being screwed by producers.

That alone is good reason for the actors to demand it be put in the contract.

Just scan people who don&#39;t care. Heck, I&#39;d volunteer. Let me know when they need scans of beer bellies.

Approach every older Hollywood actor and actress showing their age and suggest AI.

When they reel in horror and offense and refuse, remind them AI can make them look 25 again.  Forever.

I wonder how many would bite down so hard they snap the hook in two.

Gather around. Here is a useful heuristic to understand the shabby, campy, and uniquely unserious nature of this incarnation of the Trump presidency.

For the past several weeks, much attention has been paid to Alexis Wilkins, the 27-year-old country-singer girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel. This alone is unusual. Generally speaking, FBI directors are not meant to be understood as tabloid celebrities with rich personal lives. But the scandal that has enveloped the both of them is even more chintzy, in a perfectly Trumpian way. Basically, since getting sworn in to the role, Patel has used a Gulfstream jet owned by the agency to buttress his vacation time. This includes flying to concerts at which Wilkins is performing, and to a luxury hunting lodge in Texas called Boondoggle Ranch. This is the sort of controversy that raises a lot of questions—about taxpayer dollars, Patel’s ego, and why the current administration seems to be permanently occupied by manchildren stuck in various stages of arrested development. But Patel, for his part, has decided to address the charges head-on in the only way he knows how: Step in front of a podcast microphone, on a couch next to his girlfriend, and dress down the haters and losers.

The show in question is The Katie Miller Podcast, and, naturally, it is hosted by Katie Miller, wife of skull-measuring psychopath and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The podcast has platformed a cavalcade of regime-boosting sycophants, and Patel is no different. Between whining complaints about the press (hi, Kash!), boasts about his threadbare criminal justice bona fides, and mandated tributes to the genius of Donald Trump, he uses the opportunity to settle some scores. Miller asks Patel about the claims that he is mishandling FBI resources in service of his personal life, a credible accusation that he nonetheless finds completely outrageous. “If I was actually abusing [the jet], I would actually be seeing every one of her shows,” Patel says. “I think I get to, like, 15 percent.” Hilariously, the episode of the podcast opens with solemn text embossed on a black screen, informing viewers that the interview was recorded before the horrific mass shooting at Brown University. As of this writing, the FBI has yet to apprehend a suspect. (Update, Dec, 19, 12:09 a.m.: The suspect has been found dead in a storage unit. Unfortunately, the rest of this story stands.)

As we just described at Slate, Katie Miller is a mind-numbingly dull interviewer, but this thing still goes on for 50 minutes, and it’s completely dominated by pablum. At one point, Miller asks Wilkins if she disagrees with Patel on anything significant. She stumbles over the potential political ramifications of the query before informing listeners that the FBI director likes spicy food, while she does not. Scintillating stuff.

Miller, who is adjacent to the conspiracy network that animates the MAGA media ecosystem, also opens up a discussion about whether Wilkins is an Israeli spy. Apparently, this is an assertion that gets batted around in the dankest corners of fascist Discords. (Among the comments underneath the YouTube video for a vibeless Wilkins track called “GRIT,” one reads, “This is exactly what I imagine Mossad agent singing country music would sound like.”) Wilkins responds by saying that she has never been to Israel.

If there is one theme throughout the dialogue, it is Patel laying the blame for all of his grievances at the feet of the fourth estate. In that sense, he’s following a well-worn track laid out by Trump. But Patel’s demeanor is genuinely baffling. My favorite of these swipes is when Miller asks Patel when he might get engaged to Wilkins. He retorts by saying that he won’t “let the media determine the speed in which this relationship moves.” What? What are you talking about, man? I implore every boyfriend reading this to give that line a shot the next time the topic of marriage comes up: “The New York Times doesn’t control me!!” Let me know how it goes.

I guess this is what counts as damage control in the spiraling psychedelia of Trump 2.0. It doesn’t seem likely that the fiasco surrounding Patel’s chartered flights is going to stick for long, if only because this version of the White House has made highly visible corruption a defining aesthetic. Only months ago, we learned that border czar Tom Homan accepted a bag of $50,000 in cash from FBI agents, and we breezed right past it. I mean, yes, Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee are probing Patel’s flight logs, which could surface more-embarrassing information. But I’m not holding my breath over here.

Maybe none of this is really damage control at all. Sometimes it really seems as if Wilkins is the first girlfriend Patel has ever had. The idea that he needed to appear on Miller’s podcast with Wilkins to “clear the air” or whatever belies a more visceral purpose—to issue another reminder, for the American people, that the FBI director is getting laid. There is a bushy-tailed earnestness in the way Patel trumpets this information, a spiral-eyed mania of a man who, at last, is on the receiving end of positive interaction with a woman and wants to rub it in our faces. Frankly, once you understand the cretins in Trump’s orbit through that framing, a lot about this current moment begins to make sense.

On Sunday, father-and-son gunmen armed with shotguns killed 15 people and injured 40 more at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia. Their target was Chanukah by the Sea, an annual event run by the Chabad of Bondi. The dead include a Holocaust survivor, a rabbi, and a 10-year-old girl. It is the deadliest mass shooting to occur in Australia since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, a tragedy that reshaped the nation and led to the creation of gun laws that have, until now, prevented such violence from being a regular occurrence.

It is hard to parse this violence as a person from a country where it is abnormal. It is impossible not to personalize the grief, shock, and confusion. I was scrolling Instagram Stories on a sleepy Sunday arvo when I saw a friend post “just heard what I think are gunshots at Bondi - what’s going on?” The events unfolded so rapidly and brutally that it has shocked Australia into a whiplash of the soul that we will be grappling with for years to come.

We are in shock. This does not happen here. And yet, it has. It is difficult to reconcile that reality with who we are and who we imagine ourselves to be as a nation.

In the worst ways possible, the early response to the attack has taken on contours that would be familiar to Americans. That’s partly because authorities have said the shooters were motivated by “Islamic State ideology,” and because Israel’s genocide in Gaza—and the Australian complicity in it, mostly at the hands of Americans—has been a roiling issue here.

In the immediate aftermath of this attack, Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the tragedy on Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese of the Australian Labor Party, for recognizing an independent state of Palestine back in September. In his early career, Albanese was an ally of Palestine, co-founding the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine in 1999, but as prime minister he has tacitly supported Israel, Netanyahu, and the genocide in every material sense beyond a few empty gestures and hollow statements. This has divided Labor’s moderate base and beyond, and the government’s unwillingness to criticize Israel, let alone stop selling them arms, has been a major reason for the mass protests that have had hundreds of thousands of Australians marching through the streets of our major cities every weekend since Oct. 7, 2023.

Earlier this year, Albanese controversially appointed an “Antisemitism envoy” to appease Zionist interest groups. Jillian Segal, whose husband had donated to the Nazi-adjacent far-right group Advance Australia, used this position to put forth a highly censorious and constitutionally dubious list of proposed reforms framed as a “plan to combat antisemitism” that would all but outlaw criticism of Israel in Australia if adopted (which they weren’t, but likely will be in the wake of this weekend’s events). Segal has done little else in this perfunctory role other than push the narrative that the boom in antisemitism stems from the peaceful pro-Palestine movement—a falsehood she was quick to repeat in immediate response to the attacks. She has ignored the many neo-Nazi and white nationalist marches that have taken place in Australia this year, and many have concluded that she perceives more antisemitic hatred in a keffiyeh than a literal swastika.

Despite neither of the shooters being at all linked as of this writing with the pro-Palestine movement, Australia’s conservative politicians, its conservative media (which is most of it), and its right, far right, and alt right have all been quick to link the attack to the pro-Palestine crowd, particularly the campus protests, where some claim the shooter was “radicalized.” Which is odd, as the young shooter appears to be a brickie (Australian for bricklayer) who never attended university. In fact, the shooters have been found to have affiliations with the Islamic State, which is a known enemy of the Palestinian people, the pro-Palestine movement, Hamas, and Hezbollah.

Still, Australia’s right, like America’s, do not turn their nose up at an opportunity. They have had a rough time of it of late. Our conservative party, the Coalition (a combination of the Liberals and the Nationals), now headed by placeholder leader Sussan Ley, was annihilated in one of the most resounding electoral defeats in Australia’s history in May 2025. So disastrous is Ley, the Coalition’s polling, and the Coalition’s electoral prospects both on the state and federal level, that our major conservative party is essentially on the point of extinction.

Unable to find a weak spot in Albanese’s radically Zen centrism, the Coalition cynically exploited Sunday’s bloodbath almost immediately. Ley laid the blame at Albanese’s feet, and Josh Frydenberg, a major figure of the party’s hard right, demanded Albanese take “personal responsibility” for the attack. Former Prime Minister John Howard—imagine Ronald Reagan crossed with Dick Cheney crossed with Gollum, or imagine if Richard Nixon was your longest-serving president—emerged from his lair to point fingers at Albanese, his government, and Howard’s oldest, most loathed enemy, the amorphous “left.” (Howard looms over the Coalition like Darth Sidious, and as prime minister, he was the architect of Australia’s involvement in the illegal Iraq war.)

These are the mainstream of Australian conservatism and the Australian right. Behind them are a cavalcade of bloodthirsty grifters, knuckle-draggers, and hatemongers whose immediate response to the news was to lick their lips. They have been waiting for an event like this their entire lives. Pauline Hanson, founder and head of One Nation, a party that has been the fetishized mascot of white nationalism and paranoiac race hatred in Australia for 30 years, arrived with her newly anointed goon Barnaby Joyce to fire off a hateful screed before the freshly laid memorial flowers. She condemned the prime minister, Muslims, and antisemitism—somewhat of an irony, as she was recently the headline speaker at one of the many neo-Nazi marches that have recurred in Melbourne and Sydney this past year.

Other prominent bigots preferred the safety of the internet. “Western civilisation enjoyer” Drew Pavlou, a basement-dwelling influencer known best for taking a decade to complete an undergrad degree, immediately began livestreaming the shootings on his monetized YouTube channel. He took to X and began firing out dangerous misinformation, egging on racial violence with the rabid Islamophobia that has become his bread and butter. As people still lay dying, he falsely claimed that a preplanned Christmas firework event taking place in Sydney was in fact the city’s Muslim community taking to the streets in celebration. As I write, he is livestreaming himself at the public memorial, where his excitement at the prospect of inciting a race war is palpable.

I focus on Drew as a particularly grotesque case study of the breed of professional hate-peddlers that America is all too aware and fond of. The deluge of misinformation that promulgated in the immediate wake of the attacks was fueled by American social media platforms that have prioritized and monetized bigotry and psychosis. X, Meta, and YouTube were flooded with A.I. fakes, the most darkly comical of which was a reimagining of the great hero of the day, Ahmed al-Ahmed, the Syrian Muslim fruit-shop owner who bravely wrestled a gun from one of the shooters, as a white man with a comfortably white name.

Australian racism is not too dissimilar from America’s—indeed, it is largely informed by it these days—but of course it is different by the very nature of our unique histories and cultures. Like America, Australia’s Islamophobia has been violent, demented, and frothing since 9/11, and, like America, our domestic and foreign policies have unfairly targeted Muslims and the Muslim world—Iraq, Palestine, Indonesia, and beyond. Our media, much of which is owned by Rupert Murdoch and other billionaires who sometimes outpace even him in their hatreds, regularly runs extremely Islamophobic content, occasionally resulting in real violence (such as the notorious Cronulla riots, which occurred nearly 20 years ago to the day of the Bondi shootings). This reached its nightmarish apex in the 2019 Christchurch shootings, where an Australian white nationalist terrorist flew to New Zealand and murdered 51 people at a mosque. This took place in New Zealand, but it was very much an Australian shooting.

Hatred breeds hatred, and the surge of antisemitism, neo-Nazi groups like the NSN, and white nationalists like Pauline Hanson and Drew Pavlou, exists within, and is inflamed by, the malformed hatreds that are tragically intrinsic to the Australian identity. Antisemitic attacks were on the rise far before this month, raising alarm. I cannot sum up 250 years of Australian history in this article—it is hard enough to contextualize the last week—but it is important for you to do that most un-American of things and recognize that these events do not take place in a void, but rather within the specific context of a long and complicated history.

But the right’s narrative may not win out in the end, especially with the deeply unpopular and off-putting American right weighing in loudly and regularly on their behalf, laying the blame on Australia’s infamously strict gun laws. It might sound alien to even moderate Americans, but the immediate consensus here after the shooting has been that our gun laws are not strict enough—an observation many experts have been making for years as private gun ownership has bloomed exponentially, especially in the past decade. Both our prime minister and the premier of New South Wales, Chris Minns—who was an ally of the pro-gun Shooters, Fishers, and Farmers Party—have vowed gun law reform. How a person like the alleged shooter who the ASIO (our FBI) had been tracking for ties to the Islamic State associations as early as 2019 was able to acquire a gun license, let alone six shotguns, will no doubt be the subject of a lengthy parliamentary inquiry in the months to come.

In truth, if Sunday holds any lessons for Americans, it’s that Australia’s gun laws, though flawed, work. How many would have been killed if the terrorists were able to buy a couple of AR-15s from their local Coles? How many mass shootings would we have had since Port Arthur if John Howard (yes, the same man I described above) had not brought in such strict and transformative gun laws in the immediate aftermath? All I know is this is the first mass shooting on Australian soil since 1995. America has had 468 this year.

Still, American discourse, and American policy, regularly leads us about by the nose. We are The Kid to your Judge Holden, and we will ride with you to our doom. Our role as loyal foot soldiers in every American war since Korea, but especially in Iraq, and again with our support of Israel (which is largely to placate the United States), has a hand here. Our insidiously growing gun culture and broken discourse and outpourings of online-hatred blueprints imported from America have again brought the violence home to us. We of all people should know the boomerang swings back, but we got too dependent on you to truly acknowledge that. As I write, Australia’s mainstream journalists—many of whom rank among the dumbest on Earth—are riling up great dramas and screeds in a tone and style that is distinctly American, which is to say, worrying.

And yet, it is useful to see these people as a loud minority.

A contradiction I’m sure you understand is that Australia is a country of many hatreds, but also a country of great love. That love for one another is what we aspire toward as Australians; those who act on this love are the greatest Australians there are. Ahmed al-Ahmed, the Syrian refugee who confronted the shooter head-on, saving countless lives, is what we’d call the light on the hill—a kind of goodness and courage we, as Australians, must collectively strive for. Boris and Sofia Gurman, two Bondi locals who were killed in their attempts to stop one of the shooters, reflexively moved to save lives at the cost of their own. The community that has come forward to grieve and lay flowers, the swimmers who have insisted on keeping this beloved beach a place of mateship and joy, the imams and rabbis who hug and shake hands and hold each other in mourning, understanding, and support, the millions of “Are you OK?” “How are you feeling?” and “I’ll ride with you if you’re feeling unsafe” texts sent between friends, neighbors, and comrades, the record-breaking amount of blood donations given these past few days, and the rejection of violent hatred as abject, alien, and fundamentally un-Australian—this is what it has always meant, and will continue to mean, to be what we call “True Blue.” This is the Australia as it should and must be.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s Government Digital Service (GDS) will add an AI chatbot to its GOV.UK app in early 2026, before rolling it out across the GOV.UK website used by most government departments and services.

&quot;We want people to be able to ask questions as they would in everyday life; for example: &#39;I&#39;ve just had a baby, do you know what help I can get?&#39;&quot; wrote Leanne Cummings, GDS&#39;s director for products and services, in a blog post. Responses would combine material from multiple departments including HM Revenue and Customs, the Department for Work and Pensions, and the Department for Education into &quot;a single, simple conversational answer.&quot;

While GOV.UK Chat will initially answer questions, GDS is exploring whether it could carry out simple transactions as well. This would follow Ukraine&#39;s Diia.ai chatbot, which began generating income certificates on request in September.

&quot;Our focus is to transform Diia from a digital services platform into a fully functional AI agent that operates 24/7, without the need to manually fill out forms or fields,&quot; Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine&#39;s first deputy prime minister, wrote in an article.

GDS will first deploy GOV.UK Chat to the GOV.UK app, which has been in a public beta test since July and had nearly 260,000 downloads by November 24. More than 80 percent of users have customized the app&#39;s homepage, including by adding their local authority.

The chatbot, based on OpenAI technology, has been in development for more than two years. It uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model drawing on GOV.UK website content with personal data stripped out. GDS has conducted extensive testing, including red-teaming exercises where government colleagues attempted to break or corrupt it.

A private pilot with 1,000 users in late 2023 found that while most people liked using the chatbot, its answers weren&#39;t accurate enough and it made outright mistakes. GDS believes it has since addressed these issues by adding filters and rules to prevent from it answering certain questions. ®

            <h2>Cornish recycling drive sows confusion among Reg Standards Bureau</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/19/pasty_standard/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Reg Standards Bureau was plunged into uproar this week when a reader suggested a new unit for weight, inspired by Cornwall&#39;s revamped food recycling service.

Cornwall Council announced that its revamped food waste collection service had boosted recycling rates by more than a fifth to 52 percent – a remarkable achievement for any authority, even one presided over by a hereditary Duke with virtually unlimited feudal powers and a penchant for flogging overpriced own-brand groceries.

The feat is particularly impressive given that Cornish folk traditionally prefer to bury unwanted items down mines or incorporate them into holiday homes.

To illustrate the program&#39;s success, the council revealed it had collected a &quot;staggering 20,000 tonnes of leftovers, teabags, and everything else that goes in your food caddy.&quot;

Then came a Reg-ian twist: &quot;That&#39;s the equivalent weight of more than 66 million pasties!&quot; Quick math: 303.03 grams per pasty. Our reader immediately nominated it as a unit of measurement.

And that&#39;s where the confusion began. An escapee from The Reg freelance bench heard the ensuing discussion, and piped up: &quot;How could a pasty weigh 303 grams? It would never stay in place.&quot;

Blank faces from the standards board. True, we&#39;ve never attempted to stick a pasty to a wall. Well, not often. And certainly not on the window of the 11:30pm train after The Reg Christmas party. But the filling can be viscous enough for a majestic vertical slide.

Our freelancer asked: &quot;And does that include the tassel?&quot;

Tassel? Why are we talking tassels instead of a crisp ridge of hard-baked pastry, firm enough to hold betwixt finger and thumb, assuming the rest of the casing doesn&#39;t break, sending a mix of scalding hot potato, beef, turnip, and God knows what else sliding down your wrist and inside the cuffs of your fisherman&#39;s jumper.

Then the penny dropped. Pasty also refers to a disc of fabric or other material to protect the nipple. The long-distance runners among you will know the agony of chafed chests, particularly following a just-above-zero midwinter exertion.

Which got us thinking. Could the pasty be just the sort of circumference measurement we&#39;ve been waiting for?

Some quick googling, and it seems that pasties come in a variety of diameters, roughly between 2.4 and 4 inches. But it seems pasties are also rather variable, from 280 to 350 grams.

So, to ensure maximum efficiency, this will mean a lot of additional work to define both a standard pasty, and, critically, a standard pasty. And that&#39;s before we can begin to decide whether the latest addition to The Reg standards canon is a pasty or, alternatively, a pasty.

Or we throw the decision across to you, dear readers.

Is a pasty not just a European Commission-endorsed foodstuff, but a much-needed unit of mass? Or is it an ideal way of signifying radial measurements AND a cunning way of preventing inadvertent chafing?

            <div id="article-text">On Call Welcome once more to On Call, The Register&#39;s reader-contributed Friday column in which we share your stories of tech support jobs so wrong, they&#39;re right.

This week, meet a reader we&#39;ll Regomize as &quot;Mike,&quot; who told us about his time as a traveling engineer for a local education authority in the UK Midlands. The job meant Mike drove across the region, visiting various schools to fix whatever IT problems popped up.

&quot;One day I was sent to a school to carry out some work on the head teacher&#39;s laptop, which wasn&#39;t connecting to the network,&quot; he told On Call.

When Mike arrived, he plugged in an Ethernet cable and quickly realized the network port in the head teacher&#39;s office wasn&#39;t live.

&quot;He walked in as I was about to leave, and insisted that the point was indeed live, which he proceeded to demonstrate by showing that he could check for new email,&quot; Mike told On Call.

The teacher&#39;s email client, Outlook Express, promptly produced a message complaining that no internet connection could be found.

&quot;He insisted the real problem was a full inbox,&quot; Mike told On Call. &quot;And to be fair, that did happen in those days.&quot;

The teacher&#39;s next attempt to prove Mike wrong was to open a browser and show him that web pages would load.

That didn&#39;t work either, and the teacher told Mike that was because he had &quot;too much stuff on his desktop.&quot;

Mike decided the best way to support the teacher was to leave him alone.

&quot;One of our network guys got the network point working, but I made sure another engineer got assigned to complete the original task,&quot; he told On Call.

How do you handle users who push back with nonsense diagnoses? To share your story, click here to send On Call an email. The column will continue across the festive season and we can always use and appreciate a good story. ®

An anomaly caused a sudden drop in altitude and created a debris field.

SpaceX says it has lost control of a Starlink satellite that’s now falling back to Earth after suffering an anomaly. The sudden loss of communications, drop in altitude, “venting of the propulsion tank,” and “release of a small number of trackable low relative velocity objects,” suggests the anomaly was some kind of explosion. SpaceX says it poses no threat to the crew of the ISS and will burn up in the atmosphere “within weeks.”

This mishap comes a week after SpaceX reported a near miss with a Chinese satellite.

Space-tracking company Leo Labs says whatever happened to Starlink 35956 was likely caused by an “internal energetic source,” not a collision. Its radar network detected “tens of objects” around the satellite after the event.

The incident happened at 418km (260 miles), an increasingly crowded area known as low Earth orbit where over 24,000 objects, including satellites and debris, are currently being tracked.

By the end of this decade, there could be as many as 70,000 satellites operating in that same region, mostly in the service of space internet constellations like Starlink being launched by private and government organizations in the US, China, and Europe. Such density not only creates issues for astronomers, it also increases the odds of a collision that could, in theory, cascade out of control.

            <div id="article-text">After briefly going dark in the US to comply with the divest-or-ban law targeting ByteDance that went into effect on January 19th, TikTok quickly came back online. It eventually reappeared in the App Store and Google Play as negotiations between the US and China continued, and Donald Trump continued to sign extensions directing officials not to apply the law’s penalties.

Finally, in mid-December, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew told employees that the agreements to create TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, which includes Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX as part owners, have been signed, and the deal is expected to close on January 22nd, 2026. His letter said that for users in the US, the new joint venture will oversee data protection, the security of a newly-retrained algorithm, content moderation, and the deployment of the US app and platform.

TikTok has finalized a deal to sell enough of its US business satisfy the divest-or-ban law, as initially reported by Axios, The Hollywood Reporter, and CNBC. According to a memo sent from CEO Shou Zi Chew to employees (included in full below) on Thursday, they are targeting a closing date of January 22nd, 2026. Once the deal is done, he writes that ownership stakes in TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC will break down as follows:

After TikTok briefly went dark in the US in January, President Donald Trump granted TikTok a series of extensions to come up with a deal to sell a stake in its US-based operations. The US and China finally agreed on a “framework” for a deal in September, leading to yet another extension that expired on December 16th.

Less than two years ago, TikTok was a crisis situation on Capitol Hill. The chair of the House Select Committee on China called it “digital fentanyl” that brainwashes young Americans into supporting Hamas. A former national security adviser said letting TikTok remain in the US under its Chinese owner “would be akin to allowing Soviet control of several major American newspapers and TV channels during the Cold War.” Lawmakers left classified national security briefings about TikTok sharing grave concerns. All of it culminated in the surprise frenzy of a bipartisan bill forcing Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell the app or face a ban, which swiftly became law.

But nearly a year after the app should have been kicked out of the US, TikTok remains widely available, thanks to intervention from the administration of President Donald Trump. A promised acquisition by US investors, brokered through Trump, has been stalled for months. And the lawmakers who passed the ban are largely staying quiet.

For most of his career Larry Ellison has been content to quietly let Oracle be the company, behind the company, behind the technology that makes headlines. Its biggest products being cloud computing and database products that it sells to enterprise customers like DHL, Northwell Health, and Fanatics. But, now in his 80s, Ellison has begun a second act shifting from Silicon Valley pioneer, to media mogul.

Compared to many of the other people at the top of the Forbes Billionaires list, Larry Ellison tends to keep a low profile. That’s not to say he hasn’t seen his fair share of headlines, especially in recent years. But he, and his company Oracle, aren’t being routinely dragged in front of congress for high profile shouting matches, or being accused of ruining an entire generation of children in op-ed pages.

Following months of delays, President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that’s supposed to “save” TikTok. Trump claims the deal will make the app “American-operated,” fulfilling the divest-or-ban law that threatened the China-owned app’s presence in the US. But the Trump administration didn’t reveal any information about who will own TikTok’s US operations, or how much they’ll own. And questions remain about whether the new agreement — and the steps taken to get there — is even legal.

“The TikTok saga has been the single clearest articulation, the single most vivid example of the lawlessness of this administration, of its imperial conception of itself as above the rule of law,” Alan Rozenshtein, a law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, tells The Verge. During an interview, Rozenshtein calls into question Trump’s repeated deadline extensions that pushed back the enforcement of the TikTok ban law.

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order recognizing the framework of a deal between ByteDance and the US that would satisfy the TikTok divest-or-ban law. The deal values TikTok’s US operations at $14 billion and puts it under the control of companies based in the US.

“I spoke with President Xi [Jinping], we had a good talk,” Trump said during a briefing. “I told him what we were doing, and he said, ‘Go ahead with it.’”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that six of the seven board seats will be held by Americans, ByteDance retain less than a 20-percent stake, and that Americans’ data will be stored in the US with no access give to China.

“So all of those details have already been agreed upon, now we just need this deal to be signed and that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days.”

A 10 percent stake in Intel, 15 percent of Nvidia’s China sales, a “golden share” of Nippon Steel — what price will Trump extract next in exchange for favorable treatment? Well, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Trump Administration is “expected to collect a multibillion-dollar fee” in exchange for negotiating a US takeover of TikTok’s US business.

That fee will reportedly come from TikTok’s US investors, including private equity firm Silver Lake and Oracle, with the new group getting half of TikTok, while TikTok China’s parent company ByteDance would still have under 20 percent.

China and the US have “made progress” on granting permission for ByteDance to sell TikTok to an American consortium, fulfilling a nine-months-overdue legal requirement. After saying a tentative deal had been reached Monday and that approval would come Friday, President Donald Trump’s administration has issued an update that leaves the current status ambiguous and the details bare-bones.

“I just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,” Trump posted on Truth Social, noting he and Xi Jinping would meet at the APEC Summit in Korea in October. “The call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!”

As he has ever since taking office, Donald Trump again ordered the DOJ to ignore enforcing the TikTok ban law, this time until December 16th.

The president claims a deal is close, which the WSJ reports will hand control to a US consortium of investors including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreesen Horowitz.

TikTok might not finalize its deal to sell its US operations for at least another month. Sources tell CNBC’s David Faber that the US and China might close on an agreement within the next 30 to 45 days, while Oracle will remain the app’s cloud partner, allowing it to continue routing US user data on American servers.

On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that the US and China have reached a “framework deal” for TikTok. He added that President Donald Trump would confirm the deal on Friday — two days after TikTok’s latest deadline to divest expires. Trump has already given TikTok three extensions to negotiate a deal, and it’s unclear whether he’ll grant TikTok another while the company finalizes an agreement.

The US and China have reached a “framework” deal to divest TikTok from its Chinese parent company, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters during trade talks in Madrid on Monday. As noted by Reuters, Bessent confirmed that “the framework is for a switch to a US-controlled ownership.” He said Trump will confirm the deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday — two days after the latest deadline to sell or ban the app.

The preliminary deal comes after months of rocky negotiations between TikTok and the Trump administration. The app faced a ban in January, but President Donald Trump granted TikTok an extension to work out a deal to sell its operations in the US, as required by the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Trump granted TikTok two more extensions after that, giving it until September 17th to reach an agreement. It’s unknown whether he will formally extend the deadline or consider this announcement sufficient to count as a divestiture; it’s also unclear whether the deal will satisfy the requirements laid out in the law.

While it was President Joe Biden who signed the law that would force ByteDance to sell its stake in TikTok or face a ban, it’s his successor, Donald Trump, who has yet to fulfill his promise of arranging a deal to keep TikTok running, legally, in the United States. The current deadline for a deal is September 17th. Still, it hasn’t stopped Trump’s administration from creating @WhiteHouse on TikTok, which published its first post on Tuesday night: a video celebrating Trump’s accomplishments.

The ban has only seen TikTok shut down in the US for one day, and its impact has been delayed three times. The first time was in January, when Trump took office and signed an executive order delaying enforcement of the ban for 75 days; then there was another delay in April, after a potential deal fell through due to Trump’s harsh tariffs against China, and then in June, when he stated that he believed Chinese President Xi Jinping was open to a deal if a buyer emerged.

In the last month, the war in Gaza has become an inescapable facet of the public consciousness as a new surge of images of Palestinian children — their faces impossibly sunken, their limbs reduced to skin and bone — flooded the internet. As the pictures became ubiquitous, the outcry became louder than ever.

These conditions of extreme deprivation are not new: in November 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for using starvation as a method of war. Nevertheless, the situation now is piercing the mainstream in a way that official charges of war crimes could not. Maybe it was the video of guards at a food aid distribution site using stun grenades, pepper spray, and live ammunition on crowds of hungry Palestinians. Or perhaps it was the news, two weeks later, that 20 Palestinians had been killed — mostly by trampling — when a crowd at a distribution site panicked as stun grenades were used on them. Or possibly it was the open letter from the European news agency AFP, warning that its final remaining journalists in Gaza were at imminent risk of death by starvation. “Since AFP was founded in 1944, we have lost journalists in conflicts, some have been injured, others taken prisoner. But none of us can ever remember seeing colleagues die of hunger,” the agency wrote.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly ignored the bipartisan law banning TikTok from operating in the US unless it’s separated from Chinese parent company ByteDance. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) is calling for a new way to avoid a ban without breaking the law. In a draft bill, Markey proposes letting TikTok operate in the US as long as it provides transparency into its content moderation and keeps US user data out of countries like China.

Even with the TikTok divest-or-ban law officially in effect since January, the app has only shut down service in the US for one day. Now, The Information reports that an agreement for a sale satisfying the law’s requirements is close and would come with a new, separate version of the app.

Any deal, however, would need approval from the Chinese government, which is also still wrangling with the Trump administration over tariffs.

A Freedom of Information Act request has produced letters that the US Department of Justice sent to Google, Apple, Amazon, and several other companies in order to assuage their concerns about breaking a law that banned US web services from working with TikTok.

The documents — obtained by Zhaocheng Anthony Tan, a Google shareholder who sued for their release earlier this year — show Attorney General Pam Bondi and her predecessor Acting Attorney General James McHenry III promising to release companies from responsibility for violating the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which required US companies to ban TikTok from app stores and other platforms or face hundreds of billions of dollars in fines. The law was intended to force a sale of TikTok from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, due to national security concerns.

The incredibly weird saga of the ordered, then reversed, then passed, then upheld, then ignored, then ignored even harder attempt to ban one of America’s most popular social networks continues — as it will continue until US-China tensions cool down, everyone forgets it ever happened, or the heat death of the universe.

For the third time, President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok to spin out from its Chinese parent company or face a US ban. As White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed in a statement Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order on Thursday extending the deadline another 90 days, landing the new deadline in mid-September.

The Trump administration will spend the next 90 days “working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,” Leavitt said.

During an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, President Donald Trump said he’d “be willing” to extend TikTok’s June 19th deadline if its China-based parent company, ByteDance, doesn’t reach a deal to divest the app’s US business in time. China backed out of a potential deal last month after Trump imposed up to 145 percent tariffs on goods imported from the country.

That’s according to Semafor’s White House correspondent Shelby Talcott. The TikTok turmoil is just going to go on forever, huh?

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent Apple a letter “telling the company it should follow President Donald Trump’s executive order” extending ByteDance’s deadline to sell TikTok by 75 more days, reports Bloomberg. The outlet had reported a similar letter sent to both Google and Apple prior to their decision to restore the app to their online marketplaces in February, too.

Earlier this week, when it seemed as though TikTok’s fate in the US would actually be decided by April 5th, everyone — from Amazon to the founder of OnlyFans — was coming out of the woodwork to buy it.

As it turns out, none of them had a chance. And now, thanks to President Donald Trump’s tariff war, no one may get to buy TikTok.

President Donald Trump’s additional 75 day delay to TikTok’s sale-or-ban deadline leaves service providers like Apple, Google, and Oracle on shaky ground, and, according to one influential Democrat, is straight-up “against the law.”

After Trump announced the extension on Friday, 12 Republican members of the House Select Committee on China, including Chair John Moolenaar (R-MI), released a joint statement in response. The statement did not address legal concerns with the second extension, but it said that “any resolution must ensure that U.S. law is followed, and that the Chinese Communist Party does not have access to American user data or the ability to manipulate the content consumed by Americans.” The letter says signatories “look forward to more details” on a proposed deal.

Donald Trump’s initial 75-day delay against enforcement of the TikTok ban law would’ve expired this weekend, but on Friday, he announced on Truth Social that “I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days.”

This week, Trump announced new taxes on products coming into the US, including a 34 percent tariff rate against China. He has said that he would consider lowering that rate in exchange for China agreeing to a TikTok deal, but with the deadline closing in, it’s Trump who decided to extend the delay instead of having TikTok’s app shut down again.

After President Donald Trump pushed back a deadline for banning TikTok in January, the 75-day delay will run out on April 5th, but there’s still no word on a deal that could satisfy the law by shifting control of TikTok away from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.

The Information reports that later today, Trump plans to announce a plan for “TikTok America,” a new company with 50 percent ownership by unnamed new US investors, a one-third stake for existing ByteDance investors, and a 19.9 percent share for ByteDance. It would apparently license TikTok’s algorithm from ByteDance.

Update on our U.S. businessI am pleased to share some great news. We have signed agreements with investors regarding a new TikTok U.S. joint venture, enabling over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part of a vital global community.

I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued dedication and tireless work. Your efforts keep us operating at the highest level and will ensure that TikTok continues to grow and thrive in the U.S. and around the world.

With these agreements in place, our focus must stay where it’s always been—firmly on delivering for our users, creators, businesses and the global TikTok community.

There’s more work to be done as we move towards the closing date of January 22, 2026. Within this timeframe, we will continue to update you on the process and other details.

In the meantime, I have outlined key terms of the agreements below.

ByteDance and TikTok have signed binding agreements with three managing investors, Oracle Corporation, Silver Lake, and MGX, to form a new TikTok U.S. joint venture named TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC. Pursuant to the Executive Order signed by U.S. President Donald J. Trump on September 25, 2025, the agreements specify that the U.S. joint venture will be majority owned by American investors, governed by a new seven-member majority-American board of directors, and subject to terms that protect Americans’ data and U.S. national security.

Specifically, the U.S. joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX with 15% each; 30.1% held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance.

Through comprehensive security measures, more than 170 million Americans will continue to discover, create, and connect on the platform, enjoying the same experience as today. Advertisers will continue to connect with global audiences with no impact.

The U.S. joint venture will be responsible for U.S. data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance. It will also have the exclusive right and authority to provide assurances that content, software, and data for American users is secure. A trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction.

Data Protection: safeguarding sensitive U.S. user data, which will be stored in a trusted and secure cloud environment in the United States run by Oracle.

Algorithm Security: retraining the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation.

Content Moderation: ultimate decision-making authority for reviewing and approving all content moderation and related policies within the United States.

Software Assurance: deployment and integrity of the U.S. application software and platform.

The transaction will be completed no later than 120 days from the date of the Executive Order. Upon the closing, the U.S. joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok U.S. Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over U.S. data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance, while TikTok global’s U.S. entities will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.

Update, December 18th: Added details from the memo and its full text.

            <h2>China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/18/1130148/china-ev-battery-recycle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

            <div id="article-text">In just a couple of weeks, we’ll be bidding farewell to 2025. And what a year it has been! Artificial intelligence is being incorporated into more aspects of our lives, weight-loss drugs have expanded in scope, and there have been some real “omg” biotech stories from the fields of gene therapy, IVF, neurotech, and more.

As always, the team at MIT Technology Review has been putting together our 2026 list of breakthrough technologies. That will be published in the new year (watch this space). In the meantime, my colleague Antonio Regalado has compiled his traditional list of the year’s worst technologies.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.We like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.Regrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.—Antonio Regalado

Each time you’ve heard a borderline outlandish idea of what AI will be capable of, it often turns out that Sam Altman was, if not the first to articulate it, at least the most persuasive and influential voice behind it.For more than a decade he has been known in Silicon Valley as a world-class fundraiser and persuader. Throughout, Altman’s words have set the agenda. What he says about AI is rarely provable when he says it, but it persuades us of one thing: This road we’re on with AI can go somewhere either great or terrifying, and OpenAI will need epic sums to steer it toward the right destination. In this sense, he is the ultimate hype man.To understand how his voice has shaped our understanding of what AI can do, we read almost everything he’s ever said about the technology. His own words trace how we arrived here. Read the full story.—James O’Donnell

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t. Check out the rest of the package here.

Can AI really help us discover new materials?

One of my favorite stories in the Hype Correction package comes from my colleague David Rotman, who took a hard look at AI for materials research. AI could transform the process of discovering new materials—innovation that could be especially useful in the world of climate tech, which needs new batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and more.But the field still needs to prove it can make materials that are actually novel and useful. Can AI really supercharge materials research? And what would that look like? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
