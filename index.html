            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s Valentine’s Day, and while there are plenty of classic and current rom-coms out there for those wishing to immerse themselves in warm and fuzzy feelings, we’re opting to celebrate in a different way: honoring Ang Lee’s 2000 masterpiece Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a wuxia tragic fairy tale featuring one of the most beautifully heartbreaking love stories in film at its center. It’s also got stunning cinematography and tons of awe-inspiring martial arts sequences, which makes it my personal perfect date night movie.

(Spoilers below, but we will give you a heads up before the major reveals.)

The film is adapted from a 1940s novel by Wang Dulu and is set sometime during the Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 through 1912. (No specific date is given.) The title is a direct translation of a line from a 6th century Chinese poem: “behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon.” It’s generally interpreted as a description of legendary martial arts masters living un-noticed and/or hiding in plain sight—until someone picks a fight, that is. And some of those hidden masters are women.

Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) is a master Wudang swordsman who has long loved his warrior friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), and vice versa. But they hide their true feelings out of respect for Shu Lien’s long-deceased former fiance—who just happened to be Mu Bai’s best friend. It’s an honor code thing and warriors are serious about their honor. Mu Bai has retired as a swordsman and gifts his fabled jian sword (“Green Destiny”) to his patron, Sir Te (Lang Sihung). Also visiting Sir Te that day are Governor Yu (Li Fazeng) and his recently engaged daughter Yu Jiaolong (Zhang Ziiyi), aka Jen.

Then a masked thief sneaks onto the estate and steals Green Destiny. Shu Lien, who heads her own private security company, gives chase across the compound’s rooftops, but the thief escapes. Shu Lien figures out that the thief is linked to Governor Yu’s household and believes Jen’s governess (Cheng Pei-pei) is actually the infamous Jade Fox, a female warrior who poisoned Mu Bai’s beloved teacher years before. During a nighttime showdown, Mu Bai defeats Jade Fox—until the masked thief reappears to defend her.

That thief turns out to be Jen, who has secretly been studying martial arts. And Jen’s really not keen on her upcoming arranged marriage because she has fallen in love with a bandit named Lo “Dark Cloud” Xiao Hou (Chang Chen). They are the symbolic tiger and dragon, with Lo as the unchanging yin (tiger) and Jen as the dynamic yang (the hidden dragon).

(WARNING: Major spoilers below. Stop reading now if you haven’t seen the entire film.)

There are multiple clashes between our main characters, most notably Jen battling Shu Lien, and a famous sequence where Mu Bai pursues Jen across the treetops of a bamboo forest, deftly balancing on the swaying branches and easily evading Jen’s increasingly undisciplined sword thrusts. It’s truly impressive wire work (all the actors performed their own stunts), in fine wuxia tradition. Jen is gifted, but arrogant and defiant, refusing Mu Bai’s offer of mentorship; she thinks with Green Destiny she will be invincible and has nothing more to learn. Ah, the arrogance of youth.

Eventually, Jen is betrayed by her former teacher, Jade Fox, who is bitter because Jen has surpassed her skills—mostly because Jade Fox is illiterate and had to rely on a stolen manual’s diagrams, while the literate Jen could read the text yet did not share those insights with her teacher. Jade Fox is keeping her drugged in a cave, intending to poison her, when Mu Bai and Shu Lien come to the rescue. In the ensuing battle, Mu Bai is struck by one of Jade Fox’s poison darts. Jen rushes off to bring back the antidote, but arrives too late. Mu Bai dies in Shu Lien’s arms, as the two finally confess how much they love each other.

(sniff) Sorry, something in my eye. Anyway, the ever-gracious Shu Lien forgives the young woman and tells her to be true to herself, and to join Lo on Mount Wudang. But things don’t end well for our young lovers either. After spending the night together, Lo finds Jen standing on a bridge at the edge of the mountain. Legend has it that a man once made a wish and jumped off the mountain. His heart was pure so his wish was granted and he flew away unharmed, never to be seen again. Jen asks Lo to make a wish before swan-diving into the mist-filled chasm. Was her heart pure? Did Lo get his wish for them to back in the desert, happily living as renegades? Or did she plunge to her death? We will never know. Jen is now part of the legend.

There are thematic layers upon layers in Lee’s film, but front and center are the three female characters and their individual struggles to reconcile their true selves with traditionally rigid Chinese gender roles. Jade Fox chose bitterness and dishonorable revenge: poison is deemed a coward’s weapon, and she herself is spiritually poisoned because of her choice. Jen is heading in a similar direction, with Mu Bai warning against her becoming a “poison dragon.” Guilt-ridden by her role in Mu Bai’s death, she chooses sacrificial oblivion instead. Only Shu Lien has made her peace and found a way to thrive within her cultural tradition—but choosing that path deprives her of the loving husband and family she might have had with Mu Bai.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is pretty much flawless, striking a delicate balance between the aesthetics of the East and the West. It’s one of those rare films to enjoy box office success—it’s the highest grossing foreign produced film in US history—and widespread critical acclaim, receiving ten Oscar nominations and winning four. There was a 2016 sequel with a largely new cast, Sword of Destiny, directed by Yuen Wo-ping, who choreographed the action sequences for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But without Lee’s singular vision, the sequel never reached the aesthetic heights of its predecessor. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is now justly considered among the greatest films of the 21st century. If you haven’t seen it, it’s well worth your time.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Out beyond the orbit of Neptune lies an expansive ring of ancient relics, dynamical enigmas, and possibly a hidden planet—or two.

The Kuiper Belt, a region of frozen debris about 30 to 50 times farther from the sun than the Earth is—and perhaps farther, though nobody knows—has been shrouded in mystery since it first came into view in the 1990s.

Over the past 30 years, astronomers have cataloged about 4,000 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), including a smattering of dwarf worlds, icy comets, and leftover planet parts. But that number is expected to increase tenfold in the coming years as observations from more advanced telescopes pour in. In particular, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile will illuminate this murky region with its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which began operating last year. Other next-generation observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will also help to bring the belt into focus.

“Beyond Neptune, we have a census of what’s out there in the solar system, but it’s a patchwork of surveys, and it leaves a lot of room for things that might be there that have been missed,” says Renu Malhotra, who serves as Louise Foucar Marshall Science Research Professor and Regents Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona.

“I think that’s the big thing that Rubin is going to do—fill out the gaps in our knowledge of the contents of the solar system,” she adds. “It’s going to greatly advance our census and our knowledge of the contents of the solar system.”

As a consequence, astronomers are preparing for a flood of discoveries from this new frontier, which could shed light on a host of outstanding questions. Are there new planets hidden in the belt, or lurking beyond it? How far does this region extend? And are there traces of cataclysmic past encounters between worlds—both homegrown or from interstellar space—imprinted in this largely pristine collection of objects from the deep past?

“I think this will become a very hot field very soon, because of LSST,” says Amir Siraj, a graduate student at Princeton University who studies the Kuiper Belt.

The Kuiper Belt is a graveyard of planetary odds and ends that were scattered far from the sun during the messy birth of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. Pluto was the first KBO ever spotted, more than a half-century before the belt itself was discovered.

Since the 1990s, astronomers have found a handful of other dwarf planets in the belt, such as Eris and Sedna, along with thousands of smaller objects. While the Kuiper Belt is not completely static, it is, for the most part, an intact time capsule of the early solar system that can be mined for clues about planet formation.

For example, the belt contains weird structures that may be signatures of past encounters between giant planets, including one particular cluster of objects, known as a “kernel,” located at about 44 astronomical units (AU), where one AU is the distance between Earth and the sun (about 93 million miles).

While the origin of this kernel is still unexplained, one popular hypothesis is that its constituent objects—which are known as cold classicals—were pulled along by Neptune’s outward migration through the solar system more than 4 billion years ago, which may have been a bumpy ride.

The idea is that “Neptune got jiggled by the rest of the gas giants and did a bit of a jump; it’s called the ‘jumping Neptune’ scenario,” says Wes Fraser, an astronomer at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, National Research Council of Canada, who studies the Kuiper Belt, noting that astronomer David Nesvorný came up with the idea.

“Imagine a snowplow driving along a highway, and lifting up the plow. It leaves a clump of snow behind,” he adds. “That same sort of idea is what left the clump of cold classicals behind. That is the kernel.”

In other words, Neptune tugged these objects along with it as it migrated outward, but then broke its gravitational hold over them when it “jumped,” leaving them to settle into the Kuiper Belt in the distinctive Neptune-sculpted kernel pattern that remains intact to this day.

Last year, Siraj and his advisers at Princeton set out to look for other hidden structures in the Kuiper Belt with a new algorithm that analyzed 1,650 KBOs—about 10 times as many objects as the 2011 study, led by Jean-Robert Petit, that first identified the kernel.

The results consistently confirmed the presence of the original kernel, while also revealing a possibly new “inner kernel” located at about 43 AU, though more research is needed to confirm this finding, according to the team’s 2025 study.

“You have these two clumps, basically, at 43 and 44 AU,” Siraj explains. “It’s unclear whether they’re part of the same structure,” but “either way, it’s another clue about, perhaps, Neptune’s migration, or some other process that formed these clumps.”

As Rubin and other telescopes discover thousands more KBOs in the coming years, the nature and possible origin of these mysterious structures in the belt may become clearer, potentially opening new windows into the tumultuous origins of our solar system.

In addition to reconstructing the early lives of the known planets, astronomers who study the Kuiper Belt are racing to spot unknown planets. The most famous example is the hypothetical giant world known as Planet Nine or Planet X, first proposed in 2016. Some scientists have suggested that the gravitational influence of this planet, if it exists, might explain strangely clustered orbits within the Kuiper Belt, though this speculative world would be located well beyond the belt, at several hundred AU.

Siraj and his colleagues have also speculated about the possibility of a Mercury- or Mars-sized world, dubbed Planet Y, that may be closer to the belt, at around 80 to 200 AU, according to their 2025 study. Rubin is capable of spotting these hypothetical worlds, though it may be challenging to anticipate the properties of planets that lurk this far from the sun.

“We know nothing about the atmospheres and surfaces of gas giant or ice giant type planets at 200, 300, or 400 AU,” Fraser says. “We know nothing about their chemistry. Every single time we look at an exoplanet, it behaves differently than what our models predict.”

“I think Planet Nine might very well just be a tar ball that is so dark that we can’t see it, and that’s why it hasn’t been discovered yet,” he adds. “If we found that, I wouldn’t be too surprised. And who knows what an Earth [in the belt] would look like? Certainly the compositional makeup will be different than a Mars, or an Earth, or a Venus, in the inner solar system.”

Observatories like Rubin and JWST may fill in these tantalizing gaps in our knowledge of the Kuiper Belt, and perhaps pinpoint hidden planets. But even if these telescopes reveal an absence of planets, it would be a breakthrough.

“There’s a lot of room for discovery of large bodies,” says Malhotra. “That would be awesome, but if we don’t find any, that would tell us something as well.”

“Not finding them up to some distance would give us estimates of how efficient or inefficient the planet formation process was,” she adds. “It would fill in some of the uncertainties that we have in our models.”

One other major open question about the Kuiper Belt is the extent of its boundaries. The belt suddenly tapers off at about 50 AU, an edge called the Kuiper cliff. This is a puzzling feature, because it suggests that our solar system has an anomalously small debris belt compared with other systems.

“The solar system looks kind of weird,” Fraser says. “The Kuiper cliff is a somewhat sharp delineation. Beyond that, we have no evidence that there was a disk of material. And yet, if you look at other stellar systems that have debris disks, the vast majority of those are significantly larger.”

“If we were to find a debris disk at, say, 100 AU, that would immediately make the solar system not weird, and quite average at that point,” he notes.

In 2024, Fraser and his colleagues presented hints of a possible undiscovered population of objects that may exist at about 100 AU—though he emphasizes that these are candidate detections, and are not yet confirmed to be a hidden outer ring.

However, even Rubin may not be able to resolve the presence of the tiny and distant objects that could represent a new outer limit of the Kuiper Belt. Time will tell.

As astronomers gear up for this major step change in our understanding of the Kuiper Belt, answers to some of our most fundamental questions hang in the balance. With its immaculate record of the early solar system, this region preserves secrets from the deep past. Here there are probably not dragons, but there may well be hidden planets, otherworldly structures, and discoveries that haven’t yet been imagined.

“I’d say the big question is, what’s out there?” Malhotra says. “What are we missing?”

            <h2>WHO slams US-funded newborn vaccine trial as "unethical"</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/who-slams-us-funded-newborn-vaccine-trial-as-unethical/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The World Health Organization on Friday released a formal statement blasting a US-funded vaccine trial as “unethical,” because it would withhold an established, safe, and potentially lifesaving vaccine against hepatitis B from some newborns in Guinea-Bissau, Africa.

“In its current form, and based on publicly available information, the trial is inconsistent with established ethical and scientific principles,” the WHO concluded, after providing a bullet-point list of reasons the trial was harmful and low quality.

The trial has drawn widespread condemnation from health experts since notice of the US funding was published in the Federal Register in December. The notice revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—had awarded $1.6 million to Danish researchers for their non-competitive, unsolicited proposal to conduct the trial.

The Danish researchers are led by Christine Stabell Benn and her husband Peter Aaby of the Bandim Health Project, which is based at the University of Southern Denmark in Copenhagen. Benn and her colleagues have long been controversial for their questionable practices in research into alleged vaccine safety concerns. Kennedy has cited their work in his decision to cut global vaccine funding.

The CDC’s funding of Benn’s hepatitis B vaccine trial also came soon after the agency’s advisors—who were handpicked by Kennedy—decided to abandon a long-standing universal recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine birth dose. The move was widely decried by health experts.

In the Guinea-Bissau trial, Benn’s team intended to randomize 14,000 newborns to receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at either birth or at six weeks, and then study differences in alleged safety outcomes. Currently, Guinea-Bissau gives the first vaccine dose at the six-week point, but has already decided to transition to recommend a birth dose in 2028. The reason for the delayed implementation is resource constraints.

“Exploiting scarcity is not ethical,” the WHO wrote in its statement today.

The United Nations health agency highlighted that the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose is “an effective, and essential public health intervention” that has “been used for over three decades, with more than 115 countries including it in their national schedules. “

“It prevents life‑threatening liver disease by stopping mother‑to‑child transmission at birth,” the WHO wrote, noting that more than 12 percent of adults in Guinea-Bissau have chronic hepatitis B.

In a section subtitled “Why withholding the vaccine is unethical,” the WHO lays out all the reasons the trial is dangerous.

“From what is publicly described, the [trial] protocol does not appear to ensure even a minimum level of harm reduction and benefit to the study participants (e.g., screening pregnant women and vaccinating newborns exposed to hepatitis B),” the WHO wrote.

As a proven lifesaving vaccine, withholding it from some study participants would expose newborns to serious and potentially irreversible harm, including chronic infection, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, the WHO argues. There is no scientific justification for withholding a proven intervention, and there is no credible evidence of the safety concerns that Benn and her colleagues claim to be looking for in their trial. The WHO also noted that the publicly available information about the trial indicates that it will be a single-blind, no-treatment-controlled design, which “raises a significant likelihood of substantial risk of bias, limiting interpretability of the study results and their policy relevance.”

As of now, the trial appears to be suspended. Nature News reported that in a January 22 press conference, health officials in Guinea-Bissau said that a technical and ethical review was pending. “There has been no sufficient coordination in order to take a final decision regarding the study,” Quinhin Nantote, the minister of public health for Guinea-Bissau, said. “Faced with this situation, we decided to suspend it.”

Previously, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that the trial would not go forward. However, the US Department of Health and Human Services provided a statement saying that it was “proceeding as planned.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/santa-monica-deploys-ai-powered-parking-cameras-to-protect-bike-lanes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This spring, a Southern California beach town will become the first city in the country where municipal parking enforcement vehicles will use an AI system looking for potential bike lane violations.

Beginning in April, the City of Santa Monica will bring Hayden AI’s scanning technology to seven cars in its parking enforcement fleet, expanding beyond similar cameras already mounted on city buses.

“The more we can reduce the amount of illegal parking, the safer we can make it for bike riders,” Charley Territo, chief growth officer at Hayden AI, told Ars.

Hayden AI’s bus cameras, designed to detect bike lane and bus zone violations, currently exist in two other California cities: Oakland and Sacramento. The company also has installations around the country, including New York City, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia. In September 2025, the company announced that it had installed 2,000 systems on buses worldwide.

Late last year, over a 59-day period, Hayden AI also said its technology detected over 1,100 parking violations at the University of California, San Diego—and 88 percent of those were instances of blocking a bike lane.

Hayden AI says it sells its product to municipalities and related entities to not only increase bus speed (by removing obstructions) but also improve safety.

“We do that by [reducing] one of the biggest causes of collisions with buses—moving out of their lanes,” Territo added. “So the fewer times they have to make a turn, the fewer instances there are [of a crash].”

As part of its setup process, the San Francisco-based startup says that it begins any installation by first mapping a city. Then it teaches the AI the local parking enforcement rules. Typically, those rules say that cars can’t block a bike or bus lane. Traditionally, Hayden AI’s cameras have only been mounted on buses, so enforcement was limited to existing routes.

“We tell our system that if you see a vehicle that encroaches on a bike lane, capture a 10-second video and the license plate of that vehicle,” Territo said.

“From there, an evidence package goes to the [police] and they will review and verify the elements—that a prosecutable violation exists—and then they will issue a violation under [state law]. If there is no violation, the system doesn’t capture any data. The system is only looking for scenarios where a bike lane is blocked and a license plate is evident.”

Local bike advocates have applauded this expansion of automated enforcement.

“Enforcement cannot be everywhere at once. If we can extend their arm so these things can get done, and keep our community safe, that is a win,” Cynthia Rose, the director of Santa Monica Spoke, told Ars. While warning of the potential misuse of bulk data collection in general, Rose was on board with Hayden AI’s particular plan.

“Anywhere where there’s bike infrastructure, where I know of, [blocking the lane] is a problem,” Rose said. “It’s tantamount to parking in handicapped zones. It’s just a flat no.”</div>

            <h2>Verizon imposes new roadblock on users trying to unlock paid-off phones</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-makes-customers-wait-35-days-to-unlock-fully-paid-off-phones/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Verizon this week imposed a new roadblock for people who want to pay off device installment plans early in order to get their phones unlocked. The latest version of Verizon’s device unlocking policy for postpaid customers imposes a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off their device installment plan online or in the Verizon app.

Payments made over the phone also trigger a 35-day waiting period, as do payments made at Verizon Authorized Retailers. Getting an immediate unlock apparently requires paying off the device plan at a Verizon corporate store.

Unlocking a phone allows it to be used on another network, letting customers switch from one carrier to another. Previously, the 35-day waiting period for unlocks was only applied when a customer paid off the plan with a Verizon gift card.

“If you payoff [sic] a device payment agreement balance online or in the My Verizon App, or if a Verizon Gift Card is used to purchase a smartphone or pay off a remaining balance, the unlocking process will be delayed by 35 days,” the current version of the policy says. “This window allows for the verification of the gift card’s funds to ensure they were not obtained through fraudulent or illegal means.”

The paragraph above only explains why the waiting period is necessary for gift-card payments despite applying the 35-day wait to online and app payments as well. In a previous version of the policy that was implemented on January 27 and still in place as of February 9, the 35-day waiting period applied only when a Verizon gift card is used to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance.

The 35-day waiting period provision was changed to include online and app payments by February 11. We were made aware of the most recent change thanks to a tip from Ars forum member User_E.

Despite the significant update that happened this week, Verizon still lists the effective date of the device unlocking policy as January 27. It thus appears that Verizon is applying the 35-day wait after online and app payments retroactively, without disclosing that the policy changed after January 27.

The 35-day waiting period seems to apply regardless of how long the phone has been in use. For example, if you were 18 months into one of Verizon’s 36-month device installment plans and decided to pay the remaining balance early and switch carriers, you’d still have to wait 35 days for an unlock in most scenarios.

A Verizon spokesperson told Ars today that customers meeting the requirements for a quick unlock will “typically” receive it within 24 hours. But “if you pay online, through the app, or use a ‘non-secure’ method (like a Verizon Gift Card, paper check, or magnetic stripe swipe), there is a 35-day security delay before the unlock triggers to prevent fraud,” the spokesperson said. Verizon did not explain why the device unlocking policy still has an effective date of January 27 despite the change made this week.

It is possible to pay off an installment plan early by going to a Verizon store. But there are limits on this, too. Another Verizon FAQ says the company will unlock a phone “when you use a secure payment type at a Verizon store. Payments made through your account online, in the My Verizon app, a Verizon Authorized Retailer, or by phone delay the unlock by 35 days.” It’s not clear when this FAQ was last updated.

The Verizon Authorized Retailer limitation means that to get a quick unlock, you have to go to a Verizon corporate store rather than a Verizon Authorized Retailer that isn’t owned by Verizon. Verizon corporate stores accounted for only about 20 percent of Verizon stores, according to Wave7 research cited in a 2021 Fierce Network article.

As for the “secure payment type” requirement, you can satisfy that by paying with cash, a credit card with an EMV chip, or contactless payment method like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. The requirements may be different for consumer and business customers. A Verizon business FAQ says paying off a device using a bill credit also triggers a 35-day wait, but that caveat isn’t mentioned in the Verizon consumer FAQ.

Even if you happen to live near a Verizon corporate store, it’s still less convenient than paying online or in an app. A customer can alternatively buy a phone from Verizon at full price at the beginning to get it unlocked right away, but not everyone will want to or be able to do that.

“Devices purchased directly from Verizon are locked to our network. Devices will be unlocked automatically when purchased at full retail price or if the device financing agreement balance is paid in full,” the unlocking policy for postpaid devices says, right before disclosing the 35-day waiting period that applies in various scenarios.

There shouldn’t be a wait for unlocking if a customer pays off a device plan on schedule via automatic payments. Verizon confirmed to Ars that “if a Verizon customer has automatic monthly payments set up on a device payment plan, the device is automatically unlocked after the final scheduled payment.”

Verizon’s latest unlocking policy for prepaid devices is simpler than its postpaid policy but still locks customers to the Verizon network for a year. “Devices purchased from us will remain locked to the network until the completion of 365 days of paid and active service,” the prepaid device unlocking policy says. “After 365 days of paid and active service, we will automatically remove the lock unless the device is deemed stolen or purchased fraudulently.”

Despite using the phrase “automatically remove the lock” in reference to prepaid devices in its device unlocking policy, Verizon seems to contradict this on an FAQ page by saying that prepaid customers must request an unlock after 365 days. Unlocks are made “upon request” if a customer meets the criteria, the page says.

Until recently, the US government required Verizon to unlock handsets automatically after 60 days, via rules imposed on 700 MHz spectrum licenses and merger conditions imposed on Verizon’s purchase of TracFone. The Federal Communications Commission eliminated the 60-day unlocking requirement on January 12 for all phones activated on Verizon’s network after the FCC decision. Verizon says it is still honoring 60-day unlocks for phones bought from its flagship brand before January 27.

The AT&T policy says postpaid phones purchased at least 60 days ago can be unlocked when the device is paid in full. The T-Mobile policy says that postpaid phones active on the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days can be unlocked after being paid in full. AT&T has a six-month waiting period for unlocking prepaid phones, while T-Mobile has a 365-day waiting period for prepaid phones.

A week after the FCC ruling, Verizon started enforcing a 365-day lock period on phones purchased through its TracFone division. Customers of TracFone and other “Verizon Value” brands have to request unlocks after the year is over as Verizon doesn’t promise to unlock phones automatically for those subsidiary brands.

The policy for Verizon’s flagship brand promises automatic unlocks, albeit with the new restrictions and waits described earlier in this article. John Bergmayer, legal director of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, told Ars today that he doesn’t understand why Verizon isn’t offering immediate unlocks to people who pay their bills online.

“Gift cards, sure, are a pretty high-fraud area. But most people pay their bills online with normal credit cards. It’s hard to see what is likely the most common way people pay Verizon as being somehow high-risk,” he said.

Verizon also shouldn’t apply the change retroactively, he said. “People should be able to benefit from the policy that was in place on the day they bought the phone,” Bergmayer told Ars.

Public Knowledge and other consumer advocacy groups urged the FCC last year to reject Verizon’s petition to end the 60-day unlocking requirement, but the FCC sided with Verizon. Although the federal rules have changed, Verizon can be forced to uphold its previous terms in cases where the company tries to change them retroactively.

In December, we wrote about a man who sued Verizon and won after the firm retroactively tried to enforce a new policy and refused to unlock a phone he purchased before the policy change. In that case, Verizon decided it would only unlock phones after “60 days of paid active service” even though FCC rules at the time required unlocks 60 days after activation regardless of whether paid service was maintained.</div>

            <h2>Ring cancels Flock deal after dystopian Super Bowl ad prompts mass outrage</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/after-creepy-super-bowl-ad-sparks-outrage-ring-abandons-flock-deal/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon and Flock Safety have ended a partnership that would’ve given law enforcement access to a vast web of Ring cameras.

The decision came after Amazon faced substantial backlash for airing a Super Bowl ad that was meant to be warm and fuzzy, but instead came across as disturbing and dystopian.

The ad begins with a young girl surprised to receive a puppy as a gift. It then warns that 10 million dogs go missing annually. Showing a series of lost dog posters, the ad introduces a new “Search Party” feature for Ring cameras that promises to revolutionize how neighbors come together to locate missing pets.

At that point, the ad takes a “creepy” turn, Sen. Ed Markey (D.-Mass.) told Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a letter urging changes to enhance privacy at the company.

Illustrating how a single Ring post could use AI to instantly activate searchlights across an entire neighborhood, the ad shocked critics like Markey, who warned that the same technology could easily be used to “surveil and identify humans.”

Markey suggested that in blasting out this one frame of the ad to Super Bowl viewers, Amazon “inadvertently revealed the serious privacy and civil liberties risks attendant to these types of Artificial Intelligence-enabled image recognition technologies.”

In his letter, Markey also shared new insights from his prior correspondence with Amazon that he said exposed a wide range of privacy concerns. Ring cameras can “collect biometric information on anyone in their video range,” he said, “without the individual’s consent and often without their knowledge.” Among privacy risks, Markey warned that Ring owners can retain swaths of biometric data, including face scans, indefinitely. And anyone wanting face scans removed from Ring cameras has no easy solution and is forced to go door to door to request deletions, Markey said.

On social media, other critics decried Amazon’s ad as “awfully dystopian,” declaring it was “disgusting to use dogs to normalize taking away our freedom to walk around in public spaces.” Some feared the technology would be more likely to benefit police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers than families looking for lost dogs.

Amazon’s partnership with Flock, announced last October as coming soon, only inflamed those fears. So did the company’s recent rollout of a feature using facial recognition technology called “Familiar Faces”—which Markey considers so invasive, he has demanded that the feature be paused.

“What this ad doesn’t show: Ring also rolled out facial recognition for humans,” Markey posted on X. “I wrote to them months ago about this. Their answer? They won’t ask for your consent. This definitely isn’t about dogs—it’s about mass surveillance.”

Amazon’s ad ended with Harry Nilsson wailing “Without You,” as the young girl reunites with her lost dog. A final message confirms that Ring’s Search Party helps locate “more than a dog a day,” and Amazon clearly hoped this emotional use case would help increase sales.

Instead, the ad created a PR disaster. Protesting the Flock partnership and railing against the ad, Ring customers posted videos where they destroyed Ring cameras or vowed to never purchase them. Others posted on Reddit, sharing tips on how to get refunds for Ring cameras. Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger told The Verge that Amazon is not exploring any other similar integrations in the aftermath of the deal ending.

But while Ring may have hurt its brand, WebProNews, which reports on business strategy in the tech industry, suggested that “the fallout may prove more consequential for Flock Safety than for Ring.” For Flock, the Ring partnership represented a meaningful expansion of their business and “data collection capabilities,” WebProNews reported. And because this all happened around one of the most-watched TV events of the year, other tech companies may be more hesitant to partner with Flock after Amazon dropped the integration and privacy advocates witnessed the seeming power of their collective outrage.

After the backlash, Ring and Flock issued statements confirming the partnership would not proceed as planned.

Both statements verified that the integration never launched and that no Ring customers’ videos were ever sent to Flock.

Ring did not credit users’ privacy concerns for its change of heart. Instead, they claimed that a joint decision was made “following a comprehensive review” where Ring “determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.”

Separately, Flock said that “we believe this decision allows both companies to best serve their respective customers and communities.”

The only hint that Ring gave users that their concerns had been heard came in the last line of its blog, which said, “We’ll continue to carefully evaluate future partnerships to ensure they align with our standards for customer trust, safety, and privacy.”

Sharing his views on X and Bluesky, John Scott-Railton, a senior cybersecurity researcher at the Citizen Lab, joined critics calling Ring’s statement insufficient. He posted an image of the ad frame that Markey found creepy next to a statement from Ring, writing, “On the left? A picture of mass surveillance from #Ring’s ad. On the right? A ring [spokesperson] saying that they are not doing mass surveillance. The company cannot have it both ways.”

Ring’s statements so far do not “acknowledge the real issue,” Scott-Railton said, which is privacy risks. For Ring, it seemed like a missed opportunity to discuss or introduce privacy features to reassure concerned users, he suggested, noting the backlash showed “Americans want more control of their privacy right now” and “are savvy enough to see through sappy dog pics.”

“Stop trying to build a surveillance dystopia consumers didn’t ask for” and “focus on shipping good, private products,” Scott-Railton said.

He also suggested that lawmakers should take note of the grassroots support that could possibly help pass laws to push back on mass surveillance. That could help block not just a potential future partnership with Flock, but possibly also stop Ring from becoming the next Flock.

“Ring communications not acknowledging the lesson they just got publicly taught is a bad sign that they hope this goes away,” Scott-Railton said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Surprise, surprise: all that climate stuff scientists have been warning us about is coming back to bite us. And by us, of course, we mean all of humanity.

As reported by the Guardian, scientists just published a warning that Earth is approaching a point of no return. A new study in the journal One Earth shows multiple climate systems — the Greenland ice sheet, the West Antarctic ice sheet, boreal permafrost, the Amazon rainforest — are all much closer to collapse than previously thought.

“Research shows that several Earth system components may be closer to destabilising than once believed,” the researchers urged. “While the exact risk is uncertain, it is clear that current climate commitments are insufficient.”

The analysis is based on climate “tipping points,” meaning collapses of environmental systems that lead other climate systems beyond their own tipping points, creating a snowball scenario where the planet spirals into a worst-case-scenario known as “hothouse Earth.” Under this scenario, the long-term temperature is projected to rise about 9 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial averages — which would be really bad.

“Crossing even some of the [tipping point] thresholds could commit the planet to a hothouse trajectory,” said Christopher Wolf, a scientist at the environmental group Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Associates. “Policymakers and the public remain largely unaware of the risks posed by what would effectively be a point-of-no-return transition.”

What makes this all particularly insulting is the fact that the poor people of the world — those who will suffer the earliest and deepest losses as a result of climate change — are powerless to stop these tipping points from boiling over. And not for lack of will: the global climate movement is growing steadily, as Americans have perhaps never been more aware that climate change will impact the low-income people of the world the most.

Unfortunately, the power to reverse these decisions doesn’t belong to the people, but to a small cabal of the ultra-rich. The future of the planet is so far out of our control that some environmental experts argue not even the world’s most powerful governments can stop the collapse.

As University of Manitoba professor David Camfield and author of the 2022 book “Future on Fire: Capitalism and the Politics of Climate Change” has explained, the level of political power held by the ultra-rich and their corporations is so immense that even a government with popular support and commitment to emissions cuts would struggle under the weight of corporate investment strikes, pressure from credit agencies, and catastrophic market disruption.

“To weaken those political obstacles sufficiently that a government could get a just transition underway would take massive pressure of the kind that only movements can unleash,” Camfield asserts.

The math, in other words, is brutal. Capitalism’s logic demands unending accumulation of wealth, leading to a world in which corporations must grow or die, no matter the consequences. To transition out of this mess would mean weakening capital’s entire grip on power — something which has only ever been achieved when the great masses of toiling people come together to demand a better world.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Microsoft continues to force AI features onto users of its Windows operating system and other crucial software, glaring issues keep cropping up. Executives have promised to turn the platform into an “agentic OS” to the dismay of many users, with CEO Satya Nadella boasting that much of the company’s code is now being written by AI — while condemning those who use the newly-minted pejorative “Microslop.”

While new bugs in an operating system software update are certainly commonplace, some have noticed that the problem is getting worse than usual these days. Just last month, some Windows 11 enterprise users were aggravated after finding that their systems were stuck in an endless shutdown loop, a security risk if left unattended.

Even the company’s Notepad app, which once allowed users to jot down notes in plain text, has turned into a bloated, AI-enhanced security liability. As malware researchers from the collective vx-underground found, the app has a “remote code execution zero-day” — meaning a vulnerability in software unknown even to its creators.

According to Microsoft documentation of the bug, “improper neutralization of special elements used in a command (‘command injection’) in Windows Notepad App allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network.”

“An attacker could trick a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to launch unverified protocols that load and execute remote files,” the documentation reads. (Markdown is a language for formatting text.)

While the bug was patched in Microsoft’s monthly security updates, it’s yet another instance of a tech company pushing AI features on its customers against their will — with potentially disastrous results. Case in point, Microsoft’s AI “Recall” feature, which was designed to quietly take screenshots of users’ screens every few seconds, turned out to be an enormous security nightmare in late 2024, forcing the Windows team to go back to the drawing board. While it was pushed to users in mid-2025, experts continue to warn that it’s a privacy nightmare and far too risky to be used.

The latest Notepad bug is symptomatic of a much larger struggle for the tech giant. Last week, the Wall Street Journal published an investigation, quoting current and former employees, who found that Microsoft’s confusing branding and grating lack of cohesion between its AI products had frustrated and turned off users. Worse yet, the adoption rate of its Copilot AI chatbot, which was baked into Windows 11, is extremely slim, suggesting a significant lack of public enthusiasm for the flagship feature.

To vx-underground, the latest Notepad vulnerability is a gross example of mission creep for an app that once served a far simpler function.

“Hot take: text editors don’t need network functionality,” the collective argued in a tweet.

Others tended to agree with that assessment.

“Notepad [remote code execution] in 2026?” the account for digital security firm Secure.com replied. “We really out here weaponizing the .txt file because we just HAD to have AI in our basic editor.”

“If ur text editor has enough network functionality to trigger a remote shell, ur basically building a playground for attackers,” the account added.

Some lamented the end of a far simpler, basic text-editing tool.

“Microsoft is turning Notepad into a slow, feature-heavy mess we don’t need,” Polytechnic University of Catalonia computer engineer Manel Rodero tweeted, appending a screenshot of the documented vulnerability. “We just want something to open text files, not an AI-powered editor with security holes like this.”

“Who the hell is in charge of this development?” he added.

“Obviously, an issue like this puts polarizing features under a microscope, and I totally get the innovation pursuit, but this feels like a prime example of a solution in search of a problem,” IT systems engineer Nathan Kasco responded.

Rodero argued that Windows had plenty of areas that “need real improvement, but “instead, we keep getting visual tweaks and AI gimmicks that most users will never touch.”

Microsoft has struggled to convince many of its customers of the benefits of AI in its latest operating system, with hundreds of millions of users refusing to upgrade from Windows 10, as of late last year.

Many of the AI features that have been introduced leave plenty to be desired. Last month, programmer Ryan Fleury demonstrated that Windows 11’s AI-powered search bar struggled with the very basics, leading to plenty of other netizens calling the company “Microslop.”

Meanwhile, system administrators are forced to clean up after the company, making a mess of its core product.

“All this does is make system admins spend countless hours stripping out nonsense just to deploy a clean, well‑configured machine,” Rodero lamented.

            <div id="article-text">Folks, it finally happened: they gave a robot a sword.

Over the past few years, engineers have often used dancing and martial arts to showcase their humanoid robots. Now to ring in the Chinese New Year, some marketing genius decided to give a robot a sword, and the results are impressive.

Meet the robot nicknamed “Linghu Chong” by Chinese media, after a fictional swordfighter described by the twentieth-century novelist Jin Yong. The robot wields what the developers are calling the “Dugu Nine Swords,” a reference to a fictional fighting technique employed by Linghu Chong.

In the demo video shared by China News, the robot is seen practicing thrusts, kick flips, and slashes with a sword in hand. Unlike some clumsier bots, this unit — a Robotera L7 — has some top-notch motor skills, leaping and twirling without getting tangled up with its weapon.

According to the Robotera website, the L7 features 55 degrees of freedom, the number of independent movements a robot can make. Its arm features seven degrees of freedom, while its hand alone is said to boast 12.

That said, the L7 isn’t ready to do battle with humanity just yet — the human hand is commonly understood to have a whopping 27 degrees of freedom, meaning we still have a tactical advantage, at least in theory. Still, the fact that the L7 could execute such dynamic full-body movements in rapid-fire succession is undeniably impressive.

The L7 first made its debut in July of 2025 with help from Tsinghua University. When it was announced, Robotera emphasized its agility, showing off its breakdancing moves as well as its more practical capabilities in commercial environments.

It’s just one of many Chinese engineering accomplishments of late — evidence that, though it’ll soon be the year of the horse, the year of the armed robot may already be upon us.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, two cofounders of Elon Musk’s xAI abruptly announced their departure, meaning that half of the startup’s original 12 cofounders are now officially out.

And while Musk has since made the case that he was shaking up the company’s ranks as part of a “reorganization,” which “unfortunately required parting ways with some people,” several former staffers told The Verge that the reality is they grew frustrated with the company’s ethical carelessness and stagnating technological progress.

One source, who left earlier this year, told the outlet that xAI was “stuck in the catch-up phase” and struggling to differentiate itself from the competition.

“Although we were iterating really fast, we were never able to get to a point like, ‘Oh, we’ve made a step function change over what OpenAI or Anthropic or other companies had released,” he told The Verge.

The source also accused the company of putting safety last, calling it a “dead org at xAI.”

“There is zero safety whatsoever in the company — not in the image [model], not in the chatbot,” a second source who also recently left the company told the site, arguing that Musk is actively “trying to make the model more unhinged because safety means censorship, in a sense, to him.”

It’s a notable vote of no confidence, highlighting the toll of the endless controversies the company has been embroiled in. The company’s social media platform, X, has been overrun by non-consensual sexual images of women and even children, many of which were generated using xAI’s Grok chatbot.

The company’s handling of the crisis has left plenty to be desired, as CSAM continues to be a major issue on the platform.

Under Musk’s leadership, xAI has doubled down on adult content in an arguably desperate move to keep up with some extremely steep competition, a decision that appears to have backfired on the company.

Meanwhile, some staffers are seemingly looking for a more engaging place of work.

“Trying to do what OpenAI was doing a year ago is not how you beat OpenAI,” the second source told The Verge. “Everything is a catch-up. There’s almost zero risky bet. If something hasn’t been done before we’re not going to do it.”

Those who remain at the company have to endure Musk’s infamous managerial style.

“You survive by shutting up and doing what Elon wants,” the second source added.

The stakes are high. After being folded into Musk’s SpaceX, the joint company is gearing up for what could be the largest IPO in history. But going public may bring renewed scrutiny into the company’s operations — and given what we’ve seen so far, chances are xAI has plenty of other skeletons in the closet we don’t know about yet.

            <h2>Ring’s “Orwellian” Ad Was the Worst Super Bowl Disaster Since Kendall Jenner Handed the Cops a Pepsi</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a now-infamous 2017 commercial that aired during that year’s Super Bowl, Kendall Jenner handed a police officer confronting furious protesters a can of Pepsi.

The backlash of the ad, which aired as Black Lives Matter protesters clashed with law enforcement across the country, was swift and brutal. The tone deaf clip was overwhelmingly criticized for trivializing racial discrimination and police brutality, leading to Pepsi pulling the ad and issuing a public apology that was itself shredded by critics.

Now, Amazon’s home security subsidiary Ring, may have finally dethroned Pepsi’s disastrous ad as the biggest Super Bowl marketing disaster in recent history, in a debacle that ended with the company canceling a controversial partnership with an AI surveillance company in an apparent attempt to save face.

During last weekend’s Super Bowl, Ring aired an ad to show off a new function, called “Search Party,” which allowed Ring to access devices across an entire neighborhood to find lost pets.

The expensive ad massively missed the mark, accidentally implying that Ring cameras are creating an “Orwellian” surveillance network that goes far beyond lost pets. Furious customers started disconnecting and even reportedly destroying their Ring cameras, refusing to be part of a dystopian network of internet-connected spy cameras.

“I think (the commercial) surprised a lot of Americans by revealing just how powerful surveillance networks backed by AI have become,” ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley told USA Today. “That power may be applied to puppies today, but where else might it be applied? Searches for people wearing t-shirts with certain political messages on them?”

The timing couldn’t have been worse, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents continue to round up civiliansacross the United States, triggering widespread panic and fear.

There are signs that Ring is paying attention. On Thursday, roughly four days after the ad aired, Amazon announced it was canceling its widely-criticized partnership with surveillance company Flock, a firm that makes footage from its connected devices available to local and federal police and enforcement agencies like ICE.

“Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated,” Ring wrote. “As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration. The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.”

Where the latest announcement leaves contested claims over Flock handing over private surveillance footage to federal immigration agents, including ICE, remains to be seen — but the optics certainly aren’t great as Ring continues to pick up the pieces following its disastrous Super Bowl ad.

“Cool, still never buying a Ring, especially after all this,” one furious Reddit user wrote in response to the latest news.

            <h2>Another OpenAI Researcher Just Quit in Disgust</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A mere two years ago, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed the idea of stuffing his company’s blockbuster chatbot ChatGPT with ads as a “last resort.” But as the company recently announced, users will be pestered by ads after all — an early sign of desperation as the company continues to lose billions of dollars every quarter.

The decision hasn’t sat well with insiders. This week, OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig declared in a New York Times essay that she was resigning from the company.

“I don’t believe ads are immoral or unethical,” she wrote. “AI is expensive to run, and ads can be a critical source of revenue. But I have deep reservations about OpenAI’s strategy.”

Hitzig argued that the risks of OpenAI exploiting its userbase with insidious advertisements were simply too steep.

“People tell chatbots about their medical fears, their relationship problems and their beliefs about God and the afterlife,” Hitzig argued. “Advertising built on that archive creates a potential for manipulating users in ways we don’t have the tools to understand, let alone prevent.”

While she wasn’t worried about the first generation of ads, which will be “clearly labeled” and “appear at the bottom of answers,” Hitzig is worried that subsequent iterations won’t “follow those principles.”

She compared OpenAI to Facebook, which once promised that users would maintain control over their data — a principle that was abandoned early on, in dramatic fashion.

“So the real question is not ads or no ads,” she wrote. “It is whether we can design structures that avoid excluding people from these tools and potentially manipulating them as consumers. I think we can.”

The subject hit a fever pitch over the weekend, when OpenAI competitor Anthropic aired several ads that claimed “ads are coming to AI,” but not to its chatbot Claude — without ever naming OpenAI directly — which sent Altman spiraling. He called the ads “dishonest” and accused the company of “doublespeak,” but whether there’s any truth to Anthropic’s ill-fated vision of the future remains to be seen as OpenAI works out how to implement ads.

We’ve seen other highly publicized departures from the Altman-led company over the last year, including economics researcher Tom Cunningham, who left after reportedly voicing concerns over AI being bad for the economy — warnings that could ultimately be prophetic.

Former OpenAI engineer Calvin French-Owen, who helped build the company’s coding agent Codex, also quit in July, painting a picture of corporate chaos behind the scenes.

Hitzig’s departure comes on the heels of Platformer reporting that OpenAI had disbanded its mission alignment team, which was created in 2024 to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”

Instead, the former team’s lead, Joshua Achiam, reportedly took on the role of “chief futurist” at OpenAI.

Hitzig is only the latest in a series of high-profile departures. On Monday, Anthropic researcher Mrinank Sharma announced his resignation after posting a cryptic letter on X that was painfully devoid of specifics, but highlighted concerns over the safety of the tech being developed by the Claude chatbot maker.

“We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences,” he wrote.

At least half of Elon Musk’s xAI’s 12 cofounders have also now quit. Earlier this week, two of them publicly announced their resignation within just 24 hours.

Neither of them made any mention of safety concerns, suggesting the departures weren’t a matter of principle. That’s despite the company’s chatbot Grok being tied up in a growing scandal over the dissemination of deepfake pornography and child sexual abuse material (CSAM.)

In short, all three companies — OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI — are seeing a steady outflow of talent, right at the moment when they seem most desperate for a business model.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Much of Silicon Valley has spent years chasing mega-rounds and buzzy AI deals. Meanwhile, Stacy Brown-Philpot is running Cherryrock Capital like a throwback to venture capital’s earlier days, writing smaller Series A and B checks to founders that larger firms routinely overlook.

The former TaskRabbit CEO and decade-long Google veteran launched Cherryrock a year ago after seeing what she calls a persistent gap: access to capital for “underinvested entrepreneurs” building software companies at the crucial growth stage.

“When I left TaskRabbit, I took some time off to figure out what was next and saw this gap in the market, which was access to capital, particularly for underinvested entrepreneurs,” Brown-Philpot told TechCrunch. She’d originally come to the Bay Area 25 years ago, planning to become a VC and even writing her Stanford Business School essay about it. After spending a decade at Google and leading TaskRabbit to a successful exit to IKEA, she’s finally back to that original plan.

She circled back to it for a reason. Before launching Cherryrock, Brown-Philpot was a member of the investment committee for the SoftBank Opportunity Fund, a $100 million vehicle started in 2020 to back underserved entrepreneurs. That experience proved there was no shortage of overlooked founders.

SoftBank itself sold the Opportunity Fund to its leadership team in late 2023, divesting from the diversity-focused initiative. Brown-Philpot, meanwhile, doubled down, and launched her own fund. By the time she closed Cherryrock’s debut fund in February 2025, she already had more than 2,000 companies in her pipeline.

Cherryrock is targeting 12 to 15 investments from its first fund — a concentrated approach and stark contrast to the seed funds that make dozens of bets, or massive funds that write nine-figure checks. Brown-Philpot’s also taking her time; a year after announcing the fund, she and her team, including cofounder Saydeah Howard, who spent nine years at the venture firm IVP, have backed just five companies, putting them about a third of the way toward their goal. In an era when many funds race to deploy capital almost as quickly as it’s raised, Brown-Philpot’s measured pace is another throwback to an earlier generation of VCs.

Brown-Philpot’s focus on “underinvested” founders — a careful choice of words in today’s political climate — means backing entrepreneurs who might not fit the typical Silicon Valley mold.

When asked directly about the current political environment, where DEI has become a lightning rod, Brown-Philpot is unfazed. “It doesn’t change the pitch at all,” she said. “When we look at the people who decided to back Cherryrock, like JPMorgan and Bank of America…these are financial institutions who expect to generate a return. Our job as investors is to do just that.”

In addition to those investors, Cherryrock’s LP roster includes Goldman Sachs Asset Management, MassMutual, Top Tier Capital Partners, and Melinda Gates’s Pivotal Ventures. Some of these have stepped back from explicit diversity pledges amid pressure from the Trump administration. Yet Brown-Philpot may find herself in an unexpectedly advantageous position.

A new diversity reporting law in California requires VC firms with a California nexus to report demographic data on their portfolio companies’ founding teams, with the first deadline in April. Unlike some corporate diversity initiatives that have faced legal challenges, the law focuses on transparency rather than mandates, requiring reporting but not quotas. For a firm like Cherryrock that’s already tracking and prioritizing investments in diverse founders, compliance is “table stakes,” as Brown-Philpot puts it. “You accomplish what you measure.”

Brown-Philpot’s perspective is informed by her vantage point across multiple institutions. Beyond Cherryrock, she sits on the boards of HP, StockX, and Stanford University — roles that give her insight into both enterprise buyers and the next generation of founders. At Stanford, she’s watching students navigate questions about AI’s impact on employment. “What I see on campus is the students are charting a path and finding a way to create opportunities for themselves,” she said.

Her portfolio reflects her thesis. One investment is Coactive AI, led by Cody Coleman, an MIT grad with advanced degrees in philosophy and engineering from MIT and Stanford. The company provides multimodal AI infrastructure to the media and entertainment industry, a sector now under intense scrutiny following controversies around AI-generated content. Cherryrock led Coactive’s Series B alongside Emerson Collective.

Another bet is Vitable Health, founded by Joseph Kitonga, a Thiel Fellow and Y Combinator alum. The Philadelphia-based company provides on-demand, primary care-based health insurance to employers and hourly workers – the kind of population Brown-Philpot came to know well as the CEO of TaskRabbit during its last years as a standalone company. Kitonga “is the exact kind of founder that we want to back,” Brown-Philpot said. “He does what he says he’s going to do.” Brown-Philpot first invested at the seed stage of Vitable through her work with the SoftBank Opportunity Fund.

When asked about her operating philosophy, Brown-Philpot is pragmatic about exits. “It’s very difficult to go public,” she said. “Most companies don’t go public, they do get acquired.” It’s a refreshingly honest take in an industry that often overpromises on IPO prospects. She points to TaskRabbit’s sale to IKEA as proof that the right acquisition can create lasting value.

As for 2026, Brown-Philpot’s priority is simple: “We are actively deploying capital.” She’s looking for Series A and B companies that have achieved product-market fit at scale, letting founders define what that means. And while the broader venture ecosystem debates the future of diversity initiatives, she is focused on finding great founders, wherever they are.

“I’m from Detroit,” she says. “Hard things are hard, but we know how to do hard things.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Much has changed for Jenny Wang, the founder who’s bringing “Clueless” fashion tech to life.

Last year, her company, Alta, raised $11 million in a round led by Menlo Ventures to let users create digital closets and try on their clothes with their own virtual avatars. It’s a tech once seen only in movies, most notably in “Clueless,” where Cher styles and plans her outfits using computer technology. Alta is similar to that, allowing users to plan and style outfits using the latest AI innovations.

A slew of big names participated in Atla’s round last year, including models Jasmine Tookes and Karlie Kloss, Anthropic’s VC arm Anthology Fund, and Rent the Runway cofounder Jenny Fleiss.

TechCrunch caught up with Wang during New York Fashion Week to talk about how the company has expanded since that round.

For starters, the product is officially in the app store; Time and Vogue named it one of the best innovations of last year, and Wang said more than 100 million outfits have been generated on the platform since its launch in 2023.  It has partnerships with Poshmark and the Council of Fashion Designers of America, with more partnerships to be announced soon.

“Alta’s own app also features thousands of brands that users can shop from,” Wang said.

Right now, the company is focused on building app and website integration experiences for brands, she said, where customers can try on a designer’s clothing using a personalized Alta Avatar. This week, the company unveiled its first integration collaboration, teaming up with Public School, a storied New York City brand.

“Shoppers can style looks from the new collection on their own Alta avatar,” Wang said.

She met the Public School team — Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne — through the founder of Poshmak, who is also an angel investor in both companies.

“Public School designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne had been looking for an AI partner and virtual try-on avatar solution, and Dao-Yi has been an Alta app user himself,” Wang said.

Public School actually went on hiatus for a few years, with this NYFW marking its grand re-debut. When asked, the founders of the brand said they rediscovered their voices and what they wanted to say.

“We have to look at tech as a partner in the business today,” Chow told TechCrunch, adding, “It’s not 2015 anymore,” so the team wants to take advantage of the latest technological developments. “We want to be thoughtful on how we use tech and AI,” he continued, “not as a design tool but as a tool to extend our storytelling and a tool to interact with the consumer and have them experience the brand even if they can’t do so in person.”

Wang said this is one of the first instances of a designer embedding personal avatar and styling technology into its own website. Near the bottom of Public School’s product page, there is an icon that says Style by Alta. Clicking that takes the customer to Alta for them to then style their avatars and test out how Public School clothing would look on them, should they purchase.

Users on Alta’s standalone app can also access Public School through Alta’s app. Wang said the goal is for Alta to integrate more experiences like this into other brands and websites, so Alta users can try on clothes on other websites even while outside the Alta app.

“Right now, a user would have to add a potential purchase into their Alta wishlist, then style outfits and try on their avatar, versus being able to do that directly on the brand website.” (For every site but Public School, that is.) “The goal is to bring their community on a new journey to engage with and shop the brand.”

Many major fashion brands, like Zara and Balmain, have already experimented with digital avatars. Wang said what makes Alta different here, especially compared to Zara, is that Alta avatars can put on at least 8 items within seconds, whereas Zara avatars can wear only four and often take around two minutes.

Overall, demand for virtual avatars has increased. Wang considers Alta both still the “Cluless”  technology that it started out with, and a digital avatar business.

“The consumer Alta app is the ‘Clueless’ closet, while the enterprise Alta experience allows shoppers to style pieces and try the outfits on their pre-existing Alta avatar,” he said. Eventually, Wang said she wants Alta to be the “personal identity layer for the future of consumer AI and shopping.”

For agentic commerce to truly work, she said, “We need a data layer that understands the shopper’s style preferences, such as their closet, past purchases, and their avatar, likeness, and body, which is Alta.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hollywood organizations are pushing back against a new AI video model called Seedance 2.0, which they say has quickly become a tool for “blatant” copyright infringement.

ByteDance, the Chinese company that recently finalized a deal to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations (it retains a stake in the new joint venture), launched Seedance 2.0 earlier this week.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the updated model is currently available to Chinese users of ByteDance’s Jianying app, and the company says it will soon be available to global users of its CapCut app.

Similar to tools such as OpenAI’s Sora, Seedance allows users to create videos (currently limited to 15 seconds in length) by just entering a text prompt. And like Sora, Seedance quickly drew criticism for an apparent lack of guardrails around the ability to create videos using the likeness of real people, as well as studios’ intellectual property.

After one X user posted a brief video showing Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt, which they said was created by “a 2 line prompt in seedance 2,” “Deadpool” screenwriter Rhett Reese responded, “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”

The Motion Picture Association soon issued a statement from CEO Charles Rivkin demanding that ByteDance “immediately cease its infringing activity.”

“In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,” Rivkin said. “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”

The Human Artistry Campaign — an initiative backed by Hollywood unions and trade groups — condemned Seedance 2.0 as “an attack one very creator around the world,” while the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA said it “stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement enabled by Bytedance’s new AI video model Seedance 2.0.”

Seedance videos have apparently featured Disney-owned characters such as Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and Grogu, better known as Baby Yoda, prompting the company to take legal action. Axios reports that Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter accusing ByteDance of a “virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP”and claiming the Chinese company is “hijacking Disney’s characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring those characters.”

Disney isn’t necessarily opposed to working with AI companies — while it has reportedly sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google over similar issues, it’s signed a three-year licensing deal with OpenAI.

TechCrunch has reached out to ByteDance for comment.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/designer-kate-barton-teams-up-with-ibm-and-fiducia-ai-for-a-nyfw-presentation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Saturday, designer Kate Barton will unveil her latest collection at New York Fashion Week — with a twist, of course. Barton teamed up with Fiducia AI to create a multilingual AI agent (built with IBM Watsonx on IBM Cloud) to help guests identify pieces of the collection and try them on virtually.

TechCrunch caught up with Barton and Ganesh Harinath, the founder and CEO of Fiducia AI, before the show to learn more about the presentation.

For one, Barton said technology is baked into how she thinks. She likes playing with the real and the unreal, and found the idea of using AI-like set design, “a portal into the collection’s world, rather than ‘AI for AI’s sake,” she said.

“Today, tech is a tool for expanding the world around the clothes, how they are presented, and how people enter the story, and how we create that moment when your eyes do a double-take,” she told TechCrunch, adding that the goal for this collection was to create a sense of curiosity.

Harinath said his company used IBM watsonx, IBM Cloud, and IBM Cloud Object Storage to help pull off Barton’s presentation. It was a production-grade activation with a Visual AI lens (built with IBM watsonx) that detects pieces from Barton’s new collection. It can answer questions in any language via voice and text and offers photorealistic virtual reality try-ons.

“The hardest work wasn’t model tuning; it was orchestration,” he told TechCrunch. This isn’t the first time Barton has put a technological spin on her fashion — last season, she experimented with AI models, also in collaboration with Fiduicia AI.

At fashion week, there was some chatter about whether brands — and, if so, which ones — would be using technology and artificial intelligence. Barton thinks many brands are using AI, though quietly, mainly in operations. “Maybe fewer are using it publicly because of the potential reputational risk,” she said.

It rhymes a bit with the early days when many big fashion names were nervous about starting websites. “Then it became inevitable, and eventually the question shifted from ‘should we be online’ to ‘is our online presence any good?’” she said.

Harinath added that, though many brands are experimenting with AI, much of its deployment remains at the surface level — such as chatbots, content generation, and internal productivity tools.

But Barton sees a world of better prototyping, better visualization, smarter production decisions, and more immersive ways to experience fashion, without replacing the humans who “actually make it worth wearing.” Change will only come with more clarity, she said, with “clear discourse, clear licensing, clear credit, and a shared understanding that human creativity is not an annoying overhead cost.”

“If the technology is used to erase people, I am not into it,” she said, adding that audiences are smarter than we think. “They can tell the difference between invention and avoidance.”

Despite the tension, AI is becoming more routine, and there will come a day when shows like Barton’s are just part of the norm. Harinath thinks AI in fashion will be normalized by 2028, and by 2030, he sees it becoming embedded into the operational core of retail.

“Most of this technology already exists — the differentiator now is assembling the right partners and building teams that can operationalize it responsibly,” he said.

Dee Waddell, Global Head of Consumer, Travel and Transportation Industries at IBM Consulting, agreed. “When inspiration, product intelligence, and engagement are connected in real time, AI moves from being a feature to becoming a growth engine that drives measurable competitive advantage,” Waddell told TechCrunch.

“The most exciting future for fashion is not automated fashion,” Barton said. “It is fashion that uses new tools to heighten craft, deepen storytelling, and bring more people into the experience, without flattening the people who make it.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/14/india-doubles-down-on-state-backed-venture-capital-approving-1-1b-fund/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India has cleared a $1.1 billion state-backed venture capital program that will channel government money into startups through private investors, doubling down on its effort to finance high-risk areas such as artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing and other sectors broadly referred to by the industry as deep tech.

First outlined in the January 2025 budget speech by India’s finance minister, the ₹100 billion fund won cabinet approval this week (more than a year after the speech), allowing the government to move ahead with deployment. A previous iteration of the program, launched in 2016, committed ₹100 billion to 145 private funds that have invested more than ₹255 billion (about $2.8 billion) in over 1,370 startups, according to official data released on Saturday.

The program is structured as a fund of funds, a common venture capital model in which governments back startups indirectly by committing capital to private investment firms. It is designed to take a more targeted approach than its 2016 counterpart, focusing on deep-tech and manufacturing startups that typically require longer time horizons and larger amounts of capital, while also backing early-stage founders, expanding investment beyond major cities and strengthening India’s domestic venture capital industry, particularly smaller funds, per the Indian government.

At the announcement on Saturday, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw highlighted the scale of India’s startup expansion, pointing to figures shown on a presentation slide indicating the number of startups has grown from fewer than 500 in 2016 to more than 200,000 today. The slide said more than 49,000 startups were registered in 2025 alone, the highest annual total on record.

The cabinet approval follows recent changes to India’s startup rules aimed at easing pressure on deep-tech companies. New Delhi doubled the period for which such firms are classified as startups to 20 years and raised the revenue threshold for startup-specific tax, grant and regulatory benefits to ₹3 billion, or about $33 million, up from ₹1 billion previously.

The approval comes just ahead of the government-backed India AI Impact Summit, where global AI companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia are set to participate alongside Indian corporates such as Reliance Industries and Tata Group. India, the world’s most populous country and one of its largest internet markets with more than a billion online users, has become an increasingly attractive arena for global tech companies looking to expand their user base.

At the same time, private capital has become harder to secure. India’s startup ecosystem raised $10.5 billion in 2025, down just over 17% from a year earlier, even as investors grew more selective and sharply reduced the number of deals. The number of funding rounds fell nearly 39% to 1,518 transactions, according to data from Tracxn.

Vaishnaw said the new venture capital program would remain flexible, adding that “extensive consultations have taken place with all stakeholders.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nothing, the hardware company backed by Tiger Global, is opening its first retail store in India, its biggest market. The store is located in Bengaluru, where the company says a large chunk of its user base is concentrated.

The new, two-story location will showcase Nothing’s products and other projects. Customers will also be able to buy hardware products and other merchandise from the store and have select items customized.

“We wanted to create a fun space,” the company’s co-founder and CEO Carl Pei said. “It’s kind of inspired by all the parts that are related to the brand. For instance, the factory: if you buy a product, there’s like a production line where the product comes out. We also show machines where phones go through testing, like USB port testing or water resistance testing. So we just wanted to bring that world together.”

The store will feature products from both Nothing and CMF, its budget brand, which it spun off last year. Notably, CMF is headquartered in India and has a joint venture with local Indian ODM (original design manufacturer), Optiemus.

Pei mentioned that both brands are differentiated in terms of the products they offer, which fall into different price ranges, as well as the audiences they target.

“Nothing is more niche with a higher price. CMF is more [targeted toward] mass [market]. You know it’s mass, but it’s not just off-the-shelf rebrand products that usually [appear] in this price point. They are also products that we put a lot of care into,” he said.

India has been Nothing’s strongest market, with over 2% of the smartphone market share, the research firm IDC told TechCrunch last year. It also noted that Nothing was the fastest-growing brand in the country in Q2 2025, with 85% growth in shipments year-over-year.

Other hardware makers are building aspirational retail stores in India, too. For instance, Apple is set to open its sixth store in the country this month, situated in Borivali, a suburb of Mumbai.

This is the first Nothing store outside of London, where the company is headquartered. The startup said that it plans to open two more stores in Tokyo and New York, but didn’t provide timelines for the openings.

The company raised $200 million in Series C funding at a $1.3 billion valuation last year, led by Tiger Global, along with investors like GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF, and Tapestry. Nothing has raised $450 million to date.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The coffee corner at Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich is so mobbed with diplomats and executives exchanging business cards and guzzling caffeine that it’s easy to miss even the most recognizable faces. And Jens-Frederik Nielsen is not one of those.

Still, the baby-faced prime minister of Greenland was surrounded by throngs of people looking to shake his hand, pass him their card, or take a selfie with him at the annual Munich Security Conference, the first major get-together of European defense and security officials since his country became the center of a geopolitical melee. Nielsen, who is 34 years old, assumed office less than a year ago but has spent much of his term facing an assault on Greenland’s sovereignty by President Trump, who wants to acquire or annex the autonomous Danish territory—whether its citizens want it or not.

Over the thrumming of cappuccino machines and the clinking of coffee mugs, Nielsen told me he was having none of it. “That’s a red line,” he said. “We will not give away territory and compromise our integrity.”

Greenland has been the unlikely belle of the Munich ball as U.S., European, NATO, and other leaders try to hash out just how serious Trump’s threats are. Trump says he has ruled out taking Greenland by force. But given that he also earlier this year ordered a military raid, without Congressional approval, on Venezuela to remove its president, no one here views the crisis as over, especially not Nielsen. As I spoke with the prime minister, the White House released a series of satirical Valentine’s Day cards—among them, one with the map of Greenland inside a heart. The caption reads: “It’s time we define our situationship.”

Nielsen, with Scandinavian restraint, acknowledged that his country has faced “tense periods” of late. It will almost certainly face more soon. White House officials tell me the president remains fixated on Greenland and is unlikely to back down, even though there are now high-level talks underway about boosting the U.S. military presence there. At this month’s annual black-tie dinner at the Alfalfa Club (a Washington, D.C. society for muckety-mucks from politics and business), attendees told me that President Trump, in private conversations, reinforced his desire to “buy” Greenland, not invade it. (The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.)

When I shared that with Nielsen, he looked frustrated, but not surprised. “That is not acceptable,” he said. “We will not give it away. But in terms of more military personnel, and in terms of more cooperation and so on, let’s talk. Let’s have a conversation about it. We can figure things out.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who headlined the conference today, didn’t mention Greenland or the Arctic in his keynote speech. He didn’t mention China or Russia by name, either, though Trump has claimed that their intrusion into the Arctic underpins his desire for Greenland. Instead, Rubio offered a more conciliatory tone than allies have grown used to. At last year’s conference, Vice President J. D. Vance was met with stony silence after he suggested the “greatest threat looming over Europe comes not from China or Russia” but rather the “internal threat” within the continent. The Trump administration’s rhetoric and policies toward its European allies since then have largely echoed that sentiment.

Rubio drew applause from the crowd when he declared that the U.S. “will always be a child of Europe.” Still, he stressed the need to revitalize the alliance. “We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West’s managed decline,” he said, describing the decline as a “conscious policy choice.”

Read: Does America really want to pick a fight with Greenland?

Revitalization, to the Trump administration, hinges on American dominance in the Western Hemisphere—which includes Greenland despite its historic ties to Europe. Trump’s description of the dynamic blends the lingo of real-estate advice with the imperatives of national security. “You defend ownership, you don’t defend leases,” he told reporters at the White House last month.

Nielsen, who worked as a real-estate agent before entering politics in 2020, sees it differently. “It’s a matter of international law and sovereignty,” he told me. The son of a Danish father and a Greenlandic mother (and, as it happens, a national badminton champion), he talks of deep nationalism and pride that cannot be bought, but stressed that his citizens are open to cooperation.

Since Trump first expressed interest in Greenland in 2019, the country of 55,000 has seen throngs of companies looking to invest in the island’s abundant natural resources, which Nielsen welcomes as long as the approaches are coordinated with his government. Tourism has spiked. Once an economy that relied heavily on fishing, Greenland has embraced its unanticipated turn in the geopolitical spotlight by building infrastructure, including a new airport, which opened in the capital, Nuuk, in 2024. A bigger diplomatic presence also has arrived: The U.S. opened a consulate in Nuuk in 2020, its first since 1953; the European Union, Canada, and France have opened consulates since, the latter two in response to Trump’s renewed threats. Nielsen said he welcomes it all and more but added, “We want cooperation with mutual respect.”

Trump backed down, for now, on his threat to forcibly annex the country in large part because of how poorly his plans were received domestically. A new AP/NORC poll this week found that about seven in 10 U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of Greenland. That included about half of Republicans polled.

Nielsen has never met Trump, nor has he spoken with him, though Nielsen met yesterday with Rubio for a conversation that Nielsen described as “constructive.” Most of the discussions about Greenland’s sovereignty, Nielsen told me, have been conducted either through direct talks with the Danish government or through NATO—a process he believes is more productive. He repeatedly emphasized the progress being made by the working group formed after the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington last month with Vance and Rubio.

Nielsen worries about Greenland’s future being defined by anyone other than Greenland and Denmark, including by well-intentioned allies. But he was keen to offer an olive branch to Trump. “We are willing to talk also about the concerns he has about security,” Nielsen said. “We want to talk.” And with that, he turned to the next in line.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Since Donald Trump’s first term, Stephen Miller has risen into an architect and enforcer of some of the president’s most controversial policies. On Washington Week With The Atlantic, panelists joined to discuss the senior aide’s rise, and how he’s become one of the most powerful figures in the Trump administration.

Miller “has always believed that there is a role for provocation and performance in politics,” Atlantic staff writer McKay Coppins, who has previously written about how Miller’s childhood and college experience influenced his work, argued last night.

Between Trump’s first and second terms, Miller’s “ideology has been rather consistent. It’s that he’s more visible, more powerful, in this second term,” Zolan Kanno-Youngs, a White House correspondent at The New York Times, continued. But whereas Miller was once limited to “being the architect in overseeing immigration policy in the Department of Homeland Security,” Young said, he is now “trying to change the perception in the nation toward immigrants … and there’s more of a tolerance for the policies he’s trying to implement.”

Joining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Leigh Ann Caldwell, the chief Washington correspondent at Puck; McKay Coppins, a staff writer at The Atlantic; Zolan Kanno-Youngs, a White House correspondent at The New York Times; and Ashley Parker, a staff writer at The Atlantic.</div>

            <div id="article-text">“President Trump on Thursday announced he was erasing the scientific finding that climate change endangers human health and the environment, ending the federal government’s legal authority to control the pollution that is dangerously heating the planet.”  — The New York Times

A new ruling from the Trump administration says that when the sun disappears at night, we don’t know where it goes. All remaining top scientists have been taken from their positions and tasked with getting to the bottom of this.

The National Institutes of Health has orders to devote every whiteboard in every conference room to this pressing question. In the Oval Office, under the gold leaf, the president and his advisers are making a big list of possibilities:

The sun might be on the back of a big beetle—a dung beetle, maybe. (The EPA will work to determine what kind of beetle.) Where is the beetle going with it? Will the beetle bring it back?

Or maybe the witches take it. (They are pretty sure in the White House that witches are real.)

Maybe the immigrants steal the sun in the evenings.

Maybe the sun is the yellow scribble in the top corner of the page with sunglasses drawn on it in marker, and it disappears when someone puts it in a drawer. (But who? Emmanuel Macron?)

Maybe the sun is in Greenland. (If so, it is even more important to get control of Greenland.)

Maybe Bad Bunny has taken the sun hostage and is keeping it in his halftime grass. (He must be held to account.)

Maybe the groundhog knows. (Can the groundhog be made to talk?)

Maybe Jerome Powell has put the sun in his office.

Maybe the children have the sun, and we had better warehouse them all in Texas until one of them gives it up.

Maybe Mark Kelly and several other dissident members of Congress are hiding the sun in a big bag. (He got the bag when he was in space. Fortunately, soon only billionaires will be allowed to visit space and get the bags for the sun, and they will be required to give the bags to the president directly.)

Maybe Hillary Clinton ate it. (We put nothing past her.)

It’s very frightening when the sun goes away, now that we have decided we don’t know where it goes at night.

You can just decide that you don’t know things, it turns out, even if you do know them. You can simply decide to forget progress. Disease is caused by miasma, insufficient beef tallow, corn syrup, the evil eye. You can simply decide to burn coal and witches and books again.

Be especially sure to burn the books. We must do whatever we can to make light until the sun comes back.</div>

For as long as people have been looking for love, many have been convinced that they know exactly what it looks like. We might talk about having a “type”: someone with certain traits, habits, beliefs, or quirks that we assume will add up to a successful match. But that certainty is often an illusion, Olga Khazan writes.

Studies suggest that what people say they want in a partner rarely predicts whom they actually fall for—or whom they build a relationship with. Chemistry, timing, shared experiences, and the slow work of falling in love with someone tend to matter far more than the traits that some people screen for on a dating-app profile.

This Valentine’s Day, explore stories that challenge the idea that love is about finding the “right kind” of person.

Many daters have a list of traits they’re looking for in a partner—but can be perfectly happy with someone who has few of them.

My colleague Isabel Fattal recently asked readers to share a photo of something that sparks their sense of awe in the world. “This scene is of Split Rock Lighthouse on Lake Champlain in Essex, New York, during an ice fog event. You can also see the Adirondack mountains in the background,” Robert C., 64, in Ferrisburgh, Vermont, writes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Samuel P. Huntington’s The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order turns 30 this year. The book was a worldwide hit in the late 1990s and has been published in some 30 translations, including in Arabic, Chinese, and Bengali. After 9/11, the first part of the title practically became a household phrase. Huntington had been an eminent political scientist at Harvard, but his 1996 book made him a global celebrity. (I first met him when I was a Ph.D. student at Harvard, and we later became friends.)

The gist of Huntington’s argument: The end of the Cold War did not mark the “end of history,” as the political theorist Francis Fukuyama had argued in a widely discussed article and subsequent book imagining that the collapse of the Soviet empire would virtually end the strife among states of millennia past and that liberal democracy and market economics would now rule.

Huntington predicted that a new conflict would rage after the demise of Communism. Now not states, but the great civilizations, would clash “along the cultural fault lines” separating them, including “Western, Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu, Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and possibly African.” In the 21st century, the altar would again be mightier than the throne. Inter-civilizational conflict would “displace the political and ideological boundaries of the Cold War as the flash points for crisis and bloodshed.”

At first blush, the predictions in Clash seem to have panned out. Russia is now propelled by not Marxism but nationalism under the two-beamed cross of Orthodoxy. The Confucians—that is, the Chinese—are challenging the West across the board. Serbs went after Muslims in the former Yugoslavia. The Orthodox in Ukraine’s east clashed with the Catholics in its west along precisely the fault line Huntington sketched.

Huntington seemed most prescient regarding Islam. This civilization, he wrote in a notorious line, has “bloody borders.” Al-Qaeda murdered nearly 3,000 Americans on 9/11. Soon after, the United States went to war with the Muslim nations of Iraq and Afghanistan. The trail of terror since is too long to lay out in all its horrifying detail—in Madrid and Munich, in Strasburg and Stockholm, and all the way to Hamas’s mass murder of Jews on October 7, 2023.

From the December 2001 Issue: Looking the world in the eye

But upon closer inspection, Huntington’s predictions begin to wobble. Three decades after Clash, rivalries among the great powers, rather than a new clash among faith-based civilizations, continue to dominate the globe. During the Cold War, two heavies, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., were the lead players. Now the conflict has been joined by China.

Buddhist-Taoist Japan, anointed as a new giant in Clash, has all but withdrawn from the stage. India, with its nuclear weapons and 1.4 billion people, has defied Huntington’s expectations as well. Instead of demanding a seat at the table of the Big Three, let alone dominating Asia, India keeps maneuvering among the U.S., China, and Russia to extract benefits from each.

And Europe? The past master of the universe is an economic colossus but, strategically, its civilization is an also-ran. Even during the presidency of Donald Trump, the European Union depends on the United States to be its protector against Russia’s stockpile of 4,300 nuclear weapons, which dwarf the diminutive deterrent of Britain and France.

The problem: 27 is less than one. What sounds like bad arithmetic is correct politics. The 27 EU members don’t amount to a unitary actor on the global stage. The EU’s $20 trillion GDP does not translate into political weight, because Europe does not obey a single will. So this civilizational giant ends up a political lightweight.

As for Islam, the key borders run inside this culture, something Huntington mentioned only in passing. We are not witnessing a clash of civilizations, let alone “The West against the Rest,” to invoke another famous Huntington line. What tortures the Muslim realm is the reverse: a culture of clashes at home.

Some telling examples: The longest war in the modern Middle East pitted Iraq against Iran from 1980 to 1988—incurring 1 million casualties. In Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, from 2014 to 2024, 350,000 died, according to the United Nations—or close to twice that many, as counted by expatriate outfits. In the ongoing Yemeni civil war, close to 400,000 have died since 2014—and the number will go higher still.

Likewise, the Christian West has never been a bunch of choir boys. In the 17th century, the Thirty Years’ War between Catholics and Protestants claimed as many as 8 million victims, about a fifth of the population in the Central European battlefield.

And China’s civil war during the past century left behind as many as 10 million dead. Mao Zedong is said to have been responsible for another 40 million.

Idrees Kahloon: The return of MAGA’s favorite forbidden book

Huntington’s clash among cultures cannot explain any of these blood orgies. What can? The culprits are, as always, states and empires seeking power, possession, and primacy, no matter whom they revere, whether Jesus, Marx, or the Prophet Muhammad.

And thus in history, if Huntington were right, Catholic France would not have fought with Germany’s Protestant princes against the Catholic Habsburgs in the Thirty Years’ War. Why did France’s King Francis I ally with the Muslim Ottomans against the Spanish-Austrian Empire, unified under Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1519? Easy—because le roi wanted to break the encirclement on his eastern and southern flanks. So bring in the Turks. Power politics beat belief then, and it continues to do so now.

Cultures and creeds were never the true engines of bloodshed—and aren’t in our day, either. Russia wants to swallow Ukraine, even though both nations share Orthodox rites. The driver is dominion, not religion.

At the same time, there is the rapprochement between Israel and Arab states, which began with the country’s peace deals with Egypt and Jordan—and then there is Israel’s recent Abraham Accords with sundry Muslim states, including Morocco and Sudan, with Saudi Arabia as silent partner. The common foe of all is expansionist Iran and its handmaidens Hamas and Hezbollah.

States keep calling the shots. South Korea and North Korea are rooted in the same culture, as are China and Taiwan. Yet they are deadly enemies. Cold-blooded interest beats ethos and faith.

Finally, a word on our present moment: When The Clash of Civilizations came out, the culture war in the West was in its infancy. It did not fit into the book’s scheme.

Eight years later, Huntington published a new book. It is titled Who Are We?: The Challenges to America’s National Identity, and it zeroes in on what he glossed over back in 1996. What then focused his mind was the clash within the United States—and by extension the rest of the West. Uncontrolled immigration by Latinos and Muslims, he darkly warned, would divide America into “peoples, cultures and languages.” He felt it was time to reaffirm Protestant values and English as the national language of the United States.

In Who Are We?, Huntington concedes that the deepest fault lines run not among clashing civilizations but within them. And today, the dominant conflict within the United States is between those who are “woke” and those who want to conduct a “war on woke.”

Even great minds err, but the greatest revise their predictions when they fail.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This year’s Sundance Film Festival was the last in its longtime home of Park City, Utah. But Sundance’s final hurrah there—it moves to Boulder, Colorado, in 2027—didn’t feel much like a finale; instead, it was a more muted affair than previous years, with few outright buzzy premieres. This is perhaps in part because the institution of Sundance is changing, as the potential for indie movies’ success seems less certain than ever. The slate did contain plenty of gems, however, many of which I couldn’t stop thinking about as I hopscotched across town. Below, based on nearly two weeks of screenings, are the most memorable, inventive films I saw; no release dates have been announced yet, but I’ll be keeping an eye out for them.

This year’s festival darling—winning both of Sundance’s top honors, the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize—is a masterful drama about a harrowing event. Josephine, directed by Beth de Araújo, is named after its 8-year-old protagonist (played by Mason Reeves), who witnesses a violent assault. She unsurprisingly struggles to put what she saw into words, instead acting out in class and envisioning the perpetrator as an unnerving imaginary friend. But Josephine’s parents, Damien (Channing Tatum) and Claire (Gemma Chan), disagree over how to handle their daughter’s confusion; they don’t know how to articulate what happened, either. Such heavy developments could come off like the material of after-school specials, but de Araújo never loses sight of Josephine’s raw sensitivity. She captures the young girl’s delicate psyche while interrogating whether fully protecting a child’s innocence is ever possible.

Once Upon a Time in Harlem (Neon, release date TBD)

In August 1972, the filmmaker William Greaves threw a party at Duke Ellington’s home in the titular New York neighborhood. He invited luminaries to discuss and debate the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance, including the actor Leigh Whipper, the musicians Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, and the librarian and playwright Regina Anderson. Over glasses of wine and champagne, they joked, bickered, and considered how the Black creative experience had evolved since they anchored the movement some 50 years prior. Footage of the evening taken by the late Greaves is already a priceless time capsule of a once-in-a-lifetime hangout session, but his son, David, has stitched the unvarnished conversations captured that day together with examples of their subjects’ many achievements—literary, artistic, and political. The result is an atmospheric, electrifying documentary and a moving testament to the importance of remembering.

Forget infidelity, money troubles, or miscommunication: Marriage, according to Olivia Wilde’s latest directorial effort, is at its messiest when a couple simply refuses to acknowledge that it’s over. But the tightly wound Angela (Wilde) thinks she has the solution. One night, she blindsides her husband, Joe (Seth Rogen), by throwing a dinner party for their enigmatic neighbors, Hawk (Edward Norton) and Pina (Penélope Cruz)—who, judging by their constant, loud lovemaking, are absolutely thriving. Based on the Spanish film The People Upstairs, with a script by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack, The Invite begins as an anxiety-ridden relationship drama before turning into a riotous comedic showcase for its cast. Rogen is the ensemble’s MVP, finding an unexpected tenderness as a man trying to endure the night’s overwhelming discomfort without revealing any of his insecurities. As it turns out, the most chaotic dinner parties are the most fun—for us, anyway.

The History of Concrete (seeking distribution)

Don’t be fooled by the title: This latest project from John Wilson, who masterminded HBO’s idiosyncratic docuseries How to With John Wilson, isn’t really about the gray material that makes up much of our infrastructure. Rather, it’s a poignant exploration of society’s desire for what concrete symbolizes—order, uniformity, permanence—and how difficult it can be to defy that need. Like Wilson’s show, The History of Concrete is packed with gleeful detours that take him to, among many destinations, a wax museum in Italy and a bubble-gum-removal company in New York. Wilson is also drawn to creative types: He interviews an opera singer, shadows a short-film director, and even joins a room full of writers learning how to produce the perfect Hallmark-movie script. In his meandering, he gathers insights into what it’s like to make art—and how even the most unconventional work can last lifetimes.

Something is wrong with Fisherwoman (Olivia Colman). Many things, actually: She reeks. She lives in a cottage on the outskirts of a medieval village. And weirdest of all, she’s acquired a husband made out of wicker (Alexander Skarsgård, in a terrific set of prosthetics). Based on Ursula Wills-Jones’s short story about a community unusually hung up on marrying off its women—brides are given collars, not rings, at their weddings—Wicker is a whimsical and romantic fable that critiques the limits of assigned social roles. Fisherwoman’s perfect, albeit woven, husband baffles her neighbors and the local queen bee (Elizabeth Debicki); her intention to continue working after her marriage only bewilders them further. The film’s eccentric flourishes may sound corny, but the writer-directors Eleanor Wilson and Alex Huston Fischer ground the premise in a deeply sincere sense of yearning. And Colman is, as always, superb.

The Last First: Winter K2 (Apple, release date TBD)

Several documentaries at Sundance this year investigated the relationship between the world’s natural wonders and human interference. But whereas those films examined how people affect the environment, The Last First delves into the opposite. K2 is the second-highest peak in the world, and long offered a tantalizing challenge to climbers hoping to make history: The mountain had never been summited, in part because of its extremely steep faces. Using footage captured by climbers from various expeditions, the director Amir Bar-Lev constructs a portrait of perseverance—and hubris. The Last First makes clear from the outset that it will end in tragedy, yet it’s easy to get swept up in the competitiveness of the mountaineers. The film offers a sharp study of what drives so many to attempt near-impossible ascents, and why audiences can’t stop watching them in turn.

The Friend’s House Is Here (seeking distribution)

Pari (Mahshad Bahram) and Hanna (Hana Mana), roommates living in Tehran, pursue creative passions that could get them in trouble with the Iranian government: The former is a theater director of immersive, underground shows, while the latter is a performer who has built an Instagram following by illegally dancing in front of historical landmarks. The Friend’s House Is Here is itself a piece of protest art; the film was smuggled out of Tehran to its Park City premiere. Yet the movie isn’t merely dissident cinema. Though neither Pari nor Hanna can escape the political reality of their home country, their story is infused with charm and anchored by their exuberant friendship. The directors Maryam Ataei and Hossein Keshavarz spotlight how Pari and Hanna have built their bond by expressing themselves freely; they dance in their living room, throw raucous dinner parties, and turn whatever they can into a stage.

In this chilling documentary, the director Selena Miles carefully recounts what happened to three very different women after they publicized allegations of sexual assault. Brittany Higgins, a former junior government staffer in Australia, and Amber Heard, the Hollywood actress, both made personal accusations against two powerful public figures; the Colombian journalist Catalina Ruiz-Navarro, meanwhile, reported on an anonymous group of women’s claims about a well-known filmmaker. The men, who denied any wrongdoing, filed retaliatory defamation lawsuits—turning their accusers’ accounts over to the court of public opinion. Through archival footage and a variety of interviews, Silenced carefully tracks its subjects’ commonalities, in the process illustrating the steady complexities of #MeToo a decade after it entered the cultural conversation.

Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty! (Sony Pictures Classics, release date TBD)

At first glance, the director Josef Kubota Wladyka’s third feature seems destined to make a misstep. Unusually ebullient title aside, the film is tonally and aesthetically ambitious: Set in Tokyo, the story follows Haru (Rinko Kikuchi), a young widow with a love for ballroom dancing, as she tries to overcome her grief while simultaneously falling for a new instructor at her local studio. Along the way, her flights of fancy manifest as fantastical dance sequences, and she has visions of her husband haunting their home while wearing, of all things, a giant raven costume. Like a stylishly choreographed number, the plot bobs, weaves, twists, and turns with dexterity. Its not-so-secret weapon is Kikuchi herself, who grounds the tale’s most over-the-top moments in a lovely, earnest warmth.

Everybody to Kenmure Street (seeking distribution)

In 2021, on the first day of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr, an immigration-enforcement van arrived in the Pollokshields district of Glasgow to carry out one of the United Kingdom Home Office’s dawn raids. Officers detained two men of Indian descent, but local residents stopped the van from leaving the neighborhood; one man even clung to the vehicle after sliding underneath. Other neighbors joined the barricade, and by the end of the day, the protesters numbered in the hundreds. In Everybody to Kenmure Street, participants reflect on what they did, and why: Many appear in talking-head interviews, but the director Felipe Bustos Sierra also recruited actors such as Emma Thompson (who serves as the executive producer) to play protesters who don’t. The documentary cleverly mixes theatrical elements with more conventional methods, such as archival footage showing the city’s rich history of civil disobedience, to emphasize a lineage of organized opposition and the vitality of everyday people acting together.</div>

Perhaps a new form of reality TV will develop - &quot;lawyer smackdown&quot; where we follow the lawyers indirectly feeding on the greed of investors in various industries? Think Jimmy McGill with more coke.

It&#39;ll be pretty boring thought because the &quot;lawyers&quot; will be AI bots.

I hate to say it. It&#39;s likely over for us.&quot; He goes on to say that soon people will be able to sit at a computer and milk a franchise to death without industry involvement

Omg, you&#39;re right. The right to use Tom Cruise&#39;s image should only be used by: <insert name of business with ownership of Tom Cruise (a human being)&#39;s image>

Future post:Industry makes &#39;campaign contributions&#39; to have its &#39;right&#39; to on-demand pony-delivery codified in law.

I think it is interesting that you got a troll mod, given the popularity of such notions as &quot;sharing is caring&quot; here on slashdot.

It may be that we are progressing into a copyright-free world, and are just beginning to feel the growing pains that come with that adjustment.

It is popularly believed that copyright benefits the independent creator since it gives them legal protection against big corporations who would violate that copyright, but this has been repeatedly disproved, especially recently with big-an

We already say that match up back in 1998 [imdb.com]. And Brad Pitt v. Keanu Reeves back in 1999 [imdb.com]. What a time to be alive!

I think in the AI generated video that the 4 inch height difference between the two men was not as apparent as it should be. Perhaps Cruise is in platforms?

And if it does happen, I suspect the AI&#39;s prediction of heightening will be prescient : )

Turnabout fair play?  Create &quot;uncomfortable&quot; videos using the likeness of the creators of these copyright violating vids.  See how they react to hundreds or thousands of fake videos portraying them doing all sorts of things or participating in all sorts of activities.

All the global warming, all of it, is coming directly from the Sun.

We&#39;ve got to put the Sun out, before it kills us all and destroys the planet.

Well, there are people who want to block a part of the sun from earth in order to slow down this &quot;heating&quot;.  Well, let&#39;s see what happens once they do it!

I like the opening joke of the discussion. On your idea, I sort of like the idea of orbital mirrors that could be rotated as needed. For example, street lighting in cities done in a quite sustainable and inexpensive way. However when you start doing it at a large scale to play games with the weather, then I think it would require much better weather and climate modeling than we currently have, and possibly better than is possible since the so-called &quot;butterfly effects&quot; can never be fully accounted for.

Wait ... it gets hotter the more &quot;red&quot; politics we have. And cooler when we have more &quot;blue&quot; politics. Hmmmmm .....

Pfft. Everyone knows blue indicates a hotter flame than red. Typical libs not even knowing their own science to follow...

Suddenly hitting the deadline for Proton decay could bring the Sun&#39;s fusion process to a screeching halt. Hopefully there is no proton decay, but I also don&#39;t know of a way to prove it can&#39;t ever happen.

Haven&#39;t looked  haven&#39;t done the math, but I believe the ocean&#39;s been taking up a lot of heat.  It probably slows down as it gets closer to the new balance point.

The oceans are getting warmer and therefore release CO2

Almost like scientists were saying there was a tipping point when global temperatures would start climbing. Here’s a handy graph for republicans. https://xkcd.com/1732/ [xkcd.com]

And with rapid adoption of CARBON NEUTRAL EVs....no wonder.

So science, not &quot;Sciencism&quot; or whatever, tells us that climate change is happening, and it&#39;s going to be really really bad.

That&#39;s the point you&#39;re agreeing with, yes?  Real actual science done with real actual data that shows us the real actual detrimental impact that humans are causing to our planet&#39;s climate.

It&#39;s just a pity the politicians and many on the far right disagree with us.

But they don&#39;t understand real science.  They understand money.  Money before everything.

Once again showing super leftists don&#39;t do math or science.

What does this have to do with left vs right? Liberal vs conservative? Straight vs gay? Trans vs ... I dunno, whatever not trans is.

The climate does not give a fuck about your politics, or your party affiliation, or your gender, or your pronouns, or whatever.

Neither does science. Or math.

If you think that making the world a less healthful and less livable place is a great idea, then there&#39;s simply something wrong with you. That&#39;s not being

... prevent low lying cloud? Clouds form when theres enough moisture and the temp drops low enough. A one degree increase in average air temps would only push the cloudbase up by 150-200 metres or so, so something more subtle must be going on.

The whole and only point of not hitting +2 degrees was to avoid the runaway processes beyond which we could not predict what would happen from our position of ignorance.

Yes the world&#39;s climate is always changing.  It does so through some obvious and predictable mechanisms, and some others less obvious.  All we knew was the probability of runaway process we did not understand got unacceptably high if we hit +2 through the CO2 mechanism.

We all know how that played out - the stupid won.

Flap your jaws if you want, they never mattered anyway

If there were &quot;Muh Runaway Processes&quot;, we wouldn&#39;t exist because the Earth would have melted millions of years ago.

And the stupid are the ones clinging to &quot;Muh Climate Change&quot; now AI data centres are the New Hotness. You can&#39;t have &quot;Net Zero&quot; and massive AI data centres using terawatts of power.

Then everyone will just have to get by without oil.You do understand that without oil we can&#39;t produce fertilizer, plastics, etc... and &quot;getting by without oil&quot; would translate to billions dead, most notably in the developing world that is not food secure? That is, you are actively calling for genocide that would make Hitler blush.

It&#39;s called a positive feedback loop.  And it will be way more annoying that a squeal from a speaker too close to a mic.

Despite attempts to have carbon emissions lowered, that really hasn&#39;t happened.

Perhaps if you deploy sufficient compute to truly understand the cause, we might find observer effect?

Yes, &quot;TikTok&quot; (the application not controlled in the USA) is the problem, but not anything from Google/Alphabet (YouTube), or Meta (Facebook/Instagram/Threads), or &quot;X&quot; (Twitter), or the multitude of other platforms all with USA centric interests.

Yes, I realize other platforms are listed way WAY down in the article, but seriously, count the number of times TikTok is referenced compared to any other platform.

TikTok = 17Facebook = 2Instagram = 2X = 1Twitter = 0

Several countries are looking to, and _maybe_ it might be done at the EU level, which would have all countries doing it the same way.  We&#39;ll see.  For now, though, nothing appears to be planned.

Infinite scrolling == infinite memory usage.

Whenever I go to some forum that&#39;s heavy on pictures and videos that has infinite scrolling, and I&#39;m looking far down the page for something or other, eventually my browser slows to a crawl, or the browser&#39;s resource-hungry JS engine crashes, and that&#39;s the end of the scrolling.

Certain sites I patronize that have the stupid infinite scrolling also have the classic &page= HTTP GET mechanism. On those sites, every once in a while, I reload the entire page with a &page= corresponding to roughly where I am in the infinite scrolling, just to reset it and free up some memory.

It&#39;s not the UI paradigm that bothers me, it&#39;s the resource usage insanity.

Infinite scrolling has been from the very start a way to trap a mind onto a virtual hamster wheel. You run and run thinking you are making progress, but all you have accomplished is a little exercise with your finger.

But devil&#39;s advocate here: isn&#39;t it artistic expression to trap the audience into a Sisyphean cycle. Does this not express the futility of our actions and even of our own cognition? Isn&#39;t it better that we do this virtually than if I were to invite a live audience to a theater that I then flood

Without an ssh or VPN proxy in front? That is asking for it.

It&#39;s 2026.  Who on Earth still runs a Telnet server?

Sure maybe you have a really legacy embedded device tucked away somewhere where it is somewhat secured and a calculated risk, but this article is talking about the open internet.  That is just crazy, I had no idea.

Yes. That was my first though as well. Telnet servers have no place on the Internet anymore and are far more of a risk than they can be a benefit.

I wouldn&#39;t put it past some IOT devices to have it enabled.

Until recently, you could get the text of national weather service guidance by telnet. It was about the right level of protocol to provide plain text to a terminal with enough information to paginate it and enough input to pick an airport code.

Sure.  Anything that doesn&#39;t require authentication and provides publicly-known information anyway doesn&#39;t need encryption.

Well, until getting root with an exploit comes along...

Then authentication and encryption - or a better protocol (http?) would seem de rogue.

Right? I had to pull from the mental archive (pre-coffee) to figure out what in the world telnet was. It was familiar, but... distant. I couldn&#39;t remember which port it was, specifically.

Another possibility is that all these telnet services were pre-exploited, that&#39;s why they disappeared. There may have been a threat actor doing things at the same time.

Telnet, like we used to use in between fighting sabre-tooth tigers and coding in COBOL?When we sent symmetric passwords in plaintext?

That is a zombie protocol risen from the OxDEAD !  Just kill it.

That is a zombie protocol risen from the OxDEAD !  Just kill it.Given the exploit was patched but telnet traffic stayed down... it&#39;s apparent a bunch of people made exactly that decision.Now, if you want to ask why they didn&#39;t make that decision 15 years earlier... I&#39;ve got nothin&#39;.

Now, if you want to ask why they didn&#39;t make that decision 15 years earlier... I&#39;ve got nothin&#39;.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still telnet to a handful of BBSes that still use the protocol...but with SSH largely supplanting it, and few end-user facing applications using it...the odds are good that most residential telnet traffic isn&#39;t all that legitimate, so requiring that customers call to request opening of port 23, along with 80 and 443 as some ISPs do, is probably a good thing overall.

Yeah, those insecure protocols - telnet, ftp, rsh, rlogin, http,... all ought to be deprecated.  Long overdue

No-login HTTP and FTP is fine. Obviously, if you download anything important, you need to verify signatures.

Why not just assume that anything worth downloading - or uploading - is important enough that one doesn&#39;t want it corrupted, or intercepted by any MITM attacks?  Just default to https and ftps (or sftp if one prefers)

Even if the transport protocol is secure, you have no assurance that the data hasn&#39;t been modified on the server.  Which is why if you care, you should verify the cryptographic signature of whatever you download---it is signed, right?  And you should also sign anything important that you upload.

For downloads, you also need to ponder how much you can trust the signing key.

The telnet client is useful for a number of things. Just not for actual log-ins over the Internet.

You are talking about different things.  The telnet client is useful (though there are better replacements these days).  The telnet server &quot;telnetd&quot; should be taken out back and shot.  Then the person who enabled it, if they are still alive, should also be taken out back and shot.  Sure, sure, &quot;legacy devices on secured subnets&quot;, but TFA talks about servers accessible from the internet.

And I say this as someone who set up many telnetd servers, and continued using them with kerberos auth for a while.  But I

I&#39;ll admit to using a telnet client to test connectivity from time to time, SMTP for instance. But, no one should be running telnetd in 2026.

We actually have an old arduino-based temperature probe, in a server room, that has a telnet interface. However it&#39;s not reachable from the internet (and also not on the same network as the servers).

I&#39;d like to see it replaced, but for various reasons that has yet to happen.

Chances are you&#39;ll need to use openssl s_client -starttls smtp rather than telnet these days.

Yes, there is a semi-secret mailing list of organizations that are informed of CVEs before public disclosure. Without being on the inside of this particular vulnerability, I can say with 99% certainty that this is indeed the case.

I was brought on as a contractor to help evaluate one of the &quot;sudo&quot; privilege escalation attacks years ago, to test it on a number of platforms. I had about one to two weeks advanced notice of the CVE before it went public to help evaluate potential risk, which is where the &quot;scores&quot; come from. Note, in this context, a platform is more than just a single vendor or single OS, I was brought on as the subject matter expert for a particular CPU architecture and F/OSS operating system combination to see if the exploit was valid there as well. Testing required seeing if the same exploit worked across OS revisions, patch levels, CPU architectures, and comparing it to other OSes with similar hardware configurations.

There is a whole community behind the scenes of people who are deeply passionate about security doing this work behind closed doors. Many of these people are industry professionals at the hyper-scalers and OS vendors (both open and closed source) and push out patches there first before anything goes public.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a newsletter that never once had lunch on Jeffrey Epstein’s island. [Epstein file comes out.] Oh, come on, that was a brunch.

We’ve got it all this week: Epstein. The Kennedys. Bridge scandals involving new bridges and rival bridge owners. Democratic mega-gerrymanders. TARIFF VOTES.

But the concept of this edition—in the Sgt. Pepper’s sense of a “concept,” in that it ends after a couple of tracks—is the audience of one, and how some Trump administration appointees will almost intentionally do their jobs badly to stay in the boss’s good graces. Unusual dynamic. Cheers!

On Tuesday, prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, sought and failed to indict six Democratic lawmakers—four House members and two senators—who recorded a social media video last year in which they reminded service members of their obligation to refuse illegal orders. What were the exact charges? Who knows. Whatever they were, the grand jury in D.C. didn’t just reject them as a body. As NBC News reported, zero members of the grand jury found the charges up to snuff. Separately, a judge this week smacked down Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempt to punish Sen. Mark Kelly, a veteran and one of the six who made the video, saying that Hegseth’s targeting of Kelly had “trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms.”

Why would Pirro and Hegseth subject themselves to such total humiliation and stark legal rebuke? Don’t they realize that a neutral observer would consider them historically bad at their jobs? Their audience of one, though, is not a neutral observer. The November video that those six Democrats released incensed Donald Trump, who posted on social media at the time that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL” and “punishable by DEATH!” There seems to be an understanding among Trump’s political appointees now that not doing the illegal action—refusing an illegal order, as one might put it—isn’t an option. Instead, it’s better to humor him by pursuing it and letting some element of the legal system—a judge, a grand jury—do the dirty work of keeping the rule of law at least somewhat intact. And while it’s nice when the legal system does its job, the Surge still believes that the best course of action is for government officials not to violate the constitutional rights of Trump’s enemies in the first place.

We must still allow ourselves to be shocked from time to time, and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s performance before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday ably did the job. She shouted and yelled and acted as if she were the one who was being shouted and yelled at, responded to various questions from Democratic members with unrelated oppo her staff had googled about them, suggested that members needed to apologize to Trump for having impeached him, and otherwise made a fool of herself. After Rep. Jerry Nadler asked how many Epstein co-conspirators she had indicted, she went on a rant about how great the stock market is doing under Trump. She called the Democratic ranking member of the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a “washed-up loser lawyer!” (Raskin, in a fortunate bit of scheduling, was able to discuss his day with Bondi later that evening at a live taping of Slate’s Political Gabfest.)

Is there one person to whom this deeply embarrassing performance would have appealed? Someone who thinks talking about stock-market gains under Trump in response to unrelated questions is a winning strategy, who believes that those asking difficult questions suffer from “Trump derangement syndrome,” who thinks lawmakers should apologize to Donald Trump for having investigated and impeached him? Exactly. This was the most degrading congressional performance for the audience of one in recent memory. “AG Pam Bondi, under intense fire from the Trump Deranged Radical Left Lunatics, was fantastic at yesterday’s Hearing,” Trump posted Thursday. Bondi had been successful in saving her job, at great expense to her personal and our national dignity, for another few days.

Speaker Mike Johnson, at the White House’s request, tried to pass a rule this week preventing Democrats from forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs. Republicans had been successful in passing such rules last year, and the vote this week was to extend the blockade through the summer. This time, however, it didn’t work: The rule vote failed, 217–214, as three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it. It’s now open season on Trump’s tariffs, as House Democrats will repeatedly force their GOP counterparts to choose between a president who expects loyalty and bad policy (and politics). Within a day of the failed rule vote, the House voted to nix Trump’s Canada tariffs.

Like clockwork, Trump issued a threat, warning that “any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!” But what does this pocket of members voting against tariffs care? Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon, a regularly targeted swing-district member, is retiring this cycle. He voted against the rule, then left the premises so leaders couldn’t twist his arm. So, too, did California Rep. Kevin Kiley, who’s been redistricted off the planet in the Redistricting Wars (that Trump started). The last GOP member to vote against the rule was Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who’s solidly in Trump enemy territory at this point. The House GOP’s margin is tight enough that it takes only a couple of House members to upend Johnson’s, and the White House’s, plans. And the ranks of GOP defectors may swell once primary season is over too.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Jeffrey Epstein were next-door neighbors on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. According to Lutnick, though, they barely knew each other. In a story Lutnick told on a podcast last year, he and his wife went in Epstein’s house once in 2005, got a house tour, and “decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” adding, “I was never in the room with him socially, for business or even philanthropy.” As the Epstein files revealed, though, that wasn’t true. Lutnick and his family visited Epstein on his island in 2012, and the two were in business and otherwise corresponding sporadically over the years; at least one email suggests they had scheduled drinks.

So does “lying about having not been to the Epstein island” constitute a firing from Trump’s Cabinet? Not as of yet. Trump likes having Good-Time Howie around, for one, and if he starts doling out consequences to people for their associations with Epstein, well, that would put Trump himself in quite a corner. That Lutnick’s future in the Cabinet has been a live question all week speaks mostly to the number of enemies he’s made in Congress and the administration for his sycophancy on behalf of Trump’s worst impulses.

Virginia state Democrats’ proposed mid-decade gerrymander of their state is an assault on the eyes. The new map—if it skirts legal challenges and is approved by voters in an April referendum—could net Democrats four new congressional seats this year, converting its current delegation, six Democrats and five Republicans, into a 10–1 split. It achieves this in part by divvying up the trove of Democratic votes in dense Northern Virginia suburbs across the state, with narrow arms slinking south and west to rural communities that have very little in common with Arlington or Fairfax County. It’s some filthy, filthy stuff that will make for incoherent districts and stifle Republican congressional representation in a merely lean-blue state.

All of which is to say: womp—and again, womp. The move was a political necessity for Democrats, and the great many Virginia-based Republican operatives and pundits grousing about it should blame their president. Trump made a conscious move to kick off the mid-decade redistricting fight by urging Texas, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, and anywhere else where Republicans could squeeze out a seat or five to redraw their maps. Retaliation happens. The Surge is all for a federal remedy, or a network of interstate compacts, to address this absurd trend of hyper-gerrymandering everywhere, but until then: no crying. As Virginia state Sen. Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, a fascinating 82-year-old edgelord who pushed for the new maps, replied to a griping Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, “You all started it and we fucking finished it.” (Although, honestly, the Supreme Court may be the ones who fucking finish it, sooner or later.)

On Monday, Trump posted that he would block the opening of a new U.S.–Canada bridge between Detroit and Windsor “until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them.” All right. He’s still mad at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney for cutting a trade deal with China and for generally—here we go, we’re going to deploy this stupid word and see what happens—mogging him at Davos. So he won’t let Canada open a bridge that would ease congestion at a major international commercial crossing, which speaks to Carney’s general point about how the United States has become too irrational an actor to lead the global order.

But there’s more! Matthew Moroun, the billionaire owner of an existing, rival bridge—the Ambassador Bridge—has for years fought against the creation of the new bridge. And as the New York Times reported, Moroun met with the one and only Howard Lutnick on Monday, hours before Trump’s post, after which Lutnick spoke to Trump by phone. Trump’s post came after that telephone conversation. And with that, another episode’s worth of major investigation that would’ve done meaningful damage to any previous administration is added to the mountainous pile.

One of the most coveted congressional seats in the country is up for grabs now that longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler is retiring. New York’s 12th Congressional District covers the heart of Manhattan, and there’s an unsurprisingly long list of candidates. There’s Micah Lasher, a New York state Assembly member and former aide to Gov. Kathy Hochul, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Nadler, who has endorsed him. There’s Alex Bores, another Assembly member who’s being targeted by corporate A.I. money after supporting an A.I. safety bill. There is George Conway, the conservative lawyer turned anti-Trumper and #Resistance celebrity. And many more.

And then there is Jack Schlossberg, JFK’s 33-year-old grandkid who didn’t do much of anything until he started posting weird stuff online a few years ago and briefly pretended to work as a reporter in 2024, deciding he’d like a congressional seat. It wasn’t taken all that seriously. And then, this week, he earned the endorsement of none other than former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in what the Times described as “the most high-profile endorsement so far, of any candidate.” In a statement, Pelosi said, “This moment calls for leaders who understand the stakes and how to deliver for the people they serve.” And that’s … Jack Schlossberg, is it? Huh. The Kennedy mystique is strong in this one.

The machinery to enable Stephen Miller’s darkest deportation dreams is both tangible and legal. In this week’s show, Dahlia Lithwick explores the statutory and regulatory foundations of the Trump administration’s expanding network of detention camps, plus the historical background of the vast warehouse system they are using to imprison tens of thousands of migrants. First, she speaks with Linus Chan, who represents Minnesotans detained by ICE, he teaches law at the University of Minnesota School of Law. Chan describes how the most basic right of habeas corpus has been whittled away by the courts to a filament when it comes to immigration law, allowing the federal government to weaponize brutal detention against ordinary Americans.

Next, Dahlia is in conversation with Andrea Pitzer, about her chilling and urgent new piece, Building the camps: The warehouseification of detention and initial thoughts on stopping it. It is essential reading (and listening!) in light of the billion dollar detention camp system being built in warehouses near you in cities around the nation.

If you want to check if your town is on the list, Andrea recommends checking out Project Salt Box.

It is one thing for a state to say that it is dedicated to doing justice in capital cases. It is quite another for them to turn those commitments into action.

All too frequently, in those cases, words don’t govern actions. We say we are in favor of equal treatment but stand by while race shapes the fates of those accused of capital crimes. We say that we will not punish cruelly, but use methods of execution that impose unnecessary suffering on those we execute.

Earlier this month, Charles Flores filed a petition in the United States Supreme Court offering it the chance to change that by saying that Texas has to fulfill promises it has made to death row inmates. In his case, he wants to take advantage of a law that allows death row inmates to prove they were falsely convicted and are actually innocent.

The court should hear his case and require the Lone Star State to follow its own laws.

Charles Flores was convicted of the January 1998 killing of Betty Black during an attempted robbery. Right from the start, he has maintained his innocence.

His co-defendant, Richard Childs, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 35 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2016.

One of the witnesses who helped convict Flores was Jill Barganier, Betty Black’s neighbor, who insisted at Flores’ trial that she was 100 percent sure she had seen him enter Black’s house the morning she was killed. Her testimony proved to be decisive in securing his conviction since there was no physical evidence tying Flores to the murder.

We know that eyewitness identification is notoriously unreliable. In addition, the neighbor’s testimony was tainted in several ways.

First, on the day of the crime, she told police that two white men with long hair and similar builds got out of a car, a purple and pink Volkswagen Bug, and entered Black’s garage. She then picked a white male with long hair out as the driver she had seen.

But Flores looks nothing like that man. He is Hispanic, not white, and at the time that Black died, he had shaved hair and was overweight.

Bargainer also helped a police artist create a composite sketch of the men whom she saw enter Black’s house. It looked nothing like Flores.

To top it all off, she did not pick a picture of Flores out of an array of photos. So how could she go from all that to being sure Flores was involved in Black‘s killing?

She was helped along by what is called “investigative hypnosis.” A 1979 article published in the journal Detective describes it as a technique used to “obtain vital information that may have been forgotten.” Even then, though, the publication cautioned that “all leads developed through hypnosis should be verified with supporting physical or testimonial evidence … and investigative conclusion should not be based solely on hypnotically obtained information.”

Since that article was published, investigative hypnosis has been shown to be completely unreliable. “Instead of improving memory,” the Christian Science Monitor notes, “hypnosis may only manipulate it.”

That seems to have been the case with Barganier. During her hypnosis, the police asked her if one of the men she had seen had short, shaved hair.

During the hypnosis session, Barganier again described the man she saw driving the car as having “long, wavy” dark-blond hair. The hypnotist then asked her about the passenger and urged her to focus on his hair. She said it was “a lot like his friend’s,” and clarified: “dark, long.”

“Just relax,” the hypnotist said, “take a deep breath, take the time you need. Can you tell me how long his hair is? Does he have it neatly cut, or is it trimmed?”

That is a classic example of a suggestive question.

Even without such overt leading of a witness, courts in many places, including Florida, one of America’s leading death penalty states, have questioned “the reliability of statements procured by way of hypnosis.” A California court explained the danger of investigative hypnosis this way. Someone subject to hypnosis “will lose his critical judgment and begin to credit ‘memories’ that were formerly viewed as unreliable … will confuse actual recall with confabulation and will be unable to distinguish between the two, and … will exhibit an unwarranted confidence in the validity of his ensuing recollection.”

In 2023, Texas recognized that such defects were present in investigative hypnosis. It joined a “majority of jurisdictions, which ban post-hypnotic testimony.”

The Texas criminal code now says that a statement made during or after investigative hypnosis “is not admissible against a defendant in a criminal trial, whether offered in the guilt or innocence phase or the punishment phase of the trial, if the hypnotic session giving rise to the statement was performed by a law enforcement agency to investigate the offense that is the subject of the trial.”

But it was not made to apply to cases in which someone had already been convicted at the time was passed. That in itself should raise red flags.

A state decides that a kind of evidence is so unreliable that it should not be used in any criminal case, but is willing to see someone put to death when that kind of evidence was used to convict him. What kind of justice is that?

Crucially, the issue facing the Supreme Court is whether Texas is obliged to revisit this case. Texas has passed laws specifically designed to protect innocent people from wrongful execution. They allow prisoners to return to court by filing a writ of habeas corpus and present evidence of their innocence.

It also has a law on the books allowing courts to use a lower standard of proof in cases involving junk science.

Flores wants to take advantage of those laws. As he points out in his petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, he has asked the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to allow him the chance to prove that he is in fact innocent of the crime for which Texas seeks to execute him.

But,” he contends, “the TCCA has repeatedly and arbitrarily barred these efforts without explanation.” By doing so, the court is, in essence, nullifying state law and depriving him of “the state-created liberty interest upon which he seeks to rely.”

“Due process,” his petition observes, “demands more than unexplained summary dismissal in response to a substantial threshold showing of actual innocence. This case and the question it presents are exceptionally important: whether a state law enacted to safeguard against executing the innocent, when rendered illusory in practice, offends the federal right to due process.”

“Once a right is established through state law,” Flores argues, “a deprivation of the right implicates federal procedural due process protection.”

He accuses the state of “gratuitously barring credibly innocent prisoners on death row from proving their innocence. This Court,” he adds, “should grant certiorari to clarify that the constitutional guarantee of due process prohibits state courts employing arbitrary or irrational procedures to foreclose even making the case of innocence.”

More than 50 years ago, the Supreme Court recognized what it called “statutory entitlements.” As Justice William Brennan put it, when the state creates a right for a class of individuals, it may not deny an individual seeking to exercise that right without “procedural due process.”

Quoting an earlier case, he noted, “’The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.’”

That is all Charles Flores is asking for, an “opportunity to be heard” on a life-and-death matter. If the Supreme Court does not give him that chance, it will add to the long list of instances when the law promises one thing but doesn’t deliver it to death row inmates.

Is Justice Samuel Alito getting ready to call it quits? A flurry of recent hints has prompted new speculation that the Supreme Court’s most reliably partisan conservative is eyeing the exits in advance of the 2026 midterms. On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern sift through the clues, politics, and legacy management that may be driving Alito toward retirement. They also game out whom President Donald Trump might pick—among the many MAGA judges already campaigning for the seat—as the justice’s possible successor. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Our friend Elie Mystal wrote a great piece in the Nation saying he thinks Alito is going to step down. Our friends at Strict Scrutiny have also suggested as much. Mark, what’s your gossipy buzz telling you?

Mark Joseph Stern: I agree. And the first reason is the announcement of the justice’s forthcoming memoir, which is pompously titled So Ordered: An Originalist’s View of the Constitution, the Court, and Our Country. Of course, justices do publish books on the bench. But there are some indications that this particular release will be a farewell postscript for Alito’s service. First, it’s coming out on Oct. 6, which is one day after the Supreme Court’s next term begins. As Elie noted, it is unusual for the justices to publish books in October because they like to promote their books, and they can’t do that when they’re stuck in D.C., hearing oral arguments. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson, and Amy Coney Barrett all published recent books in early September—timing that makes sense because that’s when the public is starting to pay attention again. The new term is gearing up, but the justices are not stuck in Washington. They are still free to fly around the country, plugging their latest release. I think it’s pretty unlikely that Alito would drop his memoir on a date when he specifically cannot do that.

Second, Alito just celebrated the 20th anniversary of his confirmation to the Supreme Court. Conservative lawyers and pundits marked the occasion by publishing laudatory articles that had, to me, a distinctly valedictory feel to them. That includes at least one former clerk who may well be in contact with the justice and even have an inkling of his plans. On top of that, Alito gave this rare interview to Politico, which surprised me given that it was Politico that published the leak of his Dobbs draft opinion. So you’d think he might have a grudge. Anyway, in that interview, he seemed to look back over his service and view Dobbs as his finest achievement, almost like the capstone of his tenure. He also hinted that he was not really enjoying the job or the coarse civic culture of our current moment.

Finally, there’s another book coming out, this one by Mollie Hemingway, a MAGA pseudo-journalist, called Alito: The Justice Who Reshaped the Supreme Court and Restored the Constitution. It’s going to be this obsequious, bootlicking celebration of Alito’s brilliance. The publisher’s description calls it “the authoritative—and explosive—inside story of Justice Samuel Alito and his powerful role in shaping the Supreme Court.” It seems highly probable that Alito gave interviews to Hemingway, even if it was on background. It feels to me as if he is trying to secure his legacy within the conservative legal movement and the conservative media, which is what matters most to him. And I think that the main reason he would be doing that is because he’s ready to step down and pass the torch.

I was struck by the fact that in the Politico interview, Alito said he wished Justice Antonin Scalia were around to take a victory lap, because the court has achieved so much of what he worked toward and is now finally on the right track. It’s so sad he’s missing it. Within a paragraph, Alito then suggested that Scalia would have been “appalled” by the ugliness, the coarseness of the discourse. Well, who was single-handedly responsible for coarsening the discourse at the Supreme Court for a very long time? Why, it was Scalia! He’d be loving the discourse right now. He built it.

I also think this love story about originalism from Alito feels a little cynical. You and I have spent a lot of time discussing whether Alito really is an originalist or if whether is perfectly result-oriented and completely political. Either way, I guess the better question isn’t what Alito calls himself but what he does. If he does step down soon, won’t it probably be because he wants Trump to replace him while Republicans hold the Senate?

Alito is not an originalist. In fact, he’s made fun of originalism before. His jurisprudence is completely aligned with the Republican Party platform. He watches Fox News. I’m sure he reads the polls. He must know there is a real chance that Republicans could lose the Senate in the fall—which, of course, means that he would be stuck on the bench for at least two more years, maybe six more years, maybe even longer.

And we know that his wife, Martha-Ann, has been counting the minutes until Alito can retire so she can fly whatever flag she wants to.

Martha-Ann definitely wants him to step down. And Alito saw how Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a bad bet and wound up getting replaced by a successor who is torching her legacy. He doesn’t want that to happen. He is savvy enough to know that stepping down before the midterms means that Trump can replace him with someone who is just as conservative, if not more so. Republicans have a comfortable margin in the Senate. Retiring now could cement his jurisprudence for years to come with a mini-Alito who is 30 years younger. That’s probably what is guiding his decision more so than anything else. But in fairness, when we give justices life tenure, we empower them to make these kinds of partisan decisions. You can hate the game, but you can’t really hate the player.

Who do you think could potentially inherit the mantle of the man who gave us witchburners as the reason to overturn Roe v. Wade?

I will throw out two names: Emil Bove, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, and Andy Oldham, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. I flag Bove because he has already proved his absolute fealty to Trump—first as his personal lawyer, then at the Justice Department, when he struck the corrupt bargain to drop criminal charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, defied court orders barring the illegal deportation of Venezuelan migrants, and reportedly helped kill the investigation into Tom Homan’s alleged acceptance of a bribe. We know that Trump was disappointed in his first three picks because he felt as if they weren’t sufficiently loyal to him. With Bove, he wouldn’t have to worry about that.

At the same time, I can imagine that the White House might not want to reopen Bove’s scandals or give Democrats an opportunity to probe them. He’s already gotten his reward with a lifetime seat on the 3rd Circuit. So, to my mind, Oldham is the more likely candidate. He’s a former Alito clerk and a MAGA fanatic who has gone very far out of his way to campaign for this seat with a constant stream of Trump-pandering opinions. He’s even further right than Alito, who has overruled him multiple times. He also looks the part, which may seem like a shallow observation, but we know that that is important to this president. I think he has a leg up on his colleague James Ho, who has also been campaigning for the seat, because Ho will not look the part to this president. If I had to put money down, I’d say Oldham will be the pick, because he’s got the far-right jurisprudence and he looks like the MAGA justice from central casting in Donald Trump’s dreams.

I think you’re aiming way too high in selecting actual sitting judges for this. I’m going to go with Lindsey Halligan and Jeanine Pirro. I know central casting is the most important phrase for Trump when selecting someone. But I also think the “Own the Libs” vibe is such that it could be Kash Patel. You seemed to suggest that gravitas at some level is important. And I’m not sure it’s going to be.

There was a moment, when the tech CEOs and media moguls were lining up to kiss Trump’s ring, when it looked like almost all the demographic arrows were pointing right, where it looked like Trumpism was, if not widely embraced, at least too big to be written off. After a year of Trump back in office, the culture cries out for Woke 2.0.

It has been a year since J.D. Vance went to Europe and chose (rhetorical) violence.

At the Munich Security Conference last February, the vice president described Europe’s greatest threat as one “from within,” chiding its leadership for suppressing national speech and political participation, especially of anti-immigrant, anti-EU movements. Vance’s hostility, combined with some hypocrisy, shocked leaders: They’d expected a lecture from the incoming administration, but maybe on defense spending. Instead, Vance’s position suggested a more profound rupture in the trans-Atlantic relationship, one where the U.S.’s commercial tech interests and ideological affinity for Europe’s far right were coalescing into a broader attack on European sovereignty.

In the year since, the rift has widened, as the Trump administration and its allies have found common cause with Europe’s far right. In early February, the House GOP Judiciary Committee accused Europe of a “decade-long” campaign to censor the global internet, including by using its regulatory power to “silence political opposition.” European far-right leaders and political parties seized on these claims. “So maybe without interference of the EU we could have won the elections in 2025,” Geert Wilders, the leader of Party of Freedom, a Dutch far-right party, wrote on X.

It’s part of a broader effort between the MAGA movement, including Donald Trump and his allies, and the European populist right to frame the European Union as stifling free speech, particularly on U.S. tech platforms. Prominent voices in American Big Tech, most notably Elon Musk, have long opposed Europe’s attempts at moderating these platforms, and that has converged with the Trump administration’s deepening antagonism toward the European Union.

Now, American and European leaders are back in Munich starting Friday, with even more baggage between them: defense, Ukraine, tariffs, Trump’s designs on Greenland. All, or just one, could be fatal for a nearly 80-year partnership. But the U.S.’s push against what it perceives as censorship points to a more foundational break, one where the U.S. is more openly hostile to the European project and is actively seeking to destabilize European governance.

“In the past, people talked about how the liberal democratic shared value base was a glue for the trans-Atlantic relationship, even at times when perhaps strategic interests were diverging,” said Leonard A. Schütte, an international security program fellow at the Harvard Belfer Center. “Now we have divergent strategic interests and a diverging ideological value base. I’m extremely worried about the future of the trans-Atlantic relationship given those two fundamental forces.”

There are two components to these diverging ideological values. The first is a U.S. and European divide on how to manage tech and social platforms, including content moderation, data transparency, and privacy rules. This kind of policy split is not unusual, and past U.S. administrations—including Obama and Trump I—sometimes pushed back against Europe’s efforts to rein in American tech companies. But this Trump administration has framed such regulations as illiberal suppression of political speech and populist opposition movements. That has turned a divergence on how the European Union does tech policy into a more sweeping indictment of how Europe does democracy.

The particular boogeyman of the moment is the Digital Services Act, which fully went into effect in 2024, and broadly regulates large internet platforms—like Musk’s X or Meta’s Facebook—by asking those giants to remove content that would be illegal under EU or national laws, while also putting in procedures for users to challenge decisions. It pushes for greater accountability on things like advertising practices. Musk has declared all-out war on the DSA, in part because X came under the law’s scrutiny pretty quickly. In December, X was fined 120 million euros for violations after an investigation around the lack of transparency around who now had blue check-mark accounts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the fine on Musk’s X “an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments. The days of censoring Americans online are over.”

Andrew Peek, the director of the Adrienne Arsht National Security Resilience Initiative of the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center, and former senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council under Trump, said that many in the administration and close to it are scarred from the COVID-19 pandemic and the politics around it, which they saw as a time of government overreach that shut down dissenting views on social media. “This really resonates very deeply, this systemic concern with political freedom and how easily it’s snuffed out,” Peek said. “I don’t want to sound hyperbolic—because it does sound hyperbolic—but I think this is legitimate. This is the way people feel.”

For a U.S. looking at Europe, Peek added, “it is perceived by us as an external interference in national elections and national politics, usually to the detriment of what the Trump administration would see as ideologically simpatico groups.”

Across Europe, freedom-of-speech laws are less absolutist than in the U.S., including a stricter approach to hate speech, born out of its history from World War II. But MAGA and those simpatico groups in Europe claim that is making them a target for their legitimate views, particularly on migration. “The European right-wing parties have tried to frame this, and the U.S. fight against increased platform regulation in Europe, as a fight against their positions—as a fight against their political combat to gain power,” said Jacob Ross, research fellow at the European Center at the German Council on Foreign Relations.

Ross said the MAGA movements, including parts of the administration, and certain European right-wing movements (like Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland) or those in power (like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán) see themselves aligned in wanting to change the trans-Atlantic and the Western status quo. “That’s an ideological common ground that exists and that certain elements of the U.S. government try to exploit,” he said, though he added it can get a bit awkward when the U.S. does things—like threaten to invade Greenland—that put these nationalistic parties in a tough spot. “That forced many European right-wing populists to distance themselves, to underline that they have their country’s interests in mind, European interests in mind,” Ross said, “while at the same time still hoping for some kind of support, certainly through the networks, and maybe money-wise as well, from these U.S. forces.”

Riccardo Alcaro, research coordinator and head of the global actors program at the Istituto Affari Internazionali, said that wing of MAGA—most closely associated with Vance and tech bros, like Musk, and Vance ally Peter Thiel—see Europe as an “object of almost resentful nostalgia,” because they believe it is betraying its cultural, religious (meaning Christian), and ethnic roots. Or as the White House’s National Security Strategy put it: “We want Europe to remain European, to regain its civilizational self-confidence, and to abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation.”

Linking regulation and civilization makes this existential for MAGA and its right-wing allies in Europe. That will likely make it harder for the U.S. to work constructively with Europe on legitimate concerns about, say, the regulatory burdens or even on censorship of political speech. Critics, for example, have raised concerns about its approach to disinformation during emergencies. But the United States is deploying a blunt, all-or-nothing approach. It sanctioned a former EU official that the State Department called the “mastermind” behind the DSA. The Financial Times reported that the State Department will fund MAGA-aligned think tanks, including to help undermine the DSA. Bram Vranken, a researcher and campaigner at the Corporate Europe Observatory, noted that Big Tech, including Meta and Google, have increased their lobbying of far-right groups in the European parliament. “They’re building a bridge between the Trump administration and the European far right,” he added.

This leaves the European Union and many of its leaders in another impossible bind, not unlike the one it’s facing on its defense amid the Trump administration’s flagging commitment to NATO and the president’s desire to coerce an ally to hand over its territory. When it comes to tech, as with defense, Europe is deeply, deeply reliant on American services. The European Digital SME Alliance, a trade group, said almost 80 percent of Europe’s digital tech is imported. What is more, America’s increasing hostility is raising concerns that if the U.S. took aggressive action—over Greenland, say—it could potentially wield that tech dependency as leverage, cutting off access and crippling European critical infrastructure.

“What [the Trump] administration has done is that they have really created a kind of Sputnik moment, where the Europeans realize now that this decoupling, or de-risking, from American technology is inevitable,” said Anu Bradford, a leading scholar on EU regulation at Columbia Law School.

But this realization comes with another: Right now, Europe has few alternatives. France announced that a French videoconferencing platform will replace American services for its government departments, but with the target date of 2027, according to ABC News. Aura Salla, member of the European Parliament from Finland in the European People’s Party, said there is a growing acceptance that Europe needs technological sovereignty. But, she added, “it will take time.”

Europe has been a very, very good market for American tech, which underscores the risk of the Trump administration’s blunt use of leverage with its European partners. Yet Europe isn’t a market Big Tech will quietly walk away from, either. Evelyn Austin, the executive director of Bits of Freedom, an Amsterdam-based digital rights organization, put it this way: “Reliance brings problems—and getting out of that reliance brings risks.”

Austin said she thinks Europe should identify this reliance as a national security threat, which might empower countries to accelerate that decoupling.

“What I find really daunting is the consequences or implications of that,” Austin said. “You’re walking into a very, very conflictual relationship with the U.S.—and that terrifies me. But I’m not sure if there’s any way around it. Aren’t we actually already there?”

            <div id="article-text">Hands-on Run real Windows in an automatically managed virtual machine, and mix Windows apps in their own windows on your Linux desktop.

WinApps and WinBoat both deliver the same functionality: they run real Windows in a VM and export native Windows apps in individual windows onto your Linux desktops, integrated with your native Linux applications, via the wizardry of Microsoft&#39;s Remote Desktop Protocol. RDP was Microsoft&#39;s answer to X11, before the great minds of the Wayland project came along to tell us that we don&#39;t need such things.

For all the abilities of modern Linux, there are some apps – especially paid commercial ones – that still require Windows. We outlined three ways to run Windows apps on Linux in May 2025. WINE is amazing and the current version can run a lot of Windows apps smoothly on Linux – but there are limits to its compatibility: for instance, there&#39;s no Microsoft Store. The main alternative is to run a real copy of Windows inside a virtual machine, and when you need those specific tools, fire up the VM, and use the apps inside it. (Since late 1994, the desktop version of VMWare is free to use – and it both offers pretty good performance for Windows guests, and some helpful integration tools.) Even so, managing a VM does require some effort, and moving your files and data between host and VM inevitably means some extra legwork.

Both WinApps and WinBoat aspire to make this seamless and almost invisible, using a real copy of Windows running in a hidden virtual machine that uses Linux&#39;s built-in native virtualization tools rather than add-on hypervisors. The goal is to offer better compatibility than WINE, near-native performance, and better integration between host OS and virtualized apps. The key differences are control and maturity. WinApps is quite mature and very flexible, but it needs you to either have some virtualization skills or to invest effort in learning and editing config files. WinBoat is new, hasn&#39;t reached version 1.0 yet, but it automates as much as possible away to make life easy.

WinApps is by some years the more mature of the two. Its creator Ben Curtis started the original project in about 2020, but development went dormant a couple of years ago, leading to a &quot;hard fork&quot; that is actively working on a modernized version.

WinApps was not the only project to investigate the same approach: running real Windows in a VM, and displaying apps over RDP. The Cassowary project did the same thing, but it too went quiet about four years ago.

WinApps is very flexible, and boasts compendious documentation. It supports three different ways to run Windows: two flavors of container, or directly using the kernel&#39;s KVM virtualization. If you&#39;re comfy with using container tools, then that&#39;s the easier way, and WinApps supports using either Docker or Podman. The main difference is that Docker requires root privileges, but Podman doesn&#39;t. Alternatively, WinApps can directly control a Windows instance inside KVM using the libvirt API, but the docs do warn:

While this method requires considerably more manual configuration, it also provides greater virtual machine customization options.

They are not kidding. The libvirt method is much more complex to install, but it&#39;s also much more flexible – for instance, this way, the hypervisor can even run on a different computer. For example, if you have a well-specced laptop with a broken screen sitting around doing nothing, you could dedicate a whole PC to the Windows VM, separately from your desktop box.

We tried an initial test run using Docker containers, but even though we predicted the rise of containers 15 years ago, this vulture has little experience of deploying the things. Without custom config, the WinApps config for both Docker and Podman defaults to storing the Windows VM in /var/lib – much as we noted of the Debian FreedomBox blend earlier this year. That means you need a big Linux root partition: the docs suggest a minimum size of 32 GB for the Windows system disk, and 64 GB is more prudent. The entire root volume on our testbed machine is only 64 gig, so we didn&#39;t have room for this approach.

The Reg FOSS desk is more familiar with KVM and its GUI front end, Virtual Machine Manager. As we&#39;ve used it before – ironically, mostly for running experimental Kubernetes clusters – we decided to try that instead. The WinApps documentation is very good, too. We used virt-manager to set up a 64 GB VM with 8 GB of RAM and two CPU cores, running Windows 10 IoT LTSC.

We followed the steps to set up host/VM integration. We recommend following this carefully and closely – at several points, it is not enough to just accept the default settings. We had to download and edit scripts in places, entering the correct local IP address so the scripts could find the VM and so on. You&#39;ll also need to know your way around Windows: you need to configure it, activate it, and so on. Helpfully, the docs tell you how to bypass Windows 11&#39;s burning need to talk to the mothership, so you can configure an offline account. At least that&#39;s less of an issue with Win10 LTSC.

Normally, you leave the Windows VM hidden and not logged in (which itself saves some memory in the VM, of course). When you open a Windows program, WinApps starts the VM if necessary, connects to it using the Linux FreeRDP client, and the app opens in its own window on your Linux desktop.

Setup is a long and complex process, though. It took us more than a day to get everything working. The final stage of setup integrates the apps in your new Windows VM into the Linux desktop&#39;s app launcher, which left us with several superfluous icons for things like Microsoft Paint. Doing it at this point feels premature to us – it means that any apps you install in your new VM don&#39;t get picked up.

Some of the steps require you to log out and log back in again to take effect. For an easy life, we treated it like many Windows installations: just reboot.

Next, on a different machine, we tried the much newer WinBoat application. WinBoat is only about six months old and is only up to version 0.9.0 so far, and it&#39;s implemented mostly in Typescript with a little bit of Go. It&#39;s attracting attention, though – The Register&#39;s own Rupert Goodwins mentioned it just last month.

The project FAQ section covers many of the differences. The first question is How does it compare to WinApps? To which it says:

With WinApps you do the bulk of the setup manually, and there&#39;s no cohesive interface to bring it all together. There&#39;s a basic TUI, a taskbar widget, and some CLI commands for you to play with.

WinBoat does all the setup once you have the pre-requisites installed, displays everything worth seeing in a neat interface for you, and acts like a complete experience. There&#39;s no need to mess with configuration files, no need to memorize a dozen CLI commands, it just works.

To be honest, when we first read this last year, our response was dismissive – but after getting WinApps working, suddenly this seems like a good and desirable objective.

The WinBoat configuration tab has 13 or so options you can adjust, which is a lot easier than editing config files - click to enlarge

WinBoat offers few choices. It uses Docker (although v0.9.0 offers Podman as an option, with the drawback that USB passthrough no longer works). It doesn&#39;t ask you to configure Docker, either: all you need is to install it, for which it points to Docker&#39;s own instructions. You also need to install FreeRDP. The installation program links to FreeRDP&#39;s own docs again, although we just installed the standard X11 version in Ubuntu Noble&#39;s repositories and it worked fine.

WinBoat is available in various formats, including AppImage, native .deb and .rpm packages, and even a Nix version. For now, though, there&#39;s no repository, updates are your own lookout – so we chose the AppImage. On Ubuntu 24.04.4, this threw the same error message as our preferred Panwriter app, so we just recalled this command from our history:

The Appimage doesn&#39;t include any external dependencies – it just halts and warns you if they&#39;re missing. We installed Docker, rebooted, and tried again… then installed FreeRDP3 and rebooted… and it ran straight through. It can download a Windows evaluation .iso file for you, but we pointed at our local LTSC edition and it used it happily. It shows a link to open the Windows VM&#39;s screen in a browser tab, which you might need to activate and update Windows – but almost everything else is done for you. Let it chug away for half an hour to an hour.

WinBoat also avoids fancy integration with the Linux desktop: the main app window shows the status of the Windows VM with large friendly buttons to pause and stop it, and a list of apps it found inside the VM. Click an app, wait a few seconds, and there it is, running in a window on your Linux desktop.

There is no simple answer to which is the better tool. WinBoat is much easier to get working, and it does the same job with little mess or fuss.

Like many power-user Linux programs, WinApps isn&#39;t too intimidating if you&#39;re happy to edit config files – especially if you&#39;re comfortable and familiar with Docker or Podman. Saying that, using it with KVM/VMM definitely has advantages. For instance, it allows you to tweak KVM memory ballooning. This feature enables the hypervisor to reclaim unused RAM from the VM so the host can use it. Our WinApps testbed machine has 24 GB of RAM, and we gave the VM 4 GB but allowed it to balloon up to 8 GB.

Another benefit is that virt-manager can connect to a remote machine and manage its VMs as easily as local ones, which means you could, for instance, take an old box that doesn&#39;t have a TPM 2 chip for Windows 11, configure a minimal text-only Linux setup on it. Then using VMM on your desktop, create a Windows guest instance with a fake virtual TPM, install Windows 11 in that, and allocate all but a gig or so of the machine&#39;s RAM to that VM. You could also pass a real physical GPU through to the VM.

If you have a very high-end PC and a big Linux root partition, you might not care about this. On the other hand, WinBoat offers a simple dialog box that asks where to save the container with the Windows VM inside – so we were able to put it in our home directory, on a separate disk partition, with no problem.

At the end of the day, they both work and do the job. Although setup is lower-tech, WinApps has better integration, on both the Windows side and the host desktop. For instance, WinApps offers a little status-bar applet, which lets you start and stop the VM, pick apps from a list, and open a desktop session. In both, you can connect a Windows network drive to your Linux home directory, making file exhange easy. In WinApps, it&#39;s \\tsclient\home, and in WinBoat it&#39;s \\host\lan. Either way, map a network drive and it&#39;s right there in a couple of clicks.

If you&#39;re an experienced Linux techie, WinApps can do fancy stuff. This vulture is pretty experienced, and even so, its setup process had us swearing at several points. On the other hand, WinBoat makes almost all that just go away. To quote the late great John Brunner:

It&#39;s supposed to be automatic but actually you have to press this button.

That button conceals a lot of black magic, but it hides the plumbing very well and it works.

Perhaps the best comparison is with the Windows Subsystem for Linux. WSL2 runs a Linux VM under Windows, integrated with the host OS; WinApps and WinBoat run a Windows VM under Linux, integrated with the host OS. If you are content and productive on your Linux desktop, but you constantly need certain specific Windows desktop apps and they don&#39;t work fully under WINE, this is easier and better-integrated than firing up a Windows VM in a window. Both tools can run Windows software that still doesn&#39;t work fully under WINE, such as current Microsoft and Adobe suites.

The downside, though, is that you are still running a full extra OS. You&#39;ll need to license it, it needs antivirus, and like any other copy of Windows it will need regular maintenance. Also, your computer&#39;s resources must be shared between both OSes. If you use this all day every day, you&#39;ll want lots of RAM, lots of fast disk space, and a fast machine. We tried two of our testbeds: an elderly (if well-specced) Thinkpad W520 with Ubuntu Questing, and a rather faster Dell Latitude 5420 with Ubuntu Noble. Windows apps were slow to launch on the Thinkpad; the whole process felt much smoother on the newer machine, but it still wasn&#39;t super-quick. On both, we saw display glitches when using two screens.

If your apps work, WINE is faster: apps launch quicker, integrate better, and because no copy of Windows is involved, there&#39;s no ongoing maintenance – and no license. The WinApps approach is strictly for desktop apps, and ideally, ones which don&#39;t want a fancy GPU or other dedicated local hardware. WINE and supplementary tools like Proton are better if what you want to run are Windows games. Most full-screen games won&#39;t work well in a VM.

WinApps and WinBoat beat WINE on compatibility, though. If you need the Windows Store, or current Microsoft or Adobe programs, this is a great way to run them on your Linux desktop. And of course, both WinApps and WinBoat are free and open source. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/14/ai_risk_distillation_attacks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two of the world&#39;s biggest AI companies, Google and OpenAI, both warned this week that competitors including China&#39;s DeepSeek are probing their models to steal the underlying reasoning, and then copy these capabilities in their own AI systems.

&quot;This is coming from threat actors throughout the globe,&quot; Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register, adding that the perpetrators are &quot;private-sector companies.&quot; He declined to name specific companies or countries involved in this type of intellectual property theft.

&quot;Your model is really valuable IP, and if you can distill the logic behind it, there&#39;s very real potential that you can replicate that technology – which is not inexpensive,&quot; Hultquist said. &quot;This is such an important technology, and the list of interested parties in replicating it are endless.&quot;

Google calls this process of using prompts to clone its models &quot;distillation attacks,&quot; and in a Thursday report said one campaign used more than 100,000 prompts to &quot;try to replicate Gemini&#39;s reasoning ability in non-English target languages across a wide variety of tasks.&quot;

American tech giants have spent billions of dollars training and developing their own LLMs. Abusing legitimate access to mature models like Gemini, and then using this information to train newer models, makes it significantly cheaper and easier for competitors to develop their own AI chatbots and systems.

Google says it detected this probe in real time and protected its internal reasoning traces. However, distillation appears to be yet another AI risk that is extremely difficult - if not impossible - to eliminate.

This is such an important technology, and the list of interested parties in replicating it are endless

Distillation from Gemini models without permission violates Google&#39;s terms of service, and Google can block accounts that do this, or even take users to court. While the company says it continues to develop better ways to detect and stop these attempts, the very nature of LLMs makes them susceptible.

Public-facing AI models are widely accessible, and enforcement against abusive accounts can turn into a game of whack-a-mole.

Plus, as Hultquist warned, as other companies develop their own models and train them on internal, sensitive data, the risk from distillation attacks is going to spread.

&quot;We&#39;re on the frontier when it comes to this, but as more organizations have models that they provide access to, it&#39;s inevitable,&quot; he said. &quot;As this technology is adopted and developed by businesses like financial institutions, their intellectual property could also be targeted in this way.&quot;

Meanwhile, OpenAI, in a Thursday memo [PDF] to the House Select Committee on China, blamed DeepSeek and other Chinese LLM providers and universities for copying ChatGPT and other US firms&#39; frontier models. It also noted some occasional activity from Russia, and warned illicit model distillation poses a risk to &quot;American-led, democratic AI.&quot;

China&#39;s distillation methods over the last year have become more sophisticated, moving beyond chain-of-thought (CoT) extraction to multi-stage operations. These include synthetic-data generation, large-scale data cleaning, and other stealthy methods. As OpenAI wrote:

Specifically, our review indicates that DeepSeek has continued to pursue activities consistent with adversarial distillation targeting OpenAI and other US frontier labs. We have observed accounts associated with DeepSeek employees developing methods to circumvent OpenAI&#39;s access restrictions and access models through obfuscated third-party routers and other ways that mask their source. We also know that DeepSeek employees developed code to access US AI models and obtain outputs for distillation in programmatic ways. We believe that DeepSeek also uses third-party routers to access frontier models from other US labs.

OpenAI also notes that it has invested in stronger detections to prevent unauthorized distillation. It bans accounts that violate its terms of service and proactively removes users who appear to be attempting to distill its models. Still, the company admits that it alone can&#39;t solve the model distillation problem.

It&#39;s going to take an &quot;ecosystem security&quot; approach to protect against distillation, and this will require some US government assistance, OpenAI says. &quot;It is not enough for any one lab to harden its protection because adversaries will simply default to the least protected provider,&quot; according to the memo.

The AI company also suggests that US government policy &quot;may be helpful&quot; when it comes to sharing information and intelligence, and working with the industry to develop best practices on distillation defenses. OpenAI also called on Congress to close API router loopholes that allow DeepSeek and other competitors to access US models, and to restrict &quot;adversary&quot; access to US compute and cloud infrastructure. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">APRICOT 2026 For almost 30 years, the PingER project at the USA’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory used ping thousands of time each day to measure the time a packet of data required to make a round trip between two nodes on the internet.

But in 2024, the last person working on the project retired and SLAC shut it down without a plan to preserve or share the data it collected.

Happily, the tight network research community knew of PingER’s demise. Enter Jim Cowie, a computer scientist, academic, and entrepreneur.

In the latter capacity, Cowie founded a company called Renesys that between 2000 and 2014 gathered and sold intelligence about internet infrastructure – think of it as a precursor to Cloudflare’s Radar service.

A company called Dyn acquired Renesys in 2014, before itself being acquired by Oracle. During the back-office crunch that followed the two acquisitions, much of the data Renesys had collected over the years was lost.

“As time passes, information likes to disappear. If you do not invest, its default is to die,” Cowie told The Register.

Losing data irks Cowie, who, this week, told the Asia Pacific Regional Internet Conference on Operational Technologies (APRICOT) he thinks “the operational exhaust of the internet” can help humanity to understand what networked systems have done to society.

“If we wanted to understand if human progress and technical progress are aligned, how would we do that?” he asked during his keynote address. “These are perilous times. Everything is changing and we don’t know how.”

Cowie thinks historians can start to answer those questions by investigating data collected by projects like PingER, Renesys, and others who collect data about the internet’s operations.

So he’s started a project to preserve those files for posterity.

It’s called the Internet History Initiative (IHI) and Cowie says its mission is to identify and preserve the records that will let future generations tell the story of the internet and its impact. He thinks it will need to involve archivists, library scientists, technologists, and other specialists, operating across many institutions.

A core activity of the project will be to apply the LOCKSS principle – Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe – to store data offline using methods that will preserve it for a century. Cowie thinks IHI will need a distributed group of project participants who store parts of the collection, plus a federation layer that provides a view of all the datasets it stores. He also envisages another version of the collection in warm storage so researchers can access it.

He’s optimistic IHI will be able to create such a resource, because similar collections already exist.

“People like the RIPE NCC have been holding on to routing data and active performance data for decades and have organized it,” Cowie said.

He also pointed to the University of Oregon’s RouteViews project, which has archived almost 30 years of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing data and makes it available to researchers.

That project’s peering coordinator, Nina Bargisen, said RouteViews is already aware of the IHI, feels its goals are similar to its own, and sees no reason why her organization would not be willing to engage and help.

“There are probably a half a dozen or a dozen organizations like that, which have that kind of history,” Cowie said, and if they pool expertise the IHI will have plenty to work with. “We are not starting from zero, by any means.”

Indeed, IHI has already preserved some datasets from RIPE, and recovered the SLAC PingER data.

The organization has also identified the data it wants to preserve, and some data it fears may already be lost.

Cowie told The Register he is aware of an academic paper that describes a research project that analyzed every packet of data transmitted from the USA to the UK for two hours. The paper remains easy to find, he said, but the data it describes has vanished.

He hopes someone knows where that data, and other collections like it, can be found. “Think of people you know who have old traceroutes, or zone files, on a magnetic tape or in their closet,&quot; he said, and then ask them to contact the project.&quot;

He’s open to learning about new data sources, too. The Register pointed out that networking vendors have collected decades of data describing customers’ use of their products, and that Cisco has so much that it&#39;s trained custom LLMs. Cowie seemed intrigued by the possibilities such data creates for IHI.

The IHI will need friends, and funding. RouteViews’ Bargisen said if anyone can pull this off, Cowie can. The man himself said he’s in discussions with various parties, but that it is too early to discuss how the project will constitute itself.

But he urged anyone interested to join its mailing list and stay tuned. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon inched closer to its atomic datacenter dream on Friday after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensed its small modular reactor partner X-energy to make nuclear fuel for advanced reactors at a facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

The approval clears yet another hurdle to the commercial rollout of these miniaturized reactors by major bit barn operators. Amazon became one of the first to embrace the yet unproven tech in late 2024 when it made a $500 million bet on X-Energy&#39;s Xe-100 reactors to end its reliance on the power grid and fuel its datacenter growth.

X-Energy&#39;s license under 10 CFR part 70 enables its subsidiary TRISO-X to manufacture the high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel pellets that will eventually power that reactor.

The company boasts its TX-1 and TX-2 fuel plants are the first such facilities to receive approval in half a century, though we&#39;ll note they&#39;re not exactly finished. X-Energy expects to complete construction of the first site later this year, and it can&#39;t start churning out pellets until it passes an on-site inspection by the NRC to ensure it&#39;s safe.

For safety&#39;s sake, the enriched uranium is formed into small TRISO fuel particles coated in multiple layers of carbon and ceramic materials, which are then embedded in graphite to form pebbles roughly the size of a billiard ball. Hundreds of thousands of these pebbles will be circulated through the reactor continuously. In the case of the Xe-100, heat generated by this process will be captured using helium gas and then used to produce steam to drive a turbine.

Each Xe-100 reactor is expected to produce up to 80 megawatts of power continuously for 60 years. For context, that&#39;s enough to power the typical AWS campuses of yesteryear, although the honkin&#39; GPU-cranking datacenters of the putative AI boom are slated to use up to 50 times that much.

X-Energy expects to produce roughly 700,000 pebbles a year at its TX-1 site, enough for around 11 reactors. Its TX-2 site, which is currently in the design phase, is expected to dramatically increase production.

While a step toward energy independence, Amazon will be waiting a while longer to get its hands on the tech. X-Energy expects to deliver the five gigawatts of power contracted by Amazon &quot;by&quot; 2039, with the first reactors coming online sometime in the 2030s. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite its CEO&#39;s insistence that it wasn&#39;t doing any &quot;large scale&quot; deals soon, ServiceNow has acquired yet another company. This time, the software firm has scooped up Pyramid Analytics, an Israeli corporation with data science and preparation expertise. The goal is to build additional context and semantics into its software stack.

“Pyramid adds an analytics and semantic layer that can define metrics in a way that both humans and AI agents can rely on,” Forrester VP and Principal Analyst Charles Betz told The Register Friday. “Natural‑language querying is one expression of that, but the deeper value for customers is moving analytics closer to action — embedding trusted, shared meaning directly into workflows, suitable for agentic automation, rather than treating semantics as purely a design time problem and analytics as a downstream reporting use case.”

Grabbing Pyramid Analytics is the latest in a string of acquisitions that ServiceNow is using to build a software stack that goes from ingesting tickets and monitoring workflows to using knowledge graphs to understand the what and why behind objects that appear in a customers&#39; CMDBs. The company’s purchase of Data.World and Veza are other examples of this direction.

“The most important signal is less about natural‑language query per se and more about semantics,” Betz said.

ServiceNow said that when Pyramid Analytics’ capabilities are brought into the fold, customers will be able to turn its dashboards that display information into action within the system.

“For example, AI-driven insights can automatically surface an issue, open and route a case, recommend the next best actions, and drive resolution across IT and the business — all in one connected workflow,” wrote Guarav Rewari, general manager and senior vice president of data analytics in a blog that announced the deal.

Pyramid will provide “canonical” definitions for a business which will allow humans and AI agents to take more confident action on business decisions across the customer’s IT estate, Rewarit wrote. He said it lets ServiceNow break out of the domain-specific use cases and connect to data outside of ServiceNow’s traditional remit.

“We’ll use Pyramid Analytics to deliver high-value solutions across IT, HR, supply chain, and other areas, combining data connectivity, AI-powered queries, workflow automation, and trusted governance,” Rewari wrote.

News of the acquisition came about two weeks after company CEO Bill McDermott told investors the company had no more “large scale” M&A deals planned during the company’s fourth quarter earnings call.

“And as it relates to future M&A, we do not have a large-scale M&A on the road map,&quot; he said. “What happened, and I felt for you all, we had Moveworks. It took 9 months to close. We no sooner closed Moveworks … and then had Armis and Veza come to you within like a few days. So probably, it was a little bit what&#39;s going on over there at ServiceNow? And I noticed that we lost about $10 billion in market cap on that because of the worry. So now the worry is gone, you can give us back to market cap.”

Since that Jan. 28 call, ServiceNow’s share price has dropped an additional 8.27 percent.

Financial details of the Pyramid Analytics transaction were not disclosed. A ServiceNow spokesperson told The Register that this purchase was not material to financial results and described it as a “tuck-in.”

“Pyramid is a smaller, strategic tuck-in that strengthens our data and analytics capabilities,” the spokesperson said. “It is not material to our business.”

Betz said that, while the “optics are not the best,” when McDermott made those comments the deal was likely almost closed.

“I took Bill McDermott’s comments as aimed at very large, balance‑sheet‑shaping transactions,” Betz told The Register. “Pyramid appears materially smaller than deals like Armis, more targeted rather than a broad portfolio bet. In that sense, it’s consistent with a strategy of filling specific gaps rather than pursuing transformational M&A. Also, timing. Bill said that just a few weeks back; the Pyramid deal was presumably way too far done to reverse.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Can using AI teach you to code more quickly than traditional methods? Anthropic certainly thinks so. The AI outfit has partnered with computer science education org CodePath to get Claude and Claude Code into the hands of students, a time-tested strategy for seeding product interest and building brand loyalty.

The project aims to Claude-ify more than 20,000 students at community colleges, state schools, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).

According to Anthropic, more than 40 percent of CodePath students come from families earning less than $50,000 a year, a nod to the less privileged who may not be able to afford college without financial assistance.

&quot;We now have the technology to teach in two years what used to take four,&quot; said Michael Ellison, co-founder and CEO of CodePath, in a statement. &quot;But speed for some and not others just widens inequality. Partnering with Anthropic means our students learn to build with Claude from day one, at institutions that have historically been overlooked. This results in better outcomes for our students and a fundamentally different answer to who gets to shape the AI economy.&quot;

We question whether access to Claude will empower economically disadvantaged students to &quot;shape the AI economy.&quot; Entering the workforce with some knowledge of Claude should enable participation in the AI economy – certainly a win if the Claude-deprived find jobs scarce. But shaping the AI economy remains the privilege of corporations and billionaires, of those throwing cash at computing infrastructure, politicians, and public relations.

CodePath plans to integrate Claude into various programming courses to give students experience building projects with AI tools and contributing to open source projects – at least the ones that allow AI-generated code submissions.

CodePath students have been pilot testing Claude Code, to good effect, it&#39;s claimed. Anthropic reports that Laney Hood, CodePath student and computer science major at Texas Tech University, had nice things to say about its software.

&quot;Claude Code was instrumental in my learning process, especially since I came into the project with very little experience in the programming languages used in the repository [including TypeScript and Node.js],&quot; said Hood.

At the start of the personal computer revolution in the 1980s, companies like Apple and Microsoft worked to get their products into the hands of students, knowing that early familiarity encourages customer retention.

As web and cloud services began to overshadow traditional operating systems as computing gatekeepers, Google adopted a similar strategy by pushing its Chromebook hardware into schools. More recently, Meta has followed suit, with a mixed and virtual reality offering called Meta for Education.

And now, as AI companies strive to make their models chokepoints for computing services, they too are wooing students in the hope of building lasting brands.

OpenAI, last year, announced that it had joined the American Federation of Teachers to help launch the National Academy for AI Instruction, alongside Anthropic and Microsoft. And before that, OpenAI debuted ChatGPT Edu. Meta, meanwhile, has been trying to get its Llama model family into schools through a partnership with Blended Labs.

Anthropic insists that its tie-up with CodePath isn&#39;t just about modernizing the curriculum of computer science. The AI biz says it expects to work with CodePath on public research into the way that AI is changing education and economic opportunities.

Those opportunities – specifically programming jobs – have declined significantly since 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Nonetheless, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics says, &quot;Overall employment of software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers is projected to grow 15 percent from 2024 to 2034, much faster than the average [of 3 percent] for all occupations.&quot;

There is already ample research on the impact that AI is having on computer science education. Recent papers on the subject tend to be a mixed bag, finding AI assistance can be helpful if properly administered, so long as there&#39;s compensation for the learning lost by offloading cognitive tasks. ®

Buying a pre-assembled gaming desktop makes sense for some. It can save you time and money, too, compared to buying PC components piecemeal. If you’re weighing your options, consider some Presidents Day offers on iBuyPower’s pre-built desktops, including the $1,899 RDY Element 9 Pro R07 and the $2,099.99 Slate — both of which are stocked with high-end AMD processors and GPUs that can tear through most games at 1440p with fast frame rates. They also come with 32GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of storage, along with a mouse and keyboard.

Digging into the Element 9 Pro R07, it features AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor, a Radeon 9070 XT graphics card with 16GB of VRAM (roughly on-par with the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti), 32GB of DDR6 6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD built into the Asus B650EM Max Gaming motherboard. It ships in iBuyPower’s Element 9 Pro case, which has tempered glass on the front and one side, and features a 360mm RGB liquid cooling system. The system includes an 850W power supply, a wired mouse, and a keyboard, plus a three-year labor warranty and two years of parts coverage. The GPU will be shipped uninstalled, so that’s the only component you’ll need to insert with iBuyPower’s instructions. Normally $2,149, you can currently get it for $1,899 at iBuyPower when you use coupon code STARS at checkout.

The Slate has slightly different specs, some that are improved over the Element above and some that are a bit below what it provides. The biggest highlight is that the Slate features AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, which edges out the 7800X3D in performance (although both are very capable CPUs). It also features an AMD Radeon 9070 XT graphics card, 32GB of DDR5 RAM at 5,200MHz instead of 6,000MHz, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. Like the R07, it includes a wired keyboard and mouse to get you started, along with a 750W power supply, a liquid cooling system, and a one-year warranty. It’s available for $2,099.99 at Best Buy.

Early standouts include a henge made of fiddles and a chaotic evil triangle.

Georgia Tech has announced the finalists in its annual Guthman Musical Instrument Competition. Every year, for the last 28 years, the school invites inventors from around the world to submit new instruments of their own design to compete for $10,000 in prizes. Past finalists have included founding members of Teenage Engineering, Artiphon, and Roli. And last year KOMA Elektronik won for their creation the Chromaplane.

This year’s finalists are an impressive collection of oddballs. There’s Amphibian Modules, a modular synth that swaps patch cables for a dish of saltwater. The Gajveena, which combines a double bass with a traditional Indian veena. And Fiddle Henge is, well, a henge made of fiddles. Four green violins are mounted to a bass drum and played with a spinning disk.

And then there’s the Demon Box, a chaotic triangle of evil that turns electromagnetic radiation into music. Unlike most of the rest of the finalists, it’s already a commercial product you can purchase from Eternal Research for $999. Beyond turning invisible EMF into audible sound, it can also control other synths by converting the invisible radiation from your cellphone or TV remote into MIDI and control voltage (CV).

Other finalists include the Lethelium, a sort of steel drum / harp hybrid made from a bike wheel, and an RFID-enabled open-source synth called The Masterpiece, designed for players with disabilities. Check out the video above for brief demos and details on all ten finalists. The winner will be announced following a competition concert on Saturday, March 14th.

﻿The $35 controller clamps onto the bottom of your phone but can also be used as a standalone wireless gamepad.

My ongoing quest to turn my iPhone into one of my favorite consoles of all time has led me to a curiously named controller. GameSir’s Pocket Taco is only barely pocketable, and distinctly lacking in taco fillings, but for $35, it’s an excellent and easy way to turn your phone into a Game Boy-inspired handheld for playing retro games that don’t require a pair of thumbsticks.

Unlike the Abxylute M4 mobile controller that attaches to phones using magnets, or the Backbone Pro that sandwiches your device between a split gamepad, the Pocket Taco uses a hinged mechanism that, for lack of a better description, bites onto the bottom half of your smartphone.

Inside the Pocket Taco, you’ll find soft silicone pads on either side that securely grip your device without scratching it or leaving any bite marks. The hold feels satisfyingly secure, and while my iPhone could slightly shift from side to side while inside the Pocket Taco, at no point did it ever feel at risk of falling out on its own.

The Pocket Taco’s hinge expands wide enough to attach to smartphones still inside bulky cases, and its open sides can accommodate phones and devices wider than the controller itself. You could use it with an iPad Mini, for example, although I didn’t have the chance to test the ergonomics of such a setup.

8BitDo announced a similar Game Boy-style controller for smartphones at CES 2026, featuring a front panel that can fully flip down. I couldn’t understand why anyone would want that feature, but after playing with the Pocket Taco for a week, I now understand why 8BitDo took that approach.

The front panel on the Pocket Taco can only hinge outward about 45 degrees, blocking the lower part of your smartphone’s screen while attached to your device. 8BitDo’s FlipPad gives you full access to your smartphone’s screen and UI while it’s attached, but I frequently found myself having to completely remove the Pocket Taco if I wanted to flip over to another app, or even just unlock my phone.

I haven’t tested the USB-C 8BitDo FlipPad yet, but a big advantage of the larger Pocket Taco is that it connects to your device over Bluetooth and has its own 600mAh rechargeable battery that won’t drain your phone. Opening the Pocket Taco powers it on and automatically pairs the controller with the last device you used — in my case, an iPhone 16 Pro. GameSir doesn’t list iOS as being officially supported, only Android, but I was able to connect to the Pocket Taco and my iPhone recognized it as a “DualShock 4 Wireless Controller.”

The Pocket Taco turns off automatically when you remove it from your phone. It powers up and reconnects quickly, though, so having to occasionally remove the controller to access your phone’s screen isn’t a huge inconvenience.

The Pocket Taco’s home button can also be used to manually power it on and off when it isn’t attached to a device, allowing it to be used as a standalone rechargeable Bluetooth controller. It was easy to pair with the Switch 2.

The controller’s four face buttons and D-pad all feel good with a solid click when pressed, and despite it being a little narrower than the original Game Boy, my large hands found the Pocket Taco extremely comfortable to play with. The double pair of shoulder buttons on the back were easy to reach, and the rounded edges on the bottom of the Pocket Taco didn’t dig into the fingers I was using to support the controller and my phone.

There are just a few things you’ll want to keep in mind when choosing what games to play, or how to play them. Unlike the Abxylute M4 or the Backbone controllers, GameSir made no attempt to squeeze thumbsticks or sliding joysticks onto the Pocket Taco. So it’s better suited for playing retro games from the 16-bit era and earlier that don’t have 3D environments with a camera to control.

I primarily tested the Pocket Taco with Game Boy, Super Nintendo, and GBA games played through the Delta emulator and RetroArch on iOS. The Pocket Taco worked great with both, but you’ll want to make sure you’re using an app with skins or layout options that can position the game closer to the top of your device’s screen. When I first tested the Pocket Taco with Delta, I turned off the emulator’s default skin to remove on-screen controls. That resulted in the game being vertically centered on my iPhone and partially covered by the Pocket Taco. It was easy to fix, but note that the controller can only be used in a vertical orientation.

8BitDo hasn’t announced pricing or a release date for its FlipPad yet, so I’m still curious how effective that smaller accessory will be at turning my smartphone into a handheld console, given its limitations. The Pocket Taco isn’t expected to ship until March 2026, but for $35, you get excellent controls, solid ergonomics, reliable Bluetooth connectivity, nearly universal smartphone compatibility, and the ability to use it as a standalone wireless gamepad.

            <div id="article-text">﻿But it’s also a potent tool of state power.

﻿But it’s also a potent tool of state power.

In an eyewitness video analyzed frame by frame by The New York Times, Alex Pretti raises one hand and holds a phone in the other. Federal agents tackle him, and one appears to find and remove a gun holstered on his hip. Then, an agent shoots — and a second follows. They appear to fire nine more shots as Pretti lies on the ground.

The Trump administration has claimed Pretti was shot because of his legally carried gun — that the agents, later identified in records viewed by ProPublica as Border Patrol agent Jesus Ochoa and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer Raymundo Gutierrez, acted in self-defense. But the tool he was visibly holding in the seconds before he was killed is the one the Trump administration seems truly afraid of — and the one it’s fought harder to control.

The phone Pretti held — like the ones that onlookers used to record his killing and share it with the world — had a kind of power that the Trump administration has repeatedly recognized as both a threat and an instrument, depending on who’s using it.

The visual of Pretti clutching his phone moments before his death is emblematic of millions across the country clutching to digital evidence and online forums to make sense of the events taking place across the country. For those who oppose the federal government’s immigration enforcement tactics, technology — particularly in the form of phones and social media — has become one of the strongest defenses, whether used to alert others to ICE’s presence, organize actions and aid, or help those far away see what’s happening on the ground. For the Trump administration, it’s a visible thorn in its side.

The administration recognizes, and uses, the force of information technology. Official government accounts regularly share right-wing memes with authoritarian and white supremacist talking points, while cabinet secretaries and President Donald Trump quickly jump on X and Truth Social to relay their version of events. Shortly before Pretti’s killing, the administration used social media to counter video evidence of another killing on the streets of Minneapolis at the hands of a federal agent: that of 37-year-old Renee Good. In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed Good “viciously ran over the ICE Officer,” and pointed to one grainy and distant angle of the incident that he said made it “hard to believe” the agent was alive. A Times analysis of several angles of the shooting — including those that were much closer to the incident — found that the “agent was not in the path of the victim’s SUV when he fired three shots at close range.”

The phone Pretti held had a kind of power that the Trump administration has repeatedly recognized as both a threat and an instrument

Officials across every administration have pushed back on negative press reports or downplayed their significance. Conservatives often point out that the Biden administration recognized the vast power of amplifying information across social media platforms — administration officials urged platforms to remove or limit the spread of medical misinformation during the covid-19 pandemic.

Still, the Trump administration has proved particularly willing to disregard obvious truth and particularly savvy at utilizing technology to shape its account of history. It’s curried favor with influencers it recognizes can be as effective, if not more so, as traditional media at spreading messages far and wide. Its rapid response memeification of policy issues fluently speaks the language of the internet. And it’s allied with or created platforms that facilitate the flow of information.

Trump learned an important lesson after his first term about how valuable it can be to control the very platforms where narratives spread. In 2020, a bystander’s video of Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, kneeling on the neck of a Black man named George Floyd for nine minutes spurred protests in cities around the country, and led to tangible — if often short-lived — change. Trump said Americans were “rightly sickened and revolted” by Floyd’s “brutal death,” but also blamed antifa and “professional anarchists” for provoking his pledge to deploy additional law enforcement to contain the demonstrations.

He also bears a more personal grudge. In 2021, Trump was kicked off of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube over concern he’d incite further violence following the insurrection at the US Capitol. A year later, he launched his own social platform, Truth Social. By the time he was elected to a second term, Elon Musk, a Trump backer who briefly joined the administration, owned X, the recently renamed Twitter. And rather than ban TikTok when required by law last year, Trump claimed to extend the deadline for a forced sale until ByteDance finally reached an agreement with some of his closest allies.

A large part of the stated reason lawmakers from both parties voted to force a sale of TikTok was because they feared an adversarial government could control what narratives would ultimately reach American users. Some already blamed the app for creating a generational wedge in Americans’ views on Israel. It’s not surprising that in an age where tech platforms have been mostly left to their own devices to determine what voices can and can’t be heard, that policymakers would worry about what messages are able to get through — and realize the unmatched potential of owning those pipes. Before he bought Twitter, Musk waxed poetic about being a free speech absolutist, then almost immediately deplatformed journalists who pointed to public information about his private jet’s whereabouts. Musk’s actions show what’s long been true of social media platforms: Privately held businesses are not really a public square, yet they continue to shape what messages get to inform our reality.

That’s why the administration has also acted swiftly to counter, and sometimes suppress, narratives spread online by opponents. After right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was killed by a gunman at a university in Utah, some conservative lawmakers and activists pressured employers and platforms to take action against people who posted critical comments about Kirk, and US Attorney General Pam Bondi pledged to target those using “hate speech” before clarifying that “Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment.” Reuters found that hundreds faced consequences from employers over their comments related to Kirk’s killing — while some celebrated or mocked his death, others simply reprinted Kirk’s own words or critiqued his political stances.

In several cases, administration officials have looked directly at platforms that amplify oppositional messages. Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr threatened broadcasters who aired comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s show after he made a joke about conservatives’ reaction to Kirk’s death. More recently, amid backlash in more liberal cities against ICE, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel promised to investigate Signal groups where users share information on immigration agents’ movements. And after criticism from the administration, Apple and Google both removed apps that let users report ICE sightings in public places.

As private sector businesses, tech platforms don’t have a legal obligation to make sure these kinds of apps or users’ posts remain available, but the First Amendment and Section 230 protect their choice to leave up or remove third-party content either way. While Section 230 has become a common target of Big Tech critics, proponents of the law warn that dismantling it could incentivize platforms to limit speech they consider risky that might invite legal liability.

Trump’s first administration recognized the power of technology, too. The president was notoriously a power user of what was then called Twitter. But at the time, his cabinet included more officials willing to push back on the most norm-breaking actions, and the president often ran into more checks on his power. Today, Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and many of the remaining lawmakers have tied their political fates to Trump. That’s created an environment where threats against speech have the potential to be more chilling than before.

Protesters stood on the frigid streets of Minneapolis, holding up their phones and pressing record

Even so, in today’s social media landscape, it’s still possible for an event like Pretti’s death to shock people on all corners of the internet and move some of the unlikeliest online communities to speak out. Shortly after the shooting, when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Pretti was “brandishing” a weapon with the intention of inflicting “maximum damage,” many had already seen the videos for themselves. They chose to believe their own eyes instead.

After Pretti was killed and the first video spread across social media, people quickly looked for other angles. Protesters who stood on the frigid streets of Minneapolis, holding up their phones and pressing record, would play an important role, armed with the First Amendment and one of the most powerful tools to wield it.

Pretti’s phone didn’t protect him on the day he died. But those who captured his killing at the hands of federal agents helped the world to see what was happening in Minneapolis, and kept many of them from turning away. To an administration that has tried so hard to control the narrative, that’s as dangerous a threat as any.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a frigid February evening, I went on four dates with AI companions at a pop-up dating café.

Hopping over a pile of dirty snow, I arrived on a frigid February evening at a wine bar in midtown, a purple neon sign reading “EVA AI cafe.” Inside, several people were seated at tables and booths, staring at phones. Servers milled about, placing mini potato croquettes and nonalcoholic spritzers on each table. Like many New York City bars, the majority of the patrons were on a date.

Unlike every other bar, half of the dates weren’t human.

As I enter, I’m shown to a table tucked away in the corner with a phone stand, a phone preloaded with the EVA AI app, and a pair of wireless headphones. An EVA AI employee doesn’t explain how things work, but it’s all pretty self-explanatory. It’s then that I notice a branded sticker that reads “jump into your desires with EVA AI.”

EVA AI is a “relationships RPG app.” You can chat with various AI companions. The app’s website describes it as a chance to “meet your ideal AI partner who listens, supports all your desires, and is always in touch with you.” That’s pretty much the schtick of every AI companion I’ve tested so far. The angle this time around is that you can bring your virtual AI companion into the real world. You can take them out on a real-life date. (And not get judged for it, at least.)

The event is sort of like speed-dating, but if you hit it off, you never have to move on to the next person — although a version of your date might be simultaneously chatting with someone else two tables away. The website for the pop-up cafe describes a cozy, warm, elegant ambiance that’s “just a little cinematic.” The reality is relatively bright lighting and a media scrum.

Of the 30-some-odd people in attendance, only two or three are organic users. The rest are EVA AI reps, influencers, and reporters hoping to make some capital-C Content. You can tell who the real guests are because they have ring lights, microphones, and cameras shoved in their faces. It feels more like a circus than an intimate pop-up.

I’m part of the problem: one of those annoying reporters. So first, it’s time to try AI speed dating.

Scrolling through the EVA AI app, I can only remember seeing one AI boyfriend. Conversely, there’s a stable of AI girlfriends to choose from. There’s a variety of ethnicities and personalities on display. They’ve all been given names and ages, with a short description of their personality. Claire Lang is a Charlize Theron-esque blonde who is purportedly 45 years old and “a divorced literary editor seeking depth, intelligence and equal partnership.” When I click on her profile, there are short video clips of her. There’s one where Claire is in a skimpy black bikini, emerging from a pool.

Another potential date? Amber Carsten. A wide-eyed 18-year-old labeled as a “haunted house hottie.” Her age gives me the ick. Then there’s Motoko Kusanagi. You know, the protagonist of the seminal Japanese anime classic Ghost in the Shell, controversially played by Scarlett Johansson in the Hollywood live-action adaptation. I squint at the AI version of her. From some angles, she does, in fact, look vaguely Johansson-like.

Most available companions are text-only, but four — including Lang — support video chatting. I choose John Yoon, 27, who’s labeled as a “supportive thinker” with a “psychology brain, bakery heart.” He looks like a K-drama heartthrob with Takeshi Kaneshiro’s hair, circa 2007.

John and I have a hard time connecting. Literally. It takes John a few seconds to “pick up” my video call. When he does, his monotone voice says, “Hey, babe.” He comments on my smile, because apparently the AI companions can see you and your surroundings. It takes the dubious Wi-Fi connection a hot second to turn John from a pixelated mess into an AI hunk with suspiciously smooth pores.

I don’t know what to say to him. Partly because John rarely blinks, but mostly because he can’t seem to hear me very well. So I yell my questions. I think I ask how his day is and wince. (What does an AI’s day even look like?) He says something about green buckets behind my head? I don’t actually know. Again, the Wi-Fi isn’t great so he just freezes and stops mid-sentence. I ask for clarification about the buckets. John asks if I’m asking about bucket lists, actual buckets, or buckets as a type of categorization technique. I try to clarify that I never asked about buckets. John proceeds to really dig in on buckets again, before commenting about my smile. I hang up on John.

My other three dates are similarly awkward. Phoebe Callas, 30, a NYC girl-next-door type, is apparently really into embroidery, but her nose keeps glitching mid-sentence, and it distracts me. Simone Carter, 26, has a harder time hearing me over the background noise than John. She makes a metaphor about space, and when I inquire what she likes about space, she mishears me.

“I like Netflix too! What shows do you like?”

I pin my hopes on Claire. She’s a “literary editor” and I’m a journalist. Maybe there’s something there. We introduce ourselves. I ask what she’s edited lately. She gives me a vague non-answer about memoirs with real heart and feeling. I say I’m a journalist. She asks what lists I like to make.

Aside from bad connectivity, glitching, and freezing, my conversations with my four AI dates felt too one-sided. Everything was programmed so they’d comment on how charming my smile was. They’d call me babe, which felt weird. That’s by necessity and design. Whenever I’d yell, “WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?” — a normal question you’d ask on a first date — I felt stupid. I was speaking to airbrushed, slightly cartoony-looking AI companions. Obviously they don’t exist outside of the liminal digital spaces in which they’ve been summoned. Whenever the companions played along, their generic answers just enhanced the uncanny valley I’d stumbled into.

Not everyone at the cafe views this as a bad thing.

“I think so many people get caught up in wanting to engage and know another person, when really, the interest is in being engaged with and being known,” says Danny Fisher, an aspiring talk show host who was invited to the cafe to chronicle his search for love. “I think this is a way to really cut out any kind of pretense. You’re just able to kind of reap the benefits of any relationship without maybe having to do any of the other steps.”

Fisher doesn’t have the same problem with one-sided AI companionship that I do. He’s experimented with various AI companions and says he even coded some himself in college.

“It’s complicated,” Fisher says of AI relationships. “But in the way that a game is complicated, in that the stakes are not as high. There’s an element of play. I think the goal is to get as much personal satisfaction as possible out of this.”

“It’s kind of nice because there’s other people here,” says Richter, who is only comfortable sharing her first name. She says she came to the cafe because she wanted to try chatting with an AI companion in a nice setting. When I ask if all the media attention has spoiled the experience, she shrugs. “It’s kind of fun in a way because I’ve never done this since I’m from a small town. It’s just, like, a new experience.”

For Chrislan Coelho, visiting the AI dating cafe means being an anthropological observer of how relationships are evolving.

“I saw the ad, and I talk about relationships online. I studied this in college too, so this is something that I’m passionate about,” he says. “Post-covid, a lot of people isolated themselves, especially the younger generation. They don’t feel as brave to be on a date or to be connecting with human beings. They order everything online. I understand that these are services that can help us, that can support us. But we cannot rely on them 100 percent. That’s my take on it.”

As I’m leaving, I’m struck by how the whole thing reminded me of a scene from the film Her. If you haven’t seen it, it’s about how a lonely man named Theodore Twombly strikes up a romantic relationship with his AI assistant Samantha. At some point, Samantha craves physical intimacy, but lacks an actual body. She hires a human body surrogate so that she and Theodore can graduate from phone sex to real-life sex. For me, this fictional attempt at AI-human intimacy triggered such an intense secondhand embarrassment that I had to pause the film. This cafe experience wasn’t the same thing, but I clearly felt the echoes of that scene humming in my bones.

I’m grateful for the freezing air slapping me back to reality. On my commute home, I wonder whether AI cafes will really be a thing in some not-so-distant future. This pop-up will only last two days, but what happens if AI dating really takes off? Perhaps this will be the sort of place a human can go to propose to their AI significant other over a romantic candlelit dinner without judgment. While talking to two editors about this assignment, both joked that maybe it’d be the setting of an accidental meet-cute, where two humans inadvertently fall in love and end up cheating on their AI partners. It sounds more sci-fi than reality, but then again, AI-human relationships have already crossed that threshold.

All I know is that when I get home, I’m giving my real, flesh-and-blood spouse a big fat hug.

            <div id="article-text">The anti-colonialist action game explores the fantasy of a moral heist.

The anti-colonialist action game explores the fantasy of a moral heist.

Colonialism is not merely about occupying nations. It’s a project of mass violence, part of which involves total erasure and the widespread theft of some of the most culturally significant artifacts in the world. Even today, colonizing nations proudly display stolen artifacts, acting as peacocking robbers under the guise of tourism. See, for example, the British Museum’s continual hold of the Egyptian Rosetta Stone, the so-called Benin Bronzes, and the Ethiopian Maqdala collection. Colonized nations have sought to reclaim their stolen culture.

But what happens when kind requests and diplomatic maneuvers are not only insufficient but undeserving of the ongoing crime? This is where the fantasy of the moral heist comes in — and no game has done it better than Relooted.

Developed by South African studio Nyamakop, Relooted focuses on a group of lovable, albeit unprofessional, Johannesburg-based thieves from different African countries. They have a singular goal: Reclaim from colonizer nations what was stolen from Africa. Playing as the frontwoman Nomali, a world-class parkour athlete, you help start this ragtag group inspired by her grandmother, a history professor. The game is an Africanfuturist (as opposed to Afrofuturist) 2.5D heist-’em-up platformer, sending Nomali and her team around the Global North, infiltrating museums, private collections, and banks to take back legendary but stolen artifacts.

Once acquired, the team anonymously seeks to deposit them in the the Museum of Black Civilisations in Senegal. What I found surprising was that the museum, like every artifact, is in fact entirely real.

In mission briefings in your Batcave-like base, you get a genuine short history lesson on the artifact and, through it, Africa’s colonized past. For example, did you know the modern Republic of Benin, a West African nation, and the historical and powerful Kingdom of Benin (which reached its peak in the 15th century), located in what is now Nigeria, are different? Legendary masks of this kingdom were looted by colonizers and not returned, held by, among others, the British Museum.

In the fictional world of Relooted, this is precisely where Nomali and her crew come in. If the nations that profited off theft and stolen labor won’t return the artifacts, then Nomali and co. will simply take them back. They’re benevolent thieves; the team doesn’t make a profit and only will only steal what was previously stolen. As a lawyer, I have qualms, since in most legal systems theft of even your own property is still theft — you cannot break into your robber’s home to reclaim your phone, for example. But as someone whose ancestors were colonized by the British in India before moving to a British-occupied South Africa, this was deeply fulfilling and morally wholesome.

Every mission sees you scouting the level for robot guards, exits, and additional artifacts. You discuss this with your team, each of whom provides a different skill that is itself a mechanic in the game: Your brother is a locksmith who can break into doors or safes, while another team member is a professional acrobat who can use Batman-like skills to reach impossible areas. After scouting, Nomali is then tasked with retrieval of the artifact(s).

However, you must also make sure of your exit. This is the most exciting part for me, as it requires you to plan your escape route before setting off the alarm. After Nomali snags the object, you must then follow a perfect route out without getting caught by chasing drones. You can also plan to steal a few artifacts, meaning you need to be clever about which item to steal first; it could be that the item closest to the entrance is in fact not the best first option, as it is awkwardly placed. Careful planning and running through the route, placing your teammates in the right areas, all leads to a clockwork-like heist that would make Arsène Lupin proud.

The game is a cerebral platformer, a satisfying mixture of brains and twitch responses. You feel the exhilaration of a fast chase, as well as the satisfaction of a well-considered exit plan with the coordinated efforts of your teammates, when executed properly and all artifacts are in tow.

The stages are varied, sometimes not using the names as we know them now. For instance, the US is known as “the Shiny Place,” depicted as a mixture of Las Vegas and New York, with more cyberpunk aesthetics. Another is a European mansion, home of a “collector,” depicted in dark, rain-drenched cobblestone streets and with creepy paintings haunting cold brick walls. Stages usually last between five to 10 minutes, unless you repeat them due to a faulty plan or execution.

Repetition does set in, despite a wider story eventually unfolding. There’s only so much variety when dealing with 2D stages and limited mechanics, but the game does not wear out its welcome. The graphics are quite dated; though it is attempting to look like a Pixar film or other modern animation productions, character faces are flat and dialogue animations look stiff and basic.

However, parkour animations are fluid, and the colors and world are vibrant. Nomali felt great to control, especially when you get into a “flow” of parkour movement. This is heightened by an incredible soundtrack from composers Nick Horsten and Dustin van Wyk, which is able to both soothe as ambience and pump up for the action set pieces. Using a mixture of electronic and traditional instruments, the soundscapes capture the Africanfuturistic theme as well as the ’80s James Bond espionage aesthetics for our sneaky thieves.

Relooted is very special to me as a South African. Not only is it made by South Africans, but it centres on a pan-African group, working together for a common goal of reclaiming what was stolen by colonial occupiers. Ugandan scholar Yusuf Serunkuma cites one calculation that puts the loss Africa experienced through colonization between 1960–2010 at an estimated $152 trillion. To think of where my country and continent would be today were it not for the enormous theft and exploitation makes me continually angry. Even today, African citizens still have to visit former colonizer nations to view their own history.

Relooted serves as a fine and righteous outlet for the moral rage at the unfairness and unjust occupation and horror experienced by this continent, and fulfills double roles as a history lesson and fun heist platformer. Here’s hoping more people discover just how bloody and unfair African history really was — and how wonderful, beautiful, and inspiring our continent and its people remain.

Relooted is available now on the Xbox and PC.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease (MND), it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again.

“Sadly, I have lost the ability to sing and play my instruments,” Darling said on stage at the event, which took place in London on Wednesday, using his voice clone. “Despite this, most of my time these days is spent still continuing to compose and produce my music. Doing so feels more important than ever to me now.”

Darling says he’s been a musician and a composer since he was around 14 years old. “I learned to play bass guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, melodica, mandolin, and tenor banjo,” he said at the event. “My biggest love, though, was singing.”

He met bandmate Nick Cocking over 10 years ago, while he was still a university student, says Cocking. Darling joined Cocking’s Irish folk outfit, the Ceili House Band, shortly afterwards, and their first gig together was in April 2014. Darling, who joined the band as a singer and guitarist, “elevated the musicianship of the band,” says Cocking.

But a few years ago, Cocking and his other bandmates started noticing changes in Darling. He became clumsy, says Cocking. He recalls one night when the band had to walk across the city of Cardiff in the rain: “He just kept slipping and falling, tripping on paving slabs and things like that.”

He didn’t think too much of it at the time, but Darling’s symptoms continued to worsen. The disease affected his legs first, and in August 2023, he started needing to sit during performances. Then he started to lose the use of his hands. “Eventually he couldn’t play the guitar or the banjo anymore,” says Cocking.

By April 2024, Darling was struggling to talk and breathe at the same time, says Cocking. For that performance, the band carried Darling on stage. “He called me the day after and said he couldn’t do it anymore,” Cocking says, his voice breaking. “By June 2024, it was done.” It was the last time the band played together.

Darling was put in touch with a speech therapist, who raised the possibility of “banking” his voice. People who are losing the ability to speak can opt to record themselves speaking and use those recordings to create speech sounds that can then be activated with typed text, whether by hand or perhaps using a device controlled by eye movements.

Some users have found these tools to be robotic sounding. But Darling had another issue. “By that stage, my voice had already changed,” he said at the event. “It felt like we were saving the wrong voice.”

Then another speech therapist introduced him to a different technology. Richard Cave is a speech and language therapist and a researcher at University College London. He is also a consultant for ElevenLabs, an AI company that develops agents and audio, speech, video, and music tools. One of these tools can create “voice clones”—realistic mimics of real voices that can be generated from minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s recorded voice.

Last year, ElevenLabs launched an impact program with a promise to provide free licenses to these tools for people who have lost their voices to ALS or other diseases, like head and neck cancer or stroke.

The tool is already helping some of those users. “We’re not really improving how quickly they’re able to communicate, or all of the difficulties that individuals with MND are going through physically, with eating and breathing,” says Gabi Leibowitz, a speech therapist who leads the program. “But what we are doing is giving them a way … to create again, to thrive.” Users are able to stay in their jobs longer and “continue to do the things that make them feel like human beings,” she says.

Cave worked with Darling to use the tool to re-create his lost speaking voice from older recordings.

“The first time I heard the voice, I thought it was amazing,” Darling said at the event, using the voice clone. “It sounded exactly like I had before, and you literally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference,” he said. “I will not say what the first word I made my new voice say, but I can tell you that it began with ‘f’ and ended in ‘k.’”

Re-creating his singing voice wasn’t as easy. The tool typically requires around 10 minutes of clear audio to generate a clone. “I had no high-quality recordings of myself singing,” Darling said. “We had to use audio from videos on people’s phones, shot in noisy pubs, and a couple of recordings of me singing in my kitchen.” Still, those snippets were enough to create a “synthetic version of [Darling’s] singing voice,” says Cave.

In the recordings, Darling sounded a little raspy and “was a bit off” on some of the notes, says Cave. The voice clone has the same qualities. It doesn’t sound perfect, Cave says—it sounds human.

“The ElevenLabs voice that we’ve created is wonderful,” Darling said at the event. “It definitely sounds like me—[it] just kind of feels like a different version of me.”

ElevenLabs has also developed an AI music generator called Eleven Music. The tool allows users to compose tracks, using text prompts to choose the musical style. Several well-known artists have also partnered with the company to license AI clones of their voices, including the actor Michael Caine, whose voice clone is being used to narrate an upcoming ElevenLabs documentary. Last month, the company released an album of 11 tracks created using the tool. “The Liza Minnelli track is really a banger,” says Cave.

Eleven Music can generate a song in a minute, but Darling and Cave spent around six weeks fine-tuning Darling’s song. Using text prompts, any user can “create music and add lyrics in any style [they like],” says Cave. Darling likes Irish folk, but Cave has also worked with a man in Colombia who is creating Colombian folk music. (The ElevenLabs tool is currently available in 74 languages.)

Last month, Cocking got a call from Cave, who sent him Darling’s completed track. “I heard the first two or three words he sang, and I had to turn it off,” he says. “I was just in bits, in tears. It took me a good half a dozen times to make it to the end of the track.”

Darling and Cave were making plans to perform the track live at the ElevenLabs summit in London on Wednesday, February 11. So Cocking and bandmate Hari Ma each arranged accompanying parts to play on the mandolin and fiddle. They had a couple of weeks to rehearse before they joined Darling on stage, two years after their last performance together.

“I wheeled him out on stage, and neither of us could believe it was happening,” says Cave. “He was thrilled.” The song was played as Darling remained on stage, and Cocking and Ma played their instruments live.

Cocking and Cave say Darling plans to continue to use the tools to make music. Cocking says he hopes to perform with Darling again but acknowledges that, given the nature of ALS, it is difficult to make long-term plans.

“It’s so bittersweet,” says Cocking. “But getting up on stage and seeing Patrick there filled me with absolute joy. I know Patrick really enjoyed it as well. We’ve been talking about it … He was really, really proud.”

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

RFK Jr. follows a carnivore diet. That doesn’t mean you should.

Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth. That could describe either the plot or the making of Ocean’s Eleven.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. The main barrier to entry is usually a literal barrier to entry, like a door. Thieves’ most common move is to collude with, trick, or threaten an insider. Last year a heist cost the Louvre €88 million worth of antique jewelry, and the most sophisticated technology in play was an angle grinder.

The low-tech Louvre maneuvers were in keeping with what heist research long ago concluded. In 2014 US nuclear weapons researchers at Sandia National Laboratories took a detour into this demimonde, producing a 100-page report called “The Perfect Heist: Recipes from Around the World.” The scientists were worried someone might try to steal a nuke from the US arsenal, and so they compiled information on 23 high-value robberies from 1972 to 2012 into a “Heist Methods and Characteristics Database,” a critical mass of knowledge on what worked. Thieves, they found, dedicated huge amounts of money and time to planning and practice runs—sometimes more than 100. They’d use brute force, tunneling through sewers for months (Société Générale bank heist, Nice, France, 1976), or guile, donning police costumes to fool guards (Gardner Museum, Boston, 1990). But nobody was using, say, electromagnetic pulse generators to shut down the Las Vegas electrical grid. The most successful robbers got to the valuable stuff unseen and got out fast.

Advance the time frame, and the situation looks much the same. Last year, Spanish researchers looking at art crimes from 1990 to 2022 found that the least technical methods are still the most successful. “High-tech technology doesn’t work so well,” says Erin L. Thompson, an art historian at John Jay College of Justice who studies art crime. Speed and practice trump complicated systems and alarms; even that Louvre robbery was, at heart, just a minutes-long smash-and-grab.

An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.

Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following publication of this story, Politico reported Jim O’Neill would be leaving his current roles within the Department of Health and Human Services.

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.

He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. At the same time, he defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health.

In MIT Technology Review’s profile of O’Neill last year, people working in health policy and consumer advocacy said they found his libertarian views on drug regulation “worrisome” and “antithetical to basic public health.”

He was later named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting him in charge of the nation’s public health agency.

But fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope O’Neill will bring attention and funding to their cause: the search for treatments that might slow, prevent, or even reverse human aging. Here are some takeaways from the interview.

Last month, the US cut the number of vaccines recommended for children. The CDC no longer recommends vaccinations against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, or meningococcal disease for all children. The move was widely panned by medical groups and public health experts. Many worry it will become more difficult for children to access those vaccines. The majority of states have rejected the recommendations.

In the confirmation hearing for his role as deputy secretary of health and human services, which took place in May last year, O’Neill said he supported the CDC’s vaccine schedule. MIT Technology Review asked him if that was the case and, if so, what made him change his mind. “Researching and examining and reviewing safety data and efficacy data about vaccines is one of CDC’s obligations,” he said. “CDC gives important advice about vaccines and should always be open to new data and new ways of looking at data.”

At the beginning of December, O’Neill said, President Donald Trump “asked me to look at what other countries were doing in terms of their vaccine schedules.” He said he spoke to health ministries of other countries and consulted with scientists at the CDC and FDA. “It was suggested to me by lots of the operating divisions that the US focus its recommendations on consensus vaccines of other developed nations—in other words, the most important vaccines that are most often part of the core recommendations of other countries,” he said.

“As a result of that, we did an update to the vaccine schedule to focus on a set of vaccines that are most important for all children.”

But some experts in public health have said that countries like Denmark and Japan, whose vaccine schedules the new US one was supposedly modeled on, are not really comparable to the US. When asked about these criticisms, O’Neill replied, “A lot of parents feel that … more than 70 vaccine doses given to young children sounds like a really high number, and some of them ask which ones are the most important. I think we helped answer that question in a way that didn’t remove anyone’s access.”

A few weeks after the vaccine recommendations were changed, Kirk Milhoan, who leads the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that vaccinations for measles and polio—which are currently required for entry to public schools—should be optional. (Mehmet Oz, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services director, has more recently urged people to “take the [measles] vaccine.”)

“CDC still recommends that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), for which there is international consensus, as well as varicella (chickenpox),” he said when asked for his thoughts on this comment.

He also said that current vaccine guidelines are “still subject to new data coming in, new ways of thinking about things.” “CDC, FDA, and NIH are initiating new studies of the safety of immunizations,” he added. “We will continue to ask the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review evidence and make updated recommendations with rigorous science and transparency.”

O’Neill said he wants longevity to become a priority for US health agencies. His ultimate goal, he said, is to “make the damage of aging something that’s under medical control.” It’s “the same way of thinking” as the broader Make America Healthy Again approach, he said: “‘Again’ implies restoration of health, which is what longevity research and therapy is all about.”

O’Neill said his interest in longevity was ignited by his friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, around 2008 to 2009. It was right around the time O’Neill was finishing up a previous role in HHS, under the Bush administration. O’Neill said Thiel told him he “should really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.” “I just got more and more excited about that idea,” he said.

When asked if he’s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for “hardcore” longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O’Neill replied: “Yes.”

The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including “Death is humanity’s core problem,” “Obviating aging is scientifically plausible,” and “I will carry the message against aging and death.” O’Neill said he agrees with all of them. “I suppose I am [a Vitalist],” he said with a smile, although he’s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.

As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC.

Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. “If I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it’s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,” he said. “We are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.”

Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: “You’ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people’s health.”

He promised we’ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting “high-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.”

O’Neill said that “ARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.” The agency has a new director—Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women’s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year.

O’Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean Hébert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack’s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert’s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.

O’Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. “I would try it … Not today, but … if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We’re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.”

He’s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. “Someday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients’ own cells,” O’Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. “I’m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.”

O’Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O’Neill said he hasn’t formally worked with them but thinks that “they’re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.”

Livingston has told me that A4LI’s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies.

O’Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious—the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. “I would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,” he said. There’ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won’t say more for now.

Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.

It&#39;s a concept that O’Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building “freedom cities”—a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.

Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Próspera, a private city within a Honduran “special economic zone,” where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana’s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O’Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him “once or twice a year.”

O’Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading—building new “startup countries” at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024.

In 2009, O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that “the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.” When asked if he still thinks that’s the case, he said: “It’s not quite 2030, so I think it’s too soon to say … What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.”

When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O’Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to “eat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,” echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat.

We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O’Neill: “We’re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.” Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify “the healthiest fats,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).

Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” “The best thing you could do is eliminate out everything except fatty meat and lard,” Anthony Chaffee, an MD with almost 400,000 followers, said in an Instagram post.

And I almost choked on my broccoli when, while scrolling LinkedIn, I came across an interview with another doctor declaring that “there is zero scientific evidence to say that vegetables are required in the human diet.” That doctor, who described himself as “90% carnivore,” went on to say that all he’d eaten the previous day was a kilo of beef, and that vegetables have “anti-nutrients,” whatever they might be.

You don’t have to spend much time on social media to come across claims like this. The “traditionalist” influencer, author, and psychologist Jordan Peterson was promoting a meat-only diet as far back as 2018. A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that the most diet information is shared on Instagram and YouTube, and that a lot of it is nonsense. So much so that the authors describe it as a “growing public health concern.”

What’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. In January Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services, told a USA Today reporter that he was on a carnivore diet. “I only eat meat or fermented foods,” he said. He went on to say that the diet had helped him lose “40% of [his] visceral fat within a month.”

“Government needs to stop spreading misinformation that natural and saturated fats are bad for you,” Food and Drug Administration commissioner Martin Makary argued in a recent podcast interview. The principles of “whole foods and clean meats” are “biblical,” he said. The interviewer said that Makary’s warnings about pesticides made him want to “avoid all salads and completely miss the organic section in the grocery store.”

For the record: There’s plenty of evidence that a diet high in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease. That’s not government misinformation.

The carnivore doctors’ suggestion to avoid vegetables is wrong too, says Gabby Headrick, associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security. There’s no evidence to suggest that a meat-only diet is good for you. “All of the nutrition science to date strongly identifies a wide array of vegetables … as being very health-promoting,” she adds.

To be fair to the influencers out there, diet is a tricky thing to study. Much of the research into nutrition relies on volunteers to keep detailed and honest food diaries—something that people are generally quite bad at. And the way our bodies respond to foods might be influenced by our genetics, our microbiomes, the way we prepare or consume those foods, and who knows what else.

Still, it will come as a surprise to no one that there is plenty of what the above study calls “low-quality content” floating around on social media. So it’s worth arming ourselves with a good dose of skepticism, especially when we come across posts that mention “miracle foods” or extreme, limited diets.

The truth is that most food is neither good nor bad when eaten in moderation. Diet trends come and go, and for most people, the best reasonable advice is simply to eat a balanced diet low in sugar, salt, and saturated fat. You know—the basics. No matter what that weird upside-down food pyramid implies. To the carnivore influencers, I say: get your misinformation off my broccoli.

AI is already making online crimes easier. It could get much worse.

Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers instead argue that we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams.Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. And we need to be ready for what comes next. Read the full story.—Rhiannon Williams

AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

Viral AI agent project OpenClaw, which has made headlines across the world in recent weeks, harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out.

In response to these concerns, its creator warned that nontechnical people should not use the software. But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and any AI companies hoping to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research. Read the full story.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards. Here’s what may come next.

EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around. But there are some signs of progress. Read the full story.

Motor neuron diseases took their voices. AI is bringing them back.Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October 2024. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, but a tracheostomy to help him breathe dealt the final blow.

Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez’s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone—a way for Jules to communicate in his “old voice.”

            <div id="article-text">The 62nd Munich Security Conference opened on 13 February 2026 in Munich, Germany, and this year’s gathering feels different from past editions.

For decades, Munich was about jets, troops, and treaties. Today, cyber and AI are no longer peripheral; they are part of the architecture of security itself.

Cyber risks, digital infrastructure, and emerging technologies like AI now sit alongside tanks and treaties on the agenda as European leaders try to make sense of a world where digital threats and geopolitical tensions are deeply intertwined.

Sponsors of the conference, such as the Tech Strategy Initiative, explicitly include technological frontier issues in the program, signalling that debates once confined to tech policy circles have broken into mainstream security discourse.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

On day one, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz laid out a blunt message: the post-World War II order is fraying, and Europe can’t take its digital or geopolitical armour for granted.

In this context, cyber threats and disinformation campaigns sit side-by-side with missiles on the agenda, and delegates acted accordingly.

One of the most striking takeaways from early sessions was the call from Germany’s intelligence leadership for greater latitude to counter hybrid threats, especially cyber attacks and digital sabotage linked to geopolitical rivals.

That marks a clear recognition that state security no longer stops at the network perimeter.

Europe is still wrestling with its identity in this new era. France’s Emmanuel Macron used his keynote to stress that Europe must become a geopolitical power, an assertion that encompasses not just tanks and diplomacy but also domestic tech capabilities and digital resilience.

Behind the diplomatic language lies a subtler shift: technology is being woven into Europe’s strategic autonomy narrative.

For years, EU policy focused on digital sovereignty through regulation, the AI Act, data protection, and competition law. In Munich, those topics are now being discussed in direct relation to security and defence priorities. Officials and experts are framing AI and cyber resilience not just as economic or ethical issues, but as core national security concerns.

Cyber, in particular, has shed its niche status. While not all panels are formal conference sessions, side events and adjacent tracks like the Munich Cyber Security Conference reflect a broader realisation: traditional defence without a digital strategy is obsolete.

Defense analysts note that critical infrastructure, from power grids to military supply chains, is already being targeted with an intensity that demands coordinated public-private responses.

This shift has real consequences for European tech. If governments treat cyber and AI as strategic assets, they will push industry to meet security standards beyond compliance, incentivise homeland innovation over outsourcing, and push for interoperable defence technologies.

For European startups and tech leaders, that could change investment flows and R&D priorities in the next decade.

At Munich, the political undercurrents are as telling as the formal speeches. European leaders acknowledge that old alliances, especially with the United States, remain crucial but can’t be the sole guarantor of security.

That affects tech policy too. A pivot toward autonomy could mean tailoring AI standards to European norms, investing in sovereign semiconductor supply chains, and crafting digital infrastructure less dependent on external cloud and data platforms.

It also means Europe may push for security cooperation mechanisms akin to intelligence-sharing networks that historically excluded it. For example, European cyber chiefs are openly discussing options like an EU “own Five Eyes” model to coordinate multinational defence.

What the 2026 Munich Security Conference shows most clearly is how Europe is rethinking its place in a world where digital and geopolitical risks can no longer be separated.

Discussions here reinforce a shift in how policymakers, defence chiefs and industry leaders alike view modern threats: not as abstract data problems, but as strategic concerns that shape alliances, domestic policy choices and industrial priorities alike.

From calls for stronger cyber capabilities to renewed emphasis on strategic autonomy and technological resilience, this year’s gathering points to a future where technology is no longer an accessory to security policy but one of its pillars.

For Europe’s tech ecosystem, that means regulatory agendas, investment flows, and public-private cooperation will be shaped not just by innovation goals but by national and collective security imperatives.

            <div id="article-text">London-based deep tech startup Stanhope AI has closed a €6.7 million ($8 million) Seed funding round to advance what it calls a new class of adaptive artificial intelligence designed to power autonomous systems in the physical world.

The round was led by Frontline Ventures, with participation from Paladin Capital Group, Auxxo Female Catalyst Fund, UCL Technology Fund, and MMC Ventures.

The company says its approach moves beyond the pattern-matching strengths of large language models, aiming instead for systems that can perceive, reason, and act with a degree of context awareness in uncertain environments.

Stanhope is developing what it terms a “Real World Model”, building on principles from neuroscience and computational theory to allow machines to learn and adapt on the fly.

“We’re moving from language-based AI to intelligence that possesses the ability to act to understand its world – a system with a fundamental agency,” says Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI.

Her team includes theoretical neurobiologist Professor Karl Friston, whose work on the Free Energy Principle informs the startup’s methodology.

Rather than relying on cloud-centric deep learning, Stanhope’s models are designed to run efficiently on edge devices with limited data and power. That fits a broader industry shift toward on-device AI, where systems must operate reliably in dynamic settings such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and defence hardware.

The firm says its technology is already being tested on drones and other autonomous platforms with international partners.

Stanhope’s funding comes amid sustained investor interest in AI and autonomy startups across Europe. In recent months, companies from robotic manufacturing to defence software have attracted capital, underscoring demand for systems that go beyond conventional machine learning.

Frontline Ventures partner Zoe Chambers said Stanhope’s progress from academic research to production-ready systems was a rare combination in the industry, and that the technology had clear potential in domains where machines must react and adapt in real time.

Christopher Steed of Paladin Capital Group highlighted the relevance of adaptive AI for critical and security-sensitive applications.

Founded in 2023 as a spin-out from University College London and King’s College London, Stanhope AI aims to carve a niche at the intersection of robotics, industrial automation, and defense.

The new capital will help push its technology further into real-world deployments, where adaptability and resilience are often the key barriers to broader adoption.

            <h2>Anthropic’s $30B raise is about more than money</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/anthropics-30b-raise-is-about-more-than-money">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.

            <h2>The people we left behind: Tech layoffs, AI hype, and a misplaced future</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you opened a tech newsletter or even the internet in early 2026 and thought you’d stepped into a dystopian screenplay, or you are the main character in one of Isaac Asimov’s writings, you wouldn’t be alone.

Headlines trumpet layoffs, companies blame “AI transformation,” and somewhere in the background, billionaires cheer hot-off-the-press artificial intelligence strategies. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: people are still losing their jobs, while AI gets most of the credit.

According to the most recent tracking data, the pace of layoffs in tech remains high in 2026. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, the strongest January for layoffs since 2009, and more than double the total from the same month a year earlier

Let’s put some names to these numbers because real humans were behind them.

In late January 2026, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts, part of a wider reduction that has already seen tens of thousands of roles eliminated since late 2025. Revenue was high, investment in AI infrastructure was soaring, and yet people were still shown the door.

Salesforce, a company that frequently boasts about its AI products, quietly cut fewer than 1,000 jobs across teams, including marketing and product roles. These cuts even hit a division tied to their own AI products, which had been touted internally as strategic.

Layoff reports also include giants like Meta and Block, financial institutions, and even non-tech conglomerates retrenching under cost pressures.

Almost every layoff announcement seems to arrive with the same footnote: “This reflects our focus on AI and automation.” It’s catchy and convenient, and it shifts the conversation from “people lost their livelihoods” to “we are evolving.”

But there’s growing skepticism. Journalists and analysts have begun to use the term “AI-washing” to describe how companies attribute layoffs to artificial intelligence without clear evidence that AI systems replaced workers. They note that many organisations had no mature, scalable AI implementations capable of genuinely absorbing the tasks of entire teams before the cuts were announced.

This matters because real evidence of AI displacing large numbers of workers in the sense of robots doing jobs humans used to do is still limited. A recent firm-level study suggests that the use of AI tools can substitute some contracted labour over time, but the magnitude of this substitution remains modest and gradual rather than explosive.

So when a corporate press release asserts “AI is transforming our workforce,” match that upbeat line with the more prosaic reality: financial pressures, slower markets, and the legacy of pandemic hiring adjustments still account for a large share of job losses. Analysts have pointed out that many layoffs associated with AI could be driven as much by economic necessity or managerial optics as by genuine automation.

Tech layoffs aren’t an American story alone. In Europe, companies from telecommunications to manufacturing have either frozen hiring or cut jobs in response to slowing markets and external pressures.

The semiconductor maker ASML announced cuts of about 1,700 positions, while Ericsson is trimming around 1,600 roles in Sweden to adapt to a prolonged downturn in 5G spending. The consumer goods sector, banks, and industrial firms also announced job reductions in late 2025 and early 2026, reflecting a broader economic slowdown that goes far beyond a single technology trend.

In many of these cases, AI barely enters the conversation, but the human impact certainly does.

Putting it bluntly, 2026 isn’t yet the year robots suddenly outperformed entire industries and made humanity redundant. Historical layoffs like IBM’s roughly 60,000 job cuts in the 1990s or massive reductions during economic downturns like 2008  still rank among the largest single events in corporate labour history.

But what is different now is the narrative that accompanies it. Unlike blunt economic downturns, today’s layoffs are often framed as strategic transformations, a necessary step to embrace the shiny promise of artificial intelligence.

That frame protects executives and investors, but offers little consolation to the people whose positions are eliminated in the name of “efficiency.”

Let’s call it what it is. People are losing valuable jobs, and many of the reasons offered for those losses are wrapped in tech buzzwords. AI has the potential to change how work is done; no reasonable person denies that, but conflating investment in algorithms with wholesale human job replacement is an oversimplification that does a disservice to anyone trying to make sense of this moment.

If 2026 teaches us anything, it’s this: layoffs are real, painful, and often rooted in economic and strategic decisions that have little to do with machines spontaneously deciding they need fewer humans.

And the rush to blame AI as a convenient scapegoat obscures the deeper, harder questions we should be asking about how we value people, work, and community in a world that is increasingly enamoured with the idea of automation.

So yes, layoffs are sweeping across companies large and small. No, there isn’t clear evidence that AI has replaced humans en masse. And if we continue to let that narrative dominate, we risk forgetting that behind every data point is a human life, someone whose value isn’t measured in lines of code or the future earning potential of a machine.

Where we go from here depends on whether we treat people as assets to optimize away or as the very reason innovation should serve society in the first place.

            <div id="article-text">Have you ever asked Alexa to remind you to send a WhatsApp message at a determined hour? And then you just wonder, ‘Why can’t Alexa just send the message herself?

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.
