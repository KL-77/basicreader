            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/original-nintendo-switch-passes-the-ds-to-become-nintendos-bestselling-console/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Although it was finally replaced last year by the new Switch 2, the orginal switch isn’t done just yet. Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for Animal Crossing) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can’t pay $450 for a Switch 2.

The 9-year-old Switch’s continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company’s third-quarter financial results (PDF). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch “has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware” with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS’s lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo’s fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo introduced in August of 2025, citing “market conditions.”

That makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became the third-bestselling game console of all time. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony’s PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold “over 160 million units” over its long life. At its current sales rate (Nintendo predicts it will sell roughly 750,000 Switches in the next quarter), it would take the Switch another couple of years to cross that line, but those numbers are likely to taper off as we get deeper into the Switch 2 era.

As for the Switch 2, it’s off to a strong start. It had sold 15 million units by the end of December, making it the “fastest-selling dedicated video game platform released by Nintendo to date,” and it had sold a total of 17.37 million units by the end of the quarter. That’s impressive for a console that hasn’t even been out for a year yet, and it already puts the Switch 2 ahead of the Wii U’s lifetime sales (13.56 million) and not far off from the GameCube’s (21.74 million units).

The huge Switch install base means that the older console is still driving most of Nintendo’s software sales. Nintendo says it sold 47.37 million Switch games in the third quarter of its fiscal 2026, compared to 17.31 million Switch 2 games. Nintendo’s bestselling game for the year so far is Mario Kart World with 14.03 million units—doubtlessly helped along by its status as a pack-in game for many Switch 2 consoles—but Pokémon Legends Z-A (12.3 million units across Switch and Switch 2 editions) and Donkey Kong Bananza (4.25 million units) also got shoutouts.

Nintendo also recorded 129 million “annual playing users” across its consoles for 2025, a number that has been essentially flat for the last three years (Nintendo recorded 128 million active users in 2023 and 130 million in 2024).</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Chromebooks debuted 16 years ago with the limited release of Google’s Cr-48, an unassuming compact laptop that was provided free to select users. From there, Chromebooks became one of the most popular budget computing options and a common fixture in schools and businesses. According to some newly uncovered court documents, Google’s shift to Android PCs means Chromebooks have an expiration date in 2034.

The documents were filed as part of Google’s long-running search antitrust case, which began in 2020 and reached a verdict in 2024. While Google is still seeking to have the guilty verdict overturned, it has escaped most of the remedies that government prosecutors requested. According to The Verge, the company’s plans for Chromebooks and the upcoming Android-based Aluminium came up in filings from the remedy phase of the trial.

As Google moves toward releasing Aluminium, it sought to keep the upcoming machines above the fray and retain the Chrome browser (which it did). In Judge Amit Mehta’s final order, devices running ChromeOS or a ChromeOS successor are excluded. To get there, Google had to provide a little more detail on its plans.

Google’s Android chief, Sameer Samat, previously testified that Google was aiming to launch its first Aluminium machines in 2026. However, the new filings expand on that, saying that Google hopes to get Aluminium in the hands of trusted testers by late 2026. A full retail release may not happen until 2028. Google expects Aluminium to supplant ChromeOS in enterprise and education, which puts Chromebooks on the chopping block. Outside of a pandemic-era bump as workers sought cheap at-home machines, Chromebooks have never expanded much beyond those markets.

The documents suggest that Google will wash its hands of ChromeOS once the current support window closes. Google promises 10 years of Chromebook support, but that’s not counted from the date of purchase—Chromebooks are based on a handful of hardware platforms dictated by Google, with the most recent launching in 2023. That means Google has to support the newest devices through 2033. The “timeline to phase out ChromeOS is 2034,” says the filing.

From the start, the ChromeOS experience was focused on the web. Google initially didn’t even support running local apps, but little by little, its aspirations grew. Over the years, it has added Linux apps and Android apps. And it even tried to get Steam games running on Chromebooks—it gave up on that last one just recently. It also tried to shoehorn AI features into ChromeOS with the Chromebook Plus platform, to little effect.

Android was barely getting off the ground when ChromeOS began its journey, but as we approach the 2030s, Google clearly wants a more powerful desktop platform. Android has struggled on larger screens, but Aluminium is a long-running project to fix that. Whatever we see in 2028 may not even look like the Android we know from phones. It will have many of the same components under the hood, though.

Google could get everything it wants with the upcoming Aluminium release. When running on powerful laptop hardware, Android’s performance and capabilities should far outstrip ChromeOS. Aluminium is also expected to run Google apps like Chrome and the Play Store with special system privileges, leaving third-party apps with fewer features. That gives Google more latitude in how it manages the platform and retains users, all without running afoul of recent antitrust rulings.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/02/xcode-26-3-adds-support-for-claude-codex-and-other-agentic-tools-via-mcp/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple has announced a new version of Xcode, the latest version of its integrated development environment (IDE) for building software for its own platforms, like the iPhone and Mac. The key feature of 26.3 is support for full-fledged agentic coding tools, like OpenAI’s Codex or Claude Agent, with a side panel interface for assigning tasks to agents with prompts and tracking their progress and changes.

This is achieved via Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that lets AI agents work with external tools and structured resources. Xcode acts as an MCP endpoint that exposes a bunch of machine-invocable interfaces and gives AI tools like Codex or Claude Agent access to a wide range of IDE primitives like file graph, docs search, project settings, and so on. While AI chat and workflows were supported in Xcode before, this release gives them much deeper access to the features and capabilities of Xcode.

This approach is notable because it means that even though OpenAI and Anthropic’s model integrations are privileged with a dedicated spot in Xcode’s settings, it’s possible to connect other tooling that supports MCP, which also allows doing some of this with models running locally.

Apple began its big AI features push with the release of Xcode 26, expanding on code completion using a local model trained by Apple that was introduced in the previous major release, and fully supporting a chat interface for talking with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. Users who wanted more agent-like behavior and capabilities had to use third-party tools, which sometimes had limitations due to a lack of deep IDE access.

Xcode 26.3’s release candidate (the final beta, essentially) rolls out imminently, with the final release coming a little further down the line.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s Christmas of 1994, and I am 16 years old. Sitting on the table in our family room next to a pile of cow-spotted boxes is the most incredible thing in the world: a brand-new Gateway 66MHz Pentium tower, with a 540MB hard disk drive, 8MB of RAM, and, most importantly, a CD-ROM drive. I am agog, practically trembling with barely suppressed joy, my bored Gen-X teenager mask threatening to slip and let actual feelings out. My life was about to change—at least where games were concerned.

I’d been working for several months at Babbage’s store No. 9, near Baybrook Mall in southeast suburban Houston. Although the Gateway PC’s arrival on Christmas morning was utterly unexpected, the choice of what game to buy required no planning at all. I’d already decided a few weeks earlier, when Chris Roberts’ latest opus had been drop-shipped to our shelves, just in time for the holiday season. The choice made itself, really.

The moment Babbage’s opened its doors on December 26—a day I had off, fortunately—I was there, checkbook in hand. One entire paycheck’s worth of capitalism later, I was sprinting out to my creaky 280-Z, sweatily clutching two boxes—one an impulse buy, The Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive Technical Manual, and the other a game I felt sure would be the best thing I’d ever played or ever would play: Origin’s Wing Commander III: The Heart of the Tiger. On the backs of Wing Commander I and Wing Commander II, how could it not be?!

It’s easy to pooh-pooh full-motion video games here in 2026; from our vantage point, we know the much-anticipated “Siliwood” revolution that was supposed to transform entertainment and usher interactivity into all media by the end of the millennium utterly failed to materialize, leaving in its wake a series of often spectacularly expensive titles filled with grainy interlaced video and ersatz gameplay. Even the standout titles—smash hits like Roberta Williams’ Phantasmagoria or Cyan’s Riven—were, on the whole, kinda mediocre.

But we hadn’t learned any of those lessons yet in 1994, and Wing Commander III went hard. The game’s production was absurdly expensive, with a budget that eventually reached an unheard-of $4 million. The shooting script runs to 324 printed pages (a typical feature film script is less than half that long—Coppola’s working script for The Godfather was 136 pages). Even the game itself was enormous—in an era where a single CD-ROM was already considered ludicrously large, WC3 sprawled ostentatiously across four of the 600MB-or-so discs.

Why so big? Because this was the future, and the future—or so we thought at the time—belonged to full-motion video.

That’s Wing Commander III’s epic opening cinematic, upscaled for YouTube. Even without the upscaling and watching it on a 15-inch CRT, I was entranced. I was blown away. Before the credits were done rolling, I was already on the phone with my buddies Steve and Matt, telling them to stop what they were doing and get over here immediately to see this thing—it’s like a whole movie! A movie, on the computer! Surely only Chris Roberts could conceive and execute such audacity!

And what a movie it was, with an actual-for-real Hollywood cast. Malcolm McDowell! John Rhys-Davies! Jason Bernard! Tom Wilson! Ginger Lynn Allen, whom 16-year-old me definitely did not want his parents to know that I recognized! And, of course, the biggest face on the box: Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill, representing you. You, the decorated hero of the Vega campaign, the formerly disgraced “Coward of K’Tithrak Mang,” the recently redeemed savior of humanity, now sporting an actual name: Colonel Christopher Blair. (“Blair” is an evolution of the internal codename used by Origin to refer to the main character in the previous two Wing Commander titles—”Bluehair.”)

Once the jaw-dropping intro finishes, the player finds Colonel Blair as the newly invested squadron commander aboard the aging carrier TCS Victory, wandering the corridors and having FMV conversations with a few other members of the carrier’s crew. From there, it’s a short hop to the first mission—because beneath all the FMV glitz, Origin still had to provide an actual, you know, game for folks to play.

The game itself is…fine. It’s fine. The polygonal graphics are a welcome step up from the previous two Wing Commander titles’ bitmapped sprites, and the missions themselves manage to avoid many of the “space is gigantic and things take forever to happen” design missteps that plagued LucasArts’ X-Wing (but not, fortunately, TIE Fighter). You fly from point to point and shoot bad guys until they’re dead. Sometimes there are escort missions, sometimes you’re hitting capital ships, and there’s even a (very clunky) planetary bombing mission at the very end that feels like it directly apes the Death Star trench run while doing everything it can to shout “NO THIS IS NOT STAR WARS THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT!”

The space combat is serviceable, but the game also very clearly knows why we’re here: to watch a dead-eyed Mark Hamill with five days of beard stubble fulfill our “I am flying a spaceship” hero fantasies while trading banter with Tom Wilson’s Maniac (“How many people here know about the Maniac? …what, nobody?!”) and receiving fatherly advice from Jason Bernard’s Captain Eisen. And maybe, just maybe, we’d also save the universe and get the girl—either Ginger Lynn’s chief technician Rachel Coriolis or fellow pilot “Flint” Peters, played by Jennifer MacDonald.

(Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the primary purchasing demographic, players tended to overwhelmingly choose Rachel—though this might also have something to do with the fact that if you don’t choose Rachel, you can’t customize your missile loadout for some important missions near the end of the game).

I will let others more qualified than me opine on whether or not Wing Commander III succeeded at the game-y things it set out to do—folks looking to read an educated opinion should consult Jimmy Maher’s thoughts on the matter over at his site, The Digital Antiquarian.

But regardless of whether or not it was a good game in its time, and regardless of whether or not it’s an effective space combat sim, it is absolutely undeniable that it’s a fascinating historical curiosity—one well worth dropping three bucks on at the GOG store (it’s on sale!).

There are cheats built into the game to help you skip past the actual space missions, which range in difficulty from “cream puff” to “obviously untested and totally broken” because just like in 1994, what we’re really here for is the beautiful failed experiment in interactive entertainment that is the movie portion of the game, especially when Malcolm McDowell shows up as Admiral Tolwyn and, in typical Malcom McDowell fashion, totally commits to the role far beyond what would have been required to pull it off and turns in his scenery-chewing best.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid the Trump administration’s attack on universities, Harvard has emerged as a particular target. Early on, the administration put $2.2 billion in research money on hold and shortly thereafter blocked all future funding while demanding intrusive control over Harvard’s hiring and admissions. Unlike many of its peer institutions, Harvard fought back, filing and ultimately winning a lawsuit that restored the cut funds.

Despite Harvard’s victory, the Trump administration continued to push for some sort of formal agreement that would settle the administration’s accusations that Harvard created an environment that allowed antisemitism to flourish. In fact, it had become a running joke among some journalists that The New York Times had devoted a monthly column to reporting that a settlement between the two parties was near.

Given the government’s loss of leverage, it was no surprise that the latest installment of said column included the detail that the latest negotiations had dropped demands that Harvard pay any money as part of a final agreement. The Trump administration had extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from some other universities and had demanded over a billion dollars from UCLA, so this appeared to be a major concession to Harvard.

Given Trump’s tendency to avoid any appearance of concession, his hostile response to the reports was unsurprising. Several hours after the Times published its article, he took to Truth Social to say the government would now seek $1 billion from Harvard. While he separately called the Times’ coverage “completely wrong” and demanded a correction, Trump also favorably quoted the part of the Times article that noted the government had continued to threaten Harvard’s funding despite having lost in court.

All this will likely give Harvard even more ground to argue that the government is being arbitrary and capricious, should the saga ever end up back in court.</div>

            <h2>China bans all retractable car door handles, starting next year</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/china-bans-all-retractable-car-door-handles-starting-next-year/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Flush door handles have been quite the automotive design trend of late. Stylists like them because they don’t add visual noise to the side of a car. And aerodynamicists like them because they make a vehicle more slippery through the air. When Tesla designed its Model S, it needed a car that was both desirable and as efficient as possible, so flush door handles were a no-brainer. Since then, as electric vehicles have proliferated, so too have flush door handles. But as of next year, China says no.

Just like pop-up headlights, despite the aesthetic and aerodynamic advantages, there are safety downsides. Tesla’s handles are an extreme example: In the event of a crash and a loss of 12 V power, there is no way for first responders to open the door from the outside, which has resulted in at least 15 deaths.

Those deaths prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to open an investigation last year, but China is being a little more proactive. It has been looking at whether retractable car door handles are safe since mid-2024, according to Bloomberg, and has concluded that no, they are not.

The new Chinese regulations are incredibly specific. For all new models introduced after January 1, 2027, there must be a recessed space that’s at least 2.4 inches (6 cm) wide, 0.8 inches (2 cm) tall, and 1 inch (25 mm) deep for a hand to operate the handle, which can be semi-flush or simply a traditional door handle that we all know how to use.

The locking mechanism must be designed so that, in a crash that results in airbags deploying or a battery fire, doors on the non-impact side can be opened without tools. Chinese regulators are just as concerned that a vehicle’s occupants don’t get confused about how to open a door from the inside in an emergency. So each door must have mechanical releases where an occupant would expect to find them.

Again, Tesla is probably the worst offender—its front doors have always had mechanical handles, but for some model years, the rears could not be opened without tools.

For cars already approved by the Chinese government (which includes everything currently on sale), there’s a grace period. For existing designs, automakers have until January 1, 2029, to redesign their doors, and due to the specificity of the rules, that group of automakers is much larger than just Tesla. Xiaomi, which seems to be China’s most-hyped EV brand, will have to redesign some models, but BMW will, too—the rather good iX3 that will go on sale there soon will also need a redesign. The same goes for cars from Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng.

And unless there are exemptions for low volume, I would imagine that most supercars from OEMs like Ferrari and McLaren will need new doors for the all-important Chinese market. Indeed, given China’s importance to the car industry, we should expect this ban’s impact to be widely felt on any model sold globally. The benefit should be clear: fewer car occupants dying after being trapped in their cars.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, the United States stock market has been a juggernaut on the international stage. The US dollar has been — and still is — the de facto currency globally.

But for how much longer that will be the case is now looking uncertain. As the New York Times reports, investors are starting to look elsewhere as the Trump administration continues to threaten the independence of its central bank, start a trade war with Europe, and implement self-conflicting monetary policies. As a result of it all, the US dollar continues to weaken, making foreign investments in Europe and Asia far more lucrative.

Meanwhile, Wall Street continues to make enormous bets on artificial intelligence, a highly risky gambit, as tech companies still have plenty to prove and a return still appears to be many years out. The AI boom has sent tech company valuations soaring: the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, NVIDIA, and Tesla) now account for just over a third of the entire S&P 500, with experts warning that the industry could be propping up a rough-looking US economy.

The International Monetary Fund warned that the weakening hype surrounding AI could be among the biggest risks to global economic growth, noting that if expectations about AI turn out to be too optimistic, a market correction could send shockwaves across global markets.

President Donald Trump‘s nomination for the next chair of the central banking system, Kevin Warsh, appeared to do little to stop the continued weakening of the US dollar, which hit a four-year low last week. The Euro and British pound saw their values soar when measured against the US dollar this year.

Trump —also a huge AI booster, underlining the circular nature of the whole situation — celebrated the weakening dollar, arguing it would make products more affordable, in comments that alarmed investors. Officials had to step in to smooth things over, the NYT reported, arguing that despite Trump’s comments, the US government still supports a strong dollar.

Whether Wall Street’s enormous appetite for AI continues to be a weakening economy’s saving grace, for how long remains to be seen. Investors are sending a clear signal: riskier bets are no longer a hot commodity, as demonstrated by the recent plummet in the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Instead, historically safer bets like gold are proving far more lucrative, reaching record highs of $5,500 an ounce in January. Despite a massive drop last week, gold is trading 70 percent higher year over year, indicating investors are seriously on edge.

            <div id="article-text">Like a hurricane that tears down even the sturdiest storm shelters, the Epstein files have cut a path through a vast swath of America’s intellectual, political, and financial elite.

The latest tranche of emails related to the notorious sex predator have been particularly devastating. Fans of the left-libertarian academic Noam Chomsky are in shambles after learning the two were in close contact until around 2017, while tech luminaries from Bill Gates to the Google cofounders were similarly caught schmoozing with the disgraced financier.

Cypto bros are no exception. After the Department of Justice released three million files over the weekend, blockchain enthusiasts were quick to discover a certain Jeffery Epstein was an active and prominent figure in crypto during its formative years.

One file highlighted by crypto investor Patrick Riley shows an email chain between Epstein and Joichi Ito, the former head of MIT’s Media Lab whose Digital Currency Initiative played an integral role in helping crypto grow into the giant it is today. As the email exchange makes clear, Epstein’s backing was a key pillar in establishing the DGI.

“FYI,” Ito told Epstein, “used gift funds to underwrite this which allowed us to move quickly and win this round. Thanks.”

“At the time this letter was written, there were around 12,000 commits to Bitcoin’s code,” Riley remarked in a post on social media. “Today there are 47,583 commits to Bitcoin’s code. That means that 74.79 percent of the Bitcoin core development and code was committed after Jeffery Epstein took over the defacto senior management role as benefactor.”

That news didn’t go over well with crypto enthusiasts, to put it lightly.

“75 percent of bitcoins code comes directly from [Epstein’s] investments,” a crypto account called Crypto Bitlord agonized in response. “We’ve basically funded an elite global pedophile ring since 2015. I feel sick.”

Another crypto account lamented that “BTC has been funding a global elite pedo group since 2015… great.”

The email chain from Ito also suggests that Bitcoin’s mysterious developer — the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — may have in fact been five “core developers,” each of whom was in talks with Epstein.

One of those core devs may have been early Bitcoin contributor Adam Back, who invented the proof-of-work algorithm cited by “Nakamoto’s” original whitepaper on crypto. A separate email chain shows Ito suggesting the convicted sex criminal meet with Back and other tech luminaires to discuss this revolutionary new currency.

“I think we should have a meeting with Jeremy Rubin, Adam Back (or other core developer of bitcoin), Seth [Lloyd], Martin Nowak, you and a few others soon about money and the future of finance,” a 2015 email from Ito reads.

As these files seem to suggest, Back had sought a meeting with Epstein to secure funding for his crypto company, Blockstream. Unsealed records show Back along with Blockstream CEO Austin Hill trying to schedule a trip to meet Epstein in St. Thomas — one of the main US Virgin Islands located a little over six miles away from the infamous islet, Little Saint James.

“Sunday in NY I think is a no-go because of our commitments on the west coast, but Fri/Saturday on the Island are still possible,” Hill told Epstein.

“great. ,” the financier replied in typo-filled prose, “you will need to fly to st thomas. just let me know times. looking foward to it.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was only yesterday that Elon Musk announced that SpaceX had acquired his AI company xAI, a merger that catapulted the rocket maker into being the most valuable private company in the world, but raised significant questions about bringing two firms with vastly different missions under the same wing.

Now, the freshly-joined entity is facing one of its first major tests. On Tuesday, French authorities raided the offices of X, Elon Musk’s social media site owned by xAI, as part of its ongoing criminal investigation into the sexual deepfakes generated by its AI chatbot Grok. Following the acquisition, of course, those X offices are now SpaceX offices.

The raid was carried out by the Paris Public Prosecutor Office’s cybercrime unit, in collaboration with French police and Europol. And it’s perhaps an early warning sign of how all the baggage that SpaceX is inheriting by bringing Musk’s controversial AI efforts into the fold may haunt the company going forward.

In an announcement, the Paris prosecutors said it was investigating criminal offenses related to the distribution of “child pornography images,” the infringement of personal rights through the generation of “sexual deepfakes,” and the denial of “crimes against humanity,” per NBC News.

In addition to searching X’s offices, Musk and X’s former CEO Linda Yaccarino were issued a voluntary summons to appear and answer questions the week of April 20.

SpaceX is not without controversy: its Starship rocket has generated plenty of scrutiny and public backlash from its frequent explosions, which critics argue threaten public safety and flout environmental laws. But by and large, it’s the most beloved Musk venture, as space exploration is something that earns a lot of public goodwill, serving some greater mission for all of humankind. Now, its image is undoubtedly being tainted by its association with xAI and Grok.

Grok in particular is no stranger to making the wrong kinds of headlines. Last month, French prosecutors opened an investigation into Musk’s platform after the AI chatbot was used to generate nonconsensual sexualized images of real people, many of them appearing to be minors, in a weeks-long spree that started at the end of December and stretched into January.

The digital “undressing” trend was so out of control that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated Grok was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute. In all, the Center for Countering Digital Hate estimated that as many as 3,000,000 of these sexualized images were produced, including more than 23,000 images of children.

The prosecutor office also said it was investigating the distribution of Holocaust denial content on the platform. Far-right accounts have flourished under Musk’s ownership of X, formerly Twitter, with Musk often resharing racist conspiracy theories and antisemitic rhetoric — a habit mirrored by Grok, which gained notoriety for calling itself “MechaHitler” during a particularly racist posting spree last summer.

Governments abroad have seemed to take Grok’s AI nudes of women and children more seriously. Indonesia and Malaysia banned access to Grok, though the former has just lifted its ban “conditionally.” UK prime minister Keir Starmer vowed to crackdown on the chatbot and showed support for the nation’s communications regulator Ofcom, after it announced its own investigation into Grok.

Mirroring developments across the channel, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office announced its own probe into Grok on Tuesday, over its “potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content,” per the BBC. “The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people’s personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,” William Malcolm, the ICO’s executive director for regulatory risk and innovation, said in a statement.

The renewed regulatory pressure abroad comes after fresh reporting from the Washington Post detailed how some xAI employees were appalled by the startup’s abrupt pivot into embracing heavily sexualized content, as Musk pushed to make Grok as engaging as possible. Employees said that the company rolled back guardrails on sexual material and ignored repeated warnings that Grok could allow users to churn out sexualized images of children and celebrities that could be illegal. xAI’s safety team reportedly consisted of just two or three people for most of 2025.

Though Starship and a revenge-porn generating Grok would seemingly have little in common, Musk explained in an announcement about the acquisition that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology in the long-term because of the vast amounts of solar energy that could be harvested and all the untapped real-estate that putting data centers in orbit opens up. He also stated that he wants to populate the Earth’s orbit with AI satellites to build what he likened to a “sentient sun.” These are ambitions that will be years in the making — but in the meantime, SpaceX will have to survive its now close association with CSAM-generating AI.

            <div id="article-text">Along with being used to generate nonconsensual sexual images of women and girls, spread racist rhetoric, and doxx the home addresses of both celebrities and non-public figures, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is struggling to get a grip on reality.

The mercurial billionaire’s social media platform X, which was folded into his AI startup xAI last year — and subsequently acquired by SpaceX this week — has once again been thrust into the center of the ongoing scandal surrounding the Justice Department’s release of millions of files pertaining to its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Musk has been in full damage control mode, struggling to reconcile his attempts to downplay his personal relationship with the notorious predator with some damning emails that suggest he was actively trying to invite himself to Epstein’s island in the Caribbean.

Adding to the chaos is Musk’s xAI chatbot Grok, which he’s advertised as “maximally truth-seeking” — but which is instead sowing chaos into the explosive revelations about Epstein.

The result may be one of the most amazing AI responses we’ve ever seen. No, seriously: when a X account asked Grok to calculate the “probability” that New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani is somehow related to Epstein, based on perceived similarities in the shapes of their eyebrows and mouths, the AI chatbot had a downright baffling answer.

The account showed Grok two headshots of the two men side by side, with two arrows pointing to their eyebrows and circles around their respective mouths, as if to suggest they were genetically related. The odd request may have been related to recently released documents implicating Mamdani’s mother, Mira Nair, who attended a 2009 afterparty at the house of convicted sex trafficker and Epstein’s close collaborator Ghislaine Maxwell. However, there’s currently no evidence to suggest that Nair knew about or was involved in any criminal activity.

All that flew far above the AI chatbot’s head, though, as it failed to even accurately identify Mamdani.

“Based on the image, these seem to be [late-night TV host] Jimmy Kimmel (left) and Jeffrey Epstein (right),” the chatbot responded. “They share minor similarities in eyebrow arch and mouth shape, but differences in age, hair, and features are clear.”

Yes, that’s right: the chatbot that Musk has deployed to untold millions of users on X, which now operates as a de facto fact-checking machine used to settle arguments on the chaotic site, can’t even tell the difference between Zohran Mamdani and Jimmy Kimmel, who look nothing alike.

At least it admitted its error — though only after prodding.

“Correction: That’s actually Zohran Mamdani on the left, not Jimmy Kimmel — my bad on the initial ID,” the chatbot conceded. “Similarities in eyebrows and smiles are there, but no known family ties to Epstein. Probability of relation: under one percent based on public info.”

The chatbot’s gaffe shows yet again how even a seemingly straightforward task like identifying a well-known figure, who has been photographed many thousands of times, from a well-lit headshot appears to be beyond the tech’s capabilities — despite xAI pouring billions of dollars into its development.

Coincidentally, Mamdani used his powers as New York City’s mayor to shut down a “functionally unusable” AI chatbot just last week. The chatbot was set up by disgraced former mayor Eric Adams to help small business owners navigate local regulations, costing the administration “around half a million dollars,” per Mamdani. Not unlike Grok, Adams’ chatbot was shown to be incredibly unreliable, often contradicting actual labor law.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, the four daring NASA astronauts who are scheduled to venture around the Moon and back as part of the agency’s historic Artemis 2 mission entered quarantine.

Their ride, a small Orion capsule mounted atop the agency’s enormous Space Launch System rocket, has already been rolled onto Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

But the agency’s remaining checks ahead of the launch — a gauntlet of tests called the “wet dress rehearsal” that involves running through the full launch sequence without a crew on board — didn’t quite go as planned, forcing the agency to officially push back the launch date from its already ambitious early February timeline.

In an official statement this morning, NASA revealed that we may have to wait another four weeks for humanity’s return to the Moon, with the agency now eyeing a second wet dress rehearsal for “March as the earliest possible launch opportunity.”

The crew is officially released from quarantine, the agency said, as it awaits the next launch window.

It may not be the news we wanted to hear — but at least now, NASA’s Artemis 2 mission won’t have to compete with the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics for media attention.

According to a February 2 statement, NASA found that the rocket’s core stage had sprung a leak and that efforts to correct it “proved unsuccessful.”

“The leak rate at the interface of the tail service mast umbilical continued to exceed the allowable limits,” the update reads. “Liquid hydrogen filling operations on both the core stage and upper stage are paused as the team meets to determines next steps.”

As a result, the tentative February 8 launch date is no longer on the table.

Fortunately, the leak appeared to be the only major hiccup during this week’s test. NASA engineers “pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives,” according to the agency.

However, teams had to battle the elements, as cold winter temperatures “caused a late start to tanking operations.”

Engineers got to roughly five minutes left in the countdown when the ground launch sequencer noticed a “spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate,” automatically stopping the countdown as a result.

Besides the hydrogen leak, teams also had to troubleshoot “dropouts of audio communication channels across ground teams in the past few weeks leading up to the test.”

The agency will be holding a press release later today to address the latest developments.

It’s an unfortunate development, forcing us to once again be patient to see humanity’s historic return to the Moon. The next launch dates fall in early March. If NASA misses those dates, it could be pushed back to early or late April, according to Space.com — the month NASA was originally targeting before September 2025, when the launch date was pushed up to February.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the wake of ruthless arrests of journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort in Minneapolis, one Harvard political scientist is arguing something many of us have suspected for a long time: the US is moving away from its traditional democratic framework toward a fundamentally different system of governance.

In an interview with the media industry publication Status, Harvard political scientist Steven Levitsky made the case that the Trump administration’s assault on democratic norms has now become extreme, even by the standards of right-wing dictators.

“This is a new dimension,” Levitsky told Status. “In democracies, journalists don’t get arrested. In authoritarian regimes, journalists get arrested.”

Levitsky went so far as to contrast Trump with notorious conservative nationalist Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary since 2010. Since coming to power, the Hungarian strongman has systematically dismantled the country’s judiciary, as well as its election system by rewriting the constitution. Yet as Levitsky notes, even Orbán has stopped short of the kind of paramilitary street enforcement emerging in the US.

“Orbán doesn’t arrest journalists,” the Harvard academic claimed. “In Hungary if you walk the streets of Budapest or other Hungarian cities, you will not find heavily armed masked men abducting people. That doesn’t happen in Hungary.”

Notwithstanding that Orbán has been criticized for arresting journalists, it’s true that Trump’s attempts to silence the press and embolden armed federal agents speak to an alarming escalation of reactionary policies — especially in a country that fashions itself a global beacon of democracy and freedom.

Still, this moment in US politics doesn’t begin or end with Trump. As University of Tulsa economic historian Clara Mattei has argued, the groundwork for democratic erosion was laid decades ago through neoliberal austerity policies that hollowed out the economic foundations of American democracy.

In Mattei’s analysis, austerity functions as a tool to disempower people, worsening conditions for the majority “to help prevent political action against the system as a whole.” The dictatorial turn we’re seeing today — manifested in the suppression of free speech and rising police state — is the result of decades of policies that already reconfigured who holds power in American society.

“I see austerity fundamentally as one-sided class warfare, led by the state and its economic experts and aimed at refurbishing the capital order in moments when it is crumbling,” Mattei said in a 2023 interview about her book, “The Capital Order.” “As a political project, austerity is in fact the most rational way to safeguard capitalism: it structurally disempowers workers by increasing precariousness and market dependence.”

Indeed, as Levitsky observes, the damage this has done to American democracy may be irreversible.

“Even in the best case, we throw these guys out electorally, I don’t think we’re going to go back,” he told Status. “We’re not going to step back to a democracy with strong constitutional guardrails. The democratic norms have, at this point, been shattered and on the floor, and rules have been violated, twisted, manipulated.”

            <div id="article-text">All startups accepted into YC will soon have the option to receive their seed checks via stablecoins, crypto YC partner Nemil Dalal told The Block.

YC’s famous “standard deal” is that it invests $500,000 into startups accepted into its program in exchange for 7% of their companies. Now that deal is hitting the blockchain (Base, Solana, and Ethereum, to be exact), starting with the upcoming spring batch.

Dalal said that stablecoin transfers are often more effective, specifically for founders working in emerging markets. But also, YC is putting its money where its mouth is, so to speak. Last fall, YC partnered with Base and Coinbase Ventures to encourage founders to build more blockchain-related companies.

Interest in blockchain tech is on the rise again in Silicon Valley as the U.S. has taken steps toward more formal, crypto-friendly regulation of the industry.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/homeland-security-is-trying-to-force-tech-companies-to-hand-over-data-about-trump-critics/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Homeland Security has been quietly demanding tech companies turn over user information about critics of the Trump administration, according to reports.

In several cases over recent months, Homeland Security has relied on the use of administrative subpoenas to seek identifiable information about individuals who run anonymous Instagram accounts, which share posts about ICE immigration raids in their local neighborhoods. These subpoenas have also been used to demand information about people who have criticized Trump officials or protested government policies.

Unlike judicial subpoenas, which are authorized by a judge after seeing enough evidence of a crime to authorize a search or seizure of someone’s things, administrative subpoenas are issued by federal agencies, allowing investigators to seek a wealth of information about individuals from tech and phone companies without a judge’s oversight.

While administrative subpoenas cannot be used to obtain the contents of a person’s emails, online searches, or location data, they can demand information specifically about the user, such as what time a user logs in, from where, using which devices, and revealing the email addresses and other identifiable information about who opened an online account. But because administrative subpoenas are not backed by a judge’s authority or a court’s order, it’s largely up to a company whether to give over any data to the requesting government agency.

Administrative subpoenas are not new; the use of these self-signed demands by Trump officials to seek identifiable information about people who are critical of the president’s policies has raised alarm.

Bloomberg reported last week that Homeland Security sought the identity of an anonymous Instagram account called @montocowatch, which says its goal is to share resources to help protect immigrant rights and due process across Montgomery County in Pennsylvania. This comes amid an ongoing federal immigration crackdown across the United States, which has drawn widespread protests and condemnation. Homeland Security lawyers sent an administrative subpoena to Meta demanding it turn over personal information of the person who runs the account, citing a non-Homeland Security employee who claimed to receive a tip that ICE agents were being stalked.

The American Civil Liberties Union, representing the account owner, said there was no evidence of wrongdoing and that recording police, sharing that recording, and doing so anonymously is legal and protected under the First Amendment. Homeland Security withdrew its subpoena without providing an explanation.

The ACLU called the subpoena “part of a broader strategy to intimidate people who document immigration activity or criticize government actions.”

Bloomberg reported the effort to unmask the @montcowatch account was not an isolated incident, referencing at least four other cases where Homeland Security officials used administrative subpoenas in efforts to identify the people running Instagram accounts publishing content critical of the government. Those subpoenas were also withdrawn after the account owners sued to block the attempt.

Tech companies have in recent years published transparency reports that detail how many government demands for data they receive. But most do not break out how many judicial and administrative subpoenas they receive over a period of time, even though the two kinds of demands are fundamentally different.

When asked by TechCrunch, Meta spokesperson Francis Brennan did not say if Meta provided Homeland Security any data involving @montcowatch or if the company was asked to provide information about the account another way.

A new report by The Washington Post on Tuesday found that an administrative subpoena was also used to seek information from Google about an American retiree within hours of him after sending a critical email to Homeland Security’s lead attorney Joseph Dernbach. The retiree’s home was later visited by federal agents inquiring about the email.

The Post described the retiree as someone critical of Trump during his first term, who attended a No Kings rally last year, regularly attends gatherings and protests, and wrote criticisms to lawmakers, all actions protected under the First Amendment.

Within five hours of emailing the Homeland Security lawyer — who was named in an article about the case of an Afghan the U.S. was trying to deport and whose email address is listed on the Florida Bar’s website — the retiree received an email from Google, according to The Washington Post. The email notified him that his account had been subpoenaed by the Department of Homeland Security.

The subpoena demanded to know the day, time, and duration of all his online sessions, his IP address and physical address, and a list of each service he used, and any other usernames and identifiable information relating to his account, such as his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.

Two weeks later, Homeland Security agents were on his doorstep, asking him questions about the email that he sent to Dernbach, which the agents conceded broke no laws.

Google spokesperson Katelin Jabbari told TechCrunch the company pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, “as we did in this instance,” referring to the subpoena referenced in The Washington Post’s reporting.

When asked by TechCrunch, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin would not say why the U.S. was seeking information about people who have been critical of the Trump administration and accounts documenting ICE activity, or say for what reason the subpoenas were withdrawn.

“HSI has broad administrative subpoena authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(d) and 19 U.S.C. § 1509(a)(1) to issue subpoenas,” said McLaughlin, referring to Homeland Security Investigations, an investigative unit within ICE.

Not all companies are able to hand over data about their customers. For instance, information that is end-to-end encrypted and can only be accessed by obtaining a person’s phone or devices. That said, many companies are still able to provide large amounts of information about their users, including where they log in, how they log in, and from where, which may allow investigators to unmask anonymous accounts.

End-to-end encrypted messaging apps, like Signal, have long championed how little data it collects about its users. The messaging app responds to occasional legal demands by stating that it is unable to produce user data that it does not have to begin with.

The reliance on U.S. tech giants is another reason why European countries and ordinary consumers are seeking to rely less on American tech giants, at a time when chief executives and senior leaders at some of the largest U.S. tech companies are overtly cozying up to the Trump administration.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Skyryse, an El Segundo, California-based aviation automation startup, has raised more than $300 million in a Series C investment, pushing its valuation to $1.15 billion and into unicorn territory.

The round, which was announced Tuesday and led by Autopilot Ventures, provided a multimillion-dollar accelerant for the startup as it nears the end of a lengthy Federal Aviation Administration certification process for its flight control system. The capital will also be used to integrate its operating system, known as SkyOS, across numerous aircraft, including U.S. military Black Hawk helicopters.

Other investors in this round include Fidelity Management & Research Company, ArrowMark Partners, Atreides Management LP, BAM Elevate, Baron Capital Group, Durable Capital Partners, Positive Sum, Qatar Investment Authority, RCM Private Markets Fund managed by Rokos Capital Management, and Woodline Partners. The startup, which was founded in 2016, has raised more than $605 million in equity capital.

Skyryse has made inroads with investors as well as the U.S. military, emergency medical service operators, law enforcement, and private operators for its simplified flight system. The startup has stripped out dozens of mechanical flight controls like gauges and switches and replaced them with a system containing several flight computers that automate the more complicated and dangerous aspects of flying.

This is not a fully autonomous system; a pilot must still handle the operations. But it’s designed to automate the trickiest aspects of flying, enhance the skills of pilots, and improve safety.

That simplicity and ease of operation — a literal swipe of the finger on a touchscreen — has won over companies like United Rotorcraft, Air Methods, and Mitsubishi Corporation, which have contracts with Skyryse to integrate SkyOS on a variety of helicopters and airplanes.

Skyryse started building and testing its system on helicopters, one of the most unstable aircraft to operate. But the idea is that SkyOS can be applied to any aircraft. That initial operating system, known as Skyryse One, automates takeoff and landing and fully automates hover and engine-out emergency landings. The company has since integrated the operating system on Black Hawk helicopters.

Skyryse has made progress on its certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration. Last year, the FAA granted final design approval for the company’s SkyOS flight control computers. Skyryse must now complete formal flight testing and verification to achieve full certification.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/agentic-coding-comes-to-apples-xcode-26-3-with-agents-from-anthropic-and-openai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple is bringing agentic coding to Xcode. On Tuesday, the company announced the release of Xcode 26.3, which will allow developers to use agentic tools, including Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex, directly in Apple’s official app development suite.

The Xcode 26.3 Release Candidate is available to all Apple Developers today from the developer website and will hit the App Store a bit later.

This latest update comes on the heels of the Xcode 26 release last year, which introduced support for ChatGPT and Claude within Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE) used by those building apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple’s other hardware platforms.

The integration of agentic coding tools allows AI models to tap into more of Xcode’s features to perform their tasks and perform more complex automation.

The models will also have access to Apple’s current developer documentation to ensure they use the latest APIs and follow the best practices as they build.

At launch, the agents can help developers explore their project, understand its structure and metadata, then build the project and run tests to see if there are any errors and fix them, if so.

To prepare for this launch, Apple said it worked closely with both Anthropic and OpenAI to design the new experience. Specifically, the company said it did a lot of work to optimize token usage and tool calling, so the agents would run efficiently in Xcode.

Xcode leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to expose its capabilities to the agents and connect them with its tools. That means that Xcode can now work with any outside MCP-compatible agent for things like project discovery, changes, file management, previews and snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.

Developers who want to try the agentic coding feature should first download the agents they want to use from Xcode’s settings. They can also connect their accounts with the AI providers by signing in or adding their API key. A drop-down menu within the app allows developers to choose which version of the model they want to use (e.g. GPT-5.2-Codex vs. GPT-5.1 mini).

In a prompt box on the left side of the screen, developers can tell the agent what sort of project they want to build or change to the code they want to make using natural language commands. For instance, they could direct Xcode to add a feature to their app that uses one of Apple’s provided frameworks, and how it should appear and function.

As the agent starts working, it breaks down tasks into smaller steps, so it’s easy to see what’s happening and how the code is changing. It will also look for the documentation it needs before it begins coding. The changes are highlighted visually within the code, and the project transcript on the side of the screen allows developers to learn what’s happening under the hood.

This transparency could particularly help new developers who are learning to code, Apple believes. To that end, the company is hosting a “code-along” workshop on Thursday on its developer site, where users can watch and learn how to use agentic coding tools as they code along in real time with their own copy of Xcode.

At the end of its process, the AI agent verifies that the code it created works as expected. Armed with the results of its tests on this front, the agent can iterate further on the project if need be to fix errors or other problems. (Apple noted that asking the agent to think through its plans before writing code can sometimes help to improve the process, as it forces the agent to do some pre-planning.)

Plus, if developers are not happy with the results, they can easily revert their code back to its original at any point in time, as Xcode creates milestones every time the agent makes a change.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/gradients-heat-pumps-get-new-smarts-to-enable-old-building-retrofits/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New York City and others like it are filled with old buildings that are for the most part fine, except they’re not all that comfortable to live in. Built in an era when massive boilers were cutting-edge technology, the buildings are usually too hot or too cold, but seldom just right.

There are companies trying to rectify that using clever horseshoe-shaped heat pumps. Superficially, they’re similar to window air conditioners, except they don’t block the view and they can heat as well as cool.

Gradient makes one of those heat pumps, but now it’s adding a twist: In multifamily buildings, it can link every one of its window units together. The startup shared with TechCrunch exclusive details about the new Nexus software and service.

“Multifamily buildings are an ignored sector,” Vince Romanin, chief technology officer at Gradient, told TechCrunch. “It’s a place where we can do better for the user.”

The startup is mostly targeting old buildings that need HVAC upgrades. Gradient has worked with the New York City Housing Authority to install its heat pumps in public housing, and it ran a pilot in Tracy, California, in a newer two-story affordable-housing complex. It’s also talking with colleges and universities, many of which have dorms that weren’t built with hot autumn weather in mind.

Old buildings often have one electric meter, which can tempt residents into overusing their heating or air conditioning. Nexus gives some control back to building managers. They can set guardrails to prevent people from overusing the heat or AC — either intentionally or otherwise — while still allowing them to be comfortable. In one instance, a building manager set the heating limit at 78˚ F, and the next day energy consumption dropped by a quarter.

Romanin said Gradient’s heat pumps are the “lowest-cost option” for old buildings with boilers that are reaching end of life, a common occurrence in New York City. As a bonus, units that previously only had a steam radiator now get air conditioning, future proofing the units against worsening heat waves.

By installing a window unit rather than a minisplit, retrofits can happen within hours. They also don’t require electrical upgrades, Romanin said. In buildings with old electrical wiring that can’t support a full 12 amp load on a single outlet, Nexus can reduce the draw, said Mansi Shah, senior vice president of product and software at Gradient.

That strategy can extend beyond the building too. When the grid is overwhelmed by demand, which can happen on hot summer days, Gradient is working on a way to dial back its heat pumps while still maintaining occupant comfort. By using information about the building along with feedback from sensors in the heat pumps, the company hopes to predict which units can reduce their air conditioning demand, like those on the shady side of a building. That sort of demand response can help the grid serve more heat pumps without requiring costly upgrades.

“There’s a lot of people who said when we electrify everything, the grid won’t handle it,” Romanin said. “I think that it is very possible to electrify everything and make the grid better, make the grid’s job easier, and make electrons cheaper.”

At about two this morning, the familiar howl of air-raid sirens woke me in the center of Kyiv, followed by the low thuds of anti-aircraft cannons attempting to shoot down Russian drones. The news alerts followed, citing the city’s mayor: Russian strikes had left more than 1,000 apartment buildings without power and heat as temperatures fell below zero degrees Fahrenheit.

Vladimir Putin was not going to miss his chance to use winter as a weapon. In recent weeks, Russian missile strikes have hammered the power grid and neighborhood heating systems, leaving both on the verge of collapse. Last week, President Trump appealed to Putin to pause these attacks for a week, long enough for the cold snap to pass and peace talks to move forward. Putin initially appeared to acquiesce—then launched one of the worst attacks on Ukraine’s energy network since the start of the war.

No one I met in Kyiv over the past few days expected anything different. As the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches the four-year mark this month, Putin’s strategy has shifted to one that stands in blatant violation of the international laws of war, which prohibit the bombing of civilian infrastructure. Ukrainians aptly call it “energy terror,” and its goal is to freeze them into a state of hopelessness and soften them up for capitulation.

That goal, like most of his aims in this war, has remained out of Putin’s reach. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to push for peace on terms that his people can accept, including firm guarantees from the United States and its allies that they would act decisively to stop any future Russian attack. Over the weekend, as Ukraine’s negotiators met with Zelensky to plan for U.S.-mediated talks with the Russians this week in Abu Dhabi, hundreds of people gathered for a daytime rave on the frozen surface of the Kyiv reservoir, dancing, skating, and racing their cars.

The images from this defiant party masked a deepening exhaustion in the capital. “People are really on the edge,” Yana Markova, the principal of a primary school in Kyiv, told me when I visited her yesterday. The city’s schools have largely stopped holding classes this winter, and Markova has turned her building into a temporary shelter, its cafeteria serving thousands of meals to people whose apartments have no gas, water, power, or heat. “People have different reactions to all this,” she said over a cup of chicken soup. “Some point their anger at the Russians for doing this. Some blame our authorities for failing to protect us.”

On January 9, after the first massive attack of the year on Kyiv’s energy system, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, urged residents to leave their homes in search of “alternative sources of power and heat.” Temperatures dropped far below freezing that night, and the impact of the bombing “was the most devastating for the capital’s critical infrastructure,” he said in a statement on social media. In many neighborhoods, people sought shelter in subway stations, shivering as they tried to catch a few hours of sleep on yoga mats and camping chairs.

But the metro system does not extend to all parts of the city. The working-class district of Desnianskyi, home to more than a quarter of a million people, consists mostly of high-rise apartment blocks. The blackouts shut down elevators in those buildings, trapping some elderly residents in their freezing homes.

Yesterday evening, about eight hours before the latest wave of strikes on Kyiv, I went to see the head of the district, Maksym Bakhmatov, on the third floor of its administrative building. The ground floor houses the equivalent of a DMV, where people sat around in bulky coats and woolen scarves, some waiting to register their complaints about the lack of basic services. One man used the room’s relative warmth to take a nap.

Bakhmatov sat in his office in three layers of clothes, bracing for the next barrage of Russian strikes. A former television producer, he made his name as a performer on the same comedy circuit as Zelensky, who appointed Bakhmatov to run the Desnianskyi district in May. The official had little hope for the peace talks Trump initiated last year, because the Kremlin has shown no willingness to respect any calls for a cease-fire. “Putin will not stop,” Bakhmatov told me. “His rockets will not run out this year or next year.”

Though his anger was mostly reserved for the Russians, he also had harsh words for the local government, a sign of the political divisions that have deepened as living conditions in Kyiv become more difficult. “The city has sent us zero generators, zero food,” he said. Federal authorities have stepped in to provide emergency assistance, setting up heated tents and food pantries for people in his district.

Read: Ukraine latest attacks showcase its desperation.

After every bomb that hits the nearby power plant, Bakhmatov follows a frantic routine. He gets a call in the middle of the night, warning him of the impending blackouts. The water in every apartment tower in his district—roughly 800 of them—then needs to be drained from the central heating system before it freezes. Failing to do that within two hours could rupture the pipes inside the walls. It might then take years, he says, for the repairs needed to make the buildings livable again. “They have the same heating system in Russia,” Bakhmatov said. “It was all built in the Soviet Union. Putin knows all its weak spots. He knows exactly where to strike.”

The unfolding catastrophe has long been clear to the people who run Ukraine’s energy sector. In the middle of November, one of its top executives, Maxim Timchenko, traveled to Washington, D.C., to brief U.S. officials and members of Congress. “It’s an absolute disaster,” he told me during that visit. “It’s definitely going to be the worst winter of the war, and there is no solution other than an energy cease-fire. That’s the main message I’m bringing here to all levels.”

As the head of DTEK, the largest private energy company in Ukraine, Timchenko could see that the Russians had carefully selected their targets to maximize the damage not only to Ukraine’s power grid but to its sense of unity. Throughout the fall, their missile strikes destroyed the substations that move electricity from the nuclear-power plants in the western part of Ukraine to the east, where most of the population and heavy industry are concentrated. “They wanted to divide us down the middle,” Timchenko explained. “And in the electricity space, they succeeded.”

Without high-voltage lines to move power across the country, many parts of western Ukraine saw a surplus of electricity this fall and early winter, while the eastern half of the country experienced blackouts lasting as long as 18 hours a day.

As the strikes continued in January and temperatures fell, Zelensky intensified his calls for a partial cease-fire, under which both sides would agree not to target the other’s energy infrastructure. Trump put his weight behind the proposal last week. “I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that,” he said on January 29. The Ukrainians, Trump added, almost “didn’t believe it, but they were very happy about it.”

The pause in Russian attacks on Kyiv held over the weekend, while other parts of Ukraine suffered more acts of barbarism. On Sunday afternoon, Russian drones attacked a civilian bus owned by DTEK and carrying miners, killing at least 12 people as they rode home from their shift in the Dnipropetrovsk region, in eastern Ukraine. Still, the weekend saw no Russian missile strikes against Kyiv’s power plants, and Zelensky expressed hope that the respite would lay the groundwork for the next round of talks.

They are due to start tomorrow in Abu Dhabi, and Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, will be there to mediate. On Saturday, both men met in Florida with the Kremlin’s envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, to discuss the terms of a possible deal. “We are encouraged by this meeting that Russia is working toward securing peace in Ukraine,” Witkoff wrote afterward on social media. The Russians, he added, are grateful for Trump’s “critical leadership in seeking a durable and lasting peace.”

But that gratitude did not count for much against Putin’s desire to extend the suffering of Ukrainians. He sees the coldest days of winter as instruments of war, and he will use them no matter what mercies Trump may request. As the sun set over Kyiv today, the air-raid sirens started to wail again across the city center. People got dressed and headed to the shelters, determined to wait out the cold for one more night.</div>

            <h2>The Logical End Point of ‘America First’ Foreign Aid</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/foreign-aid-usaid-strategy-charity/685866/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last summer, the Dalai Lama was having a party in Dharamshala for his 90th birthday, and Bethany Morrison, a newly appointed State Department official, was eager to meet with him there. Inconveniently, the United States had recently canceled about $12 million worth of annual foreign aid benefiting Tibetan-exile communities as part of the implosion of USAID. This, Morrison and other State officials thought, would not make a particularly good impression on His Holiness, according to a former State and a former USAID official.

Prior to the Dalai Lama’s birthday, the two former federal employees told me, they had spent months lobbying for Donald Trump’s administration to restore at least some Asia-based aid projects. They had argued that these projects passed Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s new litmus test for overseas spending: They would make America “safer, stronger, and more prosperous.” Nothing changed. (Like other aid workers I spoke with for this story, the former employees requested anonymity because of fear of professional reprisal.)

But as the party’s date approached, Jeremy Lewin, the new head of U.S. foreign assistance at the State Department, was suddenly persuaded to resurrect aid to Tibetans, and had seemingly little regard for where, exactly, the money would be going, the former employees said. In a June email to other State Department officials, Lewin wrote that he wanted to “give some good news ahead of the trip.” Days before the party, the State Department allocated nearly $7 million to support Tibetan exiles in South Asia. (A State Department spokesperson, who did not give their name, told me in an email that many programs were paused in early 2025 as part of a foreign-assistance review “conducted to ensure that the American taxpayer’s hard-earned dollars were being spent efficiently” but declined to comment on the specific circumstances of Tibetan aid being reinstated ahead of the party.)

For the past half century, the U.S. has pursued, however imperfectly, a straightforward ideal of foreign aid that has been codified in laws passed by Democrats and Republicans alike: Resources should be deployed wherever they are needed most. Under this administration, funding for overseas aid is being evaluated by a different measure—using “dealmaking and transactions as near-exclusive metrics of success,” as the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a centrist think tank, put it in November.

Foreign aid has always, to varying degrees, been a political project, meant to accrue soft power by forwarding America’s vision for itself and winning over people abroad. In the past year, though, some aid agreements have been nakedly transactional (the U.S. helping finance malaria drugs in exchange for access to minerals, for instance); others, such as those that preceded the Dalai Lama’s birthday party, simply highlight how haphazardly programs have been picked for survival. The overall result is that, instead of being directed at where they can save the most lives, U.S. humanitarian efforts now seem to be aimed primarily at where they can advance the Trump administration’s other priorities.

When the Trump administration suddenly ended most foreign-assistance programs early last year, governments around the world had little time to adjust budgets or make contingency plans. This gave the U.S. new and pointed leverage over most other countries, which it seems eager to exploit. On July 1, the day that some remnants of USAID were officially absorbed by the State Department, Rubio wrote on Substack that the administration’s foreign-funding thinking “prioritizes our national interests.” Talking points distributed widely within the State Department around that time, obtained by The Atlantic, clarify that under the new “America First” approach, the department plans to award funding to two main types of aid: programs that are strategic and programs that are lifesaving. The talking points emphasize that both categories are “not global charity” but rather “a tool of strategic engagement.”

The State Department spokesperson did not dispute this characterization. “President Trump’s National Security Strategy is very clear: the United States will partner with select countries to reduce conflict and foster mutually beneficial trade and investment relationships, shifting from a traditional aid-focused approach to one that strategically leverages foreign assistance to support economic growth,” they wrote. They added that the U.S. “remains the most generous nation in the world for lifesaving humanitarian assistance.” Notably, the president proposed slashing foreign aid by 70 percent in fiscal year 2026; Congress quietly rejected the cut.

Some of the foreign aid disbursed in the second half of last year appears to have been straightforwardly treated as a bargaining chip. Another senior State official described the department’s approach to me as “Can we cut a tariff deal with this country? Okay, we’ll increase the aid going to them. Are there critical mineral rights that we would like to discuss?” Foreign aid might lubricate that conversation too. The State Department hasn’t been shy about this strategy: In a September memo to Congress, which I obtained after its existence was first reported in The Washington Post, the department says it intended to use foreign-assistance money to incentivize other nations to “support U.S. immigration priorities” and diversify “critical mineral supply chains.”

Weeks later, Equatorial Guinea, a small country on the west coast of Africa, agreed to accept U.S. deportees who are not its citizens; in return, it received $7.5 million from a government fund meant to assist refugees and victims of conflict. Eswatini and Rwanda have signed similar deals. Last month, the State Department made the release of funds to fight malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV in Zambia contingent on its government agreeing to terms “for collaboration in the mining sector” and other economic reforms. The Zambia health-financing agreement is one of more than 50 that the State Department plans to sign with low- and middle-income countries in the next few months. Earlier this month, Mike Reid, the chief science officer for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, acknowledged in a post on his personal Substack that the global-health deals put aside “long-standing, epidemiologically sound priorities” and are “transactional”—but he wrote that he ultimately rooted for their success.

Prior to this administration, the U.S. had generally distinguished a country’s government from its people when making aid decisions. The U.S. led the global effort to reduce the humanitarian crisis in Iraq caused by the near-total sanctions that had been levied on the country after President Saddam Hussein ordered the invasion of Kuwait. American taxpayers even fed North Korea during its late-1990s famine. “Showing that the United States stood in solidarity with the world’s most vulnerable people, regardless of what their government did or did not do, was kind of a goal in and of itself, as a projection of American values,” the senior State Department official told me. In some cases, that still appears to hold true: This month, for example, the U.S. announced that it is working with the Catholic Church to deliver food and supplies to Cubans, despite the State Department’s allegations that Cuba’s government sponsors terrorism and concerns about “diversion by the illegitimate regime.”

But neutrality as a rule in aid decisions “no longer exists,” the senior official said. Concerns about diversion and terrorism have been used to justify shutting down all assistance to Afghanistan and Yemen—countries where urgent intervention is needed to prevent deaths from malnutrition, according to the federal government’s famine data. And Rubio justified a muted response to Myanmar’s request for help after a major earthquake last spring in part because “they have a military junta that doesn’t like us.”

Meanwhile, countries that have a history of advancing U.S. security interests have been rewarded: Last month, for instance, as Rubio signed a deal contributing $1.7 billion to Kenya’s health system, he expressed his appreciation for the country leading a United Nations peacekeeping force in Haiti, a country the Trump administration hopes to stabilize to prevent would-be migrants from attempting the 600-mile trip to Florida. In April, funding was restored for a desalination plant in Jordan, a country where water scarcity is severe but relatively few people die for want of water—and that happens to be the U.S.’s main Arab ally, and is known to collaborate closely with the CIA. Jordan has benefited from its allyship before: In 2022, a federal watchdog determined that, by sending more funding for clean water and sanitation to Jordan than any other nation, the U.S. was subverting the spirit of the law. But if the old system was slanted by strategic interests, the new one has keeled over in pursuit of them. Jordan now appears to be the one of the only—if not the only—countries where the U.S. has reinstated a water-infrastructure project, despite having abandoned more than 20 half-finished drinking-water and sanitation systems around the world.

Sometimes, the administration’s vision of aid seems to be not “America First,” but “Trump First.” For example, in March, a Vietnamese official announced that work on a suspended USAID project to clean up toxic chemicals would resume, one day after Vietnam’s prime minister reportedly met with a representative of the Trump Organization. Soon after, Vietnamese officials argued that the organization should be allowed to skip meeting several legal requirements to begin constructing a new golf resort in Vietnam on an expedited timeline that would “capitalize on the support of the Donald Trump administration” and be more convenient for Trump’s son Eric, who planned to attend the ground-breaking in May. (The State Department spokesperson said that the chemical project was “a high priority for this Administration” but did not answer followup questions about the relationship between the project and the Trump Organization representative’s meeting with the Vietnamese prime minister. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.)

The Trump administration’s approach to foreign aid may gain more resources for the U.S. in the short term, but it also risks sacrificing other goals. The American intelligence community has long known that insurgent groups—many of which openly seek the destruction of the United States—rely on desperation, food insecurity, and hopelessness to gain recruits. USAID’s collapse has greased their efforts. The State Department spokesperson wrote that the department works with partner governments to “strengthen local security capabilities, improve intelligence-sharing, and disrupt terrorist networks before they can exploit instability.” But after U.S.-funded health and counterterrorism programs in Mozambique were cut last year, ISIS surged into the vacuum. When Trump hastily shut down all foreign aid to Afghanistan, the State Department said its “primary humanitarian objective” in the country was to prevent the resources left behind from going to terrorists. Instead, armored vehicles that American taxpayers had bought for humanitarian workers—along with 147 pieces of sensitive security equipment—were seized by the Taliban. (The State Department spokesperson did not directly address the incident. “The Trump Administration will not allow U.S. taxpayer dollars to be used to enable the Taliban’s heinous behavior,&quot; they told me.)

The United States’ new approach to foreign aid brings the nation in line with authoritarian countries that have historically prioritized strategy over charity. Russia’s grain diplomacy functions with the understanding that food today means military bases tomorrow. China subordinates the goal of improving foreign populations’ health outcomes to establishing dependency on its medical tech. The Trump administration may not have wholly forsaken the extraordinary idea that the United States should spend money to save the lives of ordinary people in foreign countries. But it has trampled on the humanitarian pretense for doing so.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The royal family in Abu Dhabi had a problem. Their AI firm, G42, wanted American chips, but both the Biden administration and Republicans in Congress feared letting them have any out of concern that the chips would be transferred to China.

The family solved the problem last year, The Wall Street Journal has discovered, by using the simplest solution that businesses can now employ for a policy obstacle: They seem to have made a deal with the Trump family. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family sometimes called the “Spy Sheikh,” purchased a 49 percent share in World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto firm, thus sending $187 million to Trump-family-controlled entities. That spring, the Trump administration reversed American policy and approved the AI-chip transfer.

A sitting U.S. president shouldn’t have a business partner. If he did, ideally, that partner would be a U.S. citizen and not an agent of a foreign government. But if the president is going to have a foreign operative as his business partner, ideally that partner would not have a nickname like the Spy Sheikh.

President Trump has generally managed to confine the proliferating conflicts between his business dealings and the public interest to second-tier news stories. Trump and his spokespeople have rarely had to even defend his choice to operate a global business empire that stands to profit from his decisions.

David Frum: The Trump presidency’s world-historical heist

The Journal’s explosive report, which constitutes the first established instance of a foreign government official buying a large share of a Trump company after the 2024 election, has at least briefly forced the administration and the Trump family to explain themselves. The defenses put forth are not reassuring.

One defense, via World Liberty itself, is that the company need not follow any different ethical standards than other companies. David Wachsman, a spokesperson for the firm, told the Journal, “The idea that, when raising capital, a privately held American company should be held to some unique standard that no other similar company would be held is both ridiculous and un-American.”

The reason World Liberty might be held to a different standard than other firms is that World Liberty was founded by, among others, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Barron Trump, and “co-founder emeritus” Donald Trump during the home stretch of the 2024 presidential campaign.

A normal business can’t simply change government policy in order to enrich itself. Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm in a blind trust upon taking office to avoid the temptation to tilt the policy agenda in a pro-peanut direction. Other peanut farmers did not have to establish blind trusts in response to Carter’s election. That is the difference between a business owned by a sitting president and one that isn’t.

Wachsman also assured the Journal that Trump and Steve Witkoff, a World Liberty co-founder, “had no involvement in the deal and haven’t been involved in World Liberty since taking office,” as the paper paraphrased his answer. But because Trump’s sons can handle the firm’s business, and presumably have regular opportunities to communicate with their dad, that does essentially nothing to dispel the conflict of interest. All that needs to happen to create a corrupt nexus is for Trump to find out who is giving him money.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, appearing on This Week With George Stephanopoulos, offered two additional defenses that are even less convincing: “President Trump has been completely transparent when his family travels for business reasons. They don’t do so in secret. We don’t learn about it when we find a laptop a few years later. We learn about it when it’s happening.” Blanche elaborated: “The president is ethical. He talks more to the press. He says what’s happening more than any president in history. You have a question about it, you can ask him. He gaggled on the plane last night at midnight for, like, 20 minutes. Okay?”

To say that the president is taking money from interested parties while delivering favorable decisions out in the open is not much of a defense. The cliché “It’s not the crime; it’s the cover-up” presumes that you have enough shame to cover up your crime in the first place. Watergate would have gone differently, but still not well, if Richard Nixon had held a press conference in 1972 to announce that he was hiring a team of burglars to surveil his opponents.

But even that threadbare defense isn’t true. Abu Dhabi’s investment in Trump’s company, the apparent quid in the quid pro quo, was a secret for more than a year until the Journal ferreted it out. Having been caught red-handed, Trump is trying to pretend to have freely disclosed it.

It is true that Trump entertains a lot of questions from the press, to which he often replies by insulting the reporters who asked, lying, or changing the subject. That is transparent in one sense of the word (you can see right through him). But it is not transparent in the sense of voluntarily placing pertinent information in the public domain.

Blanche also insisted that Trump’s World Liberty dealings were not different from the business practices of his predecessor: “I love it when these papers talk about something being unprecedented or never happening before, as if the Biden family and the Biden administration didn’t do exactly the same thing, and they were just in office.”

This is another defense that is not true and wouldn’t go very far even if it were.

Joe Biden did not run a private business while in office. His son Hunter did get involved in international businesses, such as the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, whose interest in hiring him was almost certainly due to the belief that he could put in a friendly word with his father. That arrangement was sleazy enough. But selling the mere appearance of political clout—as vice president, Joe Biden did not deliver any policy favors for Burisma—was not nearly as unethical as Trump actually delivering for his partner.

The comic aspect of a Trump spokesperson pointing to the Biden administration as precedent is that Trump has repeatedly called his predecessor a crook. He has labeled Biden “Crooked Joe,” accused him of running a “crime family,” and described him as “the most corrupt president in American history—and that’s not even close.”

Now his administration says Trump is merely doing the same thing as the most corrupt president in American history. That would mean that Trump, by his own account, is tied for first place as the most corrupt president in history.

The most revealing—you might even say transparent—defense came from the White House spokesperson Anna Kelly. “President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public,” she told the Journal. “There are no conflicts of interest.”

This is a simple but fascinating statement. On one level, it’s just a lie: There are documented conflicts of interest between Trump’s businesses and his policy decisions.

Casey Michel: America has never seen corruption like this

On a deeper level, however, Kelly is asserting that the very idea of a conflict of interest does not apply to this administration. It is a dispute not over facts but over concepts. Trump is challenging the idea that a conflict between the president’s and the public’s interests is possible.

This belief follows more or less from every other decision Trump has made, which has collapsed the space between the president and the state. Trump can apparently give himself and his friends carte blanche to commit crimes, while deeming anybody who opposes him a criminal. He can turn the government into a propaganda arm, naming parts of it for himself and making the Army hold a parade on his birthday.

When his spokespeople claim there are no conflicts of interest, they are defining Trump’s actual theory of governing: L’état, c’est moi.</div>

In the two days after Pretti died, Bovino relentlessly trolled Democrats who condemned the shooting—and defended Border Patrol agents as the real victims. When Representative Eric Swalwell wrote on X that ICE officers should walk off the job to protest the killing, Bovino replied: “I was thinking the same for you.” At about 1 a.m. last Monday, Bovino replied to a user who said he would “never pay for a beer again” after mocking Swalwell: “Lol!!  🍺 🍻 🍺 🍻 🍺 🍻.”

Getting silenced on X is, and I realize how absurd it sounds, the worst professional fate a Trump official can face. It signals that Bovino is no longer a player in an administration that has, from top to bottom, merged a social-media-first worldview with authoritarian tendencies. I like to call it the clicktatorship. Political appointees in the clicktatorship are not just using online platforms as a mode of communication. Their judgment and decision making are hyper-responsive to what’s happening on the far-right internet. They view everything as content.

No one better exemplifies the clicktatorship than the president himself. Trump routinely makes policy announcements via social media. Consider when, in August, he attempted to fire the Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook on Truth Social. When a government lawyer was questioned by the Supreme Court on the lack of an appeals option for Cook, he suggested that Cook could simply have made her case on Truth Social. In the clicktatorship, due process is reduced to the right to post.

You can see it everywhere. The administration’s official social-media feeds pump out far-right xenophobic memes and celebrate deportations with ASMR videos of undocumented immigrants in shackles. Just days before the killing of Pretti, the White House posted an image of a woman who was arrested after a protest at a church in Minnesota. It had been edited, presumably using generative AI, to show the arrestee as weeping uncontrollably. The effect is to reinforce an impression of dominance and control. Truth matters less than attention. Reporters who pointed out the manipulation were mocked by a White House spokesperson, who posted: “uM, eXCuSe mE??? iS tHAt DiGiTAlLy AlTeReD?!?!?!?!?!” (“The success of the White House’s social media pages speak for itself,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, told me in an email. “Through engaging posts and banger memes, we are successfully communicating the President’s extremely popular agenda.”)

Aspects of the clicktatorship existed during Trump’s first term, when the president used Twitter as a bully pulpit. But it has ratcheted up to new levels in his second go-round. His appointees are more likely to be keyboard warriors. They are obsessed with spectacle, and every government decision presents a potential opportunity to own the libs. Our government lost 10,000 STEM Ph.D.s last year, but seemingly has more posters than ever.

Consider Dan Bongino, who jumped from hosting a podcast to becoming deputy director of the FBI. (Bongino recently stepped down and returned to podcasting.) Or Harmeet Dhillon, who was a paid X influencer on top of her day job as a lawyer before becoming the head of civil rights at the Department of Justice. She continues to post up to a hundred times a day, between her personal and professional X accounts. “I’ve been stuck at the same level of followers on this account pretty much since I started my government job,” she wrote on X last month. What, am I chopped liver over here? What kind of content do my folks want to see more of to like and share?” And after the Venezuela raid in early January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was photographed at a makeshift command center in Mar-a-Lago. Behind him was a screen displaying X posts.

Read: Everything reacting to everything, all at once

Poster brain and authoritarianism reinforce each other: They thrive on conspiracy theories, lack all restraint, and jump to extreme solutions. Trump officials pointed to claims about welfare fraud from the social-media influencer Nick Shirley to justify cutting off billions in aid to five Democrat-led states. And Trump-administration officials pointed to Shirley’s viral video in attempting to justify a crackdown in Minnesota that has now resulted in the death of two American citizens. Meanwhile, government budget proposals and strategy documents now read like Truth Social posts, replete with online tropes. The White House website now alleges that President Obama hosted terrorists, speculates that Hunter Biden had cocaine in the White House, and says that “it was the Democrats who staged the real insurrection” on January 6, 2021.

Social media and authoritarian regimes have one other negative tendency in common: They feed information bubbles. Online, people select into circles of those they already agree with. In nondemocratic regimes, senior officials wall themselves off from reality because their underlings are afraid to deliver bad news. In both cases, the bubbles encourage radical actions rather than compromise—doubling down rather than moderation.

But the thing about bubbles is that sooner or later they burst. The Trump administration maintained a unified front after the killing of Renee Good, arguing that agents were acting in self-defense, even when video evidence complicated that version of events. Many members of the administration attempted to follow the same playbook after federal officials killed Pretti. But the fiction has not held up. The people who put their bodies on the line to record what was happening in Minneapolis revealed a valuable truth. The same tool that makes clicktatorship possible—the smartphone—can also be used against it.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The librarian sat me in front of a microfilm reader and brought out roll after roll of film. I stayed there for hours, squinting to decipher the archaic handwriting in the Free Negro Book, which was published annually in South Carolina before the Civil War.

The names in each year’s edition were alphabetized, but only roughly—all of the surnames starting with A came before all of the surnames starting with B, but Agee might come before Anderson, or it might come after.

I began with the 1848 edition, but there was no listing for a Henry Fordham. The same was true of the book for 1849. Same for 1850. But as I slowly made my way through the F section of the 1851 edition, I let out a shout that shattered the library’s decorous hush: “Yesssss!” Then, quickly, to the startled patrons and librarians: “I’m so sorry, excuse me, I’m so sorry.” And then, more softly: “Yes.”

On March 27, 1829, a wealthy white planter and businessman named Richard Fordham purchased four enslaved African Americans from a woman named Isabella Perman. One of them was my great-great-grandfather, a boy called Harry.

This transaction took place in Charleston, the port of entry for an estimated 40 percent of all enslaved Africans brought to toil in this country. A document recording the sale was filed with the South Carolina secretary of state several days later, on April 7. It does not say where in Charleston the sale took place—on the steps of the Old Exchange and Provost Dungeon, perhaps, or at the Cooper River docks, or in one of the thriving markets where people were bought and sold. The individuals bought by Fordham are listed as “a Negro boy named Harry and a Negro woman named Jenny and her two children named Hager and Margaret.” For the lot, Fordham paid $1,080.

Harry, whose proper name was Henry, spent 19 years as Fordham’s chattel. The young man proved to be quick of mind and good with his hands: He mastered the art of blacksmithing at the Chalmers Street Forge, which Fordham co-owned. Henry’s skills eventually made him Fordham’s de facto right-hand man at the forge. On July 10, 1848, Fordham sold “a Negro man named Henry” to Otis Mills and Co., a grain-wholesaling business with multiple warehouses near the Cooper River docks. The sale was recorded with the secretary of state seven days later. The company’s eponymous founder, one of Charleston’s richest men, went on to build the city’s most luxurious hotel, the Mills House. The price he paid for my great-great-grandfather was $2,000, a lot of money for a single Black man.

According to family lore, Henry had somehow circumvented the state’s strict law against educating the enslaved and become literate. He had also become deeply religious. Not only had he learned to read the Gospel of Jesus Christ; he’d also heard the call to preach it.

A few years after being acquired by Mills, Henry Fordham was purchased one final time—by himself, when he bought his freedom.

I’ve always known, through my family’s rich oral history, that my extraordinary great-great-grandfather obtained his liberty at some point before the Civil War. For a long time, however, my attempts to find out exactly when and how he cast off his chains ran into dead ends.

When I was growing up, it never occurred to me to go looking for my family’s history. It was already right there, all around me. My sister, Ellen, and I were born and raised in Orangeburg, 75 miles northwest of Charleston, in the house that Henry Fordham’s son—a formidable man named John Hammond Fordham—built for his family in 1903. Anchoring the corner of Boulevard and Oak Streets, the house is a characteristically southern structure—one and a half stories, with white wooden siding, two graceful bay windows, four dormers poking through the roof, and a wide wraparound front porch that serves as an auxiliary living room during the hot months.

We knew that important family talismans lay in a big, black safe that John Hammond Fordham kept in the main bedroom. It looked like a cartoon safe, the kind that the Road Runner used to drop on Wile E. Coyote’s head, and it was incredibly heavy, which is probably why it still sits there today.

When I was growing up, the safe was always closed but never locked. I was curious about everything, and so sometimes, while my grandmother was busy in the kitchen, I would peek inside. But the old, yellowed papers that I found didn’t mean anything special to me.

Once I became a journalist, I realized that my family’s house, documents, photographs, and oral history constituted an extremely rare gift. All of that material told an important story; I didn’t know what it was, but I had the sense that I was destined to find and share it. Life and career had a way of intervening, however, and for decades I put off the exploration of my family’s past.

I returned to those annals in earnest when I realized two things: First, that my family’s history vividly traced the repeated cycles in which African Americans win a greater measure of opportunity, only to have much or all of it taken away again. With the materials in my house and a bit of research—a lot of research, as it turned out—I could show this pattern in action, over two centuries. Second, I saw that our history is every African American’s history. Through slavery and emancipation, Jim Crow and civil rights, war and peace, all that Black Americans have ever wanted is a fair chance to pursue the American dream.

Family lore said that Henry may have arrived in Charleston from Barbados, one of the British islands in the Caribbean where Africans were “seasoned”—conditioned to the lash—in the sugarcane fields. When my wife, Avis, and I went on vacation to Barbados in 1996, I decided to look for traces of my family in the National Archives. We drove around for quite a while—on the wrong side of the road—until we found the place, which I remember as a graceful old building filled with natural light.

In a big reading room, we sat at a long table while helpful staff members, accustomed to visits from Americans seeking their roots, brought out materials they thought might help us with our search. A day of poring over records, however, gave up nothing more than hints and shadows. Discouraged, we went back to our hotel and I called Aunt Grace—actually one of my mother’s many first cousins—who was the family’s chief genealogist.

I had been looking for records of slave owners named Fordham, but she explained that the name hadn’t attached itself to our family until after Henry’s 1829 sale to Richard Fordham. Instead, she said, I should look for a Black woman named Jenny—the “Negro woman” who was sold at the same time as Henry. Jenny’s previous owner, Isabella Perman, had the maiden name Fell. So I should look for a woman named Jenny who had some connection with those two surnames.

We returned to the archives, and a senior researcher named Shirley Archer helped us renew our quest, bringing out reels of microfilm and precious old ledger books recording births, baptisms, and deaths. We finally found a family named Fell that had lived in Barbados in the early 19th century, in St. Philip Parish. We also found a family in the same parish named Perreman—pretty close to Perman. And we found that on November 27, 1793, an enslaved adult named Kitty Fell was baptized at St. Philip’s Church. She would have been the right age, I thought, to be Jenny’s mother.

But we could find no record of Kitty having a daughter, and no record of Kitty being sold away to Charleston. We had bits and pieces that might fit together, but we couldn’t figure out how. English planters in the Caribbean kept meticulous records of the horses they bred and raced, but they couldn’t be bothered to keep even rudimentary family histories of the human beings they claimed to own.

It was Aunt Grace who learned that Henry Fordham had been sold to Otis Mills in 1848. And I knew Henry had been free before the Civil War and emancipation, because I found his name in the 1861 Charleston city census, appended with the notation f.p.c.—“free person of color.” By then, I reasoned, he must have been a free man for some time, because the census showed that he already owned two wood-framed houses in the city. It must have taken him at least a few years to accumulate such assets.

But exactly when, in that 13-year gap between his last sale and his first appearance in the census, had he become free? I examined real-estate records, scoured the family Bible, searched archives in reading rooms and digital databases, looked everywhere I could think of—and didn’t find a clue. By the 19th century, manumission was essentially illegal in South Carolina, which did not entirely end the practice, but it meant there would be no official document recording the moment of Henry Fordham’s freedom in the secretary of state’s archives.

The South Carolina Historical Society, a private institution founded in 1855, is the first stop for researchers seeking information about the antebellum period. I visited its grand neoclassical headquarters on Charleston’s main thoroughfare, Meeting Street, several times over the years to look for anything about my great-great-grandfather that might pin down the date of his freedom. No luck.

In 2014, the society’s collection was moved across town to the College of Charleston so that the archives’ original home—a landmark 1826 structure known as the Fireproof Building—could be turned into a museum. Slowly, more records were digitized, or at least preserved on microfilm. In February 2023, I visited the collection at its present location, a hushed sanctum on the second floor of the college’s Addlestone Library, in the hopes that more of the hit-or-miss manumission records from Henry Fordham’s time might have been cataloged and made accessible.

I was overjoyed when the librarians found a folder labeled with Henry Fordham’s name—but then immediately deflated when they brought it out, because I saw that it contained only a long, speculative, and largely inaccurate account of Henry’s life, compiled by a distant relative whom I’d never met. I was already familiar with that document, and I knew it said nothing about when Henry had liberated himself.

Finally, one of the librarians suggested that I look through editions of Charleston’s Free Negro Book. I’d had no idea that such a thing existed: a yearly list of free African Americans residing in the city who had paid the state’s poll tax. It was an exercise in data collection born of paranoia. The fact that Black people outnumbered white people in South Carolina during the decades before the Civil War meant that white officials lived in constant fear of a Haiti-style Black uprising. Free African Americans were a tiny minority—more than 95 percent of Black people in the state were enslaved—but it seemed to make sense that any rebellion would be led by conspirators with independent resources and the liberty of unsupervised movement. White southerners took great pains to keep track of men and women like Henry Fordham.

I doubt I will ever be able to find out the month and the day my great-great-grandfather became free. But I can be quite sure that he was still enslaved when free African Americans were counted in 1850—and that he had become a proud, free Black man by the time the Free Negro Book was compiled in 1851.

Even after solving this mystery, I never stopped wondering about my deeper history, before the time of Henry Fordham. Who was my first African ancestor to set shackled foot on this continent? He or she had a name. He or she had a clan, a language, a culture, a faith. All of this history is forever gone.

There was nothing at all inadvertent about its disappearance. It was stolen. Slave owners in the English colonies of the New World went to great lengths to sever any ties that their captives had with the past and with one another. Enslavers’ fortunes and lives depended on being able to control the able-bodied Black men and women who outnumbered them—20, 40, 60 Black bodies crammed into slave shacks, versus maybe a dozen white family members in the big house. Our captors could not allow us to feel confident in the strength of our numbers. They wanted us to feel powerless, ungrounded, disconnected, and thus easier to dominate.

From the December 2023 issue: Lonnie G. Bunch III asks why America is afraid of Black history

I feel the absence of my deep, pre-American history. I feel it the way an amputee suffers phantom pain in a missing limb. I keep looking for what was stolen from me. And occasionally I glimpse what might be fragments of it.

When I was little, among the out-of-town visitors who would occasionally drop by to visit my grandmother and great-aunt were two women from Charleston. I don’t remember their names. What got my attention was that they spoke to each other in an incomprehensible, rapid-fire patois that definitely wasn’t English. I learned they had been speaking Gullah (also called Geechee), a creole language based on English but laden with a hodgepodge of West African vocabulary, grammar, and syntax.

Gullah is possibly a corruption of Angola, a region from which many Africans were seized. Or it might refer to the Gola people, an ethnic group living on land that is now in Liberia and Sierra Leone. If you have ever referred to peanuts as “goobers,” you are using a Gullah word that comes from the Kikongo term for “peanut,” nguba. On the islands around Charleston—including Daniel Island, where Richard Fordham had his plantation and my great-great-grandfather grew into manhood—Gullah evolved as a lingua franca that allowed enslaved Africans from different cultures and language groups to communicate. Henry almost surely would have understood every word those women who visited were saying.

Somewhere in Africa there is a city, town, or village where Henry Fordham’s progenitors lived and died for hundreds or thousands of years, where my distant relatives walk the streets today. That place exists, and I know I will never find it. Still, I can get closer than was possible even a few years ago, thanks to DNA testing.

In 2022, I mailed away a saliva sample and waited, with no real expectation of an aha moment. When the results came back, I learned that 34 percent of my DNA comes from Nigeria, 20 percent from Mali, and another 26 percent from other places up and down the west coast of Africa. That doesn’t depart from what I’d have predicted, and it doesn’t narrow things down meaningfully.

Read: 300 million letters of DNA are missing from the human genome

The remaining 20 percent of my DNA comes mostly from Germany, with a small contribution from the British Isles—again, no surprise. The fact that part of my genetic inheritance comes from Europe makes me like most Black Americans: According to a 2010 study, “an African American individual in the United States has, on average, about 75–80 percent West African ancestry and about 20–25 percent European ancestry.”

Someday, perhaps, the collective human genome will be sufficiently mapped to trace my DNA to a specific Nigerian village or English hamlet. But the truth is that race has never been a biological fact. It has always been a social construct, which allowed the powerful to justify exploitation of the powerless. The elaborate fiction of race gave Richard Fordham the “right” to purchase my great-great-grandfather, and required Henry Fordham to purchase his own freedom. And it is race and racism that have kept me from knowing the names, let alone the hopes and dreams, of Henry’s predecessors in my American history. So I begin with him.

During tanking, engineers spent several hours troubleshooting a liquid hydrogen leak in an interface used to route the cryogenic propellant into the rocket&#39;s core stage, putting them behind in the countdown. Attempts to resolve the issue involved stopping the flow of liquid hydrogen into the core stage, allowing the interface to warm up for the seals to reseat, and adjusting the flow of the propellant.  

Teams successfully filled all tanks in both the core stage and interim cryogenic propulsion stage before a team of five was sent to the launch pad to finish Orion closeout operations. Engineers conducted a first run at terminal countdown operations during the test, counting down to approximately 5 minutes left in the countdown, before the ground launch sequencer automatically stopped the countdown due to a spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate.

There&#39;s always at least 1 hydrogen valve issue. Perhaps they should redesign their valves?

It&#39;s also a microcosm of the Challenger disaster o-ring failure. :(

Freezing temperatures in Florida. Leaking o-rings. Fuel leak.

For the record, I fully expected the launch to be delayed. just Artemis things.

Old boss once told me, he&#39;d set up a complete call center for a US client in India, for less than he paid any one of his engineers, maybe 10 years before he and I worked together.

Just move to India already, Google. It&#39;s cheaper, and no burdensome regulations.  You&#39;ll be free to exploit your workers far more than you do here.

I mean, that&#39;s Google&#39;s purpose, right?  Pay as least as possible for everything, including people and talent?

is generally only a thing in the United States. It&#39;s an alien concept in the rest of the world outside the USA. It&#39;s a lot harder to fire people for no reason in the rest of the world.

The whole employment-at-will thing was a big driver of H-1B visas. Bosses don&#39;t like the employment laws in the rest of the world they crave the power to fire someone for any reason or no reason whatsoever. So they import bodies to the USA so they are subjected to the shitty employment laws the United States has.

You do get the same practice basically only in the 3rd world. The US is a fossile in many regards.

That&#39;s the effect of Republicans with an Industrial Revolution mindset that revolves around only catering to the wealthy.

Tammany Hall was dissolved in 1967, around the time that the Republican and Democratic parties finished switching places ideologically. [studentsofhistory.com] It&#39;s right there in the Wikipedia article you cited.

If you want to claim Rs and Ds are the same, you&#39;ll need an example that&#39;s more robust.

Oh yeah, anyone who&#39;s not as stupid as the average MAGA.

Fully endorse this.  If they want to hire Indians, for whatever reasons, just have offices in India!  Instead of uprooting your employees from their homes in India, where they have families, relatives and others who can support them, just have your offices there.  No need to struggle w/ visas, nor pay them US salaries (which they&#39;d have to if they were to afford the living costs in the US).  Pay them what is standard there, and set up the operations there accordingly

I suspect a large majority of the money spent towards open source is in the form of support contracts, yes, but large contracts paid by large companies to large projects.  The problem is that a majority of the *projects* are small, often single person, and *those* do not have a good way of funding their work.  There is no web of small companies paying small projects keeping the greater open source community healthy, and so smaller projects have to look to other ways to fund work.

AI is dumb, it cannot innovate.  Without humans creating new training data, it will fall behind.   AI must find a way to avoid being fatal to the host it feeds on.

Does it degrade or stay stagnant.Can do both, either, or also neither.
It&#39;s a complication that has to be accounted for, though.

It can reduce perplexity, but that can very much be a not good thing.

What I can say, is that OSS survived just fine before bullshit like enshittified revenue models become popular, and it will survive the AIpocalypse.
Will OSS change? Yes.

I&#39;m also unclear on what &quot;documentation traffic&quot; and &quot;bug reports&quot; has to do with a project earning money. Is this about seeing advertising? Because I&#39;m not going to contribute to a project if that requires me to look at advertising.

If the project is funded through donations, if the donation link is never seen by human eyeballs; the donation link never gets clicked.

The given example of Tailwind monetized by having the base framework be free, but having a collection of tools including a Component Library be licensed. So if an LLM is pumping out examples rather than the docs, the user isn&#39;t going to see the value add subscription.

If a project has advertising and you see it, then you are already contributing. But if the LLM is has to be &quot;

&quot;Open-source maintainers monetize through documentation visits&quot;

Open source is monetized through documentation visits? Not only most open source programmers know how to use an adblocker, but I also saw very few (thanks god!) documentation pages with ads. What are these people talking about?

That was that website where I couldn&#39;t answer questions in an area regarding which I am an expert, unless I had a certain amount of &quot;reputation&quot;. Rest in peace.

&quot;One proposed fix is a &quot;Spotify for open source&quot; model where AI platforms redistribute subscription revenue to maintainers based on package usage.&quot;

Proposed fix for what?  And what incentive would motivate &quot;AI platform&quot; developers to involve themselves with &quot;subscription revenue to maintainers&quot;?

Open source, in particular GPL, is communistic, do we assume AI is as well?  Because it sure doesn&#39;t seem like it.  And why does open source funding need to be fixed?  RMS created the GPL to compel others to give sour

It&#39;s more accurate to say that the entire concept of libraries and frameworks is now obsolete. Why bother building and maintaining libraries of tested code when you can just generate it from scratch every time? The only reason we used libraries was to keep things maintainable and reusable. If you can just get an LLM to generate bespoke code on demand, and have it do exactly what you want and nothing else, then every piece of software can be a snowflake... unique and fragile, but infinitely replaceable. It&#39;s

1) We have needed a more sustainable financing model for FOSS that matters for quite a while now.

2) &quot;Vibe &quot;coding&quot; will not matter in the long run. Its results are just too abysmally bad. People still need a few years to understand as those of low / no skills are always late in understanding the blatantly obvious. (Dunning & Kruger have an explanation for that ...)

I don&#39;t know of a single company sharing proprietary code. So where will vibe be if there is no code to scan?

On another note. A while back people were worried that open source licensed code would make it in commercial licensed code  and would create some legal issues. Isn&#39;t this also an issue with vibe generated code?

To me it seems that it&#39;s more of an issue that vibe creates a problem for proprietary code. GPL to vide makes vibe code into GPL. Share and share alike.

I love pulling a repo and having Claude explain it and figure out how to run it.It used to take forever to get an unfamiliar repo to work because Linux.This is actually one of the best uses of LLMs, getting someone else&#39;s software to work on my machine.The fear of getting knee deep in the weeds because I don&#39;t understand the repo completely, is now gone.

They&#39;re just lying because they really are doing it for the first reason you pointed out. What they should do is recognize that some of their content works fine as an audio experience and start selling audio only ads to play when delivering content in that way. Even if the audio ads don&#39;t make them as much money, the savings from not having to delivery video streams to people who aren&#39;t watching the video should make up for it.This.Also, background does not necessarily mean &quot;screen off&quot;.  It can also mean &quot;floating window&quot;, where you&#39;re still seeing the visual ad content and the video content.  Yeah, users might then swipe it off where they don&#39;t have to see the ad, but either way, they&#39;re hearing it.  And if YouTube can&#39;t figure out how to monetize that, this shows a real lack of imagination.

If I was alphabet I would be extremely careful to make sure I don&#39;t prefer my own browser.  That is.. unless I wanted the government to break me up.

Yeah, just like what happened to Microsoft when they were found to be a monopoly because they favored their own browser over any other.

We&#39;re so fortunate that they were broken up into multiple companies!

For Microsoft, that would be the wrong way.  Instead of making many Microsofts, the govts should go the other way, and make zero!

A judge already  ruled on that monopoly position and didn&#39;t force them to divest from Chrome. [bbc.com] Why change strategies if there isn&#39;t punishment?

He refused to grant government lawyers their request for a Google breakup that would include a spin-off of Chrome, the world&#39;s most popular browser.

You can smell the desperation as they fail to keep people from blocking ads. They&#39;re just so so so so greedy and grasping that they piss themselves into a frenzy if they think they&#39;re losing ad views.

Remember, if you go to the bathroom during a commercial, you&#39;re breaking the implicit contract to watch every ad they show you, or you&#39;ll be STEALING from the advertisers. (Some ad exec actually said something to that effect but I can&#39;t find the quote.)

A Google spokesperson told Android Authority that the platform &quot;updated the experience to ensure consistency,&quot;

TRANSLATION: &quot;Fuck you, you&#39;ll watch our ads or we&#39;ll cripple your browser.&quot;

I find few things on my phone more annoying, than when I close the YouTube app, it keeps playing the video. No, when I close the app, the video needs to go away. Period.

Can&#39;t you just turn off &quot;background app refresh&quot; (or its Android equivalent) for the YouTube app?

I disable that for most apps as a matter of course.

And that&#39;s what really pisses me off.  It&#39;s not a function YouTube had to create and support, it&#39;s a function of the device itself, and they prevent it from working.

Firefox on Android with the Video Background Play Fix [mozilla.org] extension still works, and probably won&#39;t stop working.

Got that last week suddenly, Brave browser on Android,Checking with ChatGPT, it proposed a few things, the one that worked: load the page in desktop mode.I could then switch off my screen and continue listening.

Then i realised last night that Brave might have done something, or Youtube reversed that function ?I no longer need to load the page in desktop mode, i can switch off my screen, continues to play.

If you wonder why i need this, i listen to stuff while falling asleep.

This is how it has been for YEARS!  They didn&#39;t just do it.  Maybe it&#39;s a new thing on Android, but they&#39;ve had their dicks up iPhone users&#39; asses for years.

I counter with, I would think the board of any public corporation would have a succession plan ready, say for instance there is a health emergency with the CEO.  Or more likely the CEO does something bad and needs to be removed.   The response to this should be &quot;Enrique Lores has decided to leave HP, the acting CEO is Stacy Smith who is fully capable of fulfilling the role.&quot;

From what I have seen over the years, public boards of directors are utterly useless.  They provide almost zero oversight.  They approv

Who cares what happens to HP, I assumed they had gone bankrupt already?

UBlock does a pretty good job of blocking PayPal&#39;s ads.And if you buy an HP computer (or for that matter, ANY Windows computer), the first step is to wipe the hard drive and install a fresh, clean copy of Windows directly from Microsoft. NONE of the computer manufacturer&#39;s branded software, ads any value whatsoever.

If he&#39;s abruptly stepping down as HP CEO, that really upsets the apple cart. And that&#39;s gotta be tanking HP stock, at least in the short term.

Seriously, common professional courtesy is to at least offer a few weeks transition. For a CEO, a few months is more typical.

If this were normal software I would agree with you, but it&#39;s not. This is Adobe software. Adobe is infamously known for doing incredibly dumb shit in the name of &quot;support&quot; such as ring fencing installation of software to specific Windows versions without any good compatibility reason.

&quot;There&#39;s no reason to think Animate won&#39;t just fail to install completely arbitrarily on some upcoming Windows release.&quot;

So they may have to keep old windows around if they want to use this old program. Or they could switch to something from a less terrible company. They have some years of support before they have to do that. Adobe might even change their mind by then.

Adobe has a history of arbitrarily ring-fencing applications to specific windows versions. Its a local application which means that what you have today will function with the build of Windows you have today. That may not be the case next year where you may find shit just fails to install with an error saying it&#39;s not compatible with your version of Windows. Adobe has a history of this dumbfuckery.

I have tried using this shit. The product bugs, updates that often broke things and it being somehow plus the software was so bad it just made you more angry at Adobe in whole new ways.

It&#39;s like my memories of Flash were wrong because this made me think it really sucked... you expect newer software to NOT to be so bad it not only makes you hate it but it also kills positive memories of past versions as well!

Gimp is closer to Photoshop since the last major version, but it&#39;s still very very far away in every category and the only way it&#39;s superior is you don&#39;t have to deal with Adobe. That&#39;s not nothing but it&#39;s also not enough.

In particular I was hoping that the interface would improve when they introduced non-destructive editing, but no. It&#39;s still grossly harder to do things which have been simple in Photoshop since early days.

Anybody burned by this insanely short announcement delay will try to stay away from Adobe now. Long-term assured tool availability is critical for professional work.

Ah, I see it is March 2027. Still way too short. Apparently, Adobe has stopped understanding its customers.

The last remaining U.S.–Russia nuclear arms–control treaty, New START, expires on Feb. 5—and, with less than 48 hours to go, President Donald Trump hasn’t done anything about it.

Asked about the impending deadline in his New York Times interview last month, Trump replied, “If it expires, it expires. We’ll do a better agreement,” maybe one that brings in China—which has a growing nuclear arsenal—as a participant.

If past is precedent, a new treaty would take at least a year to negotiate; if China takes part, something that has never happened before, it would take many years.

In the meantime, we may well see the renewal of a nuclear arms race, reversing a trend of the past half-century. The stunning thing is that, by all accounts, Trump and his advisers haven’t so much as held a conversation about the possibility or its implications for U.S. policy or the safety of the world.

It’s worth recalling that when Trump scuttled the Iran nuclear deal back during his first term as president, he said that he—master of the “art of the deal”—would goad Tehran into accepting a “better” deal. This never happened. There is no reason to believe, especially given Washington’s tense relations with both Moscow and Beijing, that he’ll bring about a superior substitute for New START either.

New START—the acronym stands for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty—was signed by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in February 2011, as a follow-on to previous accords, START and START II, which George H.W. Bush had signed with Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, respectively. The Obama–Medvedev treaty went further than the earlier accords, forcing each side to cut its long-range nuclear arsenals to 1,550 warheads—a 30 percent reduction from START II’s limits, a 75 percent cut from START’s. It also allowed very intrusive on-site inspections of each side’s arsenals to verify that they were in compliance.

New START was set to expire after 10 years. Obama envisioned negotiating, well before then, a follow-on accord that would make still deeper cuts, including short- and medium-range missiles. But it never happened. The U.S. had long ago dismantled almost all of those weapons, for good reason, while Russia retained about 2,000, which it wanted to keep to counter NATO’s superiority in conventional armies (just as, during much of the Cold War, the U.S. and NATO kept thousands of nukes in Western Europe to counter the Soviet Union’s conventional edge). Plus, after Putin returned as Russia’s president and started rattling sabers in eastern Ukraine and elsewhere, the political climate for arms control chilled.

So, as Obama left office in January 2021, New START, his main legacy in nuclear arms reduction, was about to expire. But the treaty did allow a one-time five-year extension, and his successor, Joe Biden—who had been Obama’s vice president and, before then, a longtime senator well-versed in nuclear issues—quickly called Putin to sign the extension. Diplomatic channels were still very much open (Putin wouldn’t launch his full-scale invasion of Ukraine for another year); both leaders saw it in their interests to keep a cap on a possible arms race.

Now five years have passed, and here we are. Putin recently proposed a quick accord—it could be drawn up and signed in very short order—to extend New START’s ceilings on nuclear-armed missiles, bombers, and warheads for another year. Trump has not replied, at least not in public.

Here’s why this is important: A major purpose of arms control is to put boundaries on the threat—to keep each side from spinning and acting upon “worst-case scenarios” of how many nukes the other side might build and, therefore, how many nukes it needs to build in response.

For instance, in the late 1950s, the intelligence branch of the U.S. Air Force estimated that the Soviet Union would have 500 intercontinental ballistic missiles by 1962, maybe by as soon as 1961. By contrast, the U.S. would have just 65 ICBMs. In other words, there would soon be a “missile gap.” As a result, the Pentagon proposed, and Congress readily approved, our own crash buildup of missiles (which would be built by the U.S. Air Force).

Then, in 1960, photos taken above the USSR, first by U-2 spy planes and then by Discoverer spy satellites, revealed a different story. Independent intelligence analysts at the CIA estimated that the Soviets would have just 50 ICBMs in the next couple of years. In reality, the Soviets turned out to have just four ICBMs. There was a missile gap, but very much in the United States’ favor.

However, by this time, the Pentagon had already embarked on its crash missile buildup. Air Force officers were still arguing they needed 2,000 ICBMs over the long haul. White House aides to President John F. Kennedy argued that the new intelligence data suggested the nation could get by with just 600. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara told Kennedy that, as a political compromise, to keep the Joint Chiefs of Staff from rebelling, he needed 1,000. Kennedy, who at the time was inclined to side with his Cabinet secretaries, approved 1,000.

As a result, the Soviets, seeing this American buildup, responded with a very real buildup of their own. Had there been better information, a more bounded threat, the arms race of the missile age might have been squelched before it took off.

The parallels with current times aren’t precise. Intelligence analysts don’t have to rely so much on guesswork. Even without on-site inspection, they can learn or infer a great deal—almost everything—from high-resolution satellites, communications intercepts, and a wide range of technical and human sources. (In 2023, Putin stopped allowing on-site inspections, but the U.S. still has very high confidence that he hasn’t deployed more nuclear weapons than New START allows.)

Still, one can easily imagine even today’s officers and analysts with vested interests or hawkish inclinations arguing that, freed from the restraints of New START, the Russians could build many more missiles and warheads—and, therefore, we need to build many more to match. It’s even easier to imagine Russian officers and analysts, who tend to be more paranoid than ours, doing the same. A stepped-up arms race is likely indeed.

This action-reaction complex stems not just from a psychological need to appear equal (though that is part of what goes on). There’s a tangible element here too. The planners at U.S. Strategic Command—and probably their counterparts in Russia—maintain a “counterforce” strategy. Most of our missiles are aimed at their missiles—and, most likely, vice versa. The warheads on our missiles also have sufficient accuracy and explosive power to destroy or disable the Russian missiles in their blast-hardened silos—and, again, most likely vice versa.

By the logic of this strategy, if the Russians build more missiles, we have to build more missiles too—so that we’re still able to hit all of the targets.

This is where the new dimension of arms-race scenarios comes into focus—China. When Obama and Medvedev signed New START 15 years ago, China barely had enough nuclear weapons to warrant attention. Now they have about 600; within a few years, they’ll approach parity with the U.S. and Russia. Nobody quite knows why; Chinese officers, who used to write a fair amount about nuclear strategy, have gone silent. Whatever the motive, if China is seen as an adversary, and if counterforce is still a centerpiece of U.S. nuclear strategy, then we don’t have enough warheads to cover all of the targets.

This is why some defense analysts say it’s just as well that New START is expiring. They say that the U.S. needs more nuclear weapons than New START permits.

But this is where the discussion should begin, not end. Do we really need to be able to destroy all of the Russian and Chinese missile sites? This is a two-part question: First, what are the chances that we’ll face not just war but all-out nuclear war against Russia and China simultaneously? Second, do we need to have the ability to knock out all of their missile sites in order to deter nuclear war?

Deterring nuclear war is the aim here. If the plan is to fight, maybe win a nuclear war, how does that game go? Would we launch a first strike against Russia and China? If we did, and we aimed to destroy their missile silos, would they launch the missiles on warning, before our warheads struck—in which case, they’d inflict more damage on us than might otherwise be the case? Finally, there’s “nuclear winter“—the theory that a certain number of nuclear explosions (the calculations vary, but some are as low as a few hundred) will ignite so many fires and kick up so much dust that much of life on Earth will end. There is no winner in this war.

These are controversies that have gone on for many decades. In previous administrations, the Pentagon, StratCom, the National Security Council, and sometimes the president himself, have engaged in this discussion. They have published a Nuclear Posture Review, in classified and unclassified forms, that spelled out the policy.

Trump has not done this. It is very unlikely that he or anyone else at a high level has discussed this at all, or is even aware of the dilemmas and imponderables. Nor is there likely to be a discussion of this sort in the next few years. In the meantime, Trump and Putin should sign a one-page document extending the terms of New START. It’s an imperfect accord, but it’s better than crying “Havoc!” and letting slip the dogs of a nuclear arms race.

On Sept. 15, my family and I arrived for our routine Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in appointment at the New York City immigration courthouse. My 6-year-old daughter was wearing her school uniform and her backpack. My husband and I planned to drop her off at school afterward.

Instead, the three of us were arrested and detained.

ICE officials held us at the courthouse all day with no food before transferring us to temporary housing for the night. At around 3 the next morning, officers woke us and put us on a commercial flight. Against our will, we were flown across the country to the family detention center in Dilley, Texas. The next two months we spent there were a living nightmare.

When my family and I had fled Colombia in October 2022, we believed that the United States would be a place of refuge. Back home, we had been targeted by an armed guerrilla group—the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—and over time, the death threats and physical violence became impossible to hide from. We had no choice but to flee for our lives.

On our way to the U.S., armed smugglers confined my daughter and me in a guarded safe house for days. I was forced to cook and clean for them, along with the other women. I was warned to watch my daughter closely so she would not be kidnapped. Only after being passed between multiple vehicles and handlers were we finally able to cross the border in November 2022.

After we arrived in the United States, we built a new life in Queens, New York. My daughter started school. She enjoyed art class and adored her teacher. She loved our cat. She was happy.

We applied for asylum. We were denied. But the dangers we faced in Colombia had not ended. From abroad, we learned that my husband was still receiving threats.

Because of my experience in Mexico, we then filed an application for a T visa, a form of humanitarian protection for victims of human trafficking. While that application was pending, we continued to comply with immigration authorities because we believed that following the law mattered.

That is why, even after being warned that attending our Sept. 15 check-in could lead to detention, we went anyway. But our compliance did not matter to ICE.

After we were taken to the Dilley detention center, my husband was held in a separate area from my daughter and me. Starting the first day, officers began using family separation as a threat. We were told that if we refused deportation, we would be fined $1,000 a day. We were warned that if we continued to resist deportation in any way, my husband and I could face criminal charges and our daughter could be taken from us. The officers also threatened to put us all on separate deportation flights.

The conditions at the facility only intensified the horror. People were constantly sick. Bathrooms were filthy. The food was often inedible, and the water was discolored. My daughter began losing weight because she could not eat.

Every Wednesday, deportation flights left for Colombia. Every Wednesday, we waited in fear for our names to be called. Officers unsuccessfully tried to deport us twice.

The constant threats took a toll on my health. I began experiencing regular panic attacks driven by the fear that my family would be separated or deported. I also suffer from chronic migraines, which worsened over time because the facility would not provide the medication I needed. I lived for weeks with steady pain, fainting spells, nosebleeds, and vision changes that made it difficult to function.

My daughter’s health deteriorated even faster.

At Dilley, she went from full-time school to just one hour of instruction a day. She contracted a cough, which only got worse. She cried at night and asked when we would go back to our apartment in New York. She asked about her teacher and our cat every day. My daughter was once an extroverted, healthy, and happy first grader. But at Dilley, she regressed behaviorally, wetting herself after years without accidents and begging to breastfeed again despite being 6 years old. When we sought mental health care, a psychiatrist blamed me for her distress and accused me of poor parenting.

A facility staff member accidentally struck her eye with a mop. Blood came from her eye. At the medical center, the injury was falsely recorded as a fall. Despite my daughter’s continued complaints of blurred vision, light sensitivity, and hearing problems, doctors dismissed us.

After over a month of delays, an ophthalmologist who evaluated my daughter warned that she may have suffered trauma to her eye and needed further evaluation, as well as a referral to an ENT specialist because the injury could also be affecting her hearing. My husband and I repeatedly begged the facility to provide this care, but officers insisted that it was not their responsibility—even though the injury had been caused by a staff member.

In the days before our deportation, my husband and daughter began experiencing stomach illnesses. Both suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. My husband was placed in the medical unit. He was pale and visibly unwell. For a moment, I believed that because he was so sick, ICE would not deport us.

On Wednesday, Nov. 12, ICE officers entered our room and ordered us to pack, saying we were leaving that day. My husband was taken out of the medical unit to be deported. My daughter was still coughing and vomiting. When I explained that they were too sick to travel, the agents accused me of inventing my husband’s illness, refused to let me call our lawyers, and denied my request to see a doctor. Despite my daughter’s untreated eye injury and serious cough, the officers insisted she was fine and said her health was not their responsibility.

Nearly 10 ICE agents with chains and handcuffs surrounded us and cautioned that we could leave “the easy way or the hard way.” My daughter was terrified. When she saw the chains, she screamed and cried. Officers again refused to let us contact our lawyers. There was no real choice but to comply.

They put us on a bus, along with one other woman, to transport us to Louisiana for our deportation flight. About an hour into the drive, the bus stopped, and dozens of men in chains and handcuffs got on, along with another handcuffed woman, who looked at my child and asked aloud how anyone could allow a little girl to witness this. My daughter began to cry again.

The bus ride to Louisiana was over 18 hours. We were not able to use the bathroom the entire time. At 9 a.m., while we were still on the bus, I fainted and hit my head. After I begged for medical help, the paramedic who evaluated me suggested I go to a medical center. But ICE officers refused, telling me I had no right to see a doctor.

My daughter also began to vomit on the bus that morning. For hours, despite our requests, the officers refused to give her food or water.

She received no food or water until later that afternoon, on our flight back to Colombia. I had pleaded with the officers not to put us on the plane, explaining that the pressure would worsen our health conditions, but they did not care.

My daughter vomited the entire flight. When we landed in Bogotá, she was still vomiting and coughing and was severely dehydrated. She wanted to know why we were not in New York, but I had no answers—only fear.

Today we live in hiding in Colombia. Armed groups still control our region. We cannot safely access medical care.

My daughter continues to suffer from serious vision and hearing problems but has not been able to see a specialist. Her stomach issues also have not improved, and a doctor in Colombia has diagnosed her with a severe bacterial infection. I continue to suffer from chronic migraines and anxiety, without medication. My husband and I are terrified every day that we will be murdered and our daughter will be kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

My daughter is only 6 years old. She should not know chains or handcuffs or the terror of her family being torn apart. She should never have been swept off the streets of New York or locked in a detention facility for two months. She should be in school in the United States, playing with her friends and receiving the medical care she needs.

Instead, ICE treated us like animals. Officers intimidated, restrained, and deported us without regard for our humanity. Our basic rights were violated, with no accountability or justice. My daughter is traumatized and cries every day.

We don’t know what our future will hold. But we are grateful for the time we had in America, and we will keep fighting for a better future for our daughter.

There is a uniquely American kink that holds that what really matters in terms of presidential policies and conduct is the question of whether something is “legal” as opposed to moral. In an essay for the Boston Review headlined “The Moral Stupefaction of the American Public,” professor Joseph Margulies argues that if conduct is deemed permissible simply because a mediocre law student can pen a mediocre legal memo justifying it, the country is in far deeper trouble than it presently comprehends. On this week’s Amicus podcast, he explained to Dahlia Lithwick that the inclination to fetishize that which can be justified legally has a way of opening the door to atrocities that cannot be tolerated. Their conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: In your article, you draw out the fact that lawyers are extremely uneasy about invoking the language of morality, because morality is either too malleable or just sanctimonious and annoying. I think your point is that the law—disaggregated from morality—becomes an endless series of hollow CYA memos to be deployed by any given administration to justify absolutely anything from torture at Gitmo to blowing up fishing vessels in the Caribbean?

Joseph Margulies: Yes. And that which is taking place in Minneapolis—and not simply in Minneapolis, but most pointedly in Minneapolis—ought not be framed as: “Is that lawful?” It ought to be framed as: “Is that right?” Are we going to allow a masked, heavily armed secret police force to march through the city all but unchecked, and checked only by the voluntary surveillance—to the extent they are checked—by plain citizens at their peril? A secret police force that, at least it appears at this point, enjoys absolute impunity?

Those are profoundly moral questions. Those are moral judgements. Have we lost the capacity to say this is simply wrong? That this is a grotesque obscenity and cannot be allowed to continue?

This is no longer simply a question of, “Is it a violation of the 10th Amendment?” That’s what they’re litigating in front of Judge Menendez. Or, “Is ICE violating judicial orders?” Answer: “Yes, there’s 96 of them.” The lawyers are fighting that out. Stop it. This is a horrible, grotesque, and ongoing wrong, and that’s the level at which we need to engage.

Why is it that we substitute what I call our legal voice for our moral voice? This is a country that purports to worship, and I use that term advisedly, the rule of law. We tend to believe that legality establishes rightness, establishes legitimacy. So when a question is posed: “Can they do that?” The answer is usually given in terms of: “Yes, of course, it’s all perfectly legal.” Over time, we lose the capacity to render moral objections, even when what is being done is unspeakably grotesque, because we simply don’t engage these muscles.

I read your piece with my lawyer glasses on, and two objections arose for me. One is that morality, as you and I both know, is not just subjective and inchoate, morality was also used to justify segregation—the anti-miscegenation laws were rooted in “morality.” That means, in a good sense, that morality evolves—that which was considered immoral is now urgently moral. But also, there can’t be any broad agreement about what is moral. What we like about the law, particularly in America, is the story we tell about the Framers creating a church of the law, then creating a religious document that is the Constitution, and then agreeing on certain principles that are legal and not moral. When I read your piece, while I agreed emphatically with it, I found myself getting stuck on the point of: How are we ever going to come to some kind of consensus or scientific agreement about what is moral? How should we think about the fact that what is moral today is egregiously immoral in 10 years’ time?

The myth is that by writing it down in a Constitution, we will achieve some consensus, and the myth is that that consensus will be desirable, that it will be reflective of society’s best impulses. You have an argument, I have an argument, and the debate goes no further. Lawyers seem to disagree, but lawyers in the Justice Department, or lawyers in the Trump administration or the Bush administration before that, say: “We have our document that says this is good,” and that’s just going to have to be enough. Unfortunately, if you engage only in “law-speak,” you’re done. You have nothing to say, unless you want to hold up an opposing memo.

The best example of this is the memos that John Yoo wrote that purported to justify torture. The Supreme Court calls it torture. Let’s just call it that. What we are talking about is strapping a person, with his head lowered on an inclined board, with his face covered, and then pouring water up his nose and down his throat, and holding him there until he breathes water, to bring him within sight of his own death. That is the purpose of waterboarding. You are deliberately bringing him within sight, so that he believes that he is about to die. It’s that moment of sheer terror. That’s what waterboarding is. And doing it over, and over, and over again, 86 times in my client’s case. Well, according to those memos, not only is it not torture, it’s not illegal. “I have a document that says so!”

If they can always write that, and they can always write that, then this pretense, this myth that the law will settle disputes in a fair and neutral way, is just gobbledygook and we shouldn’t pretend otherwise. And those lawyers who, or those law students who think, “I went into the law because it’s certain, it’s definite”—well, get over yourself.

I’m hearing what feels like your peak frustration with the “John Yoo special”: As long as it’s not organ failure, it’s not torture. The critique I’m hearing here is that any lawyer, any 1L with a Westlaw account, could magic up a document to justify anything. But the flip of it, of course, is that we are living in a moment where it’s really essential to know what is legal. And as you’re noting, judges around the country are drawing very firm lines in the sand and saying, “No! That’s unlawful, that’s illegal.” In other words, the thing that you are most worried about is also the thing that is saving us.

We have had district court judges and appellate court judges around the country, out on the hustings, facing death threats, and threats of impeachment, but nonetheless very clearly saying, “No. What you’re doing is unlawful.” So you’re not saying that that is a pointless exercise, that the pushback is futile because none of this has meaning. You’re saying something subtler than that. Right?

When you are trying to bend the will of society to reflect a different reality, trying to achieve a different vision for the world, the law has a role. Going into court, going to Congress, going to your statehouses—law has a role. But what we also know from decades of experience is that the law cannot play its role alone. You must have a popular movement behind it, that speaks in a moral voice, and leverages that moral voice, then lawyers who work with that community can translate that moral voice into a set of legal claims. What matters is the existence of that moral claim, that moral voice. If all you had in Minneapolis were a bunch of lawyers going into court and saying, “This violates the 10th Amendment!” you would not get whatever movement we are going to have. What we are seeing is because there are tens of thousands of people, ordinary citizens, ordinary folks who do not think of themselves as rabble-rousers or activists, who are appalled and who are waking up and are registering this in their moral voice: I will not allow this to happen. This is wrong and I’m gonna brave 20-below weather.

I love what you’re saying, because you are not, in fact, unbraiding the law from morality. You’re actually tethering them more closely together.

I don’t know what the folks who are out there in Minneapolis are thinking exactly. Whether they are defending legal rights or a thing they call the Fourth Amendment or the First Amendment. I don’t know whether they can recite the language of the Fourth Amendment. I don’t know whether some of them are making purely moral claims, that “This is an obscenity, and I’m not going to let this happen. You are murdering my neighbors. You are shooting my friends in the back. I’m not going to let you do that.” There may be some combination of both legal and moral claims here, because we are trained to think in legal terms. They may think: “I’m not going to let you do that, and the way I’m going to keep that from happening is to protest, and I’ve got a First Amendment right to protest.” We reflexively, unfortunately, think in these kinds of legal terms, but my point in this piece is that we let the dominance of law-speak gradually silence our moral voice.

You had another chillingly prescient piece in the Boston Review back in September of 2021, which feels like a million years ago. The title of the piece was “9/11 Forever.” The point was that our failure to reckon with the legacy of what happened to the law after 9/11 is absolutely the reason we are living in the slipstream of that today. If we had not been willing to tolerate the things we did to the law after 9/11 in the name of safety, or national security, what we tolerated in terms of torture and cruelty, and surveillance, and the conception of privacy that we gave away, and border security as this existential question about national survival. You wrote about all of those things as the price we were willing to pay to feel safe at the time. And a key element of that architecture was the notion that we were in a “war.” That the war on terror hoovered up the language of war instead of crime, and moved us into a world where as long as you could call it a “war,” everything would be OK. That’s the move?

That’s the move. And now in the Trump administration they have decided to declare war, which is just a rhetorical step, against an endless stream of “others.” None of the real horrors that took place post- 9/11, and those taking place now, could have been possible without a thorough embrace of demonization, without a willingness to cast some people outside the sphere of human regard. “We can do what we want with that person because they are not us. I do not see them in me. I do not see myself in them. ” That’s what demonization is. That’s the first move.

What the Bush administration did so well is to begin with that and then articulate a legal framework to justify it. Law-speak that says, “We don’t need to stop with this demonizing language. That can exist as the context, the background, but given that we all recognize that those who perpetrated this are not us and are monsters, we are allowed to do certain things, and here’s the law that shows it’s OK.”

Nobody is as good at demonizing as Donald Trump. He is the master of it. This is his worldview. “Those who are opposed to me are subhuman. They are not of my species.” Once you embrace the idea that there is a category of people whose existence threatens who I am, and that I can do whatever I want with them, and I call that war, or I call that terrorism—it doesn’t really matter what you call it, but you can always find a lawyer to cloak it in law. That’s the easiest part. The hard part is convincing people that the Mexican immigrant who has been your neighbor for 40 years and who makes your economy run, convincing people that that person is a monster. That’s the hard part, and that’s where his success is. And that’s 9/11 forever. That’s what they’ve achieved. The more you do this, the easier it gets. The more often you repeat this, the easier it becomes.

Not every example of this ends in the same place, but we all know where that dark alley ends. That dark alley ends in all the most vicious pogroms and genocides and holocausts that the world has ever known. They all start with this move. And this is what Trump is doing and he’s really good at it. And he’s got a lot of people who agree.

President Donald Trump on Monday escalated his rhetoric against the American electoral system, telling his former FBI deputy director and serial podcaster Dan Bongino that he wants to “nationalize” American elections in 15 “crooked” states. “These people were brought to our country to vote, and they vote illegally,” Trump said. “And it’s amazing the Republicans aren’t tougher on it. The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting in at least 15 places.’ ” I too used to think we should nationalize our elections, though not for the insane reasons Donald Trump offers. It is Trump himself who convinced me that I was wrong.

American elections are hyperdecentralized, as they are run on the state, and mostly county, level. States have ultimate responsibility for voter registration rolls, the kind of machinery used to conduct balloting, the rules for contesting elections, laws prescribing how candidates qualify to appear on the ballot, and much more. Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution provides that states, through their legislatures, get to set the times, places, and manners of conducting congressional elections, “but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.” Congress sometimes exercises that power to override state rules. For example, a federal statute requires that members of Congress are elected from single-member districts, not from larger districts where multiple members of Congress could be elected.

Given that authority in what is known as the “elections clause” of the Constitution, Congress could do much more to nationalize elections, for example setting uniform rules for voter registration, the approval of voting machinery, and potentially much more. For a long time I thought Congress should use that power to set up a system of national nonpartisan election administration. Indeed, that was the central argument in my 2012 book, The Voting Wars.

If you look around the world at advanced democracies from Australia to Canada, they have an independent governmental body in charge all national elections. The body imposes uniform standards for registration, ballot access, voting machinery, and much more. One can walk into a polling place in Ottawa or Vancouver and have virtually the same experience.

These nonpartisan election administrators are headed by a civil servant or group that does not answer to the government. They and their workers have allegiance to the integrity of the election system, not to any political actor. In contrast, in the United States partisan actors play important roles in our election process, such as secretaries of state who run for office as Democrats or Republicans.

In The Voting Wars, I argued that by joining other advanced democracies we could decrease the amount of partisan fighting and litigation over election rules, increase the competence of election administration, and assure we have a system run with integrity and fair access to voting.

Donald Trump has caused me to abandon this argument. As I wrote in the New York Times last summer, when the president tried to impose his authority over various aspects of American elections via an executive order: “What I had not factored into my thinking was that centralizing power over elections within the federal government could be dangerous in the hands of a president not committed to democratic principles.” At this point, American democracy is too weak and fragile to have centralized power over elections in the hands of a federal government that could be coerced or coopted by a president hell-bent, like Trump, on election subversion. Courts have ruled that parts of Trump’s executive order are unconstitutional because the president has no role to play in the administration of elections.

Trump’s comments on nationalizing elections ironically prove the point that we should not nationalize elections. He apparently wants to target the administration at blue states, doing who-knows-what to make it harder for people to vote for Democrats. He desperately fears a Congress controlled by Democrats that could check his and his administration’s power. As he did in 2020, when he unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the results of the fair presidential election that he lost to Joe Biden, Trump hangs it all on voter fraud. His comments to Bongino about noncitizens voting, just like his comments about mail-in balloting, show Trump as either a liar or delusional. The amount of election fraud of this type is extremely rare. We know it because states, including red ones like Georgia—where Trump’s administration recently raided election offices in a serious threat to the 2026 vote—have gone hunting for fraud and found very little.

The Supreme Court provides another reason for not nationalizing our elections. The court could soon fully embrace that “unitary executive” theory that there can be no exercise of executive power by the federal government that ultimately does not report to the president. (It’s an argument with an exception likely to be applied to the United States Federal Reserve, in order to protect the value of the justices’ 401(k)s.) The unitary executive theory, if adopted, would mean that presidential control over an election body might be constitutionally required. The Trump experience shows why that would be far too risky.

We should now look to states to step up the competence, integrity, and accessibility of their election systems. They serve as the front line against election subversion. Diffusion of power in the states makes it much harder for Trump to mess with the midterm elections. Whether or not the Framers intended it, our messy, decentralized, partly partisan, uneven system of administering elections turns out to be the best bulwark against would-be authoritarian presidents.

On Monday, the New York Times reported a bizarre and shocking update to news of an FBI raid last week on a Georgia election office: It turns out that immediately after the federal raid, the FBI officers involved spoke directly with President Donald Trump. To say that this is unusual would be an understatement—it is without precedent. It has long been known that the 2020 election in Georgia is a personal obsession of Trump’s, but the extent to which he is actively, openly, and personally meddling in the state’s elections system is still surprising and new. One big question looming over this entire episode, though, is why—of all the states where Trump falsely claimed there was fraud in 2020—has Georgia become ground zero for the president ahead of the 2026 midterms that election experts feel are potentially threatened by Trump’s latest actions? We think we have a few answers.

Those answers have to do as much with 2026 as they do with 2020. And, perhaps surprisingly, a big motivation for Trump’s assault on Georgia’s election infrastructure now has as much to do with the Republican primaries in the state as with November’s general election. Allow me to explain.

Georgia’s race for governor is considered a toss-up, though Republicans have consistently held the job since 2002. Polling has shown the top Republican contenders are Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones. Trump has endorsed Jones, who served as a fake elector in 2020 and was tied up in Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ election interference investigation, which charged Trump and several co-conspirators with a criminal conspiracy to steal Georgia’s 2020 election. Jones has focused his campaign on attacking Raffensperger over that election. Raffensperger, as you may recall, has been a longtime personal target of Trump’s after a 2021 phone call with the president in which he was asked to “find” 11,780 votes for Trump in order to flip the state’s 2020 election results.

In order to understand how the race between Rafensperger and Jones relates to the FBI’s raid on Fulton County, it’s necessary to recognize that Georgia’s voting system has been mired in controversy for nearly a decade. Back in 2017, a group of Georgia voters and the Coalition for Good Governance sued the state over its use of Dominion Voting Systems’ electronic ballot-marking devices. These devices are like a tablet and don’t create a paper copy of a voter’s ballot selections; instead they print a paper QR code that can be scanned to see a digital image of a ballot. This, the lawsuit alleged, opens up serious security vulnerabilities that can not only be hacked, but also make it nearly impossible to verify the software accurately recorded a voter’s ballot. When the lawsuit eventually went to trial in 2024, a computer scientist demonstrated live, in court, how he was able to rig Dominion’s voting tablet by rewriting its code and printing out as many ballots as he wanted. In a hypothetical election, the hacking was successful in flipping the outcome of a race.

During that trial, the plaintiffs also pointed to Georgia’s Coffee County data breach that occurred in 2021, where pro-Trump activists physically entered the small, rural county’s election office and copied election system software. A lawyer for the Coalition for Good Governance claimed at the time that the compromised software was not isolated to Coffee County, and that hackers could have access to voting software used in all 159 counties in Georgia. Plus in 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, under the Biden administration, also advised that Dominion’s electronic ballot-casting software presents security vulnerabilities. None of this validated Trump’s phony claims of election fraud in 2020, but it does make the state’s election systems more vulnerable to the sort of episode we witnessed last week.

Ultimately, the Coalition for Good Governance’s 2017 lawsuit failed, with a judge dismissing it just last year, partly because there wasn’t evidence to suggest there had actually been a successful hack of Georgia’s voting software and the state Legislature appeared to have remedied some of the security concerns the lawsuit raised. For instance, the Georgia Legislature approved a bill that would replace its previous QR code system with a readable text to verify a voter’s ballot entry. The new law is supposed to take effect July 1, 2026, though during a series of budget hearings last month, Georgia lawmakers didn’t appropriate any state dollars to implement the change. No budget was allocated to upgrade Georgia’s voting system software either, which would have patched any security holes.

While all of these legal challenges questioned the integrity of Georgia’s voting systems, Raffensperger consistently affirmed his state’s 2020 election results were accurate. His office conducted three separate recounts, including a statewide audit that manually re-tallied every single vote cast, plus another recount requested by the Trump campaign. In the end, Gov. Brian Kemp certified his state’s election results for Biden, though the president has continued to insist he is the rightful winner. As part of this vendetta, Trump even made Kemp and Raffensperger prime targets during the 2022 elections, trying to inspire his MAGA base to vote them both out of office. At the time, he failed miserably.

Now, though, it seems that Trump has found a new way to try to punish Raffensperger. The Trump administration is undoubtedly going to use the baggage surrounding Georgia’s voting system to cast doubt on its 2026 elections and possibly beyond, with the FBI’s recent raid evidence that this is already underway. Georgia provides a three-for-one, from the Trump perspective: He gets to again question the legitimacy of the 2020 election; he gets to again cast blame on Raffensperger, his 2020 antagonist in the state; and he gets to potentially meddle with an election which he desperately wants Raffensperger to lose.

The day after FBI agents raided Fulton County’s election office last week, officials there said federal agents took over 700 boxes of physical voter records, while officials were kept out of the room as it was happening. Fulton County Commission Chair Robb Pitts told reporters he had no clue what the FBI was going to do with all the information it seized. “I don’t know where they are, I don’t know who has them, I don’t know what they’re doing with it,” Pitts said. “I have no clue. I could use my imagination.”

It’s no small stretch of the imagination to foresee Trump’s FBI manipulating Fulton County’s voting records to fit his agenda. “What Trump is trying to do is create a narrative that you can’t trust the voting system in Georgia,” Marilyn Marks, vice president and executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, told Slate. “He’s going to be able to show these ballots that say they were counted wrong and they were cheated, and all of that: ‘You can’t trust Georgia’s voting system, therefore the feds have to come in and help control the voting system.’ ”

Right now Trump is beginning his attack on Georgia’s voting system by inserting federal action, knowing that in a few short months, the state will be holding its gubernatorial primary election on May 19. If Raffensperger secures a win, the White House will be on fertile ground to dispute the results of his election, leveraging information obtained from the FBI’s raid, plus the nearly decade-long legal challenges Georgia’s voting system has faced.

Another added benefit to Trump’s scheme is the threat to the state’s critical U.S. Senate race, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for reelection. Ossoff’s narrow win in a 2021 runoff gave Senate Democrats the slimmest majority at the start of Joe Biden’s presidency, while Trump took the brunt of the blame for the GOP defeat at the time. Constantly attacking the integrity of the 2020 election seemed to put voters off.

What ends up shaking out in Georgia remains to be seen, but it’s fair to say that the president is signaling that he is willing to use all the powers of the U.S. government to satisfy his vendetta against those he believes have wronged him. During his speech in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Trump ominously announced that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did,” while again insisting that the 2020 presidential election he lost was rigged. And just this week, Trump, while speaking on a podcast hosted by former U.S. Deputy Director of the FBI Dan Bongino, openly admitted that he believes Republicans “ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that I won that show I didn’t win. You’re gonna see something in Georgia.”

As someone deeply familiar with the inner workings of Trump’s mind, former special counsel Jack Smith, said during his Congressional testimony last month, Georgia was “ground zero” for the president’s alleged criminal misconduct just five years ago. It could be so again this November.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon Web Services&#39; European expansion has hit the buffers as the American cloud provider grapples with aging grid infrastructure and lengthy interconnect delays.

AWS has moved quickly to flood the European continent with its elastic compute fabric, but while it may take two years to bring a new datacenter online, securing power for the facilities can take up to seven years, Pamela MacDougall, who heads energy markets and regulation for AWS EMEA, said in an interview with Reuters this week.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in some European datacenter meccas, like Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin, this wait can extend to as much as a decade.

This isn&#39;t unique to Europe. While a 2025 IEA report showed grid connection lead times ranging from one to three years on average across the US, in datacenter hot spots like Northern Virginia, they&#39;re also pushing [PDF] seven years.

&quot;We&#39;re finding more and more across Europe that certainty of the delivery date has continued to be delayed,&quot; MacDougall told the news wire.

These delays have forced AWS to reassess its European buildout.

Power has become more of a problem for bit barn builders as the AI boom enters its fourth year. Since ChatGPT&#39;s debut in 2022, datacenter power consumption has skyrocketed, with typical rack densities jumping from 6-12 kW to upwards of 140 kW, with 600 kW systems slated to start rolling out next year.

Along with greater power consumption, AI workloads, particularly training, can be extremely spiky, with utilization jumping from just a couple of percent to 100 percent in a fraction of a second. This leaves grid operators and utilities tasked with serving these datacenters little time to respond to surges in energy demand.

The permitting process associated with grid improvements in Europe has also proven problematic, though regulation from the European Commission has been proposed to prevent this process from exceeding two years.

Further complicating matters, energy infrastructure remains in incredibly short supply with turbine manufacturers struggling to keep up with demand.

In response, cloud providers including Amazon have begun turning to alternative energy sources to secure power for their facilities. Amazon last year purchased Talen Energy&#39;s Cumulus datacenter campus next to a nuclear power plant, while Microsoft and Meta are also backing projects to reignite or extend the life of aging reactors.

We&#39;ve also seen a flurry of interest in startups developing small modular reactors (SMRs). These mini nuclear power plants could be deployed alongside datacenters if they can be made commercially viable.

With even the most optimistic SMR roadmaps pushing mass production out to the 2030s, a seven-year lead time on grid connections is probably the better deal for now.

The Register reached out to Amazon for comment on how it plans to address these grid challenges; we&#39;ll let you know if we hear anything back. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/palantir_lethal_magical_china_middle_east/">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">Palantir is shaping the &quot;under-the-hood&quot; practices of the US Defense Department as demand for its software grows across warfighting, shipbuilding, and weapons procurement, CEO Alex Karp said during the company&#39;s fourth-quarter earnings call on Monday.

“One of the unusual things that unfortunately we can’t talk about is also just how much we can shape what’s going on under the hood, including how do you orchestrate something in a defense or civilian context?” Karp told investors. “It’s not that we’re the deciders, but it is the first time that we can help shape the footprint against which we execute.”

In December, the company announced it signed an up to $448 million deal with the US Navy to deploy ShipOS, which has demonstrated small-scale successes in streamlining processes used within the Maritime Industrial Base, the network of private companies that build American warships.

In some of those early tests, the company has used its digital twinning technology to reduce the time General Dynamics Electric Boat spent planning a submarine schedule from 160 hours to 10 minutes. It also claims that at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the material review process has shrunk from “weeks” to under one hour.

“From the beginning, we have stuck to our very strong values of expanding what we believe is the noble side of the West, which means being lethal on the front end, meaning outside, against adversaries, if necessary,” Karp said. “Hopefully adversaries do not want to mess with us.”

Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar said this has set off a wave of demand across the Department of Defense as the company’s Maven platform provides the Pentagon with the ability to coordinate from “the factory floor to the foxhole” in order to deliver “lethality.”

“We’re starting with the sub fleet, but people are asking us to help with all sorts of different weapon systems: fighters, bombers, surface vessels, drones, weapons themselves, munitions, and it’s a big area for us that spans not only the production of the weapon, but also attainment of them,” Sankar told investors. “And if you think about lethality, the ability to deliver combat power, you need an integrated ability to do this from the factory floor to the foxhole and Maven is a huge investment that has changed how we fight across the joint force on the foxhole side.”

The company made a fortune off US taxpayers last year, as its government business surged 55 percent to $1.86 billion. In the fourth quarter alone, the company grew its government business 66 percent versus the same time last year to $570 million, for an annualized run rate of $2.28 billion.

Next year, the company expects total annual revenue of $7.19 billion, a 60 percent increase over the $4.48 billion it made this year.

Karp said the challenge for Palantir is to keep up with expectations, as over the last year it has supported what he said were the most interesting, intricate, unusual operations that the US government has been involved in, which he can’t talk about.

“We’re not in the business of delivering the best products. We’re in the business of delivering projects that are magical on the front line and we unfortunately can’t talk about some of that, but we’ve seen that in the last year, magical implementations that have actually changed how people view US deterrents,&quot; Karp said during the call. “Obviously, the primary heroes here are the war fighters. But you know, the implementation orchestration, which (Sankar) and many, many people at Palantir have spent tireless nights working on has actually changed what people are able to do.”

Palantir’s government business is also seeing stronger adoption in parts of the Middle East and in China, Karp claimed. Those are geographies where strong-arm leaders with authoritarian regimes have traditionally been in place or have recently surged to power. He said Canada and Europe have been reluctant to buy advanced American defense software, often favoring domestic suppliers.

“So Arab countries and Israel, you see adoption. You see wide scale adoption in China, and you see lack of adoption in Canada, Northern Europe, and in Europe in general,” he said. “One of the countries that has the clearest idea of the problem is France, but they don’t really know how to solve it, because the solution involves buying American products, particularly Palantir.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Baddies are exploiting a critical bug in React Native&#39;s Metro development server to deliver malware to both Windows and Linux machines, and yet the in-the-wild attacks still haven&#39;t received the &quot;broad public acknowledgement&quot; that they should, according to security researchers.

The vulnerability affects the React Native Community command line tool, a very popular npm package with nearly 2.5 million weekly downloads. React Native is a development tool created by Meta that allows users to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React.

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-11953, arises because the Metro development server started by the React Native Community command line tool exposes an endpoint vulnerable to OS command injection. This allows unauthenticated network attackers to send a POST request to the server and run malicious executables. Similarly, on Windows machines, miscreants can abuse the security hole to execute arbitrary shell commands with fully controlled arguments.

JFrog researchers discovered the vulnerability and disclosed it in early November after Meta issued a fix. The research team assigned it a critical, 9.8 CVSS severity rating, meaning it&#39;s almost as bad as bugs get.

Bug hunters wasted no time publishing proof-of-concept exploits on GitHub, with one such POC being published the same day as the public bug disclosure.

&quot;VulnCheck observed exploitation attempts as early as December, well before public discussion framed CVE-2025-11953 as anything more than a theoretical risk,&quot; VulnCheck CTO Jacob Baines told The Register. &quot;This demonstrates how quickly attackers can act once scanning becomes viable, and why developer tooling - widespread, inconsistently monitored, and often not treated as production-grade - represents a particularly attractive early target.&quot;

In a Tuesday blog, Baines said the bug isn&#39;t receiving the attention it deserves.

&quot;Now, more than a month after initial exploitation in the wild, that activity has yet to see broad public acknowledgment, and EPSS [the Exploit Prediction Scoring System] continues to assign a low exploitation probability of 0.00405. This gap between observed exploitation and wider recognition matters, particularly for vulnerabilities that are easy to exploit and, as internet-wide search data shows, exposed on the public internet,&quot; he wrote.

Baines said the first wave of exploitation began in December, with more attacks delivering the same payloads observed on January 4 and January 21.

These attacks used a multi-stage PowerShell-based loader delivered through cmd.exe, and the code disabled Microsoft Defender protections before retrieving and running the payload: a Rust-based binary with anti-analysis features, including runtime checks to help avoid detection via static inspection.

&quot;The deliberate disabling of Microsoft Defender protections before payload retrieval indicates the attacker anticipated the presence of endpoint security controls and incorporated evasion measures into the initial execution flow,&quot; Baines wrote in a Tuesday blog.

The attacks originated from the following IP addresses: 65.109.182.231, 223.6.249.141, and 134.209.69.155, with the &quot;windows&quot; payload hosted at 8.218.43.248:60124, and 47.86.33.195:60130 hosting both a &quot;windows&quot; and &quot;linux&quot; binary. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/nextgen_nuclear_reactors_skip_nepa_reviews/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Energy says advanced nuclear reactor designs - many of which have so far existed mainly at the experimental, testing, or demonstration stage - generally pose limited environmental risk and can qualify for a streamlined environmental review for future projects.

The DoE announced the &quot;categorical exclusion&quot; for advanced nuclear reactors (ANRs) in a Federal Register filing on Monday, establishing a pathway that can allow ANR projects to proceed without a full environmental assessment or environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), provided specific conditions are met. The move follows Trump&#39;s executive orders directing agencies to streamline environmental reviews for nuclear reactors in order to accelerate their deployment.

A categorical exclusion means that a covered category of actions &quot;normally does not significantly affect the quality of the human environment and therefore does not require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement,&quot; the filing says. In this case, that&#39;s referring to ANRs, which include Generation III+ reactors, small modular reactors, microreactors, and stationary and mobile reactors.

Authorization, siting, construction, operation, reauthorization, and decommissioning of ANRs are all included in the categorical exclusion.

The DoE justified its decision in a written record of support, arguing that safety features of next-generation reactor designs generally limit their potential environmental impact.

&quot;Advanced nuclear reactors have key attributes such as safety features, fuel type, and fission product inventory that limit adverse consequences from releases of radioactive or hazardous material from construction, operation, and decommissioning,&quot; the DoE said in the record of support, while conceding that most advanced reactor designs have yet to move beyond experiments and demonstrations.

&quot;Although past advanced reactor projects have been for solely experimental, testing, and demonstration purposes … these reactors indicate that reactors in this category developed for additional purposes, such as power production and industrial applications, are also appropriate for this categorical exclusion,&quot; the document explained.

The DoE&#39;s move isn&#39;t entirely surprising given Trump&#39;s executive orders cited in the Federal Register publication specifically ask the DoE to establish categorical exclusions for ANRs. Additionally, the DoE reportedly quietly rewrote other nuclear safety documents to streamline reactor projects recently, eliminating hundreds of pages of requirements, loosening groundwater protections, and increasing radiation exposure limits for personnel, among other changes.

Nonetheless, the DoE&#39;s Office of Nuclear Energy told The Register that, contrary to the definition of a categorical exclusion stated in the Federal Register publication, nuclear reactors would still undergo an environmental review under NEPA.

&quot;The U.S. Department of Energy is establishing the potential option to obtain a streamlined approach for advanced nuclear reactors as part of the environmental review performed under NEPA,&quot; a Nuclear Energy spokesperson told us in an email.

&quot;The analysis on each reactor being considered will be informed by previously completed environmental reviews for similar advanced nuclear technologies,&quot; the spokesperson continued. &quot;This methodology is a win for bipartisan supported NEPA reform and will accelerate licensing of advanced reactors while upholding the highest standards of safety and security.&quot;

The Union of Concerned Scientists&#39; nuclear power safety director, Edwin Lyman, disagrees, telling us the DoE&#39;s move cuts corners that will create a public health and environmental safety risk.

&quot;The test reactor designs currently under construction have primarily existed on paper. This lack of real-world experience with the reactors means that they should be subject to more rigorous safety and environmental reviews before they&#39;re built, not less,&quot; Lyman told us. &quot;Any nuclear reactor, no matter how small, no matter how safe it looks on paper, is potentially subject to severe accidents.&quot;

As Lyman noted, most of the ANR designs that the DoE wants to exempt are still in the development phase. Only a single pair of Generation III+ nuclear reactors has been constructed in the US, and those came online in 2023 and 2024, respectively, at the Vogtle nuclear power facility in Georgia.

Small modular reactors, microreactors, and other fantasy generators are still the stuff of dreams. Just one SMR design has cleared US regulatory approval, and none has yet been built and operated, with at least one project already abandoned. Nonetheless, Energy Secretary Chris Wright claims the US will have at least one SMR up and running before the 4th of July in 2026.

Given how far behind the nuclear industry is in deploying reactor designs that are still the stuff of dreams, it&#39;s going to need as many regulatory rewrites as possible. ®

            <h2>Snowflake plugs PostgreSQL into its AI Data Cloud</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/snowflake_postgresql_ai_data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake is launching a PostgreSQL database-as-a-service within its AI data environment to place transactional workloads alongside analytics and AI under a single set of governance rules.

PostgreSQL now runs natively in the AI Data Cloud, allowing teams to power apps and AI agents, analyze business performance and trends using the data from their operations, and build recommendations or forecasting systems without the cost and complexity of building data pipelines and managing multiple vendors, the cloud data platform provider said.

“Say you want to build an app on data that is in Snowflake, but if that app doesn&#39;t have a relational OLTP [online transaction processing] database to store the data, they have to go break out of the boundary,&quot; Snowflake EVP of product Christian Kleinerman told The Register. &quot;With the PostgreSQL service, our goal is to provide this secure boundary where, if customers build apps or build agents within that boundary, their data has not left the compliance and regulatory perimeter for Snowflake.”

In addition, the service&#39;s full compatibility with open source PostgreSQL allows organizations to move existing apps onto Snowflake without code changes, according to Snowflake.

The service relies on pg_lake, a set of open source PostgreSQL extensions that allow developers and data engineers to read and write directly to Apache Iceberg tables from PostgreSQL, thereby cutting out the need to extract and move data. Iceberg is an open table format that proponents say lets users bring their preferred analytics engines to their data without moving it. It is widely used and supported across the cloud and data platform ecosystem, including by Snowflake, Google, AWS, and others.

Snowflake claims this would eliminate costly data movement between transactional and analytical systems.

The vendor already had a transactional capability within its platform. Called Unistore, it was announced in 2022, but was not generally available until late 2024. One analyst commented last year that Unistore had attracted little interest.

Kleinerman said Unistore offered low-latency reads and writes, but customers were also saying they wanted a PostgreSQL-compatible service. After looking at a number of options, Snowflake bought Crunchy Data, a PostgreSQL service provider.

IDC research director Devin Pratt said the move helps extend Snowflake beyond analytics into a managed OLTP offering. Online transaction processing handles live application reads and writes, while online analytical processing (OLAP) is used for reporting and analysis. Running both in one environment, he said, supports agentic AI and real-time streaming because agents need continuous access to analytical insight and live transactional data, reducing the delay between data creation and analysis.

But Snowflake was not alone in adopting the strategy. “It reflects a broader trend of vendors pairing operational databases with analytics to support real-time and agentic AI workflows,” Pratt said. Following its acquisition of Neon, which provides a serverless PostgreSQL architecture, Snowflake rival Databricks announced its service Lakebase.

In many cases, with OLTP and OLAP in the same platform, teams can reduce ETL and data duplication and apply more consistent governance and observability across transactional and analytical workloads, Pratt said.

“The value is a more unified operational and analytical stack with consistent management and security,” he said. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/greynoise_cisa_ransomware_gripe/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On 59 occasions throughout 2025, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) silently tweaked vulnerability notices to reflect their use by ransomware crooks. Experts say that&#39;s a problem.

&quot;Frustrated&quot; by the agency failing to notify defenders when key pieces of intel change, Glenn Thorpe, senior director of security research and detection engineering at GreyNoise, counted the number of missed opportunities to potentially stop ransomware attacks last year.

CISA maintains its Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog and populates it on a near-daily basis with details about the vulnerabilities attackers are exploiting to successfully gain access to victims&#39; networks.

The purpose of the catalog is to identify the most serious vulnerabilities at any given time, and inform defenders, especially those working for federal agencies, about which bugs should be prioritized.

One of the features of the catalog is that it indicates whether or not CISA is aware of a given vulnerability being used by those carrying out ransomware attacks.

Generally seen as the most damaging, infosec pros tend to prioritize the security flaws that could lead to stolen and encrypted files. Previous research has shown that these vulnerabilities are patched 2.5 times faster than those that aren&#39;t associated with ransomware attacks.

The thing is, the rapid speed at which CISA adds these new bugs to the catalog often outpaces defenders. As Thorpe discovered, the bugs CISA adds to the catalog are only known to be exploited by ransomware affiliates after being added, and CISA does not alert techies when its &quot;known ransomware use&quot; indicator switches from &quot;unknown&quot; to &quot;known.&quot;

&quot;When that field flips from &#39;Unknown&#39; to &#39;Known,&#39; CISA is saying: &#39;We have evidence that ransomware operators are now using this vulnerability in their campaigns,&#39;&quot; said Thorpe.

&quot;That&#39;s a material change in your risk posture. Your prioritization calculus should shift. But there&#39;s no alert, no announcement. Just a field change in a JSON file.&quot;

Thorpe&#39;s analysis of the 59 flipped vulnerabilities revealed that the largest share (16) were Microsoft CVEs, while the other common vendors included Ivanti, Fortinet, PANW, and Zimbra.

&quot;Ransomware operators are economic actors after all. They invest in exploit development for platforms with high deployment and high-value access. Firewalls, VPN concentrators, and email servers fit that profile perfectly.&quot;

He also found that more than a third (39 percent) of the bugs confirmed to be used in ransomware campaigns in 2025 were first added to the KEV catalog before 2023. The oldest to flip last year was a bug added 1,353 days prior, while the fastest to flip was in just one day.

Bear in mind: some vulnerabilities are known to be used by ransomware crews at the time of being added, so their &quot;known ransomware use&quot; indicator was always set to &quot;Known,&quot; i.e. they never flipped.

Thorpe went on to say that authentication bypasses and remote code execution flaws were the most likely to flip after being added to the KEV catalog.

GreyNoise has now released an RSS feed to which defenders can subscribe to see when KEV catalog entries&#39; ransomware statuses change.

The feed updates hourly, and is the product of Thorpe&#39;s unrealized hopes of change following a 2024 BSidesLV presentation.

The Publisher Content Marketplace could make it easier for AI companies to pay for ‘premium’ content.

Microsoft says it is working on the Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), an AI licensing hub that shows usage terms set by publishers. That way, AI companies can easily shop the terms and set up deals to use online content for “grounding” their AI models, while the content owners get usage-based reporting to help set prices.

Microsoft says it’s been codesigning PCM with companies including Verge parent Vox Media, The Associated Press, Condé Nast, People, and others. The AI boom has been largely fueled by content ingested without payment, and many of the previously mentioned publishers have filed lawsuits and/or arranged content licensing deals as traffic from traditional sources drops. Some, like The New York Times and The Intercept, have filed copyright lawsuits against both Microsoft and OpenAI.

There’s also a publisher-backed open standard called Really Simple Licensing (RSL) that lays out a framework aimed at keeping the digital media business sustainable in the age of AI. It builds licensing terms into a publisher’s website, dictating how bots should pay to scrape their sites, but Microsoft’s announcement didn’t mention how, or if, that could interact with the PCM. The Verge reached out to Microsoft with a request for more information, but didn’t immediately hear back.

According to Microsoft, with this setup, “publishers will be paid on delivered value, and AI builders gain scalable access to licensed premium content that improves their products.” The company adds that PCM will “support publishers of all sizes,” including large organizations and independent publications.

“The open web was built on an implicit value exchange where publishers made content accessible, and distribution channels — like search — helped people find it,” Microsoft writes. “That model does not translate cleanly to an AI-first world, where answers are increasingly delivered in a conversation.”

Microsoft says it has started to onboard partners, including Yahoo, as it continues piloting the marketplace and is looking to expand further.

Developers can use Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex to take action in Xcode on their behalf.

Apple is building OpenAI and Anthropic’s AI-powered coding agents directly into Xcode. New integrations in Xcode 26.3 will give developers the ability to call upon Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex to write and edit code, update project settings, search documentation, and more.

Xcode is the software developers can use to create and test apps for the iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Both Claude and ChatGPT were previously available inside Xcode, but this latest update will allow AI agents to take action inside the app, rather than just provide coding assistance.

Apple is also making Xcode available through the Model Context Protocol, an open-source standard that will enable developers to plug other AI tools into the app.

The news of Apple’s Xcode update comes just one day after OpenAI launched its AI-powered Codex app on Mac, which lets developers write code alongside a team of AI agents. Apple says Xcode 26.3 will be available to members of the Apple Developer Program starting today, “with a release coming soon on the App Store.”

Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series processors in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s newest operating system, macOS 26. Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024 and hasn’t stopped.

These days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800, although the quality of deals fluctuates frequently. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent.

But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.

In March 2025, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.

The 13- and 15-inch MacBook Airs have both previously received sizable discounts, though there aren’t any notable deals happening right now. That said, you can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon for $849 ($150 off) if you want the midnight model, or around $949 for other color schemes. The lowest price we’ve seen for this model takes $200 off the original cost. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for about $1,049 ($150 off) at Amazon in the midnight color, which is decent but not as good as the $999 sale price that was around for months. Other colors are $50 to $100 more.

In November 2024, Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.

The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option.

As of right now, the M4 Pro-equipped MacBook Pro is the only model receiving significant discounts. For example, the 14-inch M4 Pro with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is available at Amazon starting at $1,749.99 ($300 off). It’s a solid discount, even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months.

The base 16-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, is available with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,239 ($260 off) at Amazon or $2,249 at Best Buy, which is around $120 more than the all-time low we saw during Black Friday.

Apple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts.

The 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon, which is $100 shy of its best price to date. It’s worth picking over the M4 MacBook Pro, especially since that model currently costs more than the newer, better version.

The newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived in late 2024. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.

Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.

In addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.

In the past, we’ve seen the base Mac Mini drop to as low as $469, but right now it’s on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $549 ($50 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $729 ($70 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,301 ($99 off) at Amazon or $1299 at B&H Photo.

The Grok investigations are growing, as Paris prosecutors summoned Elon Musk and Linda Yaccarino to testify.

A raid on X’s Paris office was carried out by the Paris prosecutor’s cybercrime unit on Tuesday with Europol and French police as part of an ongoing investigation that expanded in July to include Grok. As previously reported by Reuters, Elon Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino were also summoned for hearings in April.

The investigation, which was initially launched last year, is looking into several allegations against X and Grok, including complicity in possession and distribution of child pornography and denial of crimes against humanity (related to Holocaust denial content), along with claims that X was manipulating its algorithm and illegally extracting data.

On Tuesday, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) also announced a separate formal investigation into X and xAI involving Grok and “its potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.” It joins another ongoing investigation in the UK from Ofcom, which also shared an update on Tuesday stating that it is not currently investigating xAI, but is still “gathering and analysing evidence to determine whether X has broken the law.”

All of the investigations follow a flood of nonconsensual sexualized deepfakes generated by xAI’s Grok that have proliferated across X. The problem has persisted for weeks, despite claims by X that the feature has been restricted.

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <div id="article-text">During the Switch era, Nintendo turned itself into a much more ambitious entertainment company.

During the Switch era, Nintendo turned itself into a much more ambitious entertainment company.

Nintendo has had plenty of highs over its few decades in the video game industry. Popularizing home consoles with the NES, introducing new audiences to games through the Wii’s motion controls, and the touchscreen Trojan horse that was the Nintendo DS, to name a few. But often these successes were followed by missteps; the Wii sold 100 million units, while its follow-up, the Wii U, couldn’t even manage a quarter of that. But that precarity looks to change. The Switch is now Nintendo’s best-selling console ever, surpassing the DS with 155 million units sold since its debut in 2017. And over that span Nintendo has transformed itself into a company better insulated against the ever-changing whims of the games industry.

One of the key factors behind the Switch’s success was how it represented a more unified version of Nintendo. In 2013, the company merged its two main game development divisions, which had previously been split into home console and handheld groups. Given how the Switch straddled the line between console and handheld, this made a lot of sense. But it also allowed Nintendo to put the full might of its creative resources behind a single platform. The result was a string of massive hits: games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Super Mario Odyssey all sold upward of 30 million copies.

Just as important, this structure allowed Nintendo to release big games consistently over the Switch’s lifespan. Even as the focus shifted to the next console, the Switch’s final years still included brand-new Zelda and Super Mario games. The structure has also allowed Nintendo to seamlessly continue this success into the launch of the Switch 2, which got off to a very fast start and debuted alongside a brand-new Mario Kart, which was followed by Donkey Kong and Metroid.

But outside of games, which form the core of the company, Nintendo has also used the Switch’s success to steadily branch out in new directions. In 2023, The Super Mario Bros. Movie hit theaters, earned more than $1 billion, and now Nintendo has both a sequel and a live-action Zelda movie on the way. Nintendo opened its first theme park in Japan in 2021, and has since expanded to Hollywood and Florida, with a location in Singapore due up next. The company even opened its own museum in 2024. In essence, Nintendo is building an entertainment empire. Its competition is increasingly the likes of Disney and Netflix in addition to Xbox and PlayStation. “I think people view Nintendo as a gaming company,” Shinya Takahashi, Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer, told me in 2023. “But we have always thought of ourselves as an entertainment company.”

It’s not a completely unique strategy: Just about every video game company is hoping to break out in film and television after the success of projects like The Last of Us, Fallout, and A Minecraft Movie. But in Nintendo’s case, the company seems to understand just how precarious a success like the Switch can be, and it used that success to steadily build itself up into something bigger in a deliberate, concerted way. It’s something Nintendo has tried to do before — see: the company’s ill-fated efforts into mobile gaming — but its resurgence during the Switch era allowed it to approach these ventures with a new level of focus and ambition. This is a company that’s so confident it’s about to release a $100 re-creation of the Virtual Boy, one of its greatest failures.

All of this is to say that the version of Nintendo that launched the Switch in 2017 is very different from the Nintendo that exists now. Its footing is more solid, its future is more clear. And that future involves more than video games. This doesn’t guarantee future success, of course. The Switch 2 may be off to a strong start, but it’s also facing many pressures outside of Nintendo’s control, some of which have led to a world where many game consoles now get more expensive over time.

But the new Switch also doesn’t need to match its predecessor’s success — it just needs to allow Nintendo to keep this momentum going.

Anthropic is working on implementing a fix to bring Claude Code back online.

Anthropic’s Claude AI models experienced a major outage today, impacting products like Claude Code. Developers were seeing a 500 error when trying to use Claude Code, and Anthropic said that it was seeing elevated error rates on its APIs “across all Claude models.”

Anthropic quickly identified the root cause and implemented a fix within around 20 minutes, but developers that rely on the tool were left staring at their screens waiting for the service to come back online. Claude Opus 4.5 also experienced some errors yesterday, and earlier this week Anthropic had to fix purchasing issues for its AI credits system.

It’s unusual to see Claude Code experience a major outage like this, especially as the service is used widely by developers, including Microsoft’s AI teams.

Update, February 3rd: Anthropic has now resolved its Claude API outage.

            <div id="article-text">In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.

But earlier this year, the mine’s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine’s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.

Kent Sorenson, Allonnia’s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. “The low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,” he says.

Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia’s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.

The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal.

Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn’t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. “The technology we’re using now didn’t exist a few years ago,” she says.

Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.

In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith’s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines.

Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. “What guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?” Brierley asks.

Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won’t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.

“They are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,” she says. “They’ll be your biggest supporters, but they’re going to be your biggest critics.”

In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. “This is not software,” Rasner says.

Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.

While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.

“You can do what mining companies have traditionally done,” says CEO Jai Padmakumar. “Or you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.”

Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining.

Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of Gluconobacter oxydans to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. “The microbes are the manufacturing,” says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow’s lab.

To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. “Biomining is one of these areas where the need … is big enough,” he says.

The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

On Thursday, I reported the first confirmation that the US Department of Homeland Security, which houses immigration agencies, is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make content that it shares with the public. The news comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI (like a video about “Christmas after mass deportations”).

But I received two types of reactions from readers that may explain just as much about the epistemic crisis we’re in.

One was from people who weren’t surprised, because on January 22 the White House had posted a digitally altered photo of a woman arrested at an ICE protest, one that made her appear hysterical and in tears. Kaelan Dorr, the White House’s deputy communications director, did not respond to questions about whether the White House altered the photo but wrote, “The memes will continue.”

The second was from readers who saw no point in reporting that DHS was using AI to edit content shared with the public, because news outlets were apparently doing the same. They pointed to the fact that the news network MS Now (formerly MSNBC) shared an image of Alex Pretti that was AI-edited and appeared to make him look more handsome, a fact that led to many viral clips this week, including one from Joe Rogan’s podcast. Fight fire with fire, in other words? A spokesperson for MS Now told Snopes that the news outlet aired the image without knowing it was edited.

There is no reason to collapse these two cases of altered content into the same category, or to read them as evidence that truth no longer matters. One involved the US government sharing a clearly altered photo with the public and declining to answer whether it was intentionally manipulated; the other involved a news outlet airing a photo it should have known was altered but taking some steps to disclose the mistake.

What these reactions reveal instead is a flaw in how we were collectively preparing for this moment. Warnings about the AI truth crisis revolved around a core thesis: that not being able to tell what is real will destroy us, so we need tools to independently verify the truth. My two grim takeaways are that these tools are failing, and that while vetting the truth remains essential, it is no longer capable on its own of producing the societal trust we were promised.

For example, there was plenty of hype in 2024 about the Content Authenticity Initiative, cofounded by Adobe and adopted by major tech companies, which would attach labels to content disclosing when it was made, by whom, and whether AI was involved. But Adobe applies automatic labels only when the content is wholly AI-generated. Otherwise the labels are opt-in on the part of the creator.

And platforms like X, where the altered arrest photo was posted, can strip content of such labels anyway (a note that the photo was altered was added by users). Platforms can also simply not choose to show the label at all.

Noticing how much traction the White House’s photo got even after it was shown to be AI-altered, I was struck by the findings of a very relevant new paper published in the journal Communications Psychology. In the study, participants watched a deepfake “confession” to a crime, and the researchers found that even when they were told explicitly that the evidence was fake, participants relied on it when judging an individual’s guilt. In other words, even when people learn that the content they’re looking at is entirely fake, they remain emotionally swayed by it.

“Transparency helps, but it isn’t enough on its own,” the disinformation expert Christopher Nehring wrote recently about the study’s findings. “We have to develop a new masterplan of what to do about deepfakes.”

AI tools to generate and edit content are getting more advanced, easier to operate, and cheaper to run—all reasons why the US government is increasingly paying to use them. We were well warned of this, but we responded by preparing for a world in which the main danger was confusion. What we’re entering instead is a world in which influence survives exposure, doubt is easily weaponized, and establishing the truth does not serve as a reset button. And the defenders of truth are already trailing way behind.

Update: This story was updated on February 2 with details about how Adobe applies its content authenticity labels. A previous version of this story said content credentials were not visible on the Pentagon’s DVIDS website. The labels are present but require clicking through and hovering on individual images. The reference has been removed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?

At Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.

Our methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.

Mistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women

Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr. was born with a rare, potentially fatal genetic disorder that left his body unable to remove toxic ammonia from his blood. The University of Pennsylvania offered his parents an alternative to a liver transplant: gene-editing therapies.

The team set to work developing a tailored treatment using base editing—a form of CRISPR that can correct genetic “misspellings” by changing single bases, the basic units of DNA. KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old, and later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well. At an event in October last year, his happy parents described how he was meeting all his developmental milestones.

Others have received gene-editing therapies intended to treat conditions including sickle cell disease and a predisposition to high cholesterol. But KJ was the first to receive a personalized treatment—one that was designed just for him and will probably never be used again.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just $74 per kilowatt-hour by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about $59 per kilowatt-hour on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been ticking up in recent months, a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry by the middle of this year.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, ceased operations last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion research: Companies and researchers are developing new materials for components including the electrolyte and electrodes, so the cells could get more comparable to lower-end lithium-ion cells in terms of energy density, Meng says.

As we enter the second half of this decade, many eyes in the battery world are on big promises and claims about solid-state batteries.

These batteries could pack more energy into a smaller package by removing the liquid electrolyte, the material that ions move through when a battery is charging and discharging. With a higher energy density, they could unlock longer-range EVs.

Companies have been promising solid-state batteries for years. Toyota, for example, once planned to have them in vehicles by 2020. That timeline has been delayed several times, though the company says it’s now on track to launch the new cells in cars in 2027 or 2028.

Historically, battery makers have struggled to produce solid-state batteries at the scale needed to deliver a commercially relevant supply for EVs. There’s been progress in manufacturing techniques, though, and companies could soon actually make good on their promises, Meng says.

Factorial Energy, a US-based company making solid-state batteries, provided cells for a Mercedes test vehicle that drove over 745 miles on a single charge in a real-world test in September. The company says it plans to bring its tech to market as soon as 2027. Quantumscape, another major solid-state player in the US, is testing its cells with automotive partners and plans to have its batteries in commercial production later this decade.

Before we see true solid-state batteries, we could see hybrid technologies, often referred to as semi-solid-state batteries. These commonly use materials like gel electrolytes, reducing the liquid inside cells without removing it entirely. Many Chinese companies are looking to build semi-solid-state batteries before transitioning to entirely solid-state ones, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

The picture for the near future of the EV industry looks drastically different depending on where you’re standing.

Last year, China overtook Japan as the country with the most global auto sales. And more than one in three EVs made in 2025 had a CATL battery in it. Simply put, China is dominating the global battery industry, and that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon.

China’s influence outside its domestic market is growing especially quickly. CATL is expected to begin production this year at its second European site; the factory, located in Hungary, is an $8.2 billion project that will supply automakers including BMW and the Mercedes-Benz group. Canada recently signed a deal that will lower the import tax on Chinese EVs from 100% to roughly 6%, effectively opening the Canadian market for Chinese EVs.

Some countries that haven’t historically been major EV markets could become bigger players in the second half of the decade. Annual EV sales in Thailand and Vietnam, where the market was virtually nonexistent just a few years ago, broke 100,000 in 2025. Brazil, in particular, could see its new EV sales more than double in 2026 as major automakers including Volkswagen and BYD set up or ramp up production in the country.

On the flip side, EVs are facing a real test in 2026 in the US, as this will be the first calendar year after the sunset of federal tax credits that were designed to push more drivers to purchase the vehicles. With those credits gone, growth in sales is expected to continue lagging.

One bright spot for batteries in the US is outside the EV market altogether. Battery manufacturers are starting to produce low-cost LFP batteries in the US, largely for energy storage applications. LG opened a massive factory to make LFP batteries in mid-2025 in Michigan, and the Korean battery company SK On plans to start making LFP batteries at its facility in Georgia later this year. Those plants could help battery companies cash in on investments as the US EV market faces major headwinds.

Even as the US lags behind, the world is electrifying transportation. By 2030, 40% of new vehicles sold around the world are projected to be electric. As we approach that milestone, expect to see more global players, a wider selection of EVs, and an even wider menu of batteries to power them.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

This article explores its growth across industries, benefits and disadvantages, and why this is important for you, as a service provider and/or as a customer.

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.
