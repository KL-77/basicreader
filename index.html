            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/how-europes-new-carbon-tax-on-imported-goods-will-change-global-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials.

If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive.

The goal is to prevent companies from relocating their production to places with looser regulations, ensuring fair competition between EU and non-EU companies, while incentivising global decarbonisation.

After a trial phase, full payment obligations begin on January 1 2026, when importers will need to buy CBAM certificates to cover the embedded emissions in goods such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, hydrogen and (eventually) electricity.

Although it is an EU climate policy, CBAM looks set to be a game-changer for global trade. Countries that rely on EU exports may need to make costly investments in cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking, or risk losing market share. The UK government plans to introduce its own version of CBAM in 2027—although how this links to the EU’s is yet to be decided.

A positive shift is already underway: more and more companies are now measuring and reporting their emissions accurately, responding to the growing demand for reliable carbon data. At the same time, an increasing number of countries are introducing their own carbon pricing systems to stay aligned with the EU and protect the competitiveness of their exports.

Morocco is a prominent example: its 2025 finance law gradually introduces a carbon tax from January 2026. As Moroccan firms will already pay a carbon price domestically, their exports are likely to avoid additional CBAM charges at the EU border, helping them remain competitive.

In many countries, CBAM is also accelerating interest in renewable energy and greener industrial processes. Some see it not as a threat, but an opportunity to attract investment and position themselves as low-carbon manufacturing hubs.

However, this mechanism is still controversial. For businesses, CBAM is complex and administratively heavy. Firms need robust systems to measure embedded emissions, collect data from suppliers, and produce environmental product declarations. Many will also need new renewable energy contracts to cut their carbon footprint.

Around the world, CBAM has faced strong criticism. India and China describe it as “green protectionism,” arguing that it puts unfair pressure on developing economies. At the same time, the EU has not yet created dedicated funding to help exporters in lower-income countries adapt. Without this support, the mechanism may not achieve the desired results.

Although CBAM is mainly aimed at industry, its ripple effects will reach consumers in the EU. Importers are unlikely to absorb the full additional cost, meaning prices are likely to rise—particularly for goods that rely heavily on steel, aluminium, or cement. This could mean Europe sees higher costs for cars, home appliances, electronics, building materials, and, indirectly, food production (through fertilizers).

At the same time, CBAM may bring more transparency. Because importers must report the emissions embedded in their goods, consumers may eventually have clearer information about the climate impact of what they buy.

The mechanism will also generate EU revenues from certificate sales. These are expected to support vulnerable households in many European countries, as well as funding clean technologies and improving energy efficiency. How the funds are used will be crucial to public acceptance of Europe’s new carbon tax.

Even before full implementation, CBAM is already reshaping supply chains and influencing government policies far beyond Europe’s borders. It may trigger trade disputes, push exporters to adopt carbon pricing, and highlight the need for more climate finance to support developing countries undergoing green industrial transitions.

For many European consumers, it’s likely to mean gradual price increases—and potentially, more climate-conscious purchasing decisions. Behind the scenes, it marks a significant shift in how global trade accounts for carbon—and how climate policy reaches into people’s everyday lives.

            <h2>Google lobs lawsuit at search result scraping firm SerpApi</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has filed a lawsuit to protect its search results, targeting a firm called SerpApi that has turned Google’s 10 blue links into a business. According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google’s terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google’s decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data.

SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world’s largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google’s SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can’t summarize web links if it can’t find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi’s second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity for grabbing its data from Google results.

Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it’s not just doing this to protect itself—it’s also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google’s blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi “violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content.”

It’s worth noting that Google has a partnership with Reddit that pipes data directly into Gemini. As a result, you’ll often see Reddit pages cited in the chatbot’s outputs. As Google points out, it abides by “industry-standard crawling protocols” to collect the data that appears on its SERPs, but those sites didn’t agree to let SerpApi scrape their data from Google. So while you could reasonably argue that Google’s lawsuit helps protect the rights of web publishers, it also explicitly protects Google’s business interests.

The kind of data scraping that SerpApi uses is not new—Google has simply put up with it until now. However, the company claims that SerpApi’s deceptive behavior, like spoofing user agents and hammering sites with armies of bots, has increased significantly over the past year. That may have something to do with the ever-growing hunger for search data in the AI era.

Google is coming out of its antitrust cases relatively unscathed so far, which affects the availability of its data. It has avoided the harshest remedies, like the government’s demand that Google offer search data to competitors. That might have turned businesses like SerpApi legit, but with that no longer an option, Google may feel emboldened to unleash the lawyers.

While Google paints this as a benevolent action, it stands to benefit by stopping SERP scrapers. However, this may make some of Google’s competitors happy, too. Since the search giant doesn’t offer an official API for search (and the courts declined to force the issue), SERP scraping provides a way for companies to get Google’s search data on the down-low. This reduces demand for the handful of other web indexes that do have APIs, including Brave and Bing. Without illicit search APIs, chatbots may have to lean on official data sources.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.

Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.

In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.

“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”

Economo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.

To test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.

Microtomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”

To solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.

The first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.

The team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.

Ants that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.

“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”

The researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.

In a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.

“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.

The study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.

Before looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.

            <div id="article-text">Multibillionaire Elon Musk has never exactly been humble about his corporate empire, but his latest comments are genuinely over the top.

Speaking to influencer Katie Miller — wife of Donald Trump’s controversial deputy chief of staff — on a painfully awkward podcast appearance, Musk waxed poetic about SpaceX’s latest rocket developments.

“There’s a lot coming down the pipe,” he declares at one point.

“Starship,” Musk replies. “The, the degree to which Starshipis a revolutionary technology is not well understood in the world.”

“It’s the first time that there’s been any rocket design, where full rapid reusability is possible — well, full reusability at all is possible, or full reusability at all is possible,” Musk’s word salad continued. “This is the first design where a reusable rocket is one of the possible — with success — is one of the possible outcomes.”

“If there are historians in the future, they’ll look back at Starship and say it’s one of the most profound things that’s ever happened,” he boasted. “You can think of historic events as, where would they fit in the evolutionary hall of fame? You got things like single cell life, multi-cellular life, capturing a mitochondria and then also on that scale, probably in the the top ten, is life becoming multi-planetary.”

Keep in mind, this is all about the SpaceX Starship, which has struggled immensely to launch and subsequently land without exploding — failures so profound that NASA is now shopping around for an alternate vendor for its Moon landing, which had been planning on relying on Musk’s mammoth craft.

Musk wasn’t letting any of that messy reality drag down his epic braggadocio, though.

“There just aren’t very many things that are in the top ten of the evolution of life, where you can basically say — where you can evaluate any given civilization or any given life form as, y’know, on that, that scale,” Musk continued. “So life becoming multi-planetary, it’s in the top ten.”

While going “multi-planetary” will surely be a major step for humankind, Musk’s victory speech is way premature. For over a decade, the multibillionaire has promised flights to Mars that never seem to arrive — an eternal can that’s always kicked down the road.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Now that EV tax incentives have gone up in smoke, Tesla is expected to disappoint once again with its Q4 sales.

Despite a pessimistic sales forecast, Tesla’s shares have skyrocketed and are up almost 50 percent over the last six months — showing yet again how the company’s $1.5 trillion market cap is largely untethered from the success of its core business.

But that hasn’t stopped Tesla CEO Elon Musk from seemingly putting his thumb on the scales. As an insider source told Electrek, the billionaire’s space company SpaceX has bought over 1,000 Cybertrucks from Tesla, a number that could rise to 2,000 over time.

In other words, one of Musk’s other companies has allegedly spent north of $100 million on Teslas that it’s hard to imagine it finding a use for — and in what looks an awful lot like an embarrassing ploy to save face for the EV maker.

A video circulating on Musk’s social media platform, X, shows an enormous number of Cybertrucks parked outside of SpaceX’s facilities in South Texas.

Considering the pickup EV has been an enormous commercial flop, only selling barely a fraction of Musk’s promised 250,000 to 500,000 Cybertrucks a year, there’s a good chance Tesla is using the mercurial CEO’s other venture to boost the numbers ahead of the end of an otherwise disastrous year.

As Musk continues to alienate his customers following his embrace of far-right ideologies, the company is struggling to close sales. Tesla’s US sales dropped to a nearly four-year low in November, as Reuters reported last week. A cheaper, stripped-down version of its Model Y SUV failed to reverse the downward trend.

According to registration data, the company sold just 5,385 Cybertrucks in the US in Q3, a precipitous drop of 62 percent compared to the same period last year.

Apart from being a major commercial flop, the Cybertruck has also been recalled eight times for sometimes-glaring design issues, and criticized for its relatively low range and much higher than originally advertised price.

Nonetheless, Musk is adamant that the truck is a success story, tweeting earlier this month that it’s an “incredible vehicle” and “our best ever from Tesla.”

How committed the EV maker still is to producing the stainless steel monstrosity remains to be seen. Musk has been trying to transition Tesla away from selling traditional vehicles, doubling down on a robotaxi service and humanoid robots instead.

In the meantime, Tesla’s core business is looking worse for wear. Beyond drying up demand, the company is facing fresh regulatory headwinds, with California threatening the company with a 30-day car sales ban in the state for misleading its customers with the term “Autopilot.”

Despite its erroneous marketing terms, Tesla vehicles — at least the ones being sold to the public — are not able to fully drive themselves, and require the driver to be able to take over control at any time.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some of Alaska’s scenic rivers and streams look downright apocalyptic this year because they turned a flagrant orange color — but it’s not due to local pollution, according to scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

In actuality, the orange tinted water is rust, released as the frozen ground in Alaska thaws out due to unchecked greenhouse gasses driving global warming. And it’s leaking into the state’s waterways, according to NOAA’s annual report on the Arctic region, where it’s posing a danger to local wildlife, residents and commercial fisheries.

The day-glo rivers are also a bright orange flag that the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the world. The massive defrosting is also anticipated to increase sea levels and screw up weather patterns, according to scientists who talked to NPR.

“When the Arctic thaws and warms, it’s having an impact on the global climate,” Matthew Druckenmiller, lead author of the report and senior scientist with the Boulder, Colorado-based National Snow and Ice Data Center, told the broadcaster.

The planet is already showing signs of distress from global warming, such as large-scale forest fires and extreme summer temperatures outside the Arctic, which Druckenmiller described as a giant fridge for the planet.

“The Arctic is warming several times faster than Earth as a whole, reshaping the northern landscapes, ecosystems, and livelihoods of Arctic peoples,” reads the NOAA report. “Also transforming are the roles the Arctic plays in the global climate, economic, and societal systems.”

Zooming back to Alaska, people started noticing the orange waterways in 2018, according to NPR.

“ We heard from people who live in the region — pilots who are often flying over, people in the national parks,”  US Geological Survey research hydrologist Josh Koch told the broadcaster.

As temperatures heats up in the most remote parts of Alaska, permafrost — ground that usually stays continuously frozen — is melting, and that’s unlocking iron in the soil, which oxidizes from exposure to water and air, causing rivers and streams to turn orange. Surveys revealed that this contamination is far reaching, covering hundreds of miles of terrain in Alaska.

“It’s often not orange until it reaches the stream, and then all the iron and other metals can precipitate and create this iron staining,” Koch added.

It’s not clear if residents are being harmed from the polluted water, but local scientists are monitoring the situation, NPR reports.

The other problem with these rusty rivers is that they increase the acidity level in the water, according to the NOAA report, and this may harm fish like Dolly Varden char, whose juvenile offspring have experienced a sharp decrease in numbers most likely due to iron in its aquatic habitat. And that’s pretty bad for everybody in Alaska.

“The food chain is connected to the lives of people living in the Arctic,” Druckenmiller said.

            <div id="article-text">Law firms representing Google and Apple have warned that employees who need a visa stamp to re-enter the United States should avoid leaving the country due to longer-than-usual visa processing times, according to Business Insider.

BI says it has viewed memos from BAL Immigration Law (which represents Google) and Fragomen (which represents Apple).

“Given the recent updates and the possibility of unpredictable, extended delays when returning to the U.S., we strongly recommend that employees without a valid H-1B visa stamp avoid international travel for now,” the Fragomen memo reportedly said.

A State Department spokesperson told BI that embassies are “now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else.”

Salon also reports that “hundreds” of Indian professionals who traveled home to renew their U.S. work visas in December have had their U.S. embassy appointments canceled or rescheduled due to new requirements for social media vetting.

TechCrunch has reached out to Google and Apple for comment. Both companies, along with other large tech employers, issued similar warnings in September when the White House announced that employers would have to pay a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When iRobot filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last Sunday, it marked the end of an era for one of America’s most beloved robotics companies. The Roomba maker, which had sold over 50 million robots since its 2002 launch, had survived 35 years of near-death experiences and technical challenges only to be undone by what founder Colin Angle calls “avoidable” regulatory opposition.

The collapse followed Amazon’s January 2024 decision to scuttle its $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot after 18 months of investigation by the FTC and European regulators. In this candid conversation, Angle reflects on what he describes as a profoundly frustrating process, the chilling message it sends to entrepreneurs, and his determination to move forward with a new venture in consumer robotics.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

TC: You called the bankruptcy “avoidable” and a “tragedy for consumers.” Walk me through what you think regulators got wrong in blocking the Amazon acquisition.

CA: I think there’s a real lesson around the role of the FTC and the European Commission. The goal, of course, is to avoid the abuses that can happen in monopolies and with the goal of protecting consumer choice and protecting innovation.

What happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot’s trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier. In the EU, we had a 12% market share [but it was] declining where the number one competitor was only three years old in the market, which is nearly the definition of a vibrant and dynamic marketplace. And in the United States, iRobot’s market share was higher, but it was declining and there were multiple growing competitors bringing outside innovation into the marketplace.

This should have been a no-brainer. This should have been three, four weeks of investigation. What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked.

What was that 18-month process actually like? What were you being asked to do?

The amount of money and time spent was indescribable. I would not be surprised if over 100,000 documents were created and delivered. iRobot invested a significant part of our discretionary earnings against fulfilling the requirements that went along with doing the transaction. Amazon was forced to invest many, many, many times that. There was a whole team, both internal and external employees and lawyers and economists working to try to, in as many different ways as possible — because it seemed like our message was falling on deaf ears — demonstrate that this acquisition was not going to create a monopolistic situation.

There was daily activity for 18 months associated with this. Perhaps most telling, when I was testifying as part of being deposed, I had a chance to walk the halls of the FTC. The examiners on their office doors had printouts of deals blocked, like trophies.

To me, it felt so wrong as an entrepreneur who started this thing literally in my living room and lived six and a half years never having enough money in the bank to make payroll, finally making it through succeeding. Here’s an agency whose stated mission is protecting consumer interests and helping the United States economy, celebrating as victories every time they shut down M&A, which in a very real way is the primary driver of value creation for the innovation economy.

I went into this deposition looking for a friend. It’s like, “Here we are, we’re obviously not in a stronger place, and here’s a great opportunity for us. Are you excited for us?” Maybe this is just my naïve take coming out, but that’s not the reception I got. It was, “Why should we ever let them do this?” It’s like: because it’s good for the consumer — because it’s going to catalyze innovation.

How do you think what happened here changes the calculus for startup founders who see acquisition as their exit strategy? Do you think we’re in a world where American tech companies can’t scale through M&A?

Risk has a chilling effect. If you’re an entrepreneur, your only option is to hope that it doesn’t happen again. The reason you and I are talking is I hope by my words I can make it less likely that it will happen again.

I founded a new company and my outlook on exit strategy and even commercialization strategy is impacted by the experiences I had at iRobot. How can it not be? That precedent creates risk of it happening again, and only through positive experiences do we start to dial down the anxiety that the exits I’m depending on — or as a venture capitalist, the exits I’m investing in assuming will happen — will actually come through. That risk is factored into the willingness to invest, the valuation of deals, and the rate of new company formation.

It’s hard to say there’s X percent fewer entrepreneurial starts or exits as a result of the chilling message, but it certainly didn’t help. Entrepreneurs can use every leg up that we as a nation can provide. It is a rugged journey. When it actually works out, it should be a celebration. The FTC is there as a safeguard against very real examples of things gone too far. I’m a big believer in checks and balances. But when things get out of whack, the country suffers.

Let’s talk about iRobot’s journey. The Roomba didn’t come out for 12 years after the company was founded. Tell me about those early days.

iRobot was a bunch of people in an academic lab saying, “We were promised robots. Where are the robots?” If I could be pissed off that I don’t have the robots we were promised, I should do something about it. If not us, who? If not now, when?

One of the co-founders, my professor Rod Brooks, had pioneered an AI technology which allowed the embedding of machine intelligence in low-cost robotics. The mission of the company was to build cool stuff, deliver a great product, have fun, make money, and change the world.

The first business plan was “private mission to the moon, sell the movie rights.” We were maybe the first company to fail to do exactly that. But the technology we developed led to additions to the Mars Pathfinder mission — my name’s up on Mars. We built robots that went into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. We built the PackBot, which was the first robot ever deployed in a combat mission for the US Army, went into caves in Afghanistan, and became the primary methodology for diffusing improvised explosive devices. We would get postcards: “You saved my life today.”

When the Fukushima disaster happened, we donated half a million dollars worth of robots to Japan. We sent six people over to train Tokyo Electric Power Company employees. Those robots were the first inside the reactor doors, mapped out radiation levels, and found a path where an employee could run in, get to the control room, work for a minute and a half, run back out, and only receive a lifetime dose of radiation. We were credited with enabling the shutdown of the reactor.

I had a team that was working on toys, and one of the guys said, “Colin, I think it’s time we can do this. We can finally make the vacuum.” I’m like, “Okay, here’s $15,000. Two weeks. See what you can do.” Two weeks later they came back and said, “Hey, that’s not bad. Maybe there’s something here.” We scraped and found a little bit of money [to build these]. A year and a half later, I convinced my board that we could build 10,000 of these robots and we launched them.

It’s really the media that picked up the story. We had no money for marketing. Reporters were fascinated because we tended to do interesting things that were real, and they couldn’t believe that robot vacuuming could possibly be real. [The reaction was:] “My God, it actually worked.” We ended up selling 70,000 robots in the first three months. Then we nearly went out of business the next year.

Because we screwed up. The press drove this huge initial demand — 70,000 robots. So next year we’re going to do four times that. We made 300,000 robots. We even made a television commercial, but we were a bunch of geek engineers, so it totally failed. After Cyber Monday we were sitting with 250,000 robots in our warehouse like, “Oh my God, the world’s going to end.”

Then something good happened. The guy running our website said, “Why did sales quadruple yesterday?” We hadn’t done anything. What had happened was Pepsi had started running a TV ad with Dave Chappelle. He walks into this beautiful home, picks up a potato chip, and a Roomba comes out. He’s like, “A vacuum cleaner!” He throws down the potato chip, the vacuum eats it, then chases him. His pants are ripped off. He stands up in boxers. A beautiful woman appears, and he says, “Your vacuum cleaner ate my pants.” We sold 250,000 robots in two weeks and realized we knew nothing about marketing.

Wow! You had no idea Pepsi was incorporating your product into its commercial?

No idea. It was wild. You try to do good for so long and you get smacked in the face so many times, and then sometimes something good happens. You could say because of that crazy moment in time, we have robots. When we think about just how fragile a journey it is — cats riding Roombas was a big part of why we succeeded. Does that make any sense? No, not at all. But we certainly didn’t expect tens of billions of views of cats riding Roombas.

At some point you started seeing Chinese competitors like Roborock and Ecovacs adopting lidar navigation years before iRobot. Why did you stick with vision-based navigation for so long?

We explicitly did not put lasers on the robot. We had the technology decades ago because it’s a dead-end technology. Under my strategic direction, we were going to invest every penny of cost against a vision-based nav and situational understanding system. Your Tesla does not have a laser on it. It is all vision-based. At least Elon agrees with me.

Our strategic plan was for Roomba to be much more than just a vacuum cleaner in the home. To do that, it needs to understand more. Lasers are not advanced technology — they’ve been around for decades. They’re an expedient solution to a subset of the problems that a robot at home needs to take on. A laser will never tell you whether you actually cleaned the floor or not.

It is absolutely true that Chinese competition was coming in at lower price points. We were late in building a two-in-one robot — we believed that by separating mopping and vacuuming you could give a better customer experience. The customer voted that we were wrong, and that’s okay. We certainly were first in auto-evac, first in navigation. We were also importantly excluded from the Chinese marketplace, which is the largest market for consumer robotics in the world. That didn’t help.

What learnings from your iRobot experience would you share with other robotics entrepreneurs?

The first thing I tell all robotics entrepreneurs is: make sure you understand your market so that you are building something that delivers more value than it costs to create. Robots are so exciting, so sexy that it’s really easy to convince yourself that you’re doing something that is going to change the world, if only consumers were smart enough to realize it. That’s a pretty tough equation.

Technology is oftentimes in the robot space well ahead of the business plans that can take advantage of the technology. One of the traps is thinking of robotics as a thing as opposed to a toolkit. As soon as you say, “I’m going to build a robot,” and head off building your humanoid — are you really doing it because you understand a problem you’re trying to solve, or are you enamored with building your thing?

When I started iRobot, it was just assumed that robots were going to vacuum floors by building humanoids to push upright vacuum cleaners. When we first built Roomba, we would ask people, “Is that a robot?” People would say, “No, that’s not a robot. A robot has arms and legs and a head.” Yet Roomba at the time cost 10,000 times less than a humanoid pushing an upright vacuum.

The challenge of entrepreneurship is breaking through the romance and opportunity and falling in love with your technology and getting to the application that you’re trying to solve. Understand your consumer, understand the problem you’re trying to solve — because it’s complicated, robotics is expensive, and it takes a lot of energy to get right.

You mentioned you’ve founded a new company. What can you tell me about it?

We’re in stealth mode, but I’ll give you a broad hint. It’s consumer-facing. We’re really looking at the fact that most of the things robots can do to meet outstanding needs require us to interact with other people. So how do we build a robot that actually has sufficient emotional sophistication — not human-level, but enough — to build an enduring co-character that can make sense over time and use that for health and wellness related applications?

It’s going to be awesome. I’m so excited about it. It’s given me enthusiasm and energy to have a chance to use this new toolkit and continue on my journey to build the robots we were promised. I really haven’t changed that much from a grad student in college saying, “Oh my God, we’ve been promised robots and we don’t have the ones that I want yet.” I spent 30 years focused on building the world’s greatest floor care robot, and now I have a chance to do something else.

These options (as well as similar adjustments to ChatGPT’s use of headers and lists) now appear in the Personalization menu and can be set to More, Less, or Default. They allow users to further customize ChatGPT’s tone, on top of the existing ability to set a “base style and tone” — including the Professional, Candid, and Quirky tones that OpenAI added in November.

ChatGPT’s tone has been an ongoing issue this year, with OpenAI rolling back one update for being “too sycophant-y,” then later adjusting GPT-5 to be “warmer and friendlier” after some users complained that the new model was colder and less friendly.

Some academics and AI critics have suggested that chatbots’ tendency to praise users and affirm their beliefs are a “dark pattern” that creates addictive behavior and can have a negative effect on users’ mental health.

Late on the Friday before Christmas, just hours before a deadline mandated by Congress, the Department of Justice released part of the trove of documents known colloquially as the Epstein files. The contents are, at different times, unnerving, enraging, banal, and heavily redacted.

At The Atlantic, we’ve been up, poring over the documents to contextualize what they mean. In this special Galaxy Brain episode, Charlie Warzel is joined by Adrienne LaFrance, The Atlantic’s executive editor, and Isaac Stanley-Becker, a staff writer, to talk about the document dump. They share their findings, address the political fallout, and explore what, if anything, we can learn from what’s been released.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Charlie Warzel: I’m Charlie Warzel, and this is Galaxy Brain. Yesterday, conspiracy theorists, politicians, investigative reporters, concerned bystanders—they all got what they’ve long been asking for, at least, partially: The Department of Justice, as mandated by Congress, has released the Epstein files, which is a massive multimedia tranche of documents. They include files, more than 3,000 photos of Epstein’s homes in New York City and in the Virgin Islands, images of his house filled with art and photographs of nude and half-clothed women. There are photos of Epstein’s jet-setting lifestyle, a number of which depict Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell with former President Bill Clinton. In a statement on X yesterday, a spokesperson for Clinton said, “There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first.”

This information that has been released has been held by different sections of federal law enforcement, and for the last month, according to CNN, lawyers at the Department of Justice’s National Security Division have been poring over these files. They’ve been trying to comply with dueling directives to either release the information for public maximum transparency and to protect the executive and legal privacy of victims and those who haven’t been accused of any wrongdoing.

The redaction process has been described by insiders as chaotic, and these files are heavily redacted. Now that it’s here, though, in the public, everyone from vigilante investigators to journalists like myself can pore over this information in an attempt to better understand the life and crimes of Epstein, who in 2019 was charged with operating a sex-trafficking ring that targeted young women and underage girls.

Prosecutors say he was aided by Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate who’s currently serving a prison term. Epstein died in 2019 in his jail cell of reported suicide, and that incident ignited speculation about the particulars of his sex ring and rumors of a reported client list.

It’s worth backing up, though, to briefly explain the timeline of how we all got here. All the way back in February, in an interview with Fox News, Attorney General Pam Bondi was asked about a list of Jeffrey Epstein’s clients, and if the Justice Department was planning to release them. Bondi responded, quote, “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review.” In May, the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets requested the release of the files in a letter to Bondi.

Bondi did not respond to the request before the May 16 deadline. The story didn’t really heat back up until July, when [Donald] Trump’s Justice Department issued a memo that claimed there was no Epstein client list. Quote, “While we have labored to provide the public with maximum information regarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is the determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”

Bondi noted that when she said the Epstein list was sitting on her desk, she was actually referring to the DOJ files and not a client list. Around the same time, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump’s name appeared multiple times in a set of Epstein files currently in possession of the Justice Department. So later, Democrats in the House Oversight Committee, on numerous occasions, released tranches of documents from Epstein’s estate. In September, they released a 238-page PDF. It was a document of the 50th-birthday book to Jeffrey Epstein that includes a prologue by Maxwell and a page allegedly written by Trump, which Trump denied authoring. In November, it released a trove of emails between Epstein and many prominent figures, some of which referenced Donald Trump, though he was not accused of any wrongdoing.

In recent weeks, the committee has released a series of photographs of Epstein and his associates. Some of those photos include close-ups of what looks to be a woman’s body with passages from the novel Lolita drawn on them. In late November, Congress passed legislation mandating Trump’s DOJ release all Epstein files, with few exceptions. They gave him 30 days. Trump signed the bill into law on the 19th of November.

Now files are here. And let’s be clear: For all the chatter and the intrigue around Epstein for his famous associates, the memes, the wall-to-wall coverage, this is a sordid moment in American history. The release of the files is theoretically this moment of transparency, but it’s worth remembering why the files needed to be released. They depict the life and operations of a prolific sex trafficker, someone who was alleged by on-the-record victim testimony to have abused an unknown number of women, some underage. That these files are so eagerly sought is because of how firmly Epstein was ensconced in the social and political and financial dealings of extremely powerful people all over the world, even after taking a plea deal that made him a registered sex offender. His associations known and unknown, the provenance of his great wealth, the extent of his influence—this is what makes Jeffrey Epstein a newsworthy figure more than six years after his death.

That said, the release of the files are a culmination of sorts. They unite an unlikely conglomeration of interests, from QAnon to House Democrats. And in a politics where conspiracy theorizing has replaced scandals of old, the release of these files is an intentional event without much precedent.

The scattershot release offers anyone a choose-your-own-adventure, “Control-F” search bonanza. People have and will continue to post their findings, often without context, to social media and elsewhere. There will be silly, offensive, and irony-poisoned memes. There will be endless pontification, name-calling, political point-scoring. Releasing the files is an act of transparency, but dumping them on a Friday evening during a holiday week is also something of a chaos agent.

And so there’s a lot to take in here. It will likely take reporters and other investigators months, maybe years, to understand the scope. And this isn’t even all of the files. But what we wanted to do today on Galaxy Brain is to try to walk through this as best that we can. Over the last couple of hours, we at The Atlantic have been up and looking over these documents. We’ve been trying to surround them with the appropriate amount of context.

And so joining me today to talk about the files is Adrienne LaFrance, The Atlantic’s executive editor, and staff writer Isaac Stanley-Becker. They’re going to come on and share a little of what they found and what, if anything, we can learn from what has been released. This is not an exhaustive list of findings. This is an early reaction and a chance to try to ground this extremely grim but important moment, and understand what, if anything, might happen next.

Here’s Adrienne LaFrance and Isaac Stanley-Becker.

Warzel: Adrienne, Isaac. It is very early in the morning where I am. It’s light out where you are. Thank you for joining me to talk about the Epstein files, which are now out in the world. They’ve been released for a few hours. We’ve all looked through them in some capacity, and I’m delighted that you’re all here to talk about it with me.

Warzel: Absolutely. Okay, so I think the first thing that I just want to start with is: This is a partial release of the files. There are hundreds of thousands of documents. Supposedly, the Department of Justice has been working, according to reports, for a long time, trying to redact these things, trying to maintain the privacy of the victims and certain people involved in the files.

On Friday, they noted that they weren’t going to be able to release the absolute full tranche of documents. Instead, we have a partial release. How do we feel about this? Has the Department of Justice complied with this investigation? Isaac, do we feel like this is what Congress wanted to some degree, or is this partial release unsatisfying in terms of the Department of Justice actually giving Congress what it wanted?

Stanley-Becker: I think, plainly, the administration has not complied with the legislation that was passed, which required the release of these files, these documents, by yesterday, Friday. And a partial release is a partial release. It’s not a full release. It doesn’t meet the letter of this legislation that was passed. And we’ve already seen members of Congress on both sides of the aisle make this point and discuss various possibilities of steps they might take, whether it comes to the Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche or Pam Bondi, the attorney general.

I think there’s been some discussions of contempt proceedings. Certainly, Democrats have used the word impeachment. But I think there’s a lot of anger about what happened here. And these are files that have, as you said, been discussed for months, that the attorney general said that she had aspects of them sitting on her desk. So I think people have a right to be asking why it took so long and what the reason for the delay was and what has been withheld in this initial batch.

LaFrance: I was going to say it also colors our ability to understand why they released what they released. So it sort of warps the entire thing in that way.

Warzel: Yeah, and just to be clear, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, saying that the files were under desk—that was back in February of 2025. So, you know, this has been dragging out for a very long time. I think a lot of people don’t remember that first part, who have been paying attention to this. And, you know, this is something that really heated up over the summer. And then that really, you know, started this process. But genuinely, this goes back to almost the first days of the administration, all the way back then.

I want to talk about: Most people, I imagine—these were released on a Friday right before the Christmas holiday, sort of later in the afternoon on the East Coast. I doubt most people in the world have been actually sifting through these files in any capacity. We have. And so what I wanted to kind of do for people is talk about the experience, first and foremost, of going through this, right? This is a lot of—even though it’s a partial release, this is a lot of documents. This is kind of a very classic reporter thing of having to comb through this.

And so I just wanted to start first with you, Isaac. Can you kind of walk me through your process of getting these? You know, accessing these files, how you went through them. Like, what is it like to dive into this? Because I—the Epstein files is something that has just been, you know, obviously, shrouded in secrecy, but something, too, that I think people have really kind of, you know, had to imagine in their heads, right? What is this going to be? I think a lot of people thought they were going to be, like, IRS files or things like that—a lot more sort of nitty-gritty stuff. It was very image-heavy.

Starting with Isaac and then, Adrienne, to your experience of it, what was it like going through this?

Stanley-Becker: Well, there was an anticipation that there was going to be some sort of release yesterday. We didn’t know exactly what kind. And our terrific colleague Sarah Fitzpatrick had some good lines into trying to figure out when and what, and what the administration was telling various people about what they were doing. So there was some sense that at some point during the day, and I think even some indication of the afternoon, eventually. And so I think it was 4:30, 4 o’clock—but, as you say—in the afternoon when this dropped, and it was a link on the DOJ website.

And we didn’t know what to expect. We didn’t know whether it was going to be transcripts, investigative materials, photos. So we just kind of opened it and started clicking around and seeing what it looked like, even seeing sort of how to divide it among those of us reporters who were looking through it, to do it in a kind of concerted way. And so it soon became clear that there was some material that appeared to be new, some old. So we kind of wrapped our hands around the new material. And it was released in batches, like a set; there were sort of four sets.

And I just downloaded—it was a zip file—and started clicking through, as you say, a lot of images, especially where I started. So images of Epstein, of Ghislaine Maxwell, seemingly in various vacation destinations with friends of theirs. And discussing with colleagues: What here has been released? What’s new? Do we recognize this person?

You know, passing it over to Adrienne, one of the points that she made that I think is so important in how we were processing this and making sense of it was, as she said: There was no rhyme or reason to this release versus what remains held back. And I think that that’s right, but that has fueled so much of the suspicion and the cynicism. Because, say, even if we knew that this was some way chronological—like they were releasing the first batch in the investigations, and they hadn’t yet gotten to the later batch, but there was nothing like that—or this was photos, and they were going to get onto other materials in their possession. But for all we know, they picked and chose as they pleased. So that made, I think, the experience really challenging and grounds for a lot of concern and suspicion.

Warzel: Adrienne, what was your experience of this? You’re helping to direct all of our coverage. What was your experience of looking through this or trying to make sense of it?

LaFrance: Right. Well, I mean, it’s what Isaac said, and it’s really just, as journalists, trying to figure out what’s new. Is there anything in here that’s revealed that changes our understanding of the scope of Epstein’s crimes? Obviously, looking for affiliations to other powerful figures—and we can, of course, talk more about that—including multiple presidents, and just trying to understand: What does it mean, and why does it matter?

Because one of the more complicated aspects of all of this is the collision of actual crime and robust conspiracy theorizing. And I kept thinking about something. So I’ve written a lot about conspiracy theories, as you guys know, over the years. And one of the things that always comes to mind for me is: The more I’ve talked to conspiracy theorists, the more I understand that a lot of what draws them to sort of the work of conspiracy theorizing, if you can call it work, is a lot of what journalists love, like combing through difficult, complicated, limited, redacted documents, trying to find meaning. And so when you sort of unleash a document dump on the public in this really, you know, rich conspiracy-laden environment, while also knowing that it’s a hugely important news story with real crimes and real victims, it’s even harder to sort of disentangle and find meaning. And then you layer on possibly a bad-faith political maneuvering. It’s, I mean, it’s extraordinarily complicated.

Stanley-Becker: And in this case, in particular, because: I just think it can’t be emphasized enough that Epstein’s crimes are being arbitrated on the internet because they were never arbitrated in court. And that is one of the many tragedies and wrongs of the fact that he committed suicide in jail, that there was never ever an opportunity to really arbitrate this and get to the facts. And so it’s understandable that people are taking matters into their own hands on the internet, because it was never dealt with carefully and in a methodical way in court. And there’s lots of reasons for that, and lots of failures of our justice system that allowed that to happen. But it just speaks to one of the enduring wrongs and just utter failures of this whole saga.

Warzel: There is a Miami Herald article by Julie K. Brown, who has done a lot of the investigative reporting that broke this story open and really revealed to the public the extent of Epstein’s operation over a long period of time. And she wrote about the files that the House Oversight Committee, Democrats in the House Oversight Committee, released actually on Thursday, just some photographs, but said that, you know, one of the revelations in a lot of these stories is that the FBI never obtained Epstein’s computers in the original investigation, right? That some of what we are seeing here in general, broadly, is stuff that, you know, as you’re saying, Isaac, had the government done its job in other ways, this information would have maybe not been public. But it would have been things that, you know, had been brought to light, at least privately, in terms of the investigation. So I think that that’s a very important way to ground this in general.

I would love to talk a little bit about what’s in here, right. We didn’t get a lot, right? But what did we get?

LaFrance: Well, to your last point, one of, I think, arguably the most important thing—and forgive me because I have not combed through all 13,000 documents, so we are certainly gonna learn more in the coming days and with subsequent releases—but from what we know now, one of the most consequential things in here is this, I think, 1996 tip from someone who had contacted the FBI, asked them to look into Epstein’s affairs, and has said that the FBI did not even respond to her. And so to see evidence of that early complaint is really shocking. And I think, you know, as this person has told other news outlets, validating for her, but I think it speaks to exactly what Isaac was just describing.

Warzel: Yeah, apparently the FBI did not contact the person who made this complaint about child-sex-abuse material and Epstein for a decade, which, yes, I think speaks very highly to how all this unfolded. So, yeah, so let’s get to what—that was in there certainly. That was, I believe, as people were going through it, myself included, but also reported in other places. That seems to be a real revelation there in terms of: That complaint was unearthed.

It was also, it was something where, the way that these files come out, a lot of them are just images that you are downloading on a zip drive and you are rifling through. And when it’s just an image, it’s actually very easy to process, right? You can just see Jeffrey Epstein is on a Jet Ski, there’s someone in a helicopter, there’s someone on a plane, et cetera. When it is some of the photographs of images, or photographs of documents, rather, it can be kind of hard to see and to know what it is that you’re looking at. So that was definitely a revelation.

But let’s start with you, Isaac. What did we get here, and what did you really take away and notice here?

Stanley-Becker: Well, I think we should also emphasize that in addition to this being a partial release, the materials were also heavily, heavily redacted. And that’s another thing that is fueling a lot of the criticism of DOJ’s approach here.

I think maybe most strikingly, there was one file, a grand-jury file, I believe from New York, that was just entirely redacted. People were pointing out that it’s like one of those memes about nontransparency where just everything, every single line is blacked out. And that was literally what the document was.

I mean, I think, stepping back, I would make a couple points. One is that overall, this does not really add much to our understanding of Epstein’s crimes, of the people who enabled Epstein’s crimes, and of the way in which he evaded justice for so long, with the exception of, I think, the really important document that Adrienne pointed out.

And I think the second point I would make is associated with that: that sprinkled throughout here, there are some really troubling and just, frankly, grotesque details about the way in which he went about abusing young women. And details are hints because, again, it’s really hard to understand the full context because of the redactions, because of maybe some of the missing material. But there are a few documents that record phone calls, messages that were intended for Epstein, and one of them says, “I have a female for him.” Just absolutely chilling. There’s a reference at one point to someone not being available because of soccer, potentially a young person, though it’s not clear. So there are some examples of that, and also images of Epstein with what appear to be young women, though there’s a number of, again, redactions of those faces, in that case, most likely to protect victims.

And then I think the third point I would make is that there’s a lot of Bill Clinton in these images and in these files. And one of the things that we did was reach out to a spokesman for former President Clinton about this. And his office hit back pretty hard in saying that this was selectively released, that it was intended to serve a political purpose and distract from all the ways in which we know that President Trump associated with and was friends with Epstein. And also, an argument that they were friendly, there was some traveling together, but that President Clinton knew nothing of Epstein’s crimes. But again, in the way in which all of this is being used and politicized, we saw immediately an effort by White House officials, people in the communications department, to trumpet the Clinton materials, and arguing that this is what the focus should be. So those are the kind of main takeaways that I had.

LaFrance: Well, and I have to say, too, like, it definitely seems clear that the Trump camp is using this opportunity to politically weaponize the Clinton material. And yet it is shocking in its own right. I mean, just within our newsroom, I think those were the photos that were being passed around first, because it’s legitimately shocking to see a president in that capacity, even someone who you know has had inappropriate relationships with young women before.

Warzel: Yeah, those photos, you know, we talked a lot about, like: Was this the—just chronologically, right—like, the first stuff? Again, there’s so much that we don’t know here. Was this chronologically some of the first stuff there? Was it some of the easiest stuff for DOJ lawyers to clear? Because we don’t know what the actual process was here; we don’t have any insight into that.

What was interesting, to me as someone who was going through it but also observing online, was, you know—I think they were released around 1:00, 1:15 [p.m.] my time, Pacific time, so that would be about 4 o’clock eastern time—within two or three minutes on X, I was seeing multiple accounts of all political persuasions immediately going through and posting the photos of Clinton. One which has sort of become, I guess, infamous at this point is him sort of reclining in what looks like either a hot tub or a pool. There is a redacted black square that I guess represents somebody who’s in there. There was something about that, though, the fact that it was so quick to have that be there that I think it led to that feeling, right, of: Is this being weaponized in some way? This has shown up so quickly. And, you know, his presence is so prominent.

And this feeling of, you know, potential weaponization or using these documents for to score political points, I think, is underscored by the fact that, you know, the White House press secretary is reposting that photo and putting an emoji next to it, and saying, “Oh my!” A DOJ spokesperson tweeted and then deleted the tweet, according to reports from Politico, that said, “I wonder why the Biden DOJ refused to release the files.” It really seems like very quickly this just became another way to, you know, snipe on social media. And I think that lended this feeling that, like, What are we seeing? Has this been released selectively?

Stanley-Becker: Well, there’s also no pretense that it’s anything other than political. President Trump directed his attorney general to investigate as the kind of pressure was intensifying on him related to these files. He directed his attorney general to investigate Clinton’s ties to Epstein, along with a number of other prominent Democrats and people he perceives as his enemies. As in many cases, this president’s actions are, sort of, so out in the open. There’s not an effort to kind of hide the way in which they want to amplify the potential downsides for Democrats in these files.

I think the other thing that struck me about the Clinton material because, again, his people had all sorts of arguments about how this was selective and political. They’ve also said that there’s no wrongdoing on the former president’s part. And certainly these images are unsavory, but there’s nothing in them that shows him in a really compromising position with a minor or anything like that.

Warzel: And I should be clear, he said that they—sorry to interrupt you, but also, the Clinton camp said that this was a relationship that was terminated, his relationship with Epstein, as soon as he knew about any of Epstein’s wrongdoing. That’s just, you know, what was said.

Stanley-Becker: Seems like a sort of low bar. Yeah.

But I think it was one more really graphic illustration of a point that’s been made and written about well recently, just about the way this is such an indictment of a kind of elite class that Epstein managed to wrap around his finger. I mean, he was fantastically wealthy. He had lots of fancy associates. But how was he able to weasel himself in so effectively with people as prominent and important as former presidents? I mean, what was the former president doing associating with this individual? What was he getting out of this relationship? I mean, we may learn more about the facts here, but it strikes me as kind of pathetic in addition to everything else.

LaFrance: Right. And I feel this is a really important point, too, that I think you can hold sort of two things to be true at once—that, like, there are legitimate questions to be asked about Bill Clinton and Epstein’s relationship still. Absolutely. Of course, there are legitimate questions to be asked about Trump’s relationship with Epstein. And also, it seems quite apparent that both sides will try to politically weaponize. I mean, certainly, we see Trump’s side trying to politically weaponize Clinton’s appearance in these files. And so, like, is it extremely creepy? Yes. Is it being politically weaponized selectively? Also yes.

Warzel: Yeah. And, you know, I think what’s interesting and also difficult to hold in one’s head, right, is that some of what we know about some of the releases of information that have been, you know, kind of dripped and dropped throughout the fall have come from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, right? And these are, you know, emails that mention people like Peter Thiel; you know, a lot of correspondence between Donald Trump and Steve Bannon; a lot of mentions from Epstein and other people in Epstein’s circle of Donald Trump.

And then you have the Epstein files released by the Trump administration, which contain very scant mention of Donald Trump. There is, you know, to what I have seen—and again, we’re kind of poring over this—what I have seen at present, there is a photo of Jeffrey Epstein’s desk. And there seems to be what appears to be Donald Trump among a bunch of photos in his desk. There is a complaint from the Southern District of New York, a Jane Doe versus Epstein and Maxwell complaint, that mentions an interaction that Donald Trump had with a 14-year-old girl in the presence of Epstein at Mar-a-Lago. That’s kind of it. There’s not a lot there. And I think that, you know, the fact that you have Democrats on the House Oversight Committee releasing this stuff that shows kind of an extended world or associates of Donald Trump just speaks to the relationships that they have had over the course of their lives, running in similar social circles. And then you have what is supposed to be the be-all, end-all of transparency, and there is this scant mention.

It seems—did that surprise you guys at all?

LaFrance: I mean, yeah, it didn’t necessarily surprise me, but I do feel that there is more that we’re missing. I’ll also point out that Democrats did not seem interested in the Epstein files at all until it became politically convenient for them, which hurts their credibility now. And then the other thing I think we haven’t touched on that’s really important is this question of sort of, like, to what extent is someone guilty by association? Especially when we don’t exactly know what the association is.

Our colleague Liz Bruenig wrote a really thoughtful piece about how there are, you know, because of the sort of dynamic you’ve described where Epstein seemed to sort of collect famous, powerful figures in his life, there are lots of well-known people who have encountered him. And from the very limited information that the public has, it’s really hard to know, is it that Epstein was just wheeling and dealing, and meeting famous people? And yeah, sometimes they got photographed together, and now that looks bad? I mean, you don’t just accidentally get into a hot tub. So that association seems deeper than someone who might’ve just been sitting beside him at an event or something.

But I think there is this real question of, you know: In a culture that rushes to condemn people with limited evidence, you do have to sort of wonder how to contextualize or understand these little snippets or photos that we’re getting that don’t provide adequate information at this point. Does that make sense?

Warzel: Yeah, and I think it also speaks to the difficulties with the redactions, right? Because there are lots of things, as we have mentioned in here, that are redacted, some of them almost perhaps comically, right? Like, you have entire files that are just big black squares; you don’t even really know what the heck is in there. But there’s also a lot of photos and a lot of people online, even journalists that I’ve seen, who are very upset about the number of redactions, right? Like, if you are on what appears to be a private plane with Jeffrey Epstein, why are we redacting you, right?

And there was a report from Fox News that came out sort of early in the day—I’m gonna find it here—after the files were released that said that Fox learned that the same redaction standards were applied to politically exposed individuals and government officials. And that kind of floated around the internet for a while, and it was like, Wait, why are potentially politically exposed people and government officials being treated the same, with the same, you know, privileges as people who have been abused by Jeffrey Epstein? That seemed very, you know, out of place. [Deputy] Attorney General Todd Blanche later said that the Justice Department is, quote, “not redacting the names of any politicians,” and, quote, “There are no redactions of famous people.”

That leaves—that’s a little bit vague in terms of what actually is in there. But I think what’s fascinating, right, is this idea that there is this guilt by association. There is this sense that you could end up at a dinner, not know that Jeffrey Epstein’s there; there’s a photographer or something like that. It gets shown; it’s the only time you’ve ever interacted with this person. And yet, you have been, quote, “put in the Epstein files.” There is this association, as Liz writes in the piece.

And yet at the same time, it seems like we’re also all kind of collectively struggling with this idea of: You don’t just get in a hot tub, as you said, right? And there’s this idea that, like, you don’t just get on the plane. And that’s very different. But all these things get smashed together, especially, I think, because of the way that these files are released, and that just becomes extremely difficult for normal people and concerned people and people who are outraged by, you know, this type of sex trafficking and abuse. It makes it really hard to disentangle.

Stanley-Becker: I think it also speaks to, I mean, there’s now been so much ink spilled on this whole sordid affair. But one of the, in my mind, somewhat unanswered questions is how much Epstein’s globe-trotting life and lifestyle was mixed in with the criminal conduct he was engaged in. How cabined off was it? And I think that goes a long way toward helping us to understand whether all of these associates would have been privy in some way. I think as you both are saying, there’s a big difference between being pictured with him at an event and being pictured in his hot tub. But okay, if you’re on his plane, if you are at one of his homes, what degree of knowledge could you rightfully have been expected to have of what was going on behind closed doors? And I think that’s one of, in my mind, the kind of reporting questions that remains unanswered about all of this.

LaFrance: I totally agree. It’s sort of treated as though it was an open secret all along, and it certainly appears that way for people like us who’ve come to the information much later than these crimes took place. But that’s a real question for me. It’s almost one of the most basic things. Like, who knew? When did they know? What did they know? It’s just, I feel that that’s fundamental.

Stanley-Becker: Well, I was just going to say, mean, maybe there are materials in this cache of documents that will be forthcoming that will help answer this. I guess I’m not really holding my breath, because of all the previous failures. It seems to me like one of the most salient questions—maybe we can get into this—is whether this will satisfy the kind of ferocious right-wing fascination with Epstein, and the kind of beast that Trump and some of his associates created in how they hyped these documents and the kind of unintended consequences they’ve had to face as a result of that. Can that beast be tamed, and will it continue to dog him politically? is, I think, one of the key political questions, aside from the question about, Will victims get their answers? Are there more co-conspirators who can be brought to justice at this phase?

Warzel: I think to your earlier point there, about what people knew and when, obviously, that’s still a huge open question. I think one of the things that was really dissatisfying for me, going through this as someone who’s been writing about and covering this, as opposed to: In early September, House Oversight Democrats released the infamous, I think it was his 50th birthday, Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th-birthday book, right?

And in that, one of the takeaways outside of showing a purported doodle that Donald Trump made, you know, for Epstein that he had previously denied having made— outside of that, what I think what it revealed to me was a lot of winking, you know, and kind of gesturing from these wealthy friends of Jeffrey Epstein towards this idea that, well, he loves, you know, young women, right? Or, as they’re referred to, girls. We don’t know the age of people that we’re being referred to in some of these things. But it was this idea that there is a little bit of that potentially an open secret, right. That he has predilections, and there are people around him who are either okay with that or willing to overlook that or whatever, and even, you know, put that on paper in some capacity.

And I think what we see here in these documents, you have to sort of, like you said, infer, right? You have to, you know, your imagination has to take over on that. And I think that that’s just extremely unhelpful to people. You have to sort of give yourself, Oh, what did Bill Clinton know and when? What is he up to? What did this person know and when? And I think in that sense, you know, it just obfuscates more than anything.

LaFrance: It also points to this much larger sort of cultural question of what people are willing to tolerate. I mean, it’s kind of fascinating and revealing that it hasn’t even yet come up in this conversation, something that we all know, which is that Donald Trump himself has been credibly accused of multiple sexual crimes. And that, I think with the Access Hollywood tape back in 2016, was the moment where it was sort of like, Well, people, not everyone, but many people are just kind of okay with that. And so to me, there is this much larger cultural question. I mean, it goes to your point of: When? What did people know? What were they willing to sort of look away? What was treated as just sort of, He likes girls, whatever—I mean, it’s just, it’s all of a piece in a way that I don’t think anyone has sort of properly contextualized or explained.

Stanley-Becker: Yeah, Adrienne, I was going to make a really similar point, which is that a lot of the really strong reporting about Trump and Epstein’s relationship has focused on their kind of shared pursuit of women and how they competed against each other and participated in this kind of pursuit of women.

And I think that you mentioned the credible accusations against the president, the Access Hollywood tape, and this continues, this kind of language at least, and approach and rhetoric continues to the present day. So amid all of this, the president was delivering remarks in North Carolina last night. And in the course of many other things—Ilhan Omar, et cetera, immigration—he does this routine about Hillary Clinton, talks about how she’s nasty and he wouldn’t want to go home to a woman like that. So the misogyny, and the kind of discussion of women as objects that men are going home to and finding pleasing or not pleasing remains part of his ongoing schtick, which is shocking when you step back and think about it.

LaFrance: Well, and when you look back to that, you know, we talked about that 1996 tip to the FBI about Epstein. That’s taking place around the time shortly before Bill Clinton has an interaction with an intern in the White House. And so there really is this much larger cultural thing where we have to kind of step back and be like: Wait a minute. How are we treating women in this society? And you think about how that was received culturally and how Monica Lewinsky was the butt of all the jokes at the time. I mean, Clinton, to some extent, but far less so. So all of this just feels really of a piece in a way that I think is important.

Warzel: And it also speaks to that political point-scoring, too, right? I reached out in a piece that I wrote yesterday for The Atlantic to the White House. They came back with comment and said—I want to make sure that I get this right—the Trump administration “has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” was the big takeaway from that. I was asking whether or not Donald Trump wanted to address that there was this complaint, or that there was a photograph of him. But it was very much this Look what we did, using and referencing the victims, using them as a political object in this.

And I think that something that I saw, speaking to this cultural misogyny and the way that all this is treated: I saw people treating this like the Super Bowl on social media, right? Oh my God, they’re here. It’s Christmas come early. The files are here. When you zoom out, what this actually is: Some of this is crime-scene evidence. Some of this is, you know, evidence of either sexual assault or impropriety or sex trafficking. There’s a lot that we don’t know what it’s even showing, because it’s so heavily redacted. This is monstrous at its core. Like, nothing about this is actually funny. It’s super dramatic. It is culturally extremely relevant. It’s politically extremely relevant because of Epstein’s connections to various elites in the world and powerful people.

But this is all—this is, again, this is like a digital crime scene. And it is being treated as, you know, Well, look what we did for the victims, who, you know, according to the great reporting from our colleague, this is something that has actually left a lot of Epstein’s victims high and dry. They don’t feel like they’ve gotten the transparency and the accountability from this that they were hoping. They didn’t even get a meeting with the attorney general at the end of the day about this ahead of the release of the files.

So I fully agree. I think this is, you know—what has happened culturally as a result of this seems to be even more galling in terms of respecting the victims of sex trafficking and sexual assault. And the way that we talk about this in general just seems to underlie that.

LaFrance: Right, well, it’s sort of—I mean, you’re alluding to one of the great contradictions of the internet, which is: You get a bunch of people on a social platform and let them do whatever they want, and things can be awful and monstrous and glib and all the worst possible qualities you can imagine online. But also, this is a week where a tip on Reddit helped lead to the capture of the Brown shooting suspect. So, yeah, I mean, I think it’s complicated that way. I do wonder if—certainly journalists will be working hard, including many of our colleagues and both of you, to make sense of all of this, but this is one where the collision of conspiracy theory and amateur sleuthing and actual professional journalism can be a force for bad, obviously. But I’d be curious what emerges from ordinary people who are combing over these files too.

Warzel: So, you know, to that point of people going through, I want to talk about the broader conspiracy stuff in a second, or the conspiracy theorizing, rather. Do you all feel the response to this was muted, given how these files had been touted, given that “Release the files” has been a hallmark of Trump’s campaigning in the past? This has been a real load-bearing both meme and political issue for a long time. Do you feel like the reaction was more muted than you thought?

LaFrance: I want to hear what Isaac thinks. What I would just say is, I mean, first of all, you mentioned this earlier, but it’s, like, the granddaddy of Friday-night news dumps, meaning these were released at a time when most people are trying to check out for at least a couple of days. And so that’s a huge factor, I think.

And then the other point I would make is just, like, most people are not extremely online. We are, and people who tend to care about the Epstein files are. But most people really aren’t. And so it’s hard to gauge what we should expect and what muted even means. But I do think, and this is a point you’ve both made, is that this isn’t something that’s gonna go away. Even if it—you can try to bury it the Friday before Christmas, but people are intensely interested in this, and that will continue. But, Isaac, I’m curious what you think.

Stanley-Becker: Yeah, I think that this whole situation is kind of shot through with cynicism. So I think people were primed to expect a cover-up, expect unsatisfying answers. I mean, certainly, we’re hoping for some kind of really scandalous reveal, but I think also very much prepared to be let down in that respect. I guess another way of thinking about this is: Is there any kind of release, is there any kind of document that would put an end to the speculation or would satisfy people’s craving for answers, for accountability, for you name it? And I think basically, no. It’s really hard to imagine what that would be.

Again, it speaks to the way in which this sort of beast has been created, and is really hard to feed or to satisfy. So I think the reaction was somewhat muted for some combination of the reasons you both have mentioned, but it’ll be interesting. And I think some of it will depend on what sort of actions, if any, these lawmakers do take, to what extent the outrage and the response is bipartisan, and whether it forces some additional clean-up by the likes of the attorney general and the deputy attorney general.

Warzel: I’ll just put my own feelings out there on this. I was honestly kind of surprised. I understand that the world does not respond the way that terminally online journalists and people who study conspiracy theories and folks who are interested in the way that stuff travels around the internet or whatever. I understand that most people aren’t like that. But it’s been hard to not turn on a television and see file footage of Jeffrey Epstein’s face over the last six months. It’s been the thing politically that has dogged Donald Trump, right? That the story, as you have put it, that will not go away. And I know that it was a Friday-night news dump. I know that it’s—a big holiday is coming up. That people are checking out for, like, two weeks. You know, this is the actual slowest period of the year. I’m still surprised.

Stanley-Becker: What were you expecting? What did you—I’m just interested. What kind of reaction or response would have, in your mind, fit with that kind of fascination wall-to-wall coverage that you’ve been describing?

Warzel: Honestly, the way that the emails in November, from the tranche of emails that the House Oversight Committee put out. Across all the social-media platforms that I’m on, there was so much screenshotting. There was so much. I know everyone’s feed is different. Everyone, you know, has a different experience on the algorithmic internet. Right. But I felt like that was very much a lot of people reacting to, like: Here is helpful information that contextualizes the Epstein experience, right? Like, here is where we are seeing the way that he interacts and corresponds. And I think that may have had to do with the fact that it was emails, you know. Like, it’s hard to see a photo of Jeffrey Epstein, globe-trotting or, you know, on a Jet Ski and say, Well, now I understand everything. You know? Like, it’s much easier to see correspondence between Jeffrey Epstein and someone else over a long period of time.

Stanley-Becker: It makes—yeah, I don’t know. I guess I see what you mean about that. I see it somewhat differently, and it’s making me think of that [Slavoj] Žižek line. I think it’s Žižek, where he talks about the anticipation always being more satisfying than the fulfillment of the anticipation, like looking forward to something is actually always more enjoyable than experiencing it. And I think that’s so true in this case. Like, isn’t it so much fun and so fantastical to imagine what these files might show, what they might reveal, and to talk with all your friends online about them? And then when they actually drop, it’s like, well, of course they’re going to be dissatisfying and not live up to your expectations.

LaFrance: I also just think it’s such a partisan—I mean, like, this is also partly death of the monoculture and fracturing of informational environments. I mean it’s sort of the most boring but also possibly true explanation, which is: A lot of people are tuned out, everybody’s getting their information from different sources, nobody trusts each other, and it’s very hard for any major news event to capture everybody’s attention at once. We very rarely see that now in a way that we used to even five years ago.

Warzel: Well, think, I think especially to Isaac, to your point: I mean, that’s conspiracy theorizing, right? I have written and a lot of people have also talked about: This is an almost perfect conspiracy theory, right, because it blends real crime, real intrigue, real relationships, real wealth, real power with this idea of something that we can’t see that helps to explain the world. And as soon as we understand it, as soon as we can see it, we will know why, you know, things feel the way that they do, right? Why things are dissatisfying, why certain people have power, why, you know—you name it, right? And that reveal is the fact that we don’t ever know. Like, there’s never been a confirmed report that there is a client list, right, of Jeffrey Epstein. There’s his address book, there’s all sorts of just logistical things in his life, but we don’t have that. And yet the Epstein client list remains this load-bearing conspiracy-theory meme, because that would explain everything, right? That would be the skeleton key to unlock the awful behavior of the global elite, and this is what we don’t know, you know?

Stanley-Becker: But correct me if I’m wrong, Charlie, because you would know the origins of this better. I mean, the person responsible for that is the attorney general, the most powerful law-enforcement official in the country, who said that she had access to that document. So, I mean, yes, there’s this kind of swamp of conspiracy theories. But also, there are people in positions of tremendous authority and power who have fed this and given rise to it.

And I think, you know, amid everything else, one of the kind of trends or dynamics of the first year of the second Trump term that I’m personally fascinated by is this dynamic of kind mudslingers and conspiracy theorists, when they’re outside of government, giving rise to these theories, whipping up fascination, and then coming into government and having the authority to prove it or disprove it, and being kind of unwilling or unable to do that. I mean, suddenly, you have the authority to prove what you have claimed, and what do you do? You’re in a real bind in that situation.

LaFrance: This is such a good point, and it also makes me think it’s important to point out that Donald Trump is like the OG version of this, in the sense that he rose to political power based on the birtherism conspiracy theory. And so I think you’re spot-on there.

Stanley-Becker: And Thomas Massie, who’s been the kind of main Republican voice on this, in passing the other day I saw tweeted, If the 2020 election had been a criminal conspiracy theory, why has no one been arrested over it? And it’s an amazing point. And the fact that the people who believe this, the president’s supporters who believe this, have not been dissatisfied, outraged, and demanded something different from their leader is psychologically fascinating. Sorry, I interrupted you.

LaFrance: No, no, I’m totally with you. I mean, the other thing that it makes me think is, like, in terms of the conspiracy theorizing, this Epstein as a conspiracy theory, setting aside the actual crimes, it has fodder for any conspiracy theorist. And it’s important to point this out. Conspiracy theorizing is not tied to one ideology or another. The qualities that sort of unite the people who are drawn to conspiracy theories are intense distrust for government, but power generally. So, like, anti-establishment views, a sense of being aggrieved, or victimhood sort of status. And so if you look at this from that lens and you think, okay, if you’re a conspiracy theorist, and all you wanna do is prove whatever your conspiracy theory about Donald Trump is, you’ve got plenty of fodder there. If you’re an anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist, this is total fodder for that, sort of, the global elite with a powerful Jewish man. So that squarely fits onto that conspiracy theory. And you sort of tick down the list of all of the most potent and dangerous conspiracy theories, and you can see how it maps onto Epstein. And so I feel like that’s a huge part of this as well.

Warzel: I think that’s very true. There is this dynamic, Isaac, also, as you said. I mean, I guess one could say “Don’t put podcasters in charge of the government” is one part of this. But it’s also this: It is so easy to crusade against the government, against the people in power, right, and use that and leverage that.

And what we’ve seemed to be seeing time and again in this administration is: Once you get in that position of power, it becomes really hard to deal with this, right? Like, Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, the FBI, have on some of these other sort of smaller issues have said, You know, now I’ve looked at this thing. You know, it’s not what you think, because just trust me. And that’s really hard position for anyone to be in.

But I think you’re right. The flames of all of this were fanned by this administration, starting with Bondi, you know, referring to a client list. She then later said, I should note, that she was just referring to some of what we looked at over the past day, the files, not the actual client list. But it’s also very clear that back in February, a lot of people probably don’t remember, the administration made binders of information about Jeffrey Epstein and invited a whole bunch of right-wing influencers to come and collect them. And then, again, they’ve denied that this is what they did, but walked them out the door of the White House in front of a pool of press photographers; all the influencers were holding up the binders of this. This has certainly been played up by the administration.

LaFrance: Totally. Well, and the other thing is, with any major mainstream conspiracy theory, you always have to think about the true believers, because there are people who truly believe conspiracy theories and truly worry about victims in cases where there aren’t any. Obviously, there are victims in this case. You think about Pizzagate, which was someone who believed that there was a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor where they were abusing children. There was no evidence that that was true. I actually go to this pizza place all the time. It’s great.

And someone came in with a gun on a crusade. And so, you know, that’s a true believer. You have true believers on all kinds of conspiracy theories. But conspiracy theories also attract grifters and people who are opportunists and using them for political gain, as you point out, that we’ve seen within the Trump administration.

And so the other thing that I think we should watch very carefully going forward is this sort of: As more information comes out, as people are able to watch the administration’s handling of this, you’re going to see more of a divide between the true believers and the grifters. And some true believers may tie themselves in knots, justifying why they still trust Donald Trump or why they still trust Pam Bondi or whoever. But I think it gets harder and harder to have it all hold together when the grifters show themselves so obviously to be grifting.

Warzel: So that’s a great bridge to how I want to kind of tie a bow on this at the end. Which is, do we think this is going to fan the flames? Is this only going to make the conspiracy theory stronger? Do you think in some sense, you know, there’s a little bit of fatigue that might set in here, even politically, right? Like, this is something that also has—it’s tough to capture people’s attention for a long period of time. This story has, for quite a long time. And now with the release of this—I’ll start with you, Isaac—do you see this ramping up, ramping down? Or is this just gonna drag out in a very unsatisfying way for the next forever? What are you thinking in regards to that?

Stanley-Becker: Yeah, I’m sort of torn on this, actually. It has shown remarkable staying power, more so than other dynamics. And I think it’s been one of the areas where President Trump has this kind of Teflon political character, where issues that would be very damaging for others seem to kind of bounce right off of him. I think he has sustained some political damage from this. And I think that as we’ve been discussing, this release was deeply unsatisfying, and there’s a lot of grounds for continued suspicion and concern and attacks. But I also do think that there may be somewhat of a fatigue factor setting in. I think fatigue is—it’s the word I was going to use as well, and the one you used. And maybe that was responsible for some of the muted reaction last night as well, is that people are ready for their kind of fresh outrage, fresh conspiracy theory, fresh kind of gamified experience.

Warzel: And I think also, too, it becomes: The more we know, the more unsatisfying, right? Like, the more that your team is in power, it becomes a little harder to leverage this, right? I think part of the reason that some of the reaction was muted is also because it’s less—there are people who realize that you don’t want to get out over your skis on this, right? Because you don’t know what&#39;s coming next. I feel that there are people, you know, who might want to score political points.

I’ll just say: There’s a lot of right-wing influencers on the internet that I saw who are, like, kind of remarkably quiet, right? Even though, the fact that, I mean, there were some mentions of Bill Clinton, but it wasn’t their Super Bowl of conspiracy theorizing or anything like that. And I think there is, for some of those people, potentially this idea of, like, you don’t know what’s around the corner. You don’t know what’s going to be there. And I think there are more people, strangely enough for 2025, like, playing it a little bit safe with regards to that.

LaFrance: Well, and I’ll just add: I think what all three of us know acutely from being journalists is that something is the biggest story in the world until the next biggest story in the world comes along. And so I think what we’re probably likely to see is this sort of ebbing and flowing. And there’ll be moments where it’s less prominent, and potentially, depending on what the public is able to learn, moments where it comes back again. And so that’s sort of what I think we’ll be watching for and, obviously, trying to report out.

Stanley-Becker: I think also that—I was just gonna say: The theme isn’t going away, of the kind of selective release and weaponization of information by this administration. Adrienne mentioned Pizzagate, and the right-wing influencer responsible for propagating that conspiracy theory, Jack Posobiec, is totally tied in with the administration, with DHS in particular, accompanying Kristi Noem on raids. So I think the administration sees a lot of benefit in some of this conspiracy theorizing. So I expect it to continue, whether it’s about the Epstein files or other issues.

Warzel: So last thing to land this plane: What did we learn? Did we learn anything? If either of you are going to offer a high-level takeaway to somebody who is blissfully enjoying their holiday break and not combing through Department of Justice files over the weekend. Like, Adrienne, I’ll start with you. And then, Isaac, what did you learn?

LaFrance: This is maybe a cop-out, but I don’t know. I don’t think we know yet. I mean, we know there were crimes committed. We know Epstein had associations with powerful people, including at least two presidents. But I think our society could use more people saying “I don’t know.” And so I’m going to say, I don’t know. And I think we need to keep asking questions about it. But yeah, I think we’re very much in the midst of trying to figure this out.

Stanley-Becker: Yeah, no, no, no. Gosh, it’s really tough because there were small bits and pieces, the 1996 tip to the FBI, that to those on the inside of this or tracking it matter. They matter a great deal to understanding why this happened and why victims weren’t believed. But zooming way, way out, I do think it’s a kind of X-ray look at why our politics and society are so broken, because it’s got everything. It’s got the failure of accountability. It’s got the distrust. It’s got the politicization of everything. So I think that’s the bleak takeaway, is that it really is a window into how askew things are in our country and have been for a while.

Warzel: I’m going to be glib, and I’m going to say I learned that the government cannot build a search function that works properly.

Warzel: The website of it all was underwhelming in that sense. No, I think that that’s actually a really good way to end this and to think about this in general, is that if you do zoom out far enough, this is, in some ways, not just this dump of documents, but the whole saga. It feels a little bit like a skeleton key to understanding the frustrations that so many people have, right? The reason why there is a lot of distrust in institutions can be very much explained by the fact that there are wealthy and powerful people, people who currently occupy positions of power who have been seen associating with this person in some capacity, either before or in some cases after this person was a convicted sex offender, right? I think that there is a way that you can look at these things and really get an understanding of, as you said, why a lot of people feel so cynical about government and politics and elites, you know, to use that word in general. I think that is a good takeaway in this.

LaFrance: Can I offer one hopeful note?  Warzel: Oh wow! Hopeful note! Please!

LaFrance: I have hope. What I would say is, it also shows that the truth matters, and people won’t be satisfied until they get the truth. And sometimes the truth is elusive, and that’s very hard. But to me, there is some glimmer of hope that the intense focus on this means that people care about the truth and that people will seek it and report it. And that really does matter. So I’ll just throw that out there.

Warzel: Hell, yeah. Adrienne LaFrance, Isaac Stanley-Becker, thank you for coming on Galaxy Brain. Thank you for taking time out of your holiday break and also trying to make sense of this for all of us. Because, again, this does matter. This is something that is of great importance. So thank you all for your time and your reporting.

LaFrance: Thank you. And I hope the sun comes up soon over there. Is it dawn yet?

Warzel: No. We got like two hours to go here.

Something about getting older makes it easier to say “No, thank you.” On average, older Americans score higher on well-being than younger adults, and much of this is thanks to developing a clearer sense of what’s worth time and attention. At 61 years old, Arthur C. Brooks writes in his recent column, “I will go to considerable personal effort to serve causes that I care about, and I will discuss matters of spiritual depth or scientific importance for hours on end. But small talk in a noisy bar? No chance.”

The idea of saving your energy for what really matters seems obvious, even cliché. But as life’s pressures mount, it can be hard to sift through and make those decisions. Today’s newsletter offers some tips for making the tough choices that will ultimately help life feel more joyful.

Since we&#39;re stepping back in time, I’m going there. Imagine a Beowulf cluster of tape readers! Ignoring if a cluster of tape readers even makes sense.

It&#39;s great that they managed to restore this. Aside from the purely historic interest, early Unix had some fascinating tools - translators for B and SNOBOL and other languages, a text to speech converter, the m6 macro processor, the tmg compiler generator, and the early versions of roff/nroff/troff are very interesting too.

Yet the article cites a recent Stanford University study that found employment among software developers aged 22 to 25 dropped nearly 20% between 2022 and 2025, &quot;coinciding with the rise of AI-powered coding tools.&quot;  


The story is part of MIT Technology Review&#39;s new Hype Correction series of articles about AI.

It depends on your skills level. For trivial beginner stuff, it&#39;s OK but then again.

For anything out of mainstream which no or very few examples are available for the model to train, it&#39;s pretty much useless.

As much as I hate seeing a brute-force approach burn huge amounts of electricity to enable morally dubious applications based on inputs that are often corrupt or illegal, I think the AI bubble is as likely to pop as the Bitcoin bubble.

(You might ask: &quot;Do you mean that AI is a brute-force approach that burns huge amounts of electricity, etc., or that Bitcoin is?&quot;  To which I answer: &quot;Yes.&quot;)

Bitcoin doesn&#39;t lie on what it is and what it does. AI companies on the other hand ...

As much as I hate seeing a brute-force approach burn huge amounts of electricity to enable morally dubious applications based on inputs that are often corrupt or illegal, I think the AI bubble is as likely to pop as the Bitcoin bubble.

The bicoin bubble popped nearly a decade ago. You might remember that time when an iced tea beverage company changed their name to blockchain and shot up in value.

Just because bitcoin&#39;s still around doesn&#39;t mean it hasn&#39;t popped - does the existence of Amazon, Microsoft, Googl

Right now we are in the “first hit is free” phase of trying to get everyone hooked on this AI crap.  All these upstarts are trying to get marketshare and get some spaghetti to stick to the wall and the usage is heavily subsidized by all the startup money gushing in.  Once the influx peters out and these places have to pay their own rent we will see the reality of which companies are able to actually survive and which of the horde are houses of cards.

I fully expect there to be plenty of actual applications, but it will peter out to much more mundane than currently advertised.

That&#39;s just what the LLM is trained on, rather than anyone&#39;s skill at using the LLM.

Here is what keeps happening to me. I keep falling into the same trap.

I throw various simple things at the AI, sort of a Google replacement, and it gives me what I want. I&#39;ll have several successes. And then it will lead me down the wrong rabbit hole, misdirect me, refuse to break out of it&#39;s mistaken path, and waste way way way too much of my time chasing my tail.

Eventually, I&#39;ll arrive at my destination and I&#39;ll ask it why the fuck it took such a circuitous route full of errors and straight up lies to get to the simple and correct answer. It&#39;ll respond saying that it&#39;s complicated and that it doesn&#39;t have all the answers, sorry.

Tomorrow, I&#39;ll start with it all over again like a crack addict.

Yep, this is when the context is full. Nuke the chat and start again.

My current favourite is &quot;Oh, now I understand completely what&#39;s happening&quot; (for the seventeenth time in a row - all of which were too-hasty.

Yeah, one of the things I like about Claude (and Gemini 3 as opposed to 2.5) is that they really clamped down on the use of &quot;Oh, now I&#39;ve got it! This is absolutely the FINAL fix to the problem, we&#39;ve totally solved it now! Here, let me write out FIX_FINAL_SOLVED.md&quot; with some half-arse solution.  And yep, the answer to going in circles is usually either &quot;nuke the chat&quot; or &quot;switch models&quot;.

The key here is that it helps, but it can&#39;t replace you.  Not that I care whether you get replaced, but there are a couple trillion bubble bux riding on whether you can be replaced, so it&#39;s a big deal.

AI companies should pivot to predicting  Anthropogenic Global Warming, I&#39;m sure it will be perfect for that.

All that matters is they have everyone&#39;s money, can influence elections and are too big to fail. Give them a break - AI is hard.

Professional dev in my third decade of experience speaking here. At first, these products really did assist quite a bit. In 2023 and 2024, I found the tools to be pretty decent at offering suggestions for small to medium snippets of code.

Something changed late last year. It may just be that the shine is wearing off, but I find most of the AI products producing less quality results than they did previously.

I rarely ever reach for them anymore. I sure would not rely on them over even an inexperienced junior dev, either.

AI seems to be feeding the bloat habit instead of trimming it. It&#39;s becoming an auto-bloater.

Very few in the industry are interested in parsimony. Devs would rather collect buzzwords for their resume rather than try to trim out layers and eye-candy toys. It&#39;s kind of like letting surgeons also be your general doctor, they&#39;d recommend surgery more often than you really need it.

The principles of typical biz/admin CRUD haven&#39;t really changed much since client/server came on the scene in the early 90&#39;s. Yet the layers and verbosity seem to keep growing. An ever smaller portion of time is spent on domain issues and ever more on the tech layers and parts to support the domain. Something is wrong but nobody is motivated to do anything about it because bloat is job security.

YAGNI and KISS are still important, but is dismissed because it reduces one&#39;s resume buzzword count. The obsession with scaling for normal apps is an example of such insanity: there&#39;s only like a 1 in 50k chance your app or company will ever become FANG-sized, yet too many devs want to  use a &quot;webscale&quot; stack. You&#39;re almost as likely to get struck by lightning while coding it. They patients are running the asylum.

Very few in the industry are interested in parsimony.I&#39;ve come to accept that this as true, and further conjecture that bloat is often a corporate/institutional goal. 
This seems to be a joke [zerobugsan...faster.net], but in reality corporate incentives are aligned to make things more bloated. If you&#39;re a manager, then the more people you have under you, the more power you have. This means you want your people to go slower so you have to hire more of them.  
I don&#39;t have a solution but there must be one.

Eliminate wages, assuming the result still works, would be classed as a productivity gain.

In this, it is decent, and need to be something you actually understand as a result so you can proof read it.But letting it loose on the big code at large is pretty dumb.

But letting it loose on the big code at large is pretty dumb.I do this frequently, with both packaged agents and my modifications to them, just to see what comes out the other side.
Sometimes it&#39;s great, sometimes it&#39;s pretty bad.
I do it as a side job, not my regular work, so the consequences of the failure are minimal- I just throw it away and try again with another modification.
If it were my actual main workflow... I think that would stress me the fuck out- each failure being significant wasted time and money.

If you let it write code freely, you can spend hours or days trying to figure out what the f**k it&#39;s done and why it&#39;s not done what you asked or why it randomly introduces a complete re-write for a single-line fix.

Quite frankly, I don&#39;t want to talk to anyone all day, including an agent. And it&#39;s not really about being anti-social. As most people know, we have two primary brains - logical and emotional. I find that trying to explain what needs to be done the model engages my emotional/social brain too much, and the logical part can&#39;t focus on getting the job done. In order to do quality work, I need to completely ignore the emotional side of my brain and let the logical brain get into the state of flow, where I can accurate track the state of what I&#39;m working on and follow logical workflows only. Talking to an agent all day engages my social side too much to do quality work.

I came across some Emacs elisp code I&#39;d written about 25 years ago, and it looked pretty useful.  Emacs didn&#39;t like it.  I researched the functions and variables and they apparently had been rejiggered about 5 years later.  I said to myself, Self, sez I, this could be an interesting AI test.  I could probably make this do what I want in a few minutes now if I did it from scratch, but that wouldn&#39;t help me understand why it was written that way 25 years ago.

So I asked Grok.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it understood 25 year old elisp code just fine, explained when and how they had been rejiggered, and rewrite it for the current standards.  That was more than I had expected and well worth the time invested.

One other time Grok surprised me was asking how much of FDR&#39;s New Deal legislation would have passed if it had required 2/3 passage instead of just 1/2.  Not only did it name the legislation which would not have passed, it also named all the legislation which had passed by voice vote and there was no way to know if 2/3 had voted for it.  The couple of bills I checked did match and were not hallucinations.  The voice vote business was a nice surprise.

I program now for fun, not professionally.  The idea of &quot;offshoring&quot; the fun to AI doesn&#39;t interest me.  But trying to find 25-year-old documentation and when it changed doesn&#39;t sound like fun, and I&#39;m glad to know I can offshore at least some of the dreary parts.

Huh, what are the odds that MIT releases yet another paper with subjective contrarian views on productivity with AI?

There is a MASSIVE conflict of interest with these MIT papers here, and nobody&#39;s calling it out.So yeah, okay, sure, MIT thinks:

- AI makes you dumber (with methodology nobody without a dedicated lab can duplicate)
 - 95% of ai projects fail (using extremely rigid metrics and ignoring norms in the larger industry to reach conclusions, while including prototypes and showboat projec

I&#39;ve worked for myself as an independent developer for more than a decade now.Apps and websites and I do well working on my own.I&#39;m getting old though that the saying &quot;can&#39;t teach an old dog new tricks&quot;, is starting to make sense.AI couldn&#39;t have come at a better time in my life.As I&#39;ve always warned youth thinking of getting into tech at higher education, the older you are the less valuable you become. The complete opposite of the other white collar grad workers. You want the old experienced doctor, lawyer

As a human, AI workflows let me have a life. I can let the agents knock out the easy things while I&#39;m working on other tasks. I still need design out what&#39;s to be worked on, review the code, fix bone mistakes they make, etc. It&#39;s basically like having a junior developer assigned to you.Every time I see someone talking about AI being a junior developer, I am quite certain they have never worked with a junior developer.

I really do think coding using AI tools is a bit faster, at least it seems that way to me.  As most of the morning but lengthy work can be done faster by AI.

But I am also pretty sure it&#39;s VERY easy to rapidly incur technical debt, especially if you are telling AI to review its own work.  Yeah it will do some stuff but who is to say post review fixes it&#39;s really better?

More than ever I think the right approach to coding with AI is to build up carefully crafted frameworks that are solid (maybe use AI to help

AI might make newbies faster at producing... something.  Probably something full of bugs and security holes.

But it won&#39;t help non-newbies with software development, of which &quot;coding&quot; is a relatively minor part.

I&#39;ve been playing with these genAI system both as code producer but as helper on various tasks.And overall, I find the models quite brittle unless they are fine tuned on the precise task that you want.

The main problem that I see is that the tool is fundamentally a string in string out. But the strings could be absolutely anything including completely insane things without proper fine tuning.

Today, I am writing a simple automatic typo correction tool. The difficult bits are making sure that the tool didn&#39;t crap out. I mean, it is easy to check you actually got an answer from the tool. The problem is that sometimes the tools will tell you: &quot;Sure, I can fix typos. Here is your text corrected: &quot;. Ans so you have to toss that output out probably. But how do you figure out that it shat the bed? Well, you can&#39;t really, it is just as hard as the original task in some cases. So you bake various heuristics, or you get a different LLM to check the work of the first one.

At the end of the day, you really can&#39;t trust anything these tools do. They are way to erratic and unpredictible. And you should treat any of these tools as being possibly adversarial. It&#39;s exhausting to use really.

These wild swings between AI thinning out the workforce and making all our jerbs obsolete to not being sure if AI is even useful is giving me a headache.

It&#39;ll do both... dumb management and bean-counter types will replace people with AI, and the AI will suck at actually getting work done.

Been using the Claude CLI the last few weeks and it has definitely been a great assistant in working with Qt 6, C++, and QML.  The CLI interface is one of the best interfaces I have evey seen, and it&#39;s native use of markdown is ideal.  I am still writing 90% of the code but Claude&#39;s a great way to get information on some aspects of the library that I&#39;m not as familiar with.  I&#39;m not ready to set it loose with nothing but a specifications document yet.

I&#39;ve had it port some code from OpenGL to QRhi (similar t

When using AI to quickly mock up small chunks of code I find it an accelerator.  And I do mean small.

But when code scales up simple systems or API&#39;s it falls apart pretty quickly.  As the scale of the system grows the requirements grow even faster.  GDPR, PII, FIRB, NIST, all start to pile up on as code bases grow.  AI lacks the understand of the &quot;business&quot; need.  So you get this blob of code out and then you have to spend large amounts of time understanding it so you can re-factor it because the AI engine

I use AI regularly, at least once or twice a week. It&#39;s a real productivity boost. It&#39;s completely replaced searching for me. It&#39;s basically an API expert I can talk to and get answers from in 20 seconds. Good stuff.

Example: I&#39;m working on a bad code base of a legacy application. The backend is quite a mess which I don&#39;t really like to touch, so I push a lot of my new logic into our Postgres DB. I don&#39;t really like SQL and anything beyond one or two joins I&#39;d usually avoid. With progbuddy AI I&#39;m doing trigg

KDE deserves to dominate: it&#39;s far better than anything based on Gnome or its derivatives.  KDE dropping X11 [kde.org] is a mistake, however.

Perhaps waylandx [github.com] could help?  Might not work for a whole desktop, though.

Remote access of computers is more important than ever. There was one brief moment in history where it seemed obsolete that the computer you were using was not on your desktop. Today virtually every Linux computer is in a data center somewhere. Getting rid of X is pants on head retarded, and even if it were the right move it should have been done for technical reasons not intentionally causing X to die through lack of maintenance. The Xlibre guy is doing God&#39;s work.

Sadly shade doesn&#39;t work current with kwin on Wayland.  It&#39;s very annoying. Also focus follows mouse is quirky on Wayland.  Other than that KDE on Wayland is pretty fantastic.

> It has its own set of defaults but in no way is it superior to any other window manager

KDE isn&#39;t just a window manager, it&#39;s the whole desktop experience...

For me it&#39;s mainly when I get an idea about how my usage could be more comfortable, so I rearrange stuff, change a few options and experiment.Now I do have trouble using computers that aren&#39;t mine...

Mate was a straight fork of Gnome 2, as such it&#39;s a 2 decade old time capsule.

Gnome 3 then made a series of idiosyncratic UI design choices which polarized the Linux community.

And if work imposes Windows 11 for my day job, I find XFCE/Debian on my home machine to be the least drama in terms of paradigms.

MATE has had plenty of development in the 15 years that it has been in existence.

It started life as a direct fork, and quickly became its own thing.Gnome 3 then made a series of idiosyncratic UI design choices which polarized the Linux community.I think the bigger complaint was the loss of functionality. Simply... gone.
In the intervening time, the GNOME shell plugin ecosystem has effectively filled the gap, and more.

MATE is outdated (but good for resource constrained systems) and GNOME is dumbed down and hard to get good results from, you need a whole bunch of add-ins just to get where KDE is. KDE was very bad in the past, but it&#39;s really come quite a long way. GNOME was really quite good in the past, but it&#39;s really gone the wrong way. I&#39;m not against having a simple mode but I don&#39;t want oversimplification to infest everything.

I&#39;ve been hearing this a bit from very traditional greybeard linux users (I mostly just use linux at work and I&#39;m very much a terminal jocky. tmux is my &quot;terminal manager&quot;.) who have come around to KDE from being strong dislikers of it in the past. That Mate is just crusty and old, Gnome hasn&#39;t really been fun for a while but KDE has solved most of its nonsense problems and is now a quite complete and useable system, so its become their daily driver.

I just want to get alpine functional again so I can revert

The problem is, developers sometimes get too full of themselves and then start making changes that actively get in the way - which is where Gnome appears to be right now, for instance.

I want a window manager that lets me do what I need but mostly stays out of my way. Right now, for me, that&#39;s cinnamon.

This is why I first went to fluxbox without taskbar/decorations (on Debian) and later bare openbox (on Devuan) because the ctrl key stuck too often after switching workspaces.

There&#39;s nothing else but the programs and the unintrusive osd clock on my screen. It&#39;s the best &quot;desktop experience&quot; I&#39;ve had in decades of computer use.

I already realised during the Windows days that while changing colours and wallpaper is fun, it&#39;s mostly useless when 99.99% of the time the actually used programs obscure everything.

Went from Ubuntu with Gnome 2 on my first private laptop to Debian/KDE to now Devuan/openbox because all I need is the graphical part to display the programs I use. Everything else (taskbar, wallpaper, even window decorations) don&#39;t add anything to my &quot;desktop experience&quot; because it either takes up space or can&#39;t be seen anyway

On Thursday, the board of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts voted to rename the center “the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” Weirdly, the board of the center, mostly picked by President Donald Trump, does not seem to understand that a “memorial” center is named for someone who is deceased, and thus the new name implies that Trump is dead. By Friday, Trump’s name was physically added to the building at the behest of his handpicked board. Don’t be fooled by the absurdity of Trump’s vanity and the obsequiousness of these government officials: This is not an at all an innocuous move.

American political culture has long rejected he idea that sitting officer holders, or even living persons, should be honored with buildings or institutions named for them, or have their names and faces on currency, coins, or postage stamps. This sort of behavior is alien to a republic and a democracy. It is common, however, in dictatorships. Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Francisco Franco had heir faces on stamps, currency, and coins during their respective despotic reigns. Josef Stalin appeared on numerous stamps while he was the dictator of the Soviet Union and renamed a major city Stalingrad, after himself. Kim Jong-un sometimes appears on North Korean stamps.

The first United States stamps featured Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, many decades after their deaths. Our coins reflect this tradition as well, with Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John F. Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower, Susan B. Anthony, and Sacagawea getting their faces on coinage posthumously. The tyrannical Confederate government, on the other hand, put its leaders on stamps and currency, breaking with the long United States tradition of not honoring living people in these ways.

The traditions around the naming of buildings and institutions in our democracy have been similar. And the names are often the result of nonpolitical, bipartisan decisions. Our nation’s capital was called the District of Columbia until 1802—three years after the death of George Washington—when the city of Washington was chartered. By this time Washington was seen as the “father” of our country, but his political party, the Federalist Party, was no longer in power. The Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson supported the name change. Dulles airport in Washington was named for the deceased Republican Secretary of State John Foster Dulles during the Democratic administration of Kennedy. When it opened, there was talk about changing the name, but the Kennedy administration kept it. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia was responsible for the creation of New York Municipal Airport, which opened in 1939. Shortly before he died of cancer, and after he was no longer mayor, the city named the airport for him. Similarly, Congress renamed Washington National Airport for Ronald Reagan in 1998, long after Reagan had left politics, and four years after he had announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease—and with Democrat Bill Clinton in the White House. O’Hare International Airport in Chicago was named for Edward Henry “Butch” O’Hare, the first Navy pilot to win the Medal of Honor, who died in combat in 1943.

Cultural institutions are often named for those who donated to them, were leaders of them, or used their influence to create them. The Smithsonian is named for James Smithson, a British scientist who endowed the museum with a gift in his will. Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History began in 1893 but was renamed in 1905, a year before its main benefactor, Marshall Field, passed away. New York City’s Hayden Planetarium was named for a banker, Charles Hayden, who funded its creation, and passed away two years after it opened.

Which brings us to the Kennedy Center. The idea of a national cultural center had bounced around American politics for three decades before President John F. Kennedy pushed for legislation to create it, using both public and private money. The center opened in 1971, nearly eight years after JFK was assassinated. It was formally named the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Richard Nixon, a Republican, was president when it opened. In fact, Kennedy had beaten Nixon in the 1960 presidential election, but Nixon did not try to change the name. He did attend a performance there in the Eisenhower Theater, which also opened in 1971. Bipartisanship and honoring deceased leaders were etched into the building, literally.

Now Trump has physically etched a different, more sinister tradition into its walls.

The bottom line here is simple. For nearly 250 years the United States has not “honored” sitting political leaders by naming buildings or cultural institutions for them. Presidents have never appointed a board to an institution and then pressured that board to rename the institution for the president. Presidents have not signed bills, or issued executive orders, to name things after themselves. Dictators, emperors, führers, czars, kings, and “dear leaders” do such things, because it makes them feel good, powerful, and strokes their fragile egos. Presidents of a republic do not act in this way.

It is unseemly, it is childish, and it is thoroughly un-American. But it is also a warning of a path we must not continue to travel down.

Judges around the country have begun to show a simmering fury at the conduct of federal agents, including those carrying out the increasingly brutal immigration crackdowns in predominantly blue cities nationwide. At the same time, many of the same judges have begun to balk at being extravagantly and shamelessly deceived by Justice Department lawyers defending that conduct in their courtrooms. On Thursday, another federal district court judge, Gary R. Brown, lit into the Trump administration for effectively torturing immigrants in a manner that “shocks the conscience.” His 24-page ruling also castigated both Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and government lawyers for submitting “evasive and demonstrably false” claims to the court under oath. Brown, a Donald Trump appointee, also raised the serious possibility of imminent contempt proceedings against those who lied to him.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed lower court judges’ escalating efforts to hold government officials accountable for shameless fabrications, contemptuous behavior, and egregious violations of immigrants’ constitutional rights. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This picks up themes from our main show with the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt, who warned us that during Trump 1.0, the lawyering could be sloppy, but it at least conformed to norms and basic rules of truth. Now the obligation of candor is simply gone, and lying to a judge’s face is a-OK. Can you tell us what happened in Judge Brown’s court?

Mark Joseph Stern: Judge Brown explained why he ordered the release of Erron Anthony Clarke, a noncitizen whom ICE detained even though he legally entered the country and has no criminal record whatsoever. ICE accused Clarke of overstaying his visa and arrested him. Brown wrote that agents may have arrested him without securing the necessary charging documents or identifying probable cause, then fudged the paperwork to obscure the fact that they acted before they had lawful authority to do so.

But set that aside. ICE then locked Clarke up at the Central Islip federal courthouse, placing him in a tiny cell designed for one person along with eight other men. They had no access to bunks, bedding, soap, showers, toothbrushes, or clean clothes. The cell was literally freezing cold. The lights stayed on 24 hours a day. The detainees had to sleep on the floor, crowded around an open toilet that reeked of urine.

Clarke challenged his detention, arguing due process violations. When it first appeared that Judge Brown was going to release him, ICE transferred him to a different facility in Newark. Brown still ordered him released immediately. ICE blatantly defied the order, holding Clarke overnight. Brown then demanded more information about Clarke’s confinement. On Thursday, he said that what ICE provided was “preposterous,” “rank hearsay,” “evasive and demonstrably false,” and filled with “material misstatements.” He accused ICE agents of lying repeatedly—quite possibly to make it seem like Clarke spent less time in torturous conditions than he did, or to cover up its effort to evade the court’s orders by transferring him to other locations. Brown also said that ICE refused to provide key details about the holding cell at the Islip courthouse. He warned that ICE has started exploiting these holding cells to cram multiple detainees into tiny spaces for long periods, subjecting them to what is essentially torture.

Brown asked for a photo of the Islip cell, but ICE would not even provide it on the grounds that doing so would “create privacy concerns” for detainees. He was having none of this. As he wrote on Thursday: “After nearly 35 years of experience with federal law enforcement in this judicial district, encompassing service as a prosecutor and a judge, I have never encountered anything like this. ICE’s seeming disregard of procedural requisites, combined with the chillingly brutal conditions of confinement to which Petitioner has been, and presumably would continue to be subjected, cries out for immediate remedy.” And so he found that there were “extraordinary circumstances” here that required him to grant bail and release Clarke.

I want to unpeel the onion for one quick second. It’s not just the horrifying misconduct on the part of ICE. It’s the lying. And in that sense, it feels again like we’re back in Judge James Boasberg’s courtroom with a judge who is confronted with blatant misrepresentations. According to Brown, ICE claimed that it moved Clarke from a facility to another in eight minutes, but it’s a 35-minute drive. So unless there’s an ICE rocket ship we don’t know about, these are just blatant falsifications. It does raise this question, which is the same question Judge Boasberg is exploring in D.C.: Is there some possibility that there could be consequences?

Yes, there are. This was not just a cri de coeur against ICE. There is a real possibility of consequences. Judge Brown ordered counsel for ICE to tell him why he shouldn’t enter an order of contempt as punishment for ICE’s defiance of his orders. That means he is strongly considering contempt—maybe civil, maybe criminal—against ICE agents who lied to him repeatedly and conspired to defy his orders.

Crucially, Judge Brown isn’t just considering contempt because of conduct that occurred outside his courtroom. He’s looking at ICE’s defiance of his own orders by lying to him in declarations submitted to his court, lies evidently abetted by DOJ attorneys. That actually takes this beyond Judge Boasberg’s saga, because this seems to involve cut-and-dry, eminently demonstrable perjury. I know there are a lot of hurdles that Brown would have to overcome to bring a contempt proceeding with teeth, but I do think he has a good reason to try. This case could easily escalate into the next judicial attempt to hold people accountable who absolutely need to be in order for us to protect the rule of law.

In mid-March of 2025, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt and his colleagues started hearing that the Trump administration might attempt a flagrantly lawless publicity stunt, involving migrant men, secret flights to El Salvador, a notorious gulag, and a total disregard for due process. Despite getting word that something was about to happen, and rushing into a Saturday night hearing, and then securing a TRO from DC judge James Boasberg, Lee and his colleagues were unable to prevent more than 250 men from being renditioned from Texas to the CECOT torture prison in El Salvador. The legal cases spawned by the dramatic events of March 15th 2025 haven’t gone away, indeed they are reaching crucial milestones in the courts, raising foundational questions about the abuse of statutes and what it means to defy court orders. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is joined by the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt who is litigating these cases, to discuss the very high stakes of a set of cases that may have fallen off your radar in the shuffle.

How these cases play out will dictate much of what happens for the rest of Trump’s term in office by answering democracy-defining questions such as whether the antiquated and radical wartime powers of the Alien Enemies Act can be unleashed on people the government deems enemies domestically, whether court orders are actually directives the Trump DoJ is bound  to follow, whether the district courts can require Pam Bondi’s justice department to assist in the finding of fact, and whether the ancient legal concepts protecting liberty of due process and habeas corpus have the force of law in Trump’s America.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A staffer at the USA’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tried to disable backup generators powering some of its Network Time Protocol infrastructure, after a power outage around Boulder, Colorado, led to errors.

As explained in a mailing list post by Jeffrey Sherman, a NIST supervisory physicist who maintains the institute’s atomic clocks, “The atomic ensemble time scale at our Boulder campus has failed due to a prolonged utility power outage.”

Sherman, whose LinkedIn bio proclaims he is “One of the few federal employee actually paid to watch the clocks all day,” says one impact of the incident “is that the Boulder Internet Time Services no longer have an accurate time reference.”

That’s bad because one of the things NIST uses its atomic clocks for is to provide a Network Time Protocol service, the authoritative source of timing information that the computing world relies on so that diverse systems can synchronize events. If NTP isn’t working, outcomes can include difficulties authenticating between systems, meaning applications can become unstable.

At this point, readers might wonder why NIST can’t just turn off the inaccurate service. Sherman said a backup generator kicked in and kept the servers running.

“I will attempt to disable them [the generators] to avoid disseminating incorrect time,” he wrote.

But the storms that caused the outage were so severe, only emergency services personnel are allowed to visit the site.

His post says he has seen “strong evidence one of the crucial generators has failed. In the downstream path is the primary signal distribution chain, including to the Boulder Internet Time Service.”

“Another campus building houses additional clocks backed up by a different power generator; if these survive it will allow us to re-align the primary time scale when site stability returns without making use of external clocks or reference signals,” he added.

Xcel Energy, the local utility, blamed the outage on strong winds and as of Saturday night local time (7:00PM MT Dec 20, 2:00AM UTC Dec 21) advised most customers would have power again within three hours.

However at the time of writing – 00:15 MT Dec 21 – NIST’s status page states the Boulder site is experiencing “Facility outages” and a “< 4.8us clock error.” That’s about four microseconds.

NIST told CBS News it warned users such as telcos and aerospace organizations that weather around Boulder could cause problems, and advised them to tap the org’s other sources of time information.

That’s sound advice as best practice for using NTP is to specify multiple servers, and failover from troubled sources of time info to accurate ones. This incident therefore shouldn’t trouble the prudent, but may leave some NTP feed users unawares if they rely solely on the Boulder facility’s time feeds. ®

            <div id="article-text">If you were hoping for some relief from stratospheric memory pricing, don&#39;t hold your breath. DRAM prices aren&#39;t expected to peak until at least 2026, TechInsights analyst James Sanders tells El Reg.

DRAM is an incredibly broad category and includes everything from the DDR5 found in desktops and servers to the GDDR7 and HBM used by graphics cards and AI accelerators.

The market is also notoriously volatile and prone to wild swings in pricing, spiking as inventories are drawn down and cratering as new capacity is brought online, Sanders explains.

As chip markets go, DRAM is about as volatile as they get. - Click to enlarge

According to TechInsights, memory pricing was already on the rise in 2024, growing 88 percent from a rather steep valley the year prior. Based on previous DRAM booms, one might expect it to grow at a slower pace in 2025, before contracting in 2026 or 2027.

However, Sanders tells us that&#39;s unlikely to happen this time around. &quot;I think we&#39;re looking at the peak in 2026,&quot; he said, adding that even then he only expects DRAM prices to settle in 2027 before rising again in 2028.

So what&#39;s to blame for the sky-high memory prices? Well, as you might have already guessed, it&#39;s AI. But it&#39;s not the full story. Timing is also a factor.

According to Sanders, the AI boom kicked off at what was very possibly the worst time for memory vendors. &quot;This demand started in the Valley for the DRAM industry. That makes financially trying to build additional capacity really challenging,&quot; he said. &quot;If you&#39;re rushing, the time to bring additional capacity online is about three years. It&#39;s a quirk of bad timing that&#39;s led to the circumstances that we&#39;re in now.&quot;

More realistically, DRAM vendors, like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, are looking at four or five years to ramp production at a new fab, at which time the market conditions could have changed considerably.

Timing is also why the DRAM shortage is hitting some harder than others. &quot;The consumer market is in the stratosphere, whereas OEMs are about a year out, and they&#39;re not getting heartburn quite yet,&quot; he explained.

In other words, giant hardware vendors like Dell and HP aren&#39;t suffering nearly as much because they tend to lock in their orders early, while smaller vendors are at the mercy of spot pricing. In fact, ahead of the Christmas holiday, G.Skill, a supplier of memory for gamers, issued a statement pinning the blame for jacking the price of its products on AI.

&quot;DRAM prices are experiencing significant industry-wide volatility, due to severe global supply constraints and shortages, driven by unprecedented high demand from the AI industry,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;As a result, G.Skill procurement and sourcing costs have substantially increased. G.Skill pricing reflects industry-wide component cost increases from IC suppliers and is subject to change without notice based on market conditions.&quot;

What&#39;s more, AI is driving demand for a different class of memory that, unlike traditional DRAM, isn&#39;t much use in most consumer applications.

&quot;This is a little bit different from previous boom-bust cycles, in that wafers are being redirected toward HBM and away from consumer-grade memory,&quot; Sanders said.

High-bandwidth memory consists of multiple layers of DRAM, which as the name implies, enables it to achieve much higher bandwidth than a typical DRAM module you might find in a notebook or RDIMM. With HBM3e, it&#39;s not uncommon to see a single 36 GB chip deliver 1 TB/s of bandwidth. By comparison, a single 8 GB LPDDR5x module might be able to achieve 140 GB/s.

HBM is used almost exclusively in high-end datacenter GPUs and AI accelerators, like Nvidia&#39;s B300, AMD&#39;s MI355X, or Amazon&#39;s Trainium3. Because of this, Sanders says, the memory market is rapidly diverging.

&quot;Because there&#39;s no consumer demand for HBM — the consumer market can&#39;t bear that price at all — it is really becoming two markets that are detached from each other,&quot; he said.

Memory vendors are currently in the midst of a memory transition as they prepare to ramp production of HBM4 modules, which will power chips like Nvidia&#39;s Vera Rubin and AMD&#39;s MI400s starting next year. Initially, Sanders says these chips will command a price premium.

And while TechInsights does expect the memory market to settle in 2027, it won&#39;t last. As you may recall, Nvidia plans to cram 576 Rubin-Ultra GPUs each equipped with a terabyte of HBM4e memory into a single rack starting in, that&#39;s right, 2027.

This might explain why Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra recently told investors that due to strong AI datacenter demand, &quot;aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future.&quot;

Not that he&#39;s really complaining. While end customers are grappling with memory prices that have gone up 3x in just a few months, the memory fabs are raking in the cash. In Micron&#39;s Q1 2026 earnings call this month, the company saw revenues rise 56 percent while net income more than doubled from $1.87 billion this time last year to $5.24 billion.

And while memory vendors may now have the capital necessary to finance additional fabs, it&#39;ll be at least three more years before they enter production. And even when they do, the bulk of capacity is likely to be allocated toward HBM and other enterprise products.

One wildcard in all of this is China&#39;s CXMT, Sanders explains.

&quot;CXMT doesn&#39;t necessarily play by the same set of rules that everyone else does,&quot; he explained.

For one, they don&#39;t have any meaningful HBM output at this time. Second, many had expected the company to focus heavily on DDR4, but instead, Sanders says the company now appears to be transitioning to DDR5.

Today, CXMT isn&#39;t a very large player in the DRAM business. It certainly doesn&#39;t help that the company is subject to United States export controls. Despite this, TechInsights expects the company to grow considerably by the end of the decade from five to 10 percent of the market, which should in theory help grow the supply of DDR5 overall. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">hands on Infinite Machine, a New York-based electric vehicle startup, began with a stolen Vespa.

Eddie Cohen, president and co-founder of the company, told The Register that he and his brother Joseph were living together during the COVID outbreak.

&quot;His Vespa had gotten stolen and we just kinda had this crazy idea … if we were to design one for the future that was all-electric, had the best technology, what would it look like? What would it feel like?&quot; Cohen explained.

As I stood beside P1, a $10,000 electric seated scooter, and Olto, a $3,495 bike-lane legal class 2 e-bike, that question had been answered. The brothers&#39; company started shipping the P1 to customers in October and expects to deliver Olto in early 2026.

&quot;We just started dabbling and we came up with P1, you know, just a sketch,&quot; said Cohen, who had a background in product design. &quot;And then, over the subsequent two or three years, we just continued to noodle on it. Nights and weekends, we both had other jobs.&quot;

In January, 2024, he said, Infinite Machines became their full-time job. He and his brother assembled a team and began moving from sketch to actual product.

&quot;So P1 is a plated, M-class vehicle,&quot; said Cohen, meaning drivers should be licensed for motorcycles unless they only use it in Mode 1, where speed is capped at 30 mph.

&quot;It goes 65 miles an hour, 60-mile range. The battery is in the floor. It fits two people. It has a full touchscreen – 8.5&quot; display – that has what we call Phone Connect. So it connects to your iPhone, you get Maps. Music, etc. It has whisper-quiet acceleration. It&#39;s kind of like riding a Tesla for the first time, but it&#39;s even more surreal because it&#39;s silent.&quot;

The P1, said Cohen, was designed from scratch. &quot;All of the componentry is custom-toolled and developed. That&#39;s not a trivial thing.&quot;

He pointed to the fender for example. It&#39;s not off the shelf.

&quot;We designed it,&quot; he said. &quot;We made the tooling. We made the molds, and made it so that the engineering works just because we actually care about the details.&quot;

It&#39;s an opinionated design. The use of anodized aluminum and steel makes comparisons with the Tesla Cybertruck unavoidable. But the DMC DeLorean is an equally apt comparison, perhaps more so given the challenging nature of startup vehicle companies.

&quot;We were inspired by the Cybertruck,&quot; said Cohen, &quot;but we didn&#39;t set out to design the Cybertruck of scooters. We used it as one reference point in a lineage of vehicles, like Marcelo Gandini and the Lancias back in the day. The Diablo, the Countach, the DeLorean, like these are all references that we love.&quot;

Cohen added that the plan is to explore future colors, and variants for specific markets like police and other first responders.

Your correspondent had the opportunity to take the P1 for a spin in San Francisco and it was a thrill – it&#39;s fun, fast, and handles well. I&#39;m not by nature a rider of scooters or motorcycles, though I&#39;ve enjoyed the lazy ease of electric bikes. Were I a younger man, more willing to mix it up among motorists without the protection of an automotive frame, airbags, and a seatbelt, I&#39;d be looking seriously at the P1 or the more modest Olto for urban transportation.

The P1 includes just the right number of physical buttons, with well-conceived software and hardware. It features secure storage, front and rear cameras, phone-based keyless access, and GPS location tracking, among other niceties. It relies on a Linux fork called IMOS, Infinite Machine OS.

Presently, there&#39;s no AI on-board – which this reporter considers a selling point. Cohen recounted how someone had asked the company&#39;s head of systems what AI is being explored. &quot;He kind of was like, &#39;Look, they&#39;re expensive, right? You put a Nvidia chip on here and you put a camera and it&#39;s expensive. It adds to the [bill-of-materials] cost. And it&#39;s not obvious that there is value there.&quot;

He added however that the company has ideas for ways AI might be useful to improve the safety of two-wheeled vehicles.

Software applications for the vehicles will be developed in time. Cohen said that Infinite Machine does gather data to understand how people are using its vehicles, but does so in a way that respects privacy.

&quot;So we don&#39;t know anything about the individual rider and we have anonymized everything,&quot; he said. &quot;We care about rider privacy. We also care about, like, you buy this vehicle, it&#39;s just gonna work. Like you don&#39;t have to pay a subscription ever. It&#39;s just gonna work all the time and it&#39;s your vehicle. But we do anonymize and track usage.&quot;

Cohen said he expects the target market in the US will be those who appreciate technology and design. &quot;They want something that&#39;s new and they want the best,&quot; he said.

&quot;In 2025, the ultimate luxury is really time and freedom to do what you want. And P1 saves you time. It&#39;s the fastest and best way to get around any city like in San Francisco, this thing is liberating. It&#39;s amazing. It handles the hills totally well. You can park it anywhere. You don&#39;t have to spend 30 minutes looking for a spot. You get to live life on your own terms.&quot;

Cohen expects the Olto will have broader appeal.

&quot;For Olto, I think it&#39;s for everyone,&quot; he said &quot;I think it&#39;s the mom in Brooklyn dropping her kids to school. I think it&#39;s the person that is single and wants to commute to work. I think it&#39;s the SoCal kid that&#39;s going to school. This is an accessible vehicle. It&#39;s very easy to ride, very approachable, and affordable.&quot; ®

The holidays have a way of sneaking up on us. One minute you’re trick-or-treating with your kids, and the next you’re panic shopping in a Buc-ee’s gift aisle. But it doesn’t have to be that way. With the right cheat sheet, you can keep the holiday spirit high and stress levels low.

Fortunately, we did some planning on your behalf. As much as we love playing with the latest gadgets and gizmos here at The Verge, we also love recommending them. That’s why, after consulting with our expert team of writers and editors, we’ve compiled a medley of gift ideas that won’t be regifted come this time next year — from noise-canceling earbuds and e-readers to retro-inspired Polaroid cameras. Not every gift needs to be a grand gesture, though. Sure, a new gaming handheld makes for a great gift, but so does an affordable power bank.

The list below is just a fraction of what we’re recommending this holiday season. We’ve also curated guides for specific budgets and hobbies, whether you’re shopping for mom, dad, or even the avid tinkerer or budding gamer in your life. ’Tis the season, after all.

Whether your giftee likes to rock out to Sabrina Carpenter or Stravinsky, the AirPods Pro 3 deliver. Apple’s latest pair of earbuds offer improved ANC and sound, a more comfortable design, and real-time fitness tracking courtesy of a new heart rate sensor. That makes them well suited for more than just listening to tunes.

Most people don’t want to wrangle cables… and who can blame them? Not us, which is why several folks at The Verge own Baseus’ handy, retractable USB-C option. The Free2Pull comes in two sizes, each of which conveniently pulls the excess cable into a small puck that’s far tidier and easier to manage than a loose cord.

Ray-Ban’s latest smart glasses are kind of like having a phone built directly into a pair of shades. You can use them snap 12-megapixel stills, record short-form video, listen to music, and take calls, all without having to pull out your phone. Plus, this time around, you can actually use them for a full day without the batteries dying.

Cassettes, like some other physical media formats, are having a moment. We Are Rewind is capitalizing on that fact with a modern aluminum deck that looks Walkman-esque but comes equipped USB-C charging, Bluetooth 5.1, and a rechargeable battery that provides up to 12 hours of continuous playback.

Hoto’s rechargeable screwdriver is ideal for small repairs. It offers three torque modes, a rotational speed of up to 220rpm, and a helpful circular LED for illuminating dark spaces. Meanwhile, the durable case holds all 25 steel bits and an extension bar for getting into hard-to-reach places.

BioLite’s versatile lighting kit comes with six hangable bulbs and six “hammer-proof” stakes, so you can set the ambiance at your campsite or even illuminate a workspace. The included solar-powered charging case can recharge each bulb twice, providing extended use when you’re off the grid, and each weatherproof bulb provides up to 20 hours of continuous use per charge.

Despite its terrible name, Govee’s Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL really is a great smart lamp / Bluetooth speaker combo. The jazzy, color-changing lamp features individually controllable LEDs that can sync with your music and other Govee lights, as well as more than 100 preset scenes tailored toward reading or hosting your next shindig.

A level is an essential tool for DIYers, and none is more foolproof than Franklin’s 12-inch Light Level. The magnetic device turns red when it’s crooked and green when it’s level, so you don’t have to rely solely on a bubble vial (though it includes two built-in bubble vials as well). It runs on a single AA battery and can be seen from almost every angle, regardless of how bright your environment is.

Two things most people need at some point are a flashlight and a Bluetooth tracker. So why not gift both devices at once? The FlashFinder is a rechargeable, 300-lumen light outfitted with a magnetic mount you can track via Apple’s Find My network, so you never have to worry about trying to find the flashlight — or your keys — again.

Wes Anderson’s directing style is so distinct that it’s spawned a series of books dedicated to its aesthetic. The Wes Anderson Archive collects all of his films from Bottle Rocket through The French Dispatch in a single box set. The 20-disc trove includes every film on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray, plus more than 25 hours of special features and 10 illustrated booklets containing essays and interviews.

At this point, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better Android watch than the Pixel Watch 4. Google’s latest wearable upped the ante with a handsome domed display, all-around better battery life, and improved activity tracking. You also get dual-frequency GPS and access to Gemini, which is accessible via a surprisingly natural raise-to-talk gesture.

A massage gun is the kind of gift that keeps on giving. When muscles and tendons are tight or sore, the three-speed Theragun Mini serves as a quick and easy remedy, allowing your giftee to get on with their day with less discomfort. The latest model is slightly smaller than prior iterations, making what was already an ultra-portable device even more compact.

Instant cameras let us live in the moment more than phones can, and the Polaroid Flip is one of our favorite models. The vintage-look shooter greatly reduces the likelihood of wasted film with four auto-changing lenses, sonar-powered autofocusing, and other handy features. Just make sure to grab some black-and-white or color I-Type film to go with it.

A desk pad is a simple, affordable way to elevate your entire setup. Twelve South’s is made from soft vegan leather that’s comfortable and looks great, with a textured surface that provides subtle resistance for more precise mouse movements. And, like any good pad, it protects your workspace from dings and spills while keeping accessories in place.

Amazon gave its Kindle lineup a much-needed jolt with the introduction of the Kindle Colorsoft last year, its first color E Ink ebook reader. Now it’s back with a cheaper 16GB model that offers many of the same perks, including up to eight weeks of battery life and a 7-inch display that’s great for comics and graphic novels.

Anker’s Nano Travel Adapter is a versatile charger for globe-trotters. It features four plug types, providing compatibility in over 200 countries, along with an AC connector, two USB-A ports, and two USB-C ports. The adapter is also relatively tiny — each plug type either extends / retracts or folds up — so it’s easy to slot into your bag.

They say variety is the spice of life, which makes the Good Hurt Fuego box doubly so. Thoughtfully’s 20-pack of tiny hot sauce bottles includes flavors like cilantro jalapeño, bacon cayenne, and ghost pepper. Each bottle contains 0.7 fluid ounces of sauce, too, which is enough to get a taste before you lather them on your favorite pair of wings, Hot Ones-style.

Don’t get tripped up by the “poetry” part — the Magnetic Poetry Kit is really just about having fun with words. The Original Edition comes with more than 300 magnetic tiles to mix and match, allowing you to cover your fridge with random thoughts, inside jokes, and other carefully chosen creations.

Powerful power banks don’t have to be cumbersome. Iniu’s 10,000mAh P50 is about as thick as a deck of cards, but features 45W charging speeds, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port. Its braided lanyard also doubles as a USB-C cable, providing everything you need to keep all of your electronics fully juiced on the go.

Know someone who has recently joined the pickleball revolution? Meet the Selkirk Nexus Max, a durable fiberglass paddle with a cushioned grip and a large sweet spot, one that allows even beginners to hit the ball with more control and consistency. The attractive color combos are just an added plus.

Bentoheaven’s stackable bento box is slicker than most lunch bags. It comes with two large, 7.3-inch containers, a divider to help keep foods separated, and a smaller container for stashing snacks. The top container even has a compartment in its lid for utensils, and a velcro strap prevents the bento from opening in your bag.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 breaks the mold of classic RPGs. The story is just as grandiose and gripping as the best Final Fantasy games, but by allowing you to dodge and parry every enemy attack, it flips more traditional turn-based combat on its head. Then there’s the score and visually striking world, both of which are just as refreshing to behold.

The Echo Dot Max is an elegant redesign of Amazon’s orb-shaped smart speaker, with high-quality knit fabric, a flat face, a new LED ring, and touch controls. It’s the first Echo Dot with Amazon’s improved two-way speaker system and support for its new AI-powered assistant, Alexa Plus, which is enabled out of the box.

The Notes app is great, but sometimes pen and paper are where it’s at. Field Notes are small enough to fit in your pocket or a small bag, yet spacious enough to house all your big ideas and errant thoughts. The “Flora” Edition can even add a much-needed pop of color to any desk setup.

Just because GuliKit’s ES Pro costs significantly less than Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller doesn’t mean it’s cheaply made. It’s equipped with anti-drift TMR joysticks with adjustable sensitivity, an eight-direction D-pad, and the rare ability to wake the Switch 2. Not bad for a gamepad that retails for a third of the price.

The FreeSip Sway features an attractive, contoured design that’s comfortable to hold with one hand; however, unlike previous Owala bottles, it tapers at the bottom, allowing you to stash it in your car’s cupholder. The reusable bottle also features a bucket handle, a push-button lid, and a dual-function spout with a straw for sipping and a wider opening for big gulps.

The Switch 2 is arguably the best gaming handheld available — especially now that it’s actually, truly available. Nintendo’s latest hybrid console packs a larger 7.9-inch 1080p display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and a host of other minor, albeit welcome improvements that build upon what was already a winning formula in our book.

The original LifeStraw was designed for those heading into the backcountry. The new LifeStraw Sip? Not so much. The reusable steel straw is geared more toward travelers than outdoor enthusiasts, though fortunately it still manages to remove about 99.99 percent of microplastics, bacteria, and parasites from your drinking water.

They might cost $50 more than their predecessor, but the latest iteration of Sony’s best-in-class noise-canceling headphones deliver on every front. The WH-1000XM6 make subtle improvements to every facet, from sound quality to ANC performance, while wisely bringing back the foldable design last seen on the XM4.

The holidays are a cause for celebration, but all those parties can also make for a complete mess. Luckily, the S8 MaxV Ultra can handle a good chunk of cleaning on your behalf. The handy robovac can scrub floors with its vibrating mop, dodge clutter using AI, and empty its own waste bin, so you can relax once the festivities are over.

Using an ice cube in a cocktail will keep it cool, but the melting ice will steadily dilute the flavor. Thankfully, a set of proper whiskey glasses can save your spirits. When chilled, Liiton’s dishwasher-safe Mount Everest crystal can cool your drink in under a minute, letting you enjoy your latest concoction at your own pace.

This past year might not have been as life-shattering for most as 2020, but we’d argue life doesn’t have to be pure chaos for a stress ball to come in handy. The NeeDoh Groovy Glob, like all of Schylling’s colorful dough-filled shapes, makes for an inexpensive release that can be squeezed, squashed, and pulled to your heart’s content.

What’s the point of a clippable zip-up bag this small? Basically, you can use it to stash anything you would otherwise put in your pocket but fear slipping out. That includes chapstick, cash, cards, earbuds, you name it. Just be sure to leave the actual street tacos at your local tienda.

Remarkable’s first pocket-friendly device is essentially what you would get if you were to split last year’s Paper Pro in half. The slim note-taking device boasts weekslong battery life and a 7.3-inch color E Ink display, which, despite offering a slower refresh rate than a Kindle, is known for producing more vibrant and accurate colors.

The Backbone Pro might be the most flexible controller out there. Like prior models, the USB-C gamepad lets you play games on your iPhone or Android device using physical buttons, joysticks, and triggers. The Pro model takes things one step further, however, allowing you to connect to everything from a Steam Deck to an iPad over Bluetooth.

Noco’s GBX45 is made for times when a friend — or stranger — is nowhere to be found. The handy 1250A jump starter allows you to revive a dead battery without hooking it up to another car, whether you’re working with a gas or diesel engine. It also provides up to 60W of power via USB-C, so you can charge other gadgets in an emergency.

Sony’s Bravia 8 II was voted the top TV of 2025 by a panel of experts — including our own Nilay Patel. The dazzling QD-OLED has a 120Hz panel, terrific AI processing for image optimization, and support for Dolby Vision. It also features support for both Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2 and Google’s intuitive TV interface.

The Google TV Streamer (4K) isn’t just for watching movies and TV shows in 4K with Dolby Atmos — it also doubles as a smart home hub with support for Matter and Thread. That means you can use Google’s latest streamer to control your lights, adjust the temperature of your home, and view livestreams from connected cameras, all within a snappy interface that’s easy to use.

Anker’s Laptop Power Bank is a lifesaver for anyone on the go. It boasts a 25,000mAh capacity and a total output of up to 165W, allowing you to charge a powerful MacBook Pro to 50 percent in less than 30 minutes. The portable battery also features two built-in USB-C cables, one of which is retractable, so you needn’t worry about tossing yet another cable in your bag.

Leatherman’s Skeletool CX comes with a 25-year warranty and all the basics you need for everyday use. The convenient multitool conceals a sturdy steel blade, a pair of pliers, and a large bit driver within its compact build, which easily slides into your pocket. It’s the kind of gadget that proves you don’t need every tool under the sun just to get the job done.

EcoFlow’s midrange River 3 Plus is a great backup solution for emergencies and outdoor use, particularly when paired with an optional solar panel. The 268Wh generator delivers 600W of total output and features seven outlets — including a 140W USB-C port — for uninterrupted power to laptops, space heaters, and other small electronics.

Petcube’s rechargeable, 57-ounce fountain is a useful gift for busy pet parents. Its four-layer filtration system removes bacteria and other impurities from water, and it only runs when your animal is nearby to conserve battery life. The accompanying mobile app will alert you when it’s time to replace the filter, too, making it easy to stay on top of.

The 2025 MacBook Pro doesn’t look any different from the last-gen model, but with speed improvements afforded by Apple’s new M5 chip, it’s the model to buy if you want the fastest 14-incher available. Plus, it retains all the features that made the M4 model great, including a terrific 12-megapixel webcam and all-day battery life.

The AirFly Pro 2 can amp up the sound quality of in-flight entertainment, making it a handy tool for frequent travelers. The long-lasting Bluetooth adapter can sync with two pairs of wireless earbuds or headphones at once, allowing you and a partner to share a movie, a podcast, or music without relying on the subpar earbuds most airlines provide.

If you ever wished you could set up a (somewhat) legit ice cream shop at home, there’s the Ninja Creami Scoop & Swirl. The clever 2-in-1 machine can spin up soft serve and traditional hard scoops in a few easy steps, not to mention creamy milkshakes, gelato, and frozen yogurt. Plus, it doesn’t require you to leave a tip, which is a rarity in this day and age.

Eno’s DoubleNest hammock is perfect for lounging in the backyard or in a nice patch of the woods. It’s roomy enough for two adults, and it features a built-in pocket for stashing a book, phone, or drink. The fast-drying nylon hammock also packs down into a built-in stuff sack, though you will need to buy a pair of straps to actually hang it between trees if your giftee doesn’t own any.

When managed correctly, bamboo plants draw sustenance from their roots for nearly infinite growth — but growing them indoors requires patience and ongoing care. Fortunately, Lego’s 325-piece Lucky Bamboo set is ideal for those who love the look of bamboo but not necessarily the maintenance.

A basic timer may seem like a thoughtless gift, but there are many tasks we procrastinate on every day that could be more easily managed if we dedicated a little bit of time to them. A visual Pomodoro timer like the colorful MOD (Home Edition) is key to helping break tasks into manageable, bite-sized chunks.

Everyone needs a good tote bag. Patagonia’s Black Hole offering is made from a recycled ripstop that can shrug off rain and everyday wear and tear. It’s an excellent go bag for a weekend getaway, with a large main compartment, a small interior pocket, and exterior daisy chain webbing that allows you to easily tack on extra gear.

Lego delivered a gigantic dose of nostalgia with a near-perfect replica of Nintendo’s 1989 handheld. The 421-piece set captures the Game Boy’s many buttons, grilles, and curves remarkably well, while the lenticular screen inserts give the illusion of a working unit. It even comes with several brick-ified cartridges you insert into a slot in the back.

Forget Mario Kart World — Donkey Kong Bananza is the first killer exclusive for the Switch 2. The game’s crowning achievement is its destructible environments, which you can crash and smash your way through as you collect gems. And don’t worry, you’ll still use DK’s fists to clock plenty of foes as you go.

Piggyback’s insightful Metroid retrospective is a 210-page hardcover book full of concept art from the venerable GameCube and Wii trilogy, as well as notes from producer Kensuke Tanabe. The thoughtful (but candid) notes offer a behind-the-scenes look at each game’s development, including the frequent tension between Retro Studios and Nintendo.

With the film adaptation of Project Hail Mary just around the corner, now’s a great time to catch up on the book from The Martian author Andy Weir. The space odyssey chronicles one man’s mission to save the Earth; however, in doing so, it also explores the nature of sacrifice, friendship, and particle physics. Lots and lots of particle physics.

Vantage isn’t your typical open-world exploration game. It’s a sci-fi roguelike that has you traversing an alien planet alongside up to five players, each of whom must solve puzzles and complete their mission before their time, morale, or health runs out. It’s not as charming as Stonemaier’s award-winning Wingspan, but it is far more interesting.

Netflix’s KPop Demon Hunters was a runaway success thanks to a soundtrack of chart-topping earworms, including bangers like “Soda Pop,” “Golden,” and “Your Idol.” If streaming the tunes isn’t satisfying enough for you (or your kids), Republic Records has also released them in several physical formats, including both vinyl and CD.

We don’t test a lot of small-form-factor PCs at The Verge, but Framework’s first was too enticing to pass up. It’s easy to assemble and void of unwanted bloatware, and while you could certainly build a more powerful Windows machine if you wanted, the Framework Desktop still offers some serious gaming and content creation chops within a delightful 4.5-liter package.

The NASA-inspired Genki Moonbase functions as a 240W GaN charging station, one capable of powering up to seven devices simultaneously via three AC outlets and four side-mounted USB-C ports. The bigger draw, though, is that each outlet can display one of eight mesmerizing colors, providing a bit of style and substance.

Let’s face it, going with the base-model iPhone used to mean you were giving up some key features. Not anymore. Apple’s latest iPhone is outfitted with a 120Hz screen for smoother gaming and scrolling, an always-on display, double the base storage, and the same 18MP ”Center Stage” camera found in the iPhone Air and 17 Pro.

Telepathic Instruments’ retrofuturist keyboard is a vibes machine, one designed for people who want to easily produce cool sounds. It only houses a few piano keys, but it has dedicated major, minor, and other inputs that let you get creative without necessarily having to know how to play.

A lot of smart home gifts are clever, but few feel as personal as the Aura Ink. The 13.3-inch E Ink display looks more akin to a traditional frame, complete with a cordless design, yet you can update it with color photos via a companion app. The low-tech panel also offers monthslong battery life, so there’s no need to worry about keeping it charged frequently.

Lego’s latest replica of the UCS Death Star is a true sight to behold. The intricate 9,023-piece kit is loaded with iconic corridors and compartments, along with enough minifigs to reenact your favorite scenes from Star Wars and Return of the Jedi. No wonder it’s the most expensive Lego set ever sold, coming in at an eye-watering $1,000.

Lapsed fans of Guitar Hero can dust off their skills with PDP’s Riffmaster, a newer guitar controller that’s compatible with rhythm games like Rock Band 4 and Fortnite Festival. It has a wireless range of 30 feet and a collapsible fretboard, which is convenient if your gig is at a friend’s house. It even has a 3.5mm audio jack, so you can shred late into the night without disturbing your neighbors.

With a sharp rotating blade, Worx’s electric scissors make light work of tougher materials, including quarter-inch plastic, fabric, leather, and cardboard. A safety switch ensures it doesn’t unintentionally turn on, too, while a blade guard can help prevent an unwanted trip to the emergency room.

Silksong is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most lauded Metroidvanias of all time. It’s an unrelenting game that requires patience, often requiring you to replay sections in an effort to learn how to defeat a boss or avoid a pesky hazard. You may have to take breaks, but the beauty of Silksong is that it often inspires you to give tough sections “just one more try.”

The Vestaboard Note features over 2,800 mechanical flaps that flip to reveal letters and symbols, just like the vintage split-flap displays once found in old train stations. Each flap can display one of 64 alphanumeric characters and a range of symbols, letting you drop quotes, schedule love notes, and set reminders using the web interface or the mobile app.

Camp Snap’s rechargeable digital camera is more about vibes than it is cutting-edge features. It draws inspiration from the iconic Super 8 models of the 1970s, and as such, it lacks a screen. Still, it can record with a filter applied (or not) and in multiple aspect ratios, including those fit for the big screen and social media.

You’ve heard of procedurally generated video games, but how about procedurally generated paper dungeon crawlers? Each 60-page Dungeon Notebook is completely unique and requires nothing other than a six-sided die and a pencil, which give you the means to navigate a variety of floors filled with coins, four-legged baddies, and hearts.

Thanks to an excellent combo of power and portability, Asus’ latest ROG Zephyrus G14 is the gaming laptop to beat. It’s thin and light enough to shove in a backpack, yet powerful enough to tackle modern games at the highest settings. Its 14-inch, 120Hz OLED screen is fast and easy on the eyes, too, making it a great everyday laptop.

It’s still hard believe the Amazfit Active 2 retails for less than $100. The humble smartwatch includes everything from offline navigation and voice commands to a strength training mode that can auto-detect sets, reps, and rest periods. It also features a vivid OLED display and a super stylish watchface — which isn’t something often associated with affordable fitness trackers.

Traveling with a dedicated router can make connecting all your devices to public Wi-Fi that much easier, regardless of your location. TP-Link’s latest model offers Wi-Fi 7 speeds and allows you to connect up to 90 devices at once, which should be more than enough to accommodate the entire family. Its ability to connect to over 35 different VPN providers is just a plus.

Bellroy’s Venture Sling is a stylish pack that provides ample storage for your everyday carry. It features a front pocket with a key clip, an internal soft-lined pouch, and several nooks for stowing larger items. The adjustable shoulder strap can also be detached from either end, making it easy to remove regardless of how you wear it.

Holiday meals can leave you with a full belly and a foul-smelling fridge, which is where the Fun Guy comes in. The playful odor absorber can add a whimsical touch to your kitchen while serving a practical need. Just pop the mushroom top and load the smiley, spore-tacular container with baking soda to keep unwanted odors at bay.

Sucker Punch’s follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima is everything you could want in a sequel. The open-world revenge epic brims with fluid combat and a host of welcome narrative twists, all set against the gorgeous backdrop of Japan’s Edo period. It’s precisely the type of game photo modes were made for, even if you never use them.

You don’t have to hand your child a phone every time they want to play a game when the LeapMove exists. The home console has 25 preprogrammed, motion-based games designed to help kids learn math, spelling, and phonics while keeping them active. It can’t connect to the internet directly, but you can always download new games from LeapFrog’s website and transfer them over.

Most people could use a good pick-me-up while traveling or camping, but there’s no reason you have to settle for bad cup of joe. First Ascent’s instant offering provides a solid hit of caffeine and great flavor, regardless of whether you choose the light, medium, or dark roast. You just pour it in hot water and stir. Don’t you just love the smell of fresh coffee?

Part wall wart, part magnetic wireless charger, Twelve South’s StandBy-ready PowerBug is about as unique as chargers come. The simple contraption can top off both MagSafe and Qi2-compatible devices — including the latest Google Pixel models — while simultaneously supplying 35W charging speeds to a second gadget via USB-C.

Coming up with an engaging story during a marathon D&D sesh can feel next to impossible. Luckily, The Worldbuilder’s Journal offers 365 prompts about characters and locations to get the creative juices flowing. The prompts are open-ended enough to be easily recyclable as well, so your DM doesn’t need to fret when they hit a roadblock.

Who needs magnets when you have suction cups? Octobuddy’s cheap silicone mount works with most phones to provide hands-free flexibility whenever necessary. It features 24 single-sided cups, which allow you to stick your phone to a mirror, window, or any other surface you think will provide that perfect TikTok angle.

There are more powerful blenders than the OG Magic Bullet, but few match its versatility, convenience, and compact footprint. The original 250W model remains well suited for making a variety of single-serve creations, from creamy milkshakes and pico to post-workout smoothies.

If you’ve ever been curious about how quickly your devices charge while plugged into a battery pack or wall adapter, Toocki makes a 6.6-foot cable with a built-in display that’ll tell you just how many watts are passing through (up to 100W). Now, let’s hope you’re a fan of pastel blue.

Quince’s Small Carry-On Suitcase is made of a tough polycarbonate shell and features a TSA-approved lock, so you can keep would-be thieves at bay. It also has 40L of internal storage — enough to house five to seven outfits — plus 360-degree wheels, allowing you to skip baggage claim and effortlessly roll it through the terminal.

A swivelable spork might not be what your giftee had in mind for the next addition to their keychain, but hear us out: they’ll no longer have to ask for disposable cutlery, and they’ll never be without a dignified way to munch on the go. It’s also, you know, good for the environment.

If your giftee ever had a soft spot for Nintendo’s Game Boy Advance SP, the RG 34XXSP won’t disappoint. Anbernic’s newer handheld emulator sports a classic clamshell design with a 3.4-inch 720p IPS display, as well as dual joysticks, four shoulder buttons, and a 3:2 aspect ratio that’s ideal for retro titles like Golden Sun and The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap.

The Rainy 75 is the kind of budget board that simply did not exist a decade ago. The mechanical keyboard supports both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connections, comes in a variety of charming colors, and delivers a fantastic typing experience. What’s more, the Pro model comes with Kailh Cocoa linear switches, which produce the TikTok-famous “raindrop” sound for which it’s known.

Idlewild’s slim ballpoint pens look as good as they write. Each features a scratch-proof barrel, black ink, and a colorful, two-tone design, which makes them a lively piece of desk decor and the perfect instrument for jotting down thoughts in your favorite notebook. See? Who needs ChatGPT, anyway?

Unless you’re filming cinematic shots in Hollywood, you don’t necessarily need a fancy quadcopter. HoverAir’s so-called “selfie drone” is a great budget alternative to more premium models from DJI, with top-mounted controls, excellent object tracking, and a max video resolution of 2.7K / 30fps. And did we mention it can fit in your pocket? Because it can.

Bosch’s high-end espresso machine lets you whip up a myriad of cafe-caliber drinks with the touch of a button. It has over 35 programs for crafting drinks from around the world — including espresso, café con leche, and koffie verkeerd. It also ships with support for Amazon Alexa, so you can put in your order before you even get out of bed in the morning.

GE’s 800-lumen Wi-Fi bulbs serve as a great entry point for making your home a little smarter. The color-changing LED bulbs work with Alexa and Google Assistant without a hub, and they support Matter for interoperability with Apple Home, making them a great choice if you’re unsure which smart home platform your giftee uses.

Between the noise of airport terminals and snoring seat companions, traveling can be loud. Loop’s reusable Quiet 2 deliver 24 decibels of noise reduction, so you can snooze even when the person next to you is watching a movie at full volume. They’re made from a light, flexible silicone and come with four ear tip sizes, including an extra-small option.

Everybody forgets to bring their charging cable with them from time to time, but it’s a lot harder to do with Nomad’s ChargeKey. The 6-inch zinc cable comes attached to a loop, which is easy to affix to the same ring as your keys. It even supports up to 240W of power and 10Gbps data transfer speeds, despite its short stature.

Glocusent’s Bookmark Style Reading Light is the perfect gift for those who burn the midnight oil reading. The clip-on USB light offers a lightweight design and multiple brightness levels, providing a soft, warm glow that’s dim enough that it won’t disturb anyone else trying to get some shut-eye nearby.

If you’re on a DIY kick, iFixit’s Pro Tech Go Toolkit deserves a spot in your bag. The portable driver kit includes a variety of specialty bits needed to open devices ranging from phones to laptops and gaming consoles. It also comes with tweezers, spudgers, a small suction cup, and opening picks to pry open your devices. Good luck on your repairs!

We here at The Verge are big fans of pen and paper for taking notes, jotting down ideas, and keeping track of assignments. The Midori MD Notebook is a minimal A5 lined notebook that features high-quality paper that won’t bleed through. A slight texture gives the paper a satisfying feel while writing, and the notebook can lie flat without you having to fight it to stay open.

The Espresso Pro is the kind of device that can change your life — or at least the way you work. The portable monitor packs a bright 4K panel, passthrough charging, and support for multiple orientations, as well as compatibility with macOS, iOS, Windows, and Android. It all works via a single USB-C cable, too, so you needn’t worry about unnecessary cable clutter on the road.

Scissors are overrated. Slice’s retractable box cutter has been a mainstay in our gift guides for years, primarily because the finger-friendly ceramic blade is great for tearing through packing tape and cutting plastic wrapping. The comfy tool also features a sturdy, reinforced nylon handle and a hooked design that makes it easy to stow when not in use.

Love it or hate it, Scrabble is a board game with staying power. The timeless crossword game has been tearing families apart for nearly 80 years, and to honor that impressive longevity, WS Game Company recently brought back the original 1948 design, complete with a fabric-lined cover that resembles the vintage novels of yesteryear.

The irony of Blue Prince is that knowing as little as possible about it is what makes it great. The puzzle title’s central mystery plays second fiddle to the clever gameplay, which has you work your way through all 45 rooms in your uncle’s magical mansion, one architectural puzzle after another. Just be sure to keep an actual notebook nearby. You’re gonna need it.

High-end robovacs with auto-empty docks and AI obstacle avoidance are great and all, but sometimes a classic handheld is all you need. Black & Decker’s rechargeable Furbuster is a great option for picking up fur, dirt, and other debris, especially since it offers a surprising amount of suction and an extra-long crevice tool for hitting those hard-to-reach areas.

Percival Everett’s first work of fiction earned him the Pulitzer this year — and it’s no surprise. The bold 2024 tale serves as a reworking of Huck Finn as told by the enslaved man who travels with him down the Mississippi, and although it’s dead serious at times due to the subject matter, it’s also inventive, poetic, and surprisingly funny.

The only thing better than a thick corduroy hat is a thick corduroy hat with a bird on it. Bird Collective’s embroidered, adjustable caps take a one-size-fits-most approach to fit and feature a selection of feathery friends, including chickadees, sandpipers, kestrels, owls, and the always unassuming red-throated hummingbird.

It’s not the timeless look that makes Distil’s Folly Sunglasses attractive — though they do look quite good. The real appeal lies in their hidden neodymium magnets, which allow you to clip the polarized shades to your shirt or bag without having to worry about them falling off. That alone is worth the $69 price tag.

If they’re a Swiftie, The Life of a Showgirl might end up being their favorite gift of the year. The glitzy, orange vinyl edition features all 12 tracks from the singer’s most recent album — including Opalite and the viral hit Fate of Ophelia — plus a few extras, including never-before-seen photos, lyrics, and a poem written by Tay herself.

Your desk could probably use a fun distraction to help you unwind a little in the middle of the day. The Mini Buddha Board lets you create ephemeral sketches using water and the included brush. Once the water evaporates you’ll be left with a blank board to create a new work, no cleanup necessary.

The Fanttik X8 Apex is the kind of gift that keeps on giving, even if you’d prefer to never use it. The compact tire inflator features a built-in LCD display and can deliver up to 150psi, allowing your giftee to quickly top off their car or road bike with the right amount of air. It even functions as a power bank and charges via USB-C, just to make things easy.

Keychains make for a great gift, even if we do live in an age when keys themselves are becoming a bit of a novelty. Veraloop’s 7-inch Colorblock is a sturdy two-tone option made from deadstock and polyester, one that easily attaches to your purse, pouch, or other bags via the included carabiner.

Do you ever wish you could turn on your coffee maker or hit the lights without getting up? If so, all you need to do is stick SwitchBot’s cheap contraption on a standard button or rocker switch, which will allow you to control or schedule your pet feeder, garage door, and a wide range of other devices directly from your smartphone.

Historical horror, as a genre, is severely underrated. Stephen Graham Jones’ gruesome tale of a Blackfeet man who becomes a vengeful vampire in 19th-century Montana is proof that, when done right, it can be as poetic and pointed as any piece of contemporary literature.

For many, few things are as calming as white noise. Luckily, Yogasleep’s rechargeable, pocket-sized sound machine offers six noise profiles, from ambient nature sounds to serene pink noise, along with a built-in night light that’s just bright enough to read with.

Snuggies are so 2008. Scout Regalia’s Anywhere Blanket is far more durable and a hell of a lot more fashionable than the aforementioned, infomercial-driven wearable blanket from the late aughts. The fluffy, water-resistant throw slots into a stuff sack for travel or, if you prefer, can be worn like a poncho while on the go.

Good, screen-free entertainment can be hard to come by for kids — which is where the latest Yoto Mini comes in. The travel-friendly audio gadget features a clock, an alarm, white noise, and a night light; however, its real selling point is that you can use it to play music and tell stories via a robust collection of more than 1,000 cards.

If you’re feeling the stress of having procrastinated on your holiday shopping — and you missed out during Black Friday and Cyber Monday — we’ve got you. We’ve found a variety of gadgets on sale that make for great gifts, many of which will ship in time for the holidays. One of the standouts is the current promo on Sony’s noise-canceling WH-1000XM5 headphones, which are on sale with a free pair of wireless earbuds. Other deals you may have missed include steep discounts on Amazon’s latest entry-level Kindle and the new Echo Dot Max.

Sony’s last-gen WH-1000XM5 have consistently impressed us with their audio quality, active noise cancellation, and comfort. And right now, Amazon is offering them with a free pair of Sony’s WF-C700N earbuds for $248 ($152 off). The headphones have an updated design that includes a thinner headband, more memory foam in the ear pads, and repositioned mics that reduce wind noise when taking calls. These changes didn’t add much weight, and the headphones still get 30 hours of playtime with ANC enabled.

The XM5 sounded “more refined, detailed, and spacious” in our tests, but we noticed less oomph when listening to EDM or hip-hop tracks with a lot of bass. The headphones have eight microphones, four of which are for voice, and their excellent noise reduction on calls was immediately noticeable, even in louder environments. The $89.99 WF-C700N, meanwhile, are a midrange pair of noise-canceling earbuds with an IPX4 rating, up to seven and a half hours of battery life (with ANC enabled), and a slim design.

Amazon’s 11th-gen Kindle is our favorite budget-friendly e-reader, and you can pick up the ad-supported version for $89.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. The entry-level ebook reader features a six-inch 300ppi E Ink display that won’t show glare from the sun like your phone or tablet. It has enough storage space to hold thousands of books, or dozens of audiobooks from Audible, the latter of which you can play via Bluetooth headphones or speakers.

The Kindle’s built-in battery lasts up to six weeks, depending on how long you read per day and how reliant you are on its backlight, and recharges over USB-C. It has the same screen resolution and storage as the step-up Kindle Paperwhite, but it’s not waterproof, which may matter if you like to read at the beach or in the bath.

Amazon’s last-minute “Super Saturday” sale is underway, though, we’d argue some of the better deals are actually some the lingering discounts we’re seeing on Amazon’s own devices, many of which have been effect for several weeks. Right now, for instance, you can grab the new Echo Dot Max at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $79.99 ($20 off), which is the best price we’ve seen on the smart speaker since it launched.

Despite the name, the Dot Max is less of a follow up to the Echo Dot as it is the fourth-gen Echo from 2020. It’s got a compact knit fabric design, simpler controls, a better processor, and more smart home sensors and radios than prior models (it offers support for Matter, Thread, and Zigbee protocols). It still sounds great for its size, though, and like prior models, it can function as an Wi-Fi extender if you’re looking buoy a Eero mesh network. It’s also one of the first devices to offer Amazon’s AI-powered Alexa Plus out of the box, which, while still very much a work in progress, is a step in the right direction.

Holiday shoppers, it’s time to finish knocking out that seasonal wish list. At this point, your online purchases may not arrive in time unless you’re willing to pay extra for priority shipping — or you happen to get lucky. Still, gifting anything at all is awfully nice of you, regardless of when it arrives. If you’re shopping on a budget of $50 or less per item, we’ve crafted this gift guide specifically for you.

Below, we’ve assembled a delightful set of practical gifts that can improve just about anybody’s life. Quince silk pillowcase can make for a blissful night’s sleep, for instance, and your giftee will surely think of you while using Unihand’s handy set of rechargeable hand warmers. Alternatively, you can level up their bread-making game with King Arthur’s elegant sourdough crock, or ensure their quality coffee intake never falters when they’re away from home thanks to the Aeropress Go. Needless to say, there are many ways to deliver happiness.

Remind yourself of the summer months ahead, flush with ripe, succulent heirloom tomatoes, with this replica beeswax candle that can burn for up to 20 hours. Though it’s so scrumptious-looking, you may not wish to melt it away.

I invite you to start (or enhance) your homemade sourdough bread-making journey with this glass crock from King Arthur, which makes it easy to tell how much your starter has grown (or shrunk) since its last feeding.

There are some who think little of the pillowcase they sleep on. However, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with treating yourself to something better. A silk pillowcase can feel more deluxe than you might imagine, and these are under $50 each.

If the one thing stopping you or a loved one from using cookbooks more often is because of how much counter space they take up, snag this cookbook stand that’ll give you back some of that working surface to prep ingredients on.

A key light is one of the best additions you can make to your home office. It can make you feel more awake (and look better in video calls). But many are needlessly pricey, so grab this 10.2-inch model that’s under $50.

Whether you’re indoors or outdoors, you’ve got to keep your hands warm. Warmth keeps your digits limber, and these rechargeable hand warmers are a great asset, lasting up to 20 hours per charge and going up to 130 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are more powerful blenders than the OG Magic Bullet, but few match its versatility, convenience, and compact footprint. The original 250W model remains well suited for making a variety of single-serve creations, from creamy milkshakes and pico to post-workout smoothies.

This game puts a fresh, multi-round spin on charades. Your teammates need to guess what’s on your card, and how much verbal info you can give away to them dwindles as the game progresses, thus increasing the challenge.

While most people are content to store their files in the cloud, some content is too precious not to save on personal digital devices. Sandisk’s multi-plug flash drive makes it easy to move data between phones, tablets, and computers.

Lovingly reminiscent of the Sega Saturn controller, GuliKit’s wireless Elves 2 can connect to PC, Switch, or Switch 2, serving as a compact but competent gamepad that’s great for small-handed gamers.

What’s the point of a clippable zip-up bag this small? Basically, you can use it to stash anything you would otherwise put in your pocket but fear slipping out. That includes chapstick, cash, cards, earbuds, you name it. Just be sure to leave the actual street tacos at your local tienda.

A fold-up pocket blanket is an underrated addition to anyone’s everyday repertoire of this-and-that. You never know when you’ll want to pop a squat on a fresh patch of grass, or use it to feel more comfortable during a long ride.

One of Amazon’s smallest, least expensive smart speakers is among its best currently available. The Echo Pop sounds fantastic and adds a pop of color to any room you put it in. It comes in white, black, purple, or teal.

Two things most people need at some point are a flashlight and a Bluetooth tracker. So why not gift both devices at once? The FlashFinder is a rechargeable, 300-lumen light outfitted with a magnetic mount you can track via Apple’s Find My network, so you never have to worry about trying to find the flashlight — or your keys — again.

No matter who you are, your desk is going to get a little messy. Stray hairs, dust, little wrapper pieces, and more can wind up strewn about, but thankfully, this small, AA-powered vacuum can suck it all up with relative ease.

One of my least favorite parts of traveling is the struggle to find good coffee. A simple solution is to bring the AeroPress Go with your favorite coffee grounds. With it, you can make a great cup of coffee no matter where you are.

Big Bluetooth speakers deliver big sound, unsurprisingly. But JBL’s compact Go 4 punches above its weight. It can deliver impressive sound quality at home, in the bathroom, on a bike ride, or poolside.

Whether you have an unwieldy slab of a phone or something smaller, you probably want to prevent drops, right? The Snap 5 grip attaches via MagSafe magnets, so you can hold it at multiple angles in a secure, comfortable manner.

Desktop speakers can set you back a pretty penny, but they don’t have to. Creative’s Pebble V3 sound great wired into a PC via USB-C, and you can connect more devices to them wirelessly via Bluetooth.

Sure, there’s something very satisfying about lighting a candle. But it’s better for your health to use a candle warmer instead. Plus, you’ll get to smell your favorite scents without dealing with the danger of an open flame.

Pocket-friendly power banks that come with built-in USB-C cables are beloved, and it’s easy to see why. Anker’s 10,000mAh Zolo with 30W charging speeds is just big enough, and fast enough, to quickly recharge most small gadgets.

Nothing’s CMF Buds 2A go well beyond what you might expect from a $49 set of wireless earbuds. They offer active noise cancellation, great mic and sound quality, IP54 protection against water and dust, and other sought-after features.

You don’t need to pay dearly for a mouse that can help you soothe a pain-stricken wrist. Seenda’s rechargeable ergonomic mouse lets your wrist pronate while you’re computing, which could bring some much-needed relief.

If you’ve ever been curious about how quickly your devices charge while plugged into a battery pack or wall adapter, Toocki makes a 6.6-foot cable with a built-in display that’ll tell you just how many watts are passing through (up to 100W). Now, let’s hope you’re a fan of pastel blue.

No one likes carrying more cables than they really need to. If you’re traveling with any combination of phone, tablet, e-reader, laptop, or gaming handheld, snag Anker’s 2-in-1 USB-C cable, which can help you charge two of them at once.

There’s nothing quite as nostalgic as building a Lego set. The 484-piece Medium Creative Brick Box contains the pieces you’ll need to make your own custom scenes, plus specific bricks to create Lego vehicles, animals, and other objects — including a windmill and toaster. The pieces come in a giant Lego brick-shaped bucket for easy storage.

AirTags can function as a second set of eyes for iPhone owners, allowing you to keep tabs on everything from your car keys to your backpack. That’s because the ultra wideband location trackers tap into Apple’s extensive Find My network, which allows for impressively precise tracking and lets users share the tracker with up to five other people for even greater peace of mind.

Do you ever wish you could turn on your coffee maker or hit the light switch without getting up? The SwitchBot Bot lets you do that. All you need to do is stick the inexpensive contraption on a standard button or rocker switch, which will allow you to control or schedule your pet feeder, garage door, and a wide range of other devices from your smartphone.

If you’re looking for a tech-free way to entertain friends or family while huddling for warmth indoors, board games like Evolution are perfect. The card-based strategy game rewinds time, pitting players against one another and forcing them to adapt to an ever-changing ecosystem in which hungry predators loom and resources are always at a premium.

Glocusent’s Bookmark Style Reading Light is the perfect gift for those who burn the midnight oil reading. The clip-on USB light offers a lightweight design and multiple brightness levels, providing a soft, warm glow that’s dim enough that it won’t disturb anyone else trying to get some shut-eye nearby.

When managed correctly, bamboo draws sustenance from its roots for nearly infinite growth — but growing it indoors requires patience and ongoing care. Lego’s Lucky Bamboo set can be great for someone who loves the look of bamboo but not necessarily the maintenance. Building the 325-piece set still takes a while, but when you’re done, you’re done for good.

This slick phone mount, compatible with MagSafe-enabled iPhones and other devices with magnetized cases, gives you a handy place to slap your phone. It sticks to your wall via 3M adhesive, and its waterproof, nylon design won’t scratch your gadgets.

Anker’s 67W Prime charger features two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, along with retractable prongs, rendering it one of our go-to travel companions. It’s a gadget that lets you easily charge a MacBook Air and a Nintendo Switch 2 with a port to spare.

Who needs magnets when you have suction cups? Octobuddy’s cheap silicone mount works with most phones to provide hands-free flexibility whenever necessary. It features 24 single-sided cups, which allow you to stick your phone to a mirror, window, or any other surface you think will provide that perfect TikTok angle.

Your desk could probably use a fun distraction to help you unwind a little in the middle of the day. The Mini Buddha Board lets you create ephemeral sketches using water and the included brush. Once the water evaporates you’ll be left with a blank board to create a new work, no cleanup necessary.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <h2>China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to deal with their aging batteries.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/18/1130148/china-ev-battery-recycle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of).

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
