            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A couple of hours after a judge formally swore in private astronaut Jared Isaacman as the next administrator of NASA on Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order outlining his space policy objectives for the next three years.

The executive order, titled “Ensuring American Space Superiority,” states that the country must “pursue a space policy that will extend the reach of human discovery, secure the nation’s vital economic and security interests, unleash commercial development, and lay the foundation for a new space age.”

There is nothing Earth-shattering in the new executive order, as much of it builds on previously announced policies that span multiple administrations. There are some notable points in the document that clearly reflect the White House’s priorities, though, and Isaacman’s leadership of NASA.

Strikingly, there is no mention of a concrete plan to send humans to Mars in this document. There are just two references to the red planet, both of which talk about sending humans there as a far-off goal. One source recently told Ars that as soon as Trump learned there was no way humans could land on Mars during his second term, he was no longer interested in that initiative.

Also absent from this document is much reference to space science, with only a mention of “optimizing space research-and-development investments to achieve my Administration’s near-term space objectives.”

The architect of the Trump Administration’s proposed deep cuts in space science (which Congress has largely forestalled) was Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget. It’s probably not a great indicator for science missions that Isaacman is directed to coordinate with Vought’s office to achieve policy objectives in the executive order.

All told, the policies Trump signed are generally forward-looking, seeking to modernize NASA’s exploration efforts. Isaacman will face many challenges, including landing humans on the Moon by 2028 and working with industry to develop an on-time successor to the International Space Station. Whether and how he meets these challenges will be an intriguing storyline in the coming months and years.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google is generally happy to see people using generative AI tools to create content, and it’s doubly happy when they publish it on its platforms. But there are limits to everything. Two YouTube channels that attracted millions of subscribers with AI-generated movie trailers have been shuttered.

Screen Culture and KH Studio flooded the site with fake but often believable trailers. The channels, which had a combined audience of more than 2 million subscribers, became a thorn in Google’s side in early 2025 when other YouTubers began griping about their sudden popularity in the age of AI. The channels produced videos with titles like “GTA: San Andreas (2025) Teaser Trailer” and “Malcom In The Middle Reboot (2025) First Trailer.” Of course, neither of those projects exist, but that didn’t stop them from appearing in user feeds.

Google demonetized the channels in early 2025, forcing them to adopt language that made it clear they were not official trailers. The channels were able to monetize again, but the disclaimers were not consistently used. Indeed, many of the most popular videos from those channels in recent months included no “parody” or “concept trailer” disclosures. Now, visiting either channel’s page on YouTube produces an error reading, “This page isn’t available. Sorry about that. Try searching for something else.”

Deadline reports that the behavior of these creators ran afoul of YouTube’s spam and misleading-metadata policies. At the same time, Google loves generative AI—YouTube has added more ways for creators to use generative AI, and the company says more gen AI tools are coming in the future. It’s quite a tightrope for Google to walk.

While passing off AI videos as authentic movie trailers is definitely spammy conduct, the recent changes to the legal landscape could be a factor, too. Disney recently entered into a partnership with OpenAI, bringing its massive library of characters to the company’s Sora AI video app. At the same time, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google demanding the removal of Disney content from Google AI. The letter specifically cited AI content on YouTube as a concern.

Both the banned trailer channels made heavy use of Disney properties, sometimes even incorporating snippets of real trailers. For example, Screen Culture created 23 AI trailers for The Fantastic Four: First Steps, some of which outranked the official trailer in searches. It’s unclear if either account used Google’s Veo models to create the trailers, but Google’s AI will recreate Disney characters without issue.

While Screen Culture and KH Studio were the largest purveyors of AI movie trailers, they are far from alone. There are others with five and six-digit subscriber counts, some of which include disclosures about fan-made content. Is that enough to save them from the ban hammer? Many YouTube viewers probably hope not.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Peacock subscribers will see ads immediately upon opening the streaming app or website next year. It’s a bold new strategy for attracting advertisers—something that’s been increasingly important to subscription-based streaming services—but it also risks alienating viewers

As reported by Variety, the new type of ads will display on the profile selection page that shows when a subscriber launches Peacock. Starting next year, instead of the profile page just showing your different Peacock profiles, most of the page will be dominated by an advertorial image. The circles of NBCUniversal-owned characters selected for user profiles will be relegated to a vertical column on the screen’s left side, as you can see here.

To avoid seeing what NBCUniversal is calling “Arrival Ads” every time you open Peacock, you need to subscribe to Peacock’s most expensive plan, which is ad-free and starts at $17 per month (Peacock’s ad-based plans start at $8/month.)

NBCUniversal’s announcement claims that Peacock will be the first streaming service to implement this type of ad. But that may not be the brag the entertainment giant thinks it is, as subscribers may quickly find the startup ads disruptive.

Over the past couple of years, it’s become increasingly important for streaming services to generate revenue beyond subscription fees. Peacock and many other streaming services have struggled with profitability after spending years focusing on pricey content production and licensing to attract subscribers.

For its part, Peacock has 41 million subscribers and isn’t profitable. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, shared in October, NBCUniversal parent company Comcast reported that the service lost $217 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, compared to losing $436 million in the same quarter in 2024. At the same time, Peacock has struggled to grow viewership and has had the same number of subscribers since Q1 2025. In Q1 2024, Peacock had 31 million subscribers.

Bundle deals that include Peacock have become more common this year, but subscriber growth has been evasive for Peacock, leading to heavy advertising. In search of ad dollars and subscribers, the service has also focused on live events. But those events are expensive, and costs are partly what prompted NBCUniversal to explore new ad formats for Peacock, executives said, according to Variety.

NBCUniversal also announced this week that Peacock will start showing ads on the vertical video feeds in its mobile app. Today, the service already shows full-screen ads when subscribers with ad plans hit pause and “Binge Ads” that show after someone streams two episodes of the same show consecutively.

Peacock’s ad business seems to be a bright spot. Comcast’s most recent earnings report largely attributed NBCUniversal’s ad growth of 2.6 percent to Peacock. A strong advertising arm could potentially help the service avoid more or steeper price hikes while it tries to become profitable.

Peacock’s new launch ads, however, represent a more disruptive type of ad that places another barrier between subscribers and content. With Peacock opening the door, other streaming services may also consider adopting more disruptive ad formats as more people turn to ad-supported streaming services due to rising subscription prices.

It will be problematic if all streaming services start viewing their platform’s launching pages as a “canvas” for the streaming service provider and its partners, as Alison Levin, president of advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal, discussed during a press conference announcing Arrival Ads,</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What’re professional team sports without a good shoving match? Basketball star Kyrie Irving got into one recently — though not on the court, but with a humanoid robot.

In a video shared by the Dallas Mavericks social media page, a Unitree G1 android shows off its slick karate moves in front of the team, before Irving approaches and squares it up. The diminutive 4’2″ robot displays better survival instincts than most humans and nervously skitters away from the imposing athlete, who is two feet taller.

But it was to no avail. Irving shoves it in the chest, and the robot stumbles with human-like agility — or lack thereof — before falling flat on its back. Onlookers howl in laughter as it lies paralyzed on the ground, utterly motionless.

“My apologies, I thought I could push him a little harder,” Irving says, while the robot’s operators attend to it like courtside medics. “My bad.”

Maybe next time he can shoot hoops with one instead.

Back falls are no joke. Irving and the others try to lift the bot back on its feet, but it remains unresponsive, its limbs flopping around. Later, Irving comes back to check on it one last time, but it’s still out cold.

The Unitree G1 has become a cultural sensation with its surprising spryness and cute stature, with influencers using them for all kinds of slapstick stunts and “GONE WRONG!” videos. Some have become their own mini-celebrities, like “Jake the Rizzbot,” which is known for slinging Gen-Z slang and coming out as gay, whatever that means for a robot.

One way Unitree bots often shows off their adroitness is by performing martial arts moves, a trend that other robotics companies have eagerly jumped on (with some interesting iterations.) The flipside is that they also make tempting punching-bags for humans. No doubt that it’s hilarious to see them ragdoll on the ground after getting laid out, but they can only take so much abuse. The owners of Jake the Rizzbot, for instance, are currently suing the popular streamer IShowSpeed for allegedly wrecking their little celebrity after he punched it in the face, pinned it to a couch, and threw it to the ground during a stream.

As it stands, it’s unclear what condition the Mavericks robot is in after Irving made it eat pavement. But we hope it’s okay — if not for its sake, then for our own.

“Skynet will remember that,” a commenter joked.

            <h2>When Asked to Generate an Alphabet Poster for Preschoolers, the Latest Version of ChatGPT Just Flails Wildly</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On December 11, OpenAI release ChatGPT 5.2, the latest version of the widely used AI chatbot.

As it does every time it releases a minor update, the company hailed its latest version as a “significant improvement in general intelligence,” calling it the “best model yet for real-world, professional use.” In a further display of hubris, OpenAI even went so far as to claim 5.2 is their “first model that performs at or above a human expert level.”

Yet when we ran it through an incredibly simple prompt — to generate an alphabetized chart of animals for school children — the world-beating AI model came up laughably short.

The ABC deficiency was first noticed by BCA Research chief global strategist Peter Berezin. Using ChatGPT 5.1, which was released back in November, Berezin asked the AI to “draw [a] poster where you say A is for an animal that starts with the letter A, B for an animal that starts with B, all the way to Z.”

That version thought for six seconds, and spat out an image with 25 letters, as opposed to the standard English alphabet which uses 26. Already off to a rocky start, 5.1 does an okay job with “A” through “I,” but falls off the rails as soon as it gets to “K,” which it says “is for Lion.”

It goes on like this: “O is for jellyfish,” while “Q is for penguin” and “R is for snake.” By the time it gets to the end, “Z” is for “urba” — a turtle, apparently — followed by “B,” along with a picture of a pig.

“Still needs more capex,” Berezin quips, referencing the $1.15 trillion OpenAI has committed to spending on hardware in 2025 alone.

We were curious how ChatGPT 5.2 stacked up to its month-old predecessor — and sure enough, it didn’t disappoint.

Though the latest version of ChatGPT did a bit better with individual animals, it still only identified 24 letters in the English alphabet, forgetting “U” and “Z.” Instead, 5.2 listed “Y” for “Yak” right after “T.” This particular alphabet ends with “X,” which of course stands for “X-ray fish,” but is illustrated by a Zebra.

Its illustrations were also a bit suspect, with Kangaroos sporting a weird limb, an Iguana with two tails, a Narwal with a strange mash of eyes and fins as well as a bird’s beak, and a hedgehog with a cat’s face, to name a few weak points.

A follow-up prompt only spread the spill around. This time, there are 25 letters total. “Y” is still a problem area, taking the place of “U,” only this time it stands for “Unicorn,” which isn’t a real animal in the first place. By the end, there are two entries for “X,” one of which “is for fish,” followed by another “X,” again for “X-ray fish,” but with the same Zebra illustration.

The second poster also starts to scramble the instructions, injecting bits of the prompt into the poster title: “A is for alligator, B is for bear…”

As some users on X-formerly-Twitter pointed out, results are the same for Google’s Gemini, and as a quick glance at Grok shows, Elon Musk’s AI engine isn’t even close. But while ChatGPT might be the best at making an animal poster, it still comes up laughably short — and certainly not at the level of any “human expert” we’ve ever met.

            <div id="article-text">You don’t share the road with robotaxis — the robotaxis munificently share the road with you.

This week, one of Waymo’s fully driverless cabs was spotted blundering down the wrong side of a street in Austin, Texas, causing the human motorists driving in the correct direction to cautiously come to a halt, not unlike hikers encountering a bear.

The incident was captured in footage uploaded to Reddit. For a split second, it shows the Waymo flash its emergency signal, before switching to its turn signal. The robotaxi then turns in the opposite direction indicated by its blinker and pulls into a gas station, taking its sweet time.

“Just another day in Austin,” the uploader wrote in the caption.

Local news site My San Antonio reports that the incident took place on a stretch of frontage road next to the Interstate 35 highway in downtown Austin.

It’s another example of robotaxis acting with the kind of impunity to traffic laws you might expect from someone playing Grand Theft Auto. In fact, it’s not even the first time they’ve been caught driving on the wrong side of the road. Waymo may boast an impressive safety record, but its driverless cabs can still go off the rails in ways that can be comical, baffling, or genuinely dangerous.

This month, for example, Waymo recalled a software patch after its robotaxis were caught blowing past stopped school buses with active warning lights and stop signs, including at least one incident where a Waymo drove right by students who were disembarking. Twenty of these incidents were reported in Austin alone, MySA noted, prompting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to open an investigation into the company.

It’s not just school buses: the cabs don’t always stop for law enforcement, either. Earlier this month, a Waymo careened into an active police standoff, driving just a few feet away from a suspect who was lying facedown in the asphalt while cops had their guns trained on him.

In San Francisco, Waymo sparked outrage in the community after one of its robotaxis killed a beloved bodega cat known to locals as Kit Kat. Another ran over a dog that witnesses say was playing in the street.

These come as Waymo has been updating its cars’ software to drive more aggressively like a human motorist.

“Safety is our highest priority at Waymo, both for people who choose to ride with us and with whom we share the streets,” a spokesperson told MySA in a statement. “We take situations like this seriously and are committed to improving road safety through our ongoing learnings and experience.”

            <h2>Apple becomes a debt collector with its new developer agreement</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/apple-becomes-a-debt-collector-with-its-new-developer-agreement/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers’ behalf, among other methods.

The change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.

The changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.

Apple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)

In its new developer agreement, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.

Additionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.

The agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.

The types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.

The updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.

These changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.

These are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.

Of interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.

To be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Instacart will pay $60 million in refunds to settle allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it deceived consumers with false advertising. The federal agency alleged Instacart misled consumers with unlawful tactics, causing them to pay higher fees while also denying refunds.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated Instacart’s “free delivery” claims are misleading because customers are still required to pay a mandatory service fee, which can add up to 15% to their total order.

The agency also said the delivery platform’s “100% satisfaction guarantee” promise is false because it implies it will provide full refunds when consumers are not fully satisfied with their orders, which is typically not the case when people receive late deliveries or unprofessional service.

Additionally, Instacart hid the refund option from the “self-service” menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, making people believe they could only get a credit toward a future order rather than a refund, the FTC claimed.

Instacart also failed to clearly disclose terms relating to the Instacart+ membership enrollment process, the agency said. The sign-up process for the free trial of the subscription service did not disclose consumers would be charged once the trial ended, which allowed Instacart to charge people without their informed consent. These consumers will be receiving refunds as a result of the settlement, the FTC said.

“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.

Instacart acknowledged the settlement in a blog post and denied “any allegations of wrongdoing.” The company also said it believes “the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed.”

The settlement comes as Instacart is currently under fire over a recent study that revealed its AI-powered pricing tool is causing some customers to receive different prices for the same items at the same stores. Instacart responded to the controversy by stating that retailers determine their own prices, and any pricing tests conducted through its AI tool are random and not influenced by user data. Reuters reported on Wednesday the FTC has begun an investigation into the delivery platform’s AI pricing tool.

            <div id="article-text">App developers looking to launch their programs in ChatGPT can now submit them for review and potential publication, OpenAI said Wednesday. The company also introduced a new app directory within Chat’s tools menu that has swiftly been dubbed an “app store.”

In October, the company announced the arrival of apps in its chatbot, explaining that the move would bring a broader suite of capabilities to ChatGPT users. Major platforms — including Expedia, Spotify, Zillow, and Canva — announced integrations that would allow users to access their services directly from Chat conversations. Now, the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players.

“Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,” the company said Wednesday.

OpenAI’s Apps SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the company’s OpenAI Developer platform, where they will be able to track its approval status, the company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it added.

This is a big step for OpenAI toward expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it.

After his death, James Garfield got the full Horatio Alger treatment. As well he should have. Garfield, who died in September 1881 from an assassin’s bullet and his own doctors’ staggeringly inept care, really did rise, as Alger’s book phrased it, From Canal Boy to President. Born into poverty in Ohio, Garfield was a striver of tireless industry and integrity, particularly when measured against the slithering creatures that moved through American political life in the Gilded Age.

Now Garfield has received the prestige television treatment, becoming the subject of the four-part Netflix series Death by Lightning, which premiered last month and covers his nomination and brief presidency. The series presents Garfield as a thoroughly decent figure in a mostly rotten time—and with good reason. If Garfield had his compromises and inner conflicts, he really was serious and principled. But watching the show today, when flashes of the Gilded Age are visible in presidential decor, tariffs, weird manliness cults, and much else, its depiction of Garfield feels like a hollow revival of the Alger myth—while the qualities of the man who killed the president feel disturbingly familiar.

Alger wrote didactic fiction, the kind of thing that he said would “exert a wholesome influence on his young readers.” With Garfield, the lessons came from the story of his life: born in a log cabin, raised to labor on a farm, stood up to bullies, expanded his mind by diligent application, and performed heroic service in the Civil War. Garfield came to public service honestly, which is to say reluctantly. At 21, in 1852, he observed in his diary that politics seemed a crooked racket. What he called “the wire-pulling of politicians and the total disregard of truth in all their operations” held little appeal. Though his ambitions grew over time, Garfield never fully shook his basic doubts. Between references to Shakespeare, Latin poetry, and earnest reflections on books and sermons, Garfield’s diary records constant restlessness over the humdrum and compromises of public life.

The story of an honest bootstrapper became more complicated amid the corruption of the Gilded Age. Garfield retained his decency, but it didn’t always match the politics he inhabited, as evidenced in his 1877 Atlantic treatise on Congress. Scholarly and reverent, the essay presents the institution as noble at precisely the moment when its credibility was under strain. Written shortly after Rutherford B. Hayes ascended to the presidency because of a shadowy compromise Garfield had a hand in striking, this essay does not disguise the political system’s flaws. Instead, Garfield insisted that American institutions could retain their integrity, even in corrupt times.

Death by Lightning spares viewers Garfield’s backstory, but his inner conflicts over the dull and disreputable doings of politics forms the ample weight he seems to carry (which the actor Michael Shannon labors to convey under his thick, stagey beard). By the show’s telling—and not entirely without foundation—Garfield channeled his frustrations into a stirring speech at the 1880 Republican convention in Chicago. There to nominate the Ohio Senator John Sherman, Garfield spoke with such force (he’d bemoaned the decline of the oratorical tradition in his Atlantic essay) that he ended up advancing his own candidacy.

Once he was president, Garfield became mired in the unsavory workings of the spoils system: He was beset by factional jockeying among the Republican brass, and hordes of office seekers were beating down his door. Most formidable in the former camp was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, who enjoyed the power and profit of patronage, and was not inclined to give it up. Conkling and his minions—including Vice President Chester Arthur—behaved like mob bosses in defense of the existing system. In the series, they talk like mob bosses, too. It’s possible that they use the F-word more over four episodes than it was used in the whole of the United States between Garfield’s nomination and death.

Garfield’s brief time in office was also menaced by a deranged drifter named Charles Guiteau. Guiteau, who had spent the election repeatedly delivering an incoherent pro-Garfield speech on street corners, was convinced that his campaigning merited a diplomatic posting—in Vienna, or preferably Paris. When his efforts failed, he purchased a pistol with an ivory handle, believing it worthy of the extra expense because it was destined to find a place in national history as the instrument that liberated the country from Garfield. He used it on July 2, 1881, shooting the president twice in the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station.

In Death by Lightning, Garfield is portrayed as a good man in an age of bad politicians; such a premise is hopeful but perhaps too hopeful for our current moment. At the same time, Guiteau, as played with demented earnestness by Matthew McFadyen, steals the show. The assassin is the more legible, if not the more compelling, character: a voracious consumer of political coverage and carefully attuned to the culture of celebrity. He is chillingly redolent of the violent figures who sometimes emerge from the darkest corners of contemporary discourse.

After Garfield’s death and Guiteau’s execution, Death by Lightning concludes with a gesture toward what Garfield’s life set in motion. A postscript montage notes that his assassination helped spur the first major civil-service reform with the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883, an effort to curb the spoils system that had consumed his presidency. That legacy was real—but it was also narrow and easily undermined. The civil service it helped birth is now in question, its independence hanging before the Supreme Court, all while openly transactional politics and the logic of the spoils system once again take hold in Washington. Then as now, when so much of governance is fraying, one good guy might not be enough.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Donald Trump has now installed descriptive plaques under all the portraits that line his “Presidential Walk of Fame” in the White House. If you wonder whether they are petty, but also deeply strange and erratically capitalized, the answer is: Yes! Of course!

Surely they cannot really be that bad, you say. All right. See if you can guess the real ones! Then scroll to the bottom for the answer key.

25. Joseph Biden: Nicknamed both “Sleepy” and “Crooked,” Joe Biden was dominated by his Radical Left handlers. They and their allies in the Fake News Media attempted to cover up his severe mental decline, and his unprecedented use of the Autopen.

24. Barack Obama: Barack Hussein Obama was the first Black President, a community organizer, one term Senator from Illinois, and one of the most divisive political figures in American History. As President, he passed the highly ineffective “Unaffordable” Care Act, resulting in his party losing control of both Houses of Congress, and the Election of the largest House Republican majority since 1946.

23. George W. Bush: President Bush created the Department of Homeland Security, but started wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which should not have happened.

22. John F. Kennedy: Kennedy suffered a painful setback during the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion, and was President when the Soviet Union built the Berlin Wall, but skillfully navigated the threat of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

21. Harry S. Truman: Harry S. Truman dropped the nuclear bombs. The Fat Man and the Little Boy. Boy, was that a mistake! If Donald Trump dropped a bomb he would make certain it was an elegant, slim bomb. He would also come up with a different name for the plane.

20. Herbert Hoover: A self-made man who rose from humble beginnings, Herbert Hoover was a successful mining engineer who became known as the “Great Humanitarian.”

19. Warren G. Harding: Right out of central casting, this guy! Groundbreaking in many ways. Those letters he sent to his mistress. Hot to trot, this guy! Jerry. We’re not allowed to talk about Jerry nowadays. The Ohio Gang. Teapot Dome. Teapot Dome, what happened to Teapot Dome? You never see any Teapot Domes anymore. Warren “Gamaliel” Harding. What a name! Gamaliel, Gamaliel, like some elf from Lord of the Rings. But he was a president, not an elf! Maybe better to be an elf. Then he could have gone into the West instead of dying in office. Better luck next time, Gamaliel.

18. Woodrow Wilson: On the one hand, he did the League of Nations, but on the other hand, he used to show Birth of a Nation in the White House and he segregated the federal government. This just goes to show there are good and bad sides to everyone. Thank goodness we never got into the League of Nations.

17. Theodore Roosevelt: Speak softly and carry a big stick was Theodore Roosevelt’s idea of a good foreign policy, which is only “good” if you have a weak voice and want your arm to get really tired. Can you imagine? You sit down with Vladimir Putin and he says, Who is that guy in the corner whispering with the stick? I guess it was a different time. Yet they gave him the Nobel Peace Prize?

16. William McKinley: What do you say about William McKinley?

15. Grover Cleveland: We love Grover Cleveland! He was president once and then he came back, which Donald Trump would also do, but better. He married his ward. Donald Trump hasn’t done that yet. But that ward wasn’t the only love of his life. “Ma, ma, where is my pa? Gone to the White House, ha ha ha!” That’s what they sang. Gone to the White House! They didn’t care about the illegitimate child. “Ha ha ha!” We need a song like that. America doesn’t make songs like that anymore.

14. James Garfield: Some say Charles Guiteau assassinated him, but actually the doctors killed him. Not Charlie, sad to say! It wasn’t Charles Guiteau who did it. Guiteau, Git-Out, that’s what they called him at the Oneida Free Love Colony. He wanted some of that free love but his energy was just bad. And Garfield paid the price!

13. Rutherford B. Hayes: Boy, they had a lot of these guys with beards! Even the voters took one look at this little guy and said, Nah, we want to go with Samuel Tilden. Poor Sammy Tilden. Didn’t have what it took. He won the popular vote, but they gave the election to Hayes in the so-called Corrupt Bargain of 1876! At least they ended Reconstruction, which, frankly, never should have happened. But they didn’t get rid of the Fourteenth Amendment. Donald Trump has to do it himself.

12. Ulysses S. Grant: He beat the late, great Robert E. Lee. “Never fight uphill, me boys!” Was it fair and square? Hard to know. But they put him on the money. Not such a good president. He didn’t have great people around him. Sad.

11. Andrew Johnson: Some say he was drunk at inauguration. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn’t. Did you know they impeached him? Crooked Thaddeus Stevens and his Radical Republican cronies! They didn’t like old Andy J. They never like the Andrews. Jackson, Johnson, they’re not big fans. Issued a lot of great pardons, though. They said, Don’t do the pardons, Mr. Johnson. These men are traitors! They fought against the Union! They were begging him, Don’t do the pardons. But he did the pardons anyway. Good!

10. Abraham Lincoln: Lincoln succeeded for numerous reasons. He was a man who was of great intelligence, but he was also a man that did something that was a very vital thing to do at that time. Ten years before or 20 years before, what he was doing would never have even been thought possible. So he did something that was a very important thing to do, and especially at that time.

9. James Buchanan: Donald Trump has a little bit of affection for James Buchanan because as long as Buchanan is on the list of presidents, they can never put Trump last. Instead it’s little Jimmy B., or as Andrew Jackson called him, “Miss Nancy.” Not so nice of Andrew Jackson!

8. Franklin Pierce: Franklin Pierce! “We Polked You in ’44, We Shall Pierce You in ’52!” They don’t make slogans like that anymore, because of Woke.

7. Zachary Taylor: They called him a war hero but he got defeated by cherries. By cherries and a little bit of milk. Mexican War couldn’t do it, but a little tiny fruit, that got him. George Washington defeated the cherry, but Zachary Taylor, not so much. So-called general who was weaker than fruit.

6. William Henry Harrison: Gave such a long inaugural address that he died! Donald J. Trump gave a much longer address and did not die. Tippecanoe didn’t have what it takes! “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too,” that’s a slogan for you. You feel a little bad for Tyler, the way they tacked him on there at the end.

5. Andrew Jackson: “Old Hickory” served as a U. S. Congressman, Judge, General, Senator, and Military Governor. Before becoming President, Jackson was best known for leading the victory at the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. Jackson was often called “The People’s President” for championing the common man, but was unjustifiably treated unfairly by the Press, but not as viciously and unfairly as President Abraham Lincoln and President Donald J. Trump would, in the future, be.

4. James Monroe: Tall guy, but weird-looking. They say he ushered in the “Era of Good Feelings,” actually very BAD feelings for the Federalists! We love the Monroe Doctrine, though. And his wife was very good in Some Like It Hot.

3. James Madison: Presided over a little demolition at the White House but not on purpose. The British paid for it. Liddle Jemmy!

2. Thomas Jefferson: The Declaration of Independence, very overrated! Very overrated document. “Transported beyond seas for pretended offenses”? Sometimes you have to transport people beyond seas for pretended offenses. “Quartering troops”? Sometimes it’s nice to quarter a little troop. He didn’t get it.

1. George Washington: We like that he put his name on all the things: the monument, the city, even a state. Now if you put your name on the things, they say it’s tacky, but with him, not so much! The name wasn’t enough; he’s also on a bill and a coin. Two different forms of legal tender. Not the penny, fortunately, which is trash.

            <h2>The U.S. Is on the Verge of Meteorological Malpractice</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2025/12/climate-science-global-mothership-ncar/685313/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday afternoon, the risk of wildfire in northeastern Colorado had risen high enough that Xcel Energy, the state’s largest utility company, announced that it would shut down power in much of the area the following day. Expected high winds, combined with the current dry conditions, meant that a downed electrical line could spark a catastrophe. Local institutions responded by announcing closures yesterday, among them the Boulder, Colorado–based National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR.

Shortly after the Xcel announcement, USA Today broke the news that the Trump administration planned to “dismantle” the center. Climate scientists know NCAR as one of the largest weather-and-climate-research institutions in the world; Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, described it as “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country.” NCAR had already reduced its staff in anticipation of drastic budget cuts at the National Science Foundation, which provides about half of the center’s funding. In March, a major NCAR project meant to track hurricanes and other severe storms was canceled after the administration pulled back money appropriated for it. Now efforts to dissolve the center would begin “immediately,” USA Today reported, and would include a full closure of the center’s Mesa Laboratory—whose distinctive rose-hued towers, designed by I. M. Pei, have overlooked the city since the 1960s. (The Office of Management and Budget did not immediately return a request for comment.)

On Tuesday night, Antonio Busalacchi, the president of the consortium that operates the center, was in New Orleans at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union along with many of the center’s researchers. Busalacchi issued a brief statement acknowledging the reports but noted that “we do not have additional information about any such plan.” That’s essentially still true: At a press availability at the conference today, Busalacchi said, “I don’t want to be facetious, but I don’t know what the best definition of ‘immediate’ means.” He defended NCAR’s work, which would be more costly if it was broken up, he said, as well as the impartiality of its researchers. “We are physical scientists. We’re not political scientists,” he said.

Like many of the institutions and agencies targeted by the Trump administration this year—USAID, the Forest Service, the National Institutes of Health—NCAR is vulnerable in part because so few Americans know what it does, if they’ve heard of it at all. Established in 1960 to advance the field of meteorology, which had flourished during World War II but languished in peacetime, the center was designed to coordinate research on “the problems of the atmosphere” and provide the large-scale computing facilities necessary for that work. It now employs more than 800 researchers and makes its facilities available to thousands more each year.

Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and the chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy, called NCAR “quite literally our global mothership.” Daniel Swain, a UC Agriculture and Natural Resources climate scientist known for his commentary on extreme-weather events, hosted a “rapid response” livestream yesterday morning. “Most academics in the weather and climate world,” he said, “have in some way passed through or connected with the National Center for Atmospheric Research.” Swain, himself a research partner at NCAR, spoke to his audience from Boulder, warning that the area’s planned power shutoff could bring his report to an abrupt end. He described the administration’s plans for NCAR as “a genuinely shocking self-inflicted wound.”

Whether or not Americans know it, research at the center has contributed to enormous advances in the weather forecasts they consult each day. Three-day forecasts have been more than 80 percent accurate since the 1980s and are now about 97 percent accurate; five-day forecasts hit the 80 percent threshold in the early 2000s, and seven-day forecasts are approaching it today. NCAR researchers have also enabled more precise predictions of tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, and other extreme events. The center has been so successful, Swain observed during his livestream, that we now take for granted “the fact that we are not caught by surprise when a hurricane makes landfall, the fact that we can predict the occurrence—literally, as I speak, the winds are picking up outside the window—of these extreme fire-weather conditions.”

The dissolution of the center could disrupt climate science and its applications in more fundamental ways, interfering with access to the center’s supercomputer facility in Wyoming, the cross-disciplinary collaborations essential to climate science, and recent partnerships with insurance companies and other businesses whose profitability depends on a predictable climate. An NCAR employee who was laid off because of funding cuts earlier this year, and who requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation from the Trump administration, told me that the worst effects of these disruptions might not be immediately apparent. “The gaps we’re going to have in our science and technology research in the next decades are what you’re really going to notice,” the former employee said.

Vought told USA Today that although the National Science Foundation “will be breaking up” NCAR, “vital activities such as weather research will be moved to another entity or location.” Yesterday, the NSF stated that it would “explore options” to put the center’s modeling and forecasting powers toward “seasonal weather prediction, severe storms, and space weather.” (Reached today, the NSF had no further comment.) White House officials characterized the dismantling of NCAR as a return to the center’s original mission—to make the weather great again, so to speak, by separating weather forecasting from research on climate change.

Weather and climate aren’t easily separable, though, and never have been. Weather, after all, is essentially a snapshot of the climate: same atmosphere, shorter timescale. The massive computer models that climate scientists now use to predict future changes in the global climate arose from the weather-forecasting models that NCAR researchers began to help build and refine in the 1960s. As researchers added power and complexity to these models, running them for longer periods and including the effects of ocean temperatures, volcanic activity, seasonal ice and snow cover, and other factors, they began to approximate the climate. NCAR’s newest climate model, the Model for Prediction Across Scales, or MPAS, can simulate both large-scale atmospheric patterns and small-scale weather events.

Today, predicting the weather without considering the climate would be meteorological malpractice. Human-caused changes in the global climate have fundamentally changed the weather, making extreme conditions not only possible but also more likely. Without ongoing research on climate change, forecasters would be less able to predict deadly weather events such as last week’s flooding in the Pacific Northwest and heavy snow in the Midwest and Northeast.

And they might not have seen the Colorado winds coming in time for electric utilities to take preventive measures. Swain signed off his livestream yesterday as the wind picked up in Boulder. By noon, Xcel Energy had shut off power to nearly 100,000 of its Colorado customers. By 4 p.m., the weather station at NCAR’s Mesa Laboratory was measuring wind gusts of more than 100 miles per hour.</div>

While ignoring the fact that Amazon hired this person.

I hope this counts against Amazon&#39;s H1-B allotment.

any guesses if this infiltrator was hired because he was the best of the best or cause he was willing to work for peanuts?

I suppose another interesting way tech workers could catch if their coworker is working for North Korea would be to do something crazy like talk to and get to know their coworkers as human beings. But that would never happen.

All he has to do is to adopt the BOFH attitude. Nobody would dare get on his bad side by asking inane questions.

So this guy got hired entirely remotely? Like, I get working from home. But you&#39;re gonna hire a sysadmin you&#39;ve never met? You can&#39;t afford a plane ticket for the final interview?

That would be my question.  Who is fronting for this guy when he&#39;s required to go into the office?

Don&#39;t worry. There are home-grown disgruntled employees that could cause a lot of damage on their way out. But really, I&#39;m not too concerned about that. There are enough spies working at the cloud platforms that nobody can get any espionage done without showing their hand to a competing spy. The real problem is when they replace a load-bearing Perl script with &quot;secure&quot; and &quot;high-performance&quot; Rust code that nukes all data in one go.

I get that the heat has to go somewhere, but there are ways to build a system that doesn&#39;t &quot;consume&quot; much water.

Building these kinds of systems may cost more cash up-front but the cost to the people in your state/country (which becomes a political/regulatory cost to you down the road) of using water in areas where water is scarce needs to be factored in.

They are building them. I think the early âoeAI Datacenterâ was built for size, not efficiency. Regular AC, because it was industry standard.

Then they saw how much power is being consumed, how much their chips are being slammed for calculations and realized this was unsustainable.lolNow the designs are all-in for efficiency. Zero water (aka closed loop) are the next generation being built right now. More efficient chips, efficiency for the infrastructure, even on backup power generation.

Water consumption doesn&#39;t matter much (or at all) near these places:
  1. Colombia river basin2. Mississippi River3. The entire east coast from Virgina, south to Florida
  There&#39;s no incentive to conserve water in these areas, access to fresh water is limitless. half to three quarters of data centers are in areas with no problems with water access; the hysterics around water use is being weaponized, rather than rationalized. If you have a data center in California or Arizona, water is more of an issue, but they often use more efficient cooling loops there.

It sounds like they&#39;re permanently destroying water or something. Many datacenters line the colombia river, which is both an excellent hydroelectric and limitless water supply, and then the other big cluster is in the SE near Virgina and into the Carolinas, which are frequently flooding,
  764.6 billion liters of water is about the same water usage as NYC uses in 200 days
  764.6 billion liters of water is about 8 days worth of water used by California agriculture

Suppose that water headed for California almond farms instead was diverted to Arizona golf courses. What&#39;s the problem, right? Not like the water was destroyed or something.

You may as well ask, what&#39;s the problem with inflation? Not like money is destroyed when you spend it.

Combined Cooling Heat and Power (CCHP) uses gas compressors to create cooling from waste energy, it saves some energy and a lot of water.

But I agree that AI systems are wasteful and the people building them need to find better, more efficient processes.

Guess you haven&#39;t been keeping up with the news, where dear leader is preparing to invade Venezuela... who by the way has more oil than Iraq. It&#39;s not about drugs or anything else, it&#39;s about oil.

Well, also as a distraction from basically everything else.

Once he figured out how much electricity these AI systems would likely consume, he could use that to forecast the amount of planet-heating pollution that would likely create. That came out to between 32.6 and 79.7 million tons annually. For comparison, New York City emits around 50 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.So one big city&#39;s worth for the entire planet?  It actually does not seem so bad when you put it that way.

Gather around. Here is a useful heuristic to understand the shabby, campy, and uniquely unserious nature of this incarnation of the Trump presidency.

For the past several weeks, much attention has been paid to Alexis Wilkins, the 27-year-old country-singer girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel. This alone is unusual. Generally speaking, FBI directors are not meant to be understood as tabloid celebrities with rich personal lives. But the scandal that has enveloped the both of them is even more chintzy, in a perfectly Trumpian way. Basically, since getting sworn in to the role, Patel has used a Gulfstream jet owned by the agency to buttress his vacation time. This includes flying to concerts at which Wilkins is performing, and to a luxury hunting lodge in Texas called Boondoggle Ranch. This is the sort of controversy that raises a lot of questions—about taxpayer dollars, Patel’s ego, and why the current administration seems to be permanently occupied by manchildren stuck in various stages of arrested development. But Patel, for his part, has decided to address the charges head-on in the only way he knows how: Step in front of a podcast microphone, on a couch next to his girlfriend, and dress down the haters and losers.

The show in question is The Katie Miller Podcast, and, naturally, it is hosted by Katie Miller, wife of skull-measuring psychopath and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The podcast has platformed a cavalcade of regime-boosting sycophants, and Patel is no different. Between whining complaints about the press (hi, Kash!), boasts about his threadbare criminal justice bona fides, and mandated tributes to the genius of Donald Trump, he uses the opportunity to settle some scores. Miller asks Patel about the claims that he is mishandling FBI resources in service of his personal life, a credible accusation that he nonetheless finds completely outrageous. “If I was actually abusing [the jet], I would actually be seeing every one of her shows,” Patel says. “I think I get to, like, 15 percent.” Hilariously, the episode of the podcast opens with solemn text embossed on a black screen, informing viewers that the interview was recorded before the horrific mass shooting at Brown University. As of this writing, the FBI has yet to apprehend a suspect.

As we just described at Slate, Katie Miller is a mind-numbingly dull interviewer, but this thing still goes on for 50 minutes, and it’s completely dominated by pablum. At one point, Miller asks Wilkins if she disagrees with Patel on anything significant. She stumbles over the potential political ramifications of the query before informing listeners that the FBI director likes spicy food, while she does not. Scintillating stuff.

Miller, who is adjacent to the conspiracy network that animates the MAGA media ecosystem, also opens up a discussion about whether Wilkins is an Israeli spy. Apparently, this is an assertion that gets batted around in the dankest corners of fascist Discords. (Among the comments underneath the YouTube video for a vibeless Wilkins track called “GRIT,” one reads, “This is exactly what I imagine Mossad agent singing country music would sound like.”) Wilkins responds by saying that she has never been to Israel.

If there is one theme throughout the dialogue, it is Patel laying the blame for all of his grievances at the feet of the fourth estate. In that sense, he’s following a well-worn track laid out by Trump. But Patel’s demeanor is genuinely baffling. My favorite of these swipes is when Miller asks Patel when he might get engaged to Wilkins. He retorts by saying that he won’t “let the media determine the speed in which this relationship moves.” What? What are you talking about, man? I implore every boyfriend reading this to give that line a shot the next time the topic of marriage comes up: “The New York Times doesn’t control me!!” Let me know how it goes.

I guess this is what counts as damage control in the spiraling psychedelia of Trump 2.0. It doesn’t seem likely that the fiasco surrounding Patel’s chartered flights is going to stick for long, if only because this version of the White House has made highly visible corruption a defining aesthetic. Only months ago, we learned that border czar Tom Homan accepted a bag of $50,000 in cash from FBI agents, and we breezed right past it. I mean, yes, Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee are probing Patel’s flight logs, which could surface more-embarrassing information. But I’m not holding my breath over here.

Maybe none of this is really damage control at all. Sometimes it really seems as if Wilkins is the first girlfriend Patel has ever had. The idea that he needed to appear on Miller’s podcast with Wilkins to “clear the air” or whatever belies a more visceral purpose—to issue another reminder, for the American people, that the FBI director is getting laid. There is a bushy-tailed earnestness in the way Patel trumpets this information, a spiral-eyed mania of a man who, at last, is on the receiving end of positive interaction with a woman and wants to rub it in our faces. Frankly, once you understand the cretins in Trump’s orbit through that framing, a lot about this current moment begins to make sense.

On Sunday, father-and-son gunmen armed with shotguns killed 15 people and injured 40 more at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia. Their target was Chanukah by the Sea, an annual event run by the Chabad of Bondi. The dead include a Holocaust survivor, a rabbi, and a 10-year-old girl. It is the deadliest mass shooting to occur in Australia since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, a tragedy that reshaped the nation and led to the creation of gun laws that have, until now, prevented such violence from being a regular occurrence.

It is hard to parse this violence as a person from a country where it is abnormal. It is impossible not to personalize the grief, shock, and confusion. I was scrolling Instagram Stories on a sleepy Sunday arvo when I saw a friend post “just heard what I think are gunshots at Bondi - what’s going on?” The events unfolded so rapidly and brutally that it has shocked Australia into a whiplash of the soul that we will be grappling with for years to come.

We are in shock. This does not happen here. And yet, it has. It is difficult to reconcile that reality with who we are and who we imagine ourselves to be as a nation.

In the worst ways possible, the early response to the attack has taken on contours that would be familiar to Americans. That’s partly because authorities have said the shooters were motivated by “Islamic State ideology,” and because Israel’s genocide in Gaza—and the Australian complicity in it, mostly at the hands of Americans—has been a roiling issue here.

In the immediate aftermath of this attack, Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the tragedy on Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese of the Australian Labor Party, for recognizing an independent state of Palestine back in September. In his early career, Albanese was an ally of Palestine, co-founding the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine in 1999, but as prime minister he has tacitly supported Israel, Netanyahu, and the genocide in every material sense beyond a few empty gestures and hollow statements. This has divided Labor’s moderate base and beyond, and the government’s unwillingness to criticize Israel, let alone stop selling them arms, has been a major reason for the mass protests that have had hundreds of thousands of Australians marching through the streets of our major cities every weekend since Oct. 7, 2023.

Earlier this year, Albanese controversially appointed an “Antisemitism envoy” to appease Zionist interest groups. Jillian Segal, whose husband had donated to the Nazi-adjacent far-right group Advance Australia, used this position to put forth a highly censorious and constitutionally dubious list of proposed reforms framed as a “plan to combat antisemitism” that would all but outlaw criticism of Israel in Australia if adopted (which they weren’t, but likely will be in the wake of this weekend’s events). Segal has done little else in this perfunctory role other than push the narrative that the boom in antisemitism stems from the peaceful pro-Palestine movement—a falsehood she was quick to repeat in immediate response to the attacks. She has ignored the many neo-Nazi and white nationalist marches that have taken place in Australia this year, and many have concluded that she perceives more antisemitic hatred in a keffiyeh than a literal swastika.

Despite neither of the shooters being at all linked as of this writing with the pro-Palestine movement, Australia’s conservative politicians, its conservative media (which is most of it), and its right, far right, and alt right have all been quick to link the attack to the pro-Palestine crowd, particularly the campus protests, where some claim the shooter was “radicalized.” Which is odd, as the young shooter appears to be a brickie (Australian for bricklayer) who never attended university. In fact, the shooters have been found to have affiliations with the Islamic State, which is a known enemy of the Palestinian people, the pro-Palestine movement, Hamas, and Hezbollah.

Still, Australia’s right, like America’s, do not turn their nose up at an opportunity. They have had a rough time of it of late. Our conservative party, the Coalition (a combination of the Liberals and the Nationals), now headed by placeholder leader Sussan Ley, was annihilated in one of the most resounding electoral defeats in Australia’s history in May 2025. So disastrous is Ley, the Coalition’s polling, and the Coalition’s electoral prospects both on the state and federal level, that our major conservative party is essentially on the point of extinction.

Unable to find a weak spot in Albanese’s radically Zen centrism, the Coalition cynically exploited Sunday’s bloodbath almost immediately. Ley laid the blame at Albanese’s feet, and Josh Frydenberg, a major figure of the party’s hard right, demanded Albanese take “personal responsibility” for the attack. Former Prime Minister John Howard—imagine Ronald Reagan crossed with Dick Cheney crossed with Gollum, or imagine if Richard Nixon was your longest-serving president—emerged from his lair to point fingers at Albanese, his government, and Howard’s oldest, most loathed enemy, the amorphous “left.” (Howard looms over the Coalition like Darth Sidious, and as prime minister, he was the architect of Australia’s involvement in the illegal Iraq war.)

These are the mainstream of Australian conservatism and the Australian right. Behind them are a cavalcade of bloodthirsty grifters, knuckle-draggers, and hatemongers whose immediate response to the news was to lick their lips. They have been waiting for an event like this their entire lives. Pauline Hanson, founder and head of One Nation, a party that has been the fetishized mascot of white nationalism and paranoiac race hatred in Australia for 30 years, arrived with her newly anointed goon Barnaby Joyce to fire off a hateful screed before the freshly laid memorial flowers. She condemned the prime minister, Muslims, and antisemitism—somewhat of an irony, as she was recently the headline speaker at one of the many neo-Nazi marches that have recurred in Melbourne and Sydney this past year.

Other prominent bigots preferred the safety of the internet. “Western civilisation enjoyer” Drew Pavlou, a basement-dwelling influencer known best for taking a decade to complete an undergrad degree, immediately began livestreaming the shootings on his monetized YouTube channel. He took to X and began firing out dangerous misinformation, egging on racial violence with the rabid Islamophobia that has become his bread and butter. As people still lay dying, he falsely claimed that a preplanned Christmas firework event taking place in Sydney was in fact the city’s Muslim community taking to the streets in celebration. As I write, he is livestreaming himself at the public memorial, where his excitement at the prospect of inciting a race war is palpable.

I focus on Drew as a particularly grotesque case study of the breed of professional hate-peddlers that America is all too aware and fond of. The deluge of misinformation that promulgated in the immediate wake of the attacks was fueled by American social media platforms that have prioritized and monetized bigotry and psychosis. X, Meta, and YouTube were flooded with A.I. fakes, the most darkly comical of which was a reimagining of the great hero of the day, Ahmed al-Ahmed, the Syrian Muslim fruit-shop owner who bravely wrestled a gun from one of the shooters, as a white man with a comfortably white name.

Australian racism is not too dissimilar from America’s—indeed, it is largely informed by it these days—but of course it is different by the very nature of our unique histories and cultures. Like America, Australia’s Islamophobia has been violent, demented, and frothing since 9/11, and, like America, our domestic and foreign policies have unfairly targeted Muslims and the Muslim world—Iraq, Palestine, Indonesia, and beyond. Our media, much of which is owned by Rupert Murdoch and other billionaires who sometimes outpace even him in their hatreds, regularly runs extremely Islamophobic content, occasionally resulting in real violence (such as the notorious Cronulla riots, which occurred nearly 20 years ago to the day of the Bondi shootings). This reached its nightmarish apex in the 2019 Christchurch shootings, where an Australian white nationalist terrorist flew to New Zealand and murdered 51 people at a mosque. This took place in New Zealand, but it was very much an Australian shooting.

Hatred breeds hatred, and the surge of antisemitism, neo-Nazi groups like the NSN, and white nationalists like Pauline Hanson and Drew Pavlou, exists within, and is inflamed by, the malformed hatreds that are tragically intrinsic to the Australian identity. Antisemitic attacks were on the rise far before this month, raising alarm. I cannot sum up 250 years of Australian history in this article—it is hard enough to contextualize the last week—but it is important for you to do that most un-American of things and recognize that these events do not take place in a void, but rather within the specific context of a long and complicated history.

But the right’s narrative may not win out in the end, especially with the deeply unpopular and off-putting American right weighing in loudly and regularly on their behalf, laying the blame on Australia’s infamously strict gun laws. It might sound alien to even moderate Americans, but the immediate consensus here after the shooting has been that our gun laws are not strict enough—an observation many experts have been making for years as private gun ownership has bloomed exponentially, especially in the past decade. Both our prime minister and the premier of New South Wales, Chris Minns—who was an ally of the pro-gun Shooters, Fishers, and Farmers Party—have vowed gun law reform. How a person like the alleged shooter who the ASIO (our FBI) had been tracking for ties to the Islamic State associations as early as 2019 was able to acquire a gun license, let alone six shotguns, will no doubt be the subject of a lengthy parliamentary inquiry in the months to come.

In truth, if Sunday holds any lessons for Americans, it’s that Australia’s gun laws, though flawed, work. How many would have been killed if the terrorists were able to buy a couple of AR-15s from their local Coles? How many mass shootings would we have had since Port Arthur if John Howard (yes, the same man I described above) had not brought in such strict and transformative gun laws in the immediate aftermath? All I know is this is the first mass shooting on Australian soil since 1995. America has had 468 this year.

Still, American discourse, and American policy, regularly leads us about by the nose. We are The Kid to your Judge Holden, and we will ride with you to our doom. Our role as loyal foot soldiers in every American war since Korea, but especially in Iraq, and again with our support of Israel (which is largely to placate the United States), has a hand here. Our insidiously growing gun culture and broken discourse and outpourings of online-hatred blueprints imported from America have again brought the violence home to us. We of all people should know the boomerang swings back, but we got too dependent on you to truly acknowledge that. As I write, Australia’s mainstream journalists—many of whom rank among the dumbest on Earth—are riling up great dramas and screeds in a tone and style that is distinctly American, which is to say, worrying.

And yet, it is useful to see these people as a loud minority.

A contradiction I’m sure you understand is that Australia is a country of many hatreds, but also a country of great love. That love for one another is what we aspire toward as Australians; those who act on this love are the greatest Australians there are. Ahmed al-Ahmed, the Syrian refugee who confronted the shooter head-on, saving countless lives, is what we’d call the light on the hill—a kind of goodness and courage we, as Australians, must collectively strive for. Boris and Sofia Gurman, two Bondi locals who were killed in their attempts to stop one of the shooters, reflexively moved to save lives at the cost of their own. The community that has come forward to grieve and lay flowers, the swimmers who have insisted on keeping this beloved beach a place of mateship and joy, the imams and rabbis who hug and shake hands and hold each other in mourning, understanding, and support, the millions of “Are you OK?” “How are you feeling?” and “I’ll ride with you if you’re feeling unsafe” texts sent between friends, neighbors, and comrades, the record-breaking amount of blood donations given these past few days, and the rejection of violent hatred as abject, alien, and fundamentally un-Australian—this is what it has always meant, and will continue to mean, to be what we call “True Blue.” This is the Australia as it should and must be.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/amazon_blocked_fake_dprk_workers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Even Amazon isn&#39;t immune to North Korean scammers who try to score remote jobs at tech companies so they can funnel their wages to Kim Jong Un&#39;s coffers.

The cloud giant has stopped more than 1,800 suspected scammers from the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea (DPRK, aka North Korea) from joining its workforce since April 2024, Amazon Chief Security Officer Steve Schmidt said Thursday.

&quot;And we&#39;ve detected 27 percent more DPRK-affiliated applications quarter over quarter this year,&quot; Schmidt said in a LinkedIn post.

North Korea’s fake worker scam sees real developers use fake or stolen identities to apply for remote jobs at US and European companies. Applicants often use AI tools to help draft resumés or develop social media personas, and sometimes the scammers even use deepfakes during video interviews to increase their chances of getting hired.

Once they&#39;re employed, they remit much of their income to the North Korean regime, which, according to the US government, uses it to fund weapons programs.

Most Fortune 500 companies have fallen for the scam, which has cost American businesses tens of millions of dollars.

In some cases, the fraudsters use their insider access to steal proprietary source code and other sensitive data, and then extort their employers with threats to leak corporate data unless a ransom is paid.

&quot;We believe, at this point, every Fortune 100 and potentially Fortune 500 has a pretty high number of risky employees on their books,&quot; Socure Chief Growth Officer Rivka Little told The Register in an earlier interview.

In addition to using fake IT workers to support its illicit activities, DPRK-linked crews have also developed a newer variant of BeaverTail, an infostealer and malware loader, that adds sophisticated obfuscation abilities and signature evasion.

Darktrace researchers say an updated sample of the malware they uncovered in November contained more than 128 layers dedicated entirely to concealment and used decoy payloads to evade detection.

Infosec researchers have linked the malware to multiple subgroups, including Famous Chollima, Gwisin Gang, and Tenacious Pungsan, within the Lazarus Group, and believe attackers used it in the ongoing Contagious Interview campaign.

BeaverTail has been seen targeting Windows, macOS, and Linux systems, and is frequently used to load the Python-based InvisibleFerret backdoor. In addition to the usual info-stealer capabilities, it also has several surveillance features including keylogging, screenshot capture, and clipboard monitoring – which attackers use to steal cryptocurrency wallet data.

According to Schmidt, Amazon uses a combination of AI screening and human verification to filter out suspected fraudsters.

&quot;Our detections combine AI-powered screening with human verification,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Our AI model analyzes connections to nearly 200 high-risk institutions, anomalies across applications, and geographic inconsistencies. We verify identities through background checks, credential verification, and structured interviews.&quot;

But even with this amount of compute-and-people-power, it&#39;s getting more difficult to detect fake IT workers.

Some North Korean operatives have moved on from creating fake online identities and instead inhabit real software engineers&#39; identities by using stolen credentials to hijack dormant LinkedIn accounts to add credibility to their job applications, Schmidt said.

Plus, they often work with American laptop farmers who receive corporate laptop shipments and host computers for overseas IT workers posing as US residents, enabling the devices to appear to be operating from within the United States.

As Okta Threat Intelligence pointed out earlier this year, fraudsters are interviewing at a growing number of firms outside the IT sector including finance, healthcare, public administration, and professional services.

Companies can defend against this risk, as The Register has previously reported.

As Schmidt told Bloomberg, keystroke lag is one giveaway.

Small details, such as formatting US phone numbers with &quot;+1&quot; rather than &quot;1,&quot; or degrees from schools that don&#39;t offer claimed majors – when combined with other indicators – can also be strong hints, he wrote on LinkedIn.

&quot;If you&#39;re concerned about these threats in your organization, query your databases for common indicators: patterns in resumés, emails, phone numbers, educational backgrounds,&quot; Schmidt said. &quot;Implement identity verification at multiple hiring stages and monitor for anomalous technical behavior: unusual remote access, unauthorized hardware.&quot; ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/firefox_no_ai_alternative_waterfox/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waterfox, a popular fork of Firefox, is saying nay to AI. Considering how unpopular Mozilla&#39;s plan to botify its browser has become, this could win the alternative some converts.

The latest post on the Waterfox blog even says right in its URL that it is a &quot;response to Mozilla.&quot; In it, lead developer Alex Kontos says:

Waterfox will not include LLMs. Full stop. At least and most definitely not in their current form or for the foreseeable future.

This is, as the URL says, in response to new Mozilla head honcho Anthony Enzor-DeMeo, whose first blog from the role says:

Firefox will grow from a browser into a broader ecosystem of trusted software. Firefox will remain our anchor. It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions.

In the words of the late great Douglas Adams, &quot;this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.&quot; Many are quoting a Mastodon post from &quot;TheZeldaZone&quot;:

&quot;Hello, We&#39;re Firefox, The Only Browser That Hasn&#39;t Hit Itself In The Dick With A Hammer. For years now, folks use us because of our un-hammered dick. Now, you may be wondering why today we&#39;ve brought this hammer and pulled out our dick. Well I&#39;m glad you asked–&quot;

Mozilla is not totally oblivious – just dyslexic when it comes to reading the room – and has responded to reactions to the &quot;modern AI browser&quot; statement with a toot of its own from the Firefox for Web Developers account:

Something that hasn&#39;t been made clear: Firefox will have an option to completely disable all AI features.

We&#39;ve been calling it the AI kill switch internally. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll ship with a less murderous name, but that&#39;s how seriously and absolutely we&#39;re taking this.

All AI features will also be opt-in. I think there are some grey areas in what &#39;opt-in&#39; means to different people (e.g. is a new toolbar button opt-in?), but the kill switch will absolutely remove all that stuff, and never show it in future. That&#39;s unambiguous.

As we have described before, Waterfox is one of the Reg FOSS desk&#39;s favorite Firefox-based browsers. It originated as a 64-bit rebuild, back when the Mozilla original was 32-bit only. Over time, it evolved. This correspondent has been using it since 2017, which was when the Firefox Quantum project bore fruit in the form of Firefox 57. Thanks to the then-new Electrolysis architecture, Firefox Quantum was multi-threaded, and thus better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs.

The problem was encapsulated by the description of the Classic Add-ons Archive:

This catalog contains 93,598 versions of 19,450 Firefox add-ons created by 14,274 developers over the past 15 years using XUL/XPCOM technology before Mozilla decided to ruin the classic extensions ecosystem and go exclusively to WebExtensions.

At the time Firefox 57 came out, this vulture had a carefully assembled collection of nearly 30 extensions, giving Firefox 56 a combined vertical tab bar and bookmarks bar, syncing our bookmarks automatically between machines, doing multi-threaded downloads that could be resumed if they failed, automatically logging in to vexatious sites with shared fake credentials and much more. After Firefox 57, all but two or three trivial ones were gone. So, we switched to Waterfox and got them all back.

Since Firefox is now 64-bit native, that&#39;s no longer a selling point for Waterfox, but there are others. It&#39;s based on Mozilla&#39;s ESR versions, so it has a more leisurely update schedule than Firefox&#39;s decade-old monthly releases. For a long time, it maintained compatibility with XUL addons, which is still available via Waterfox Classic. Now, the mainstream release has had to drop that, but both the main branch and Classic turn off all of Mozilla&#39;s telemetry – which made it immune to the Foxstuck bug in 2022. It has its own integrated vertical tab bar, which it implemented long before Firefox.

For Linux folks using desktops with a global menu bar, such as Xfce, KDE Plasma, and Unity, then Waterfox still works with it – unlike Firefox itself.

There are other Firefox-derived browsers out there, including LibreWolf, Floorp, and the Zen Browser with its impressive browser window tiling. Waterfox remains our go-to, though – and with Mozilla&#39;s enthusiasm for automated plagiarism as a service, we suspect more of its fans may start to look elsewhere. ®

            <h2>Snowflake update caused a blizzard of failures worldwide</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake pushed an update this week that caused a “major outage” worldwide, leaving many users unable to query data, experiencing failures when ingesting files, and receiving error messages for 13 hours, the company wrote in an impact statement.

“Our initial investigation has identified that our most recent release introduced a backwards-incompatible database schema update,” the company wrote in its incident report. “As a result, previous release packages errantly referenced the updated fields, resulting in version mismatch errors and causing operations to fail or take an extended amount of time to complete.”

The update took down 10 of Snowflake’s 23 global regions. In the US, the outage hit chunks of Snowflake customers accessing its Azure data center in Virginia, and its AWS data center in Oregon. Globally, users of Snowflake’s data centers in Ireland, Zurich, London, Sweden, Mumbai, Singapore, and Mexico were hit.

The outage was first reported as an issue with Snowflake Data Cloud at 0255 UTC Tuesday when customer queries against their data returned SQL execution errors.

About an hour and a half later, Snowflake said that it had identified the problem and it was working on a fix. The systems were back up and running by about 0500 UTC.

“I dealt with this yesterday,” one user groused on Snowflake&#39;s Reddit page. “Took them way too long to role [sic] back this change”

The company said it would release its root cause analysis within five days of closing the incident, which should be Sunday.

“We have nothing additional to share at this time,” a spokesperson told The Register.

This was Snowflake’s second incident inside of a week after a Dec 10 database infrastructure issue caused degraded performance among users who employ its software out of the AWS datacenter in Oregon, according to its status page.

Snowflake is not the only data platform with issues this month.

Between Dec 11 and Dec 13, Snowflake’s archrival Databricks had a days-long service disruption where customers in several US regions experienced latency or errors when using Mosaic AI, the company’s assistant for building AI agents, which was contained to users of the company’s Azure data centers in seven US regions.

That came after customers in its US Gov West AWS region endured a “complete outage, with all Databrick services presumed unavailable” for about two hours on Dec 3.

Unlike Snowflake, which lists the preliminary cause of outages and follows up with a root cause analysts on its incident page, Databricks does not publish the cause of its outages.

Databricks did not respond to an email from The Register seeking comment. ®

An internal memo says its algorithm will be retrained on US user data after the deal closes in January.

TikTok has finalized the deal to sell its US business, according to reports from Axios, The Hollywood Reporter, and CNBC. They report that a memo from TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew to employees on Thursday said the deal will close on January 22nd, with Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX owning 45 percent of the company, while its China-based parent company ByteDance will hold 20 percent.

The remainder of the company will be held by “affiliates of existing ByteDance investors,” Axios reports. TikTok briefly went dark in the US in January as the divest-or-ban law came into effect. Throughout the year, President Donald Trump granted TikTok a series of extensions to come up with a deal to sell its US-based operations. The US and China agreed on a “framework” for a deal in September, leading to yet another extension that expired on December 16th.

“Your efforts keep us operating at the highest level and will ensure that TikTok continues to grow and thrive in the U.S. and around the world,” Chew wrote, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “With these agreements in place, our focus must stay where it’s always been — firmly on delivering for our users, creators, businesses and the global TikTok community.”

Reports indicate that the US-based TikTok will use an algorithm based on the one created by ByteDance, but it will be retrained on US user data and controlled by Oracle. TikTok didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.

            <div id="article-text">A conversation with the head of Threads Conor Hayes on creators, ads, and the fediverse.

A conversation with the head of Threads Conor Hayes on creators, ads, and the fediverse.

This is an excerpt of Sources by Alex Heath, a newsletter about AI and the tech industry, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.

By all measures, Meta’s Threads app had a very good year. The app was Apple’s second-most-downloaded iOS app of the year, trailing only ChatGPT. Threads now has 400 million monthly and 150 million daily active users.

“There are consumers who are ravenous to consume the content.”

That growth is still coming mainly from Meta’s other platforms. “We do a lot of work in Instagram and Facebook to show off what’s going on in Threads,” Connor Hayes, the head of Threads, told me this week. The playbook: surface personalized Threads content in your Instagram and Facebook feeds, get you to download the app, then wean you off needing those nudges to check it consistently. “We do a bunch of work to get people off of being dependent on those promotions and wake up in the morning and just want to open the app,” Hayes explained.

Hayes, who helped launch Threads initially and was named its head in September, has been focused on clarifying the platform’s identity. In our conversation, he said the goal for Threads is to be “the place on the internet to talk about what’s going on in the world.” Practically, that means going vertical by vertical — sports, entertainment, news — and tipping both creators and consumers toward using the app more.

When it comes to competitors, Hayes is focused on more than just X. “Reddit has a ton of activity that is analogous to what happened on Twitter in the early days,” he said. “Discord has a bunch of these big group chat-style communities.” He acknowledged Twitter, now X, as “the app that pioneered the core format,” but made clear that the battle for real-time conversation is crowded.

There’s no direct monetization for creators on Threads right now. Hayes is pitching something different: Threads as a traffic channel to other platforms where creators actually get paid.

The clearest example is podcasts. Threads recently launched a feature that renders show and episode links from platforms like Spotify and lets users pin them to their profiles. Hayes said Threads is open to other partnerships with platforms like Substack and Patreon as well. But there’s no plan to let creators paywall content directly on Threads or to share ad revenue like YouTube.

Meanwhile, Threads is testing ads in four countries, including the US, but the load is deliberately light, Hayes told me. “We are ramping the ad load up steadily over the course of the next year,” he said, “but only doing it when we feel like there’s enough value on the consumer side of the app to justify doing that.”

Threads is testing a new feature called “Dear Algo” in a handful of countries. Users can ask to see more or less of a topic, share their algorithm prompt for others to use or remix, and have their personalized feed adjust to the prompt for three days. “After a heartbreaking loss of your sports team, you can be like, don’t show me NFL content for three days,” Hayes said. “But you’ll be ready on day four to come back in.”

The broader point: content understanding has gotten better thanks to LLMs. “We now don’t just know that a thing is about basketball. We know that it’s the 1998 NBA Finals, and it’s this player taking a shot for this team.” That precision is what makes this kind of algorithm steering possible. Hayes has been surprised by how specific early user requests are with prompts like, “show me more football content, but not Patrick Mahomes.”

Threads still supports federation with other apps like Mastodon, but Hayes was clear that it’s not a top priority for the current roadmap. “It’s something that we’re supporting, it’s something that we’re maintaining, but it’s not the thing that we’re talking about that’s gonna help the app break out,” he said.

“As someone who has built a zillion consumer products, it’s just really hard to keep these divergent platforms and products consistent on the same protocol over time,” he explained. “There’s always going to be the trade-offs that these companies are thinking about of how much energy do I want to pour into compatibility with this ecosystem versus iterating on this thing I’m building and seeing what’s valuable.”

Threads used to be mocked for how it would surface old content. Now, the app prioritizes recommending content from the last 24 hours, according to Hayes. “If something is four or five days old, even if it’s really good, we probably won’t show that.”

Unlike X, Hayes said Threads isn’t making a push to get more journalists and publishers on the app. “We just look at it like any other vertical, which is that there are certain creators who are really good at this and know a lot about it. There are consumers who are ravenous to consume the content.” He said Threads isn’t downranking news, but it’s “not one of the focus verticals right now.”

            <div id="article-text">If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

In 2022, we called a simple magnetic ring from Anker the best MagSafe phone grip, but things have evolved dramatically since then! You can buy two or even three magnetic rings joined at the hip these days to wield your iPhone, recent Pixel, or really any phone if you stick a magnetic case or included mounting ring on the back.

But the best I’ve yet tried are the double-sided $15-$25 Syncwire Magnetic Phone Ring Holder — and, more recently, the $40 OhSnap Snap Grip 5.

Unlike the Anker we swore by for years, both are double-sided magnet rings. I don’t have to take them off when I plop them on a MagSafe phone charger or car mount. And with them on, I can stick my phone directly to a fridge, filing cabinet, or certain pieces of gym equipment since the magnets work both ways.

But the real trick, the thing that sets them apart from the pack, is getting the right magnet strength. The OhSnap 5 now uses magnets so strong that it no longer needs any pesky adhesive to hold onto my phone — while the reverse side is just strong enough to stick to my magnetic car mount while also detaching easily.

My wife’s puffier version of the Syncwire also detaches easily, as I discussed in my September video below, but the standard version doesn’t. I often have to run back out to the car after accidentally leaving my Syncwire stuck to the charger.

As you’ll see in my videos embedded in this story, the Syncwire’s a pretty traditional ring save for its awesome ratcheting mechanism, which leaves fewer scrapes on my phone than the Anker and doubles as an excellent fidget toy.

The OhSnap works differently: instead of putting a finger through a ring, you place them in or around a set of interlocking flexible arms attached to a disc that retracts from the back. It looks downright weird but it’s impressively versatile: you can hold it between any two fingers like a PopSocket, or stick any of your fingers into the little cage between the arms. You can even slot the disc into a little notch to turn it into a basic phone stand.

You can see all those in my October 2024 video about the earlier Snap Grip 4 version:

$40 is a high price to pay for a phone grip, particularly one that’s had some sort of weakness in every revision so far. (My colleague Victoria Song broke her Snap Grip 3’s little fingers, the Snap Grip 4 had far stronger fingers but it also had the annoying adhesive, and now the new soft-touch coating is peeling off my Snap Grip 5 after a month or so of use, though it’s easy enough to scrape away.)

But the Snap Grip 5 is meaningfully thinner and lighter than the Syncwire, and I no longer accidentally leave it in the car. As a cheapskate and fidget toy lover, I might stick with my ratcheting Syncwire… but I’m definitely thinking I might gift a Snap Grip or two this Christmas!

Oh, and before you ask, my phone case is the Spigen Ultra Hybrid ZeroOne Edition. A lot of people ask!

            <h2>China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/18/1130148/china-ev-battery-recycle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.We like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.Regrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.—Antonio Regalado

Each time you’ve heard a borderline outlandish idea of what AI will be capable of, it often turns out that Sam Altman was, if not the first to articulate it, at least the most persuasive and influential voice behind it.For more than a decade he has been known in Silicon Valley as a world-class fundraiser and persuader. Throughout, Altman’s words have set the agenda. What he says about AI is rarely provable when he says it, but it persuades us of one thing: This road we’re on with AI can go somewhere either great or terrifying, and OpenAI will need epic sums to steer it toward the right destination. In this sense, he is the ultimate hype man.To understand how his voice has shaped our understanding of what AI can do, we read almost everything he’s ever said about the technology. His own words trace how we arrived here. Read the full story.—James O’Donnell

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t. Check out the rest of the package here.

Can AI really help us discover new materials?

One of my favorite stories in the Hype Correction package comes from my colleague David Rotman, who took a hard look at AI for materials research. AI could transform the process of discovering new materials—innovation that could be especially useful in the world of climate tech, which needs new batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and more.But the field still needs to prove it can make materials that are actually novel and useful. Can AI really supercharge materials research? And what would that look like? Read the full story.

Is this the electric grid of the future?Lincoln Electric System, a publicly owned utility in Nebraska, is used to weathering severe blizzards. But what will happen soon—not only at Lincoln Electric but for all electric utilities—is a challenge of a different order.Utilities must keep the lights on in the face of more extreme and more frequent storms and fires, growing risks of cyberattacks and physical disruptions, and a wildly uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. They must keep prices low amid inflationary costs. And they must adapt to an epochal change in how the grid works, as the industry attempts to transition from power generated with fossil fuels to power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind.The electric grid is bracing for a near future characterized by disruption. And, in many ways, Lincoln Electric is an ideal lens through which to examine what&#39;s coming. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
