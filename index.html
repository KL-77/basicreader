            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Civilization VII is coming to the iPhone and iPad, Apple and publisher 2K announced today.

Formally titled Sid Meier’s Civilization VII Arcade Edition, it is developed by Behaviour Interactive with input from original developer Firaxis Games.

Neither announcement makes any mention of a non-Arcade version, so this appears to be exclusively part of the subscription.

That shouldn’t be too much of a surprise; full-priced premium games have struggled on the platform when not bundled in a subscription. For example, Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption came out both as a standalone title on the App Store and as part of Netflix’s subscription. The Netflix version surpassed a staggering 3.3 million downloads, while the $40 direct purchase managed just over 10,000.

The announcement calls this release “the authentic Civilization experience,” which you can probably take to mean that it doesn’t simplify the gameplay in any way. That said, there is some fine print you shouldn’t miss.

The App Store listing for the game says this release will not receive any of the DLC planned for other platforms. It also notes that “post-launch updates that apply to other platforms may be excluded or delayed.” Also, the supported players listed is “1,” suggesting it may not have multiplayer. (The desktop and console versions already lack hotseat multiplayer, but they support online play.)

Civilization VII launched to mixed reception in early 2025. We liked it when we reviewed it at Ars, despite some notable shortcomings in terms of polish and user interface, and it has a decent community of dedicated players. However, it makes enormous changes to the classic series’ formula, drawing ideas from competitors like Humankind. Many players feel it strayed too far, and there are still some frustrations with the user interface not showing enough information to players.

It has gotten a steady stream of updates since launch, though, and 2K seems committed to continuing to release content and patches.

This version of Civilization VII is expected to launch on February 5, and it will run on iPhone, Mac, and iPad. There’s no mention of Apple TV, and the App Store page specifically notes that Intel Macs aren’t supported, so you’ll need an M1 or later Mac.

Apple also announced a few other Arcade releases coming on February 5, including Felicity’s Door and I Love Hue Too+. There will also be Retrocade, a digital arcade that includes Asteroids, Bubble Bobble, Centipede, Galaga, and others. Notably, Retrocade will get a Vision Pro release that will let players play on simulated cabinets in a 3D virtual arcade space.</div>

            <h2>Bandcamp bans purely AI-generated music from its platform</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/bandcamp-bans-purely-ai-generated-music-from-its-platform/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, Bandcamp announced on Reddit that it will no longer permit AI-generated music on its platform. “Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted on Bandcamp,” the company wrote in a post to the r/bandcamp subreddit. The new policy also prohibits “any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles.”

The policy draws a line that some in the music community have debated: Where does tool use end and full automation begin? AI models are not artists in themselves, since they lack personhood and creative intent. But people do use AI tools to make music, and the spectrum runs from using AI for minor assistance (cleaning up audio, suggesting chord progressions) to typing a prompt and letting a model generate an entire track. Bandcamp’s policy targets the latter end of that spectrum while leaving room for human artists who incorporate AI tools into a larger creative process.

The announcement emphasized the platform’s desire to protect its community of human artists. “The fact that Bandcamp is home to such a vibrant community of real people making incredible music is something we want to protect and maintain,” the company wrote. Bandcamp asked users to flag suspected AI-generated content through its reporting tools, and the company said it reserves “the right to remove any music on suspicion of being AI generated.”

As generative AI tools make it trivial to produce unlimited quantities of music, art, and text, this author once argued that platforms may need to actively preserve spaces for human expression rather than let them drown in machine-generated output. Bandcamp’s decision seems to move in that direction, but it also leaves room for platforms like Suno, which primarily host AI-generated music.

The policy contrasts with Spotify, which explicitly permits AI-generated music, although its users have expressed frustration with an influx of AI-generated tracks created by tools like Suno and Udio. Some of those AI music issues predate the latest tools, however. In 2023, Spotify removed tens of thousands of AI-generated songs from distributor Boomy after discovering evidence of artificial streaming fraud, but the flood just kept coming.

Last September, Spotify revealed that it had removed 75 million spam tracks over the previous year. It’s a figure that rivals the scale of Spotify’s actual catalog of 100 million tracks. Country music has also been particularly affected by AI music synthesis on Spotify, with AI-generated tracks sometimes topping genre charts above fully human tracks in December 2025.

In a newsroom post from last year, Spotify wrote that it envisioned “a future where artists and producers are in control of how or if they incorporate AI into their creative processes” and that the company wants to leave “those creative decisions to artists themselves.” Spotify focuses its enforcement on impersonation, spam, and deception rather than banning AI-generated content outright.

In some ways, the stark contrast between Bandcamp and Spotify reflects their different business models. Bandcamp operates as a direct marketplace where artists sell music and merchandise to fans, taking a cut of each sale. Spotify pays artists per stream, creating incentives for bad actors to flood the platform with cheap AI content and game the algorithm.

Bandcamp acknowledged the policy may evolve. “We will be sure to communicate any updates to the policy as the rapidly changing generative AI space develops,” the company wrote. The announcement also noted that the company had received feedback about this issue previously, writing, “Given the response around this to our previous posts, we hope this news is welcomed.”

Enforcement remains a question. Detecting AI-generated music is not straightforward, since today’s products of AI synthesis realistically imitate voices and even acoustic instruments. Bandcamp did not specify what tools or methods it would use to identify AI content, only that its team would review flagged submissions. In a world where seemingly unlimited quantities of music can now be created at the push of a button, that’s no minor task.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A New York man is suing Prenuvo, a celebrity-endorsed whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provider, claiming that the company missed clear signs of trouble in his $2,500 whole-body scan—and if it hadn’t, he could have acted to avert the catastrophic stroke he suffered months later.

Sean Clifford and his legal team claim that his scan on July 15, 2023, showed a 60 percent narrowing and irregularity in a major artery in his brain—the proximal right middle cerebral artery, a branch of the most common artery involved in acute strokes. But Prenuvo’s reviews of the scan did not flag the finding and otherwise reported everything in his brain looked normal; there was “no adverse finding.” (You can read Prenuvo’s report and see Clifford’s subsequent imaging here.)

Clifford suffered a massive stroke on March 7, 2024. Subsequent imaging found that the proximal right middle cerebral artery progressed to a complete blockage, causing the stroke. Clifford suffered paralysis of his left hand and leg, general weakness on his left side, vision loss and permanent double vision, anxiety, depression, mood swings, cognitive deficits, speech problems, and permanent difficulties with all daily activities.

He filed his lawsuit against Prenuvo in September 2024 in the New York State Supreme Court. In the lawsuit, he argues that if he had known of the problem, he could have undergone stenting or other minimally invasive measures to prevent the stroke.

In the legal proceedings since, Prenuvo, a California-based company, has tried to limit the damages that Clifford could seek, first by trying to force arbitration and then by trying to apply California laws to the New York case, as California law caps malpractice damages. The company failed on both counts. In a December ruling, a judge also denied Prenovo’s attempts to shield the radiologist who reviewed Clifford’s scan, William A. Weiner, DO, of East Rockaway, New York.

Notably, Weiner has had his medical license suspended in connection with an auto insurance scheme, in which Weiner was accused of falsifying findings on MRI scans.

In comments to Radiology Business in December, Neal Bhushan, the lawyer representing Clifford, said, “I am pleased that the court sided with us. This ruling reaffirms the strength and merits of our medical malpractice and negligence claims, and we look forward to continuing to litigate this matter in New York County Supreme Court.”

Prenuvo has declined to comment on the litigation but it told The Washington Post, “We take any allegation seriously and are committed to addressing it through the appropriate legal process. Our focus remains on delivering safe, high quality, proactive care to the patients who place their trust in us every day.”

Prenuvo is one of the most prominent providers of elective whole-body MRIs. It got an endorsement from Kim Kardashian, and its investors include supermodel Cindy Crawford and 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki.

Overall, Clifford’s case spotlights the ongoing controversy over the use of elective whole-body MRI scans. They are marketed as a way to catch problems early and give patients peace of mind about their health. But many doctors have significant complaints about the scans, which are generally not covered by insurance, including that they serve the worried wealthy, further widening health care disparities in the country. They also raise concerns that they are likely to identify insignificant abnormalities that will only lead to unnecessary medical appointments, tests, and treatments.

A standing statement from the American College of Radiology says there is not sufficient evidence to justify the scans.

To date, there is no documented evidence that total body screening is cost-efficient or effective in prolonging life. In addition, the ACR is concerned that such procedures will lead to the identification of numerous non-specific findings that will not ultimately improve patients’ health but will result in unnecessary follow-up testing and procedures, as well as significant expense.

Clifford’s case represents the other end of the spectrum, where reviews of whole-body, non-specific scans, which are not aimed at looking for anything specific, could miss a critical finding.

The top comment on a medical subreddit conversation of Clifford’s legal case elaborated on this concern: “I think their business model has been predicated on getting two types of people: worried well or very sick, and are not appropriately set up to handle patients with real but subtle findings their MRI and radiologists aren’t well suited to detect.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A 14,400-year-old wolf puppy’s last meal is shedding light on the last days of one of the Ice Age’s most iconic megafauna species, the woolly rhinoceros.

When researchers dissected the frozen mummified remains of an Ice Age wolf puppy, they found a partially digested chunk of meat in its stomach: the remnants of the puppy’s last meal 14,400 years ago. DNA testing revealed that the meat was a prime cut of woolly rhinoceros, a now-extinct 2-metric-ton behemoth that once stomped across the tundras of Europe and Asia. Stockholm University paleogeneticist Sólveig Guðjónsdóttir and her colleagues recently sequenced a full genome from the piece of meat, which reveals some secrets about woolly rhino populations in the centuries before their extinction.

“Sequencing the entire genome of an Ice Age animal found in the stomach of another animal has never been done before,” said Uppsala University paleogeneticist Camilo Chacón-Duque, a co-author of the study, in a recent press release.

Scientists found the freeze-dried corpse of the wolf puppy—and her sister—eroding out of the permafrost near the Siberian village of Tumat in 2011 and 2015. When the team brought the puppy to a lab for dissection in 2022, they found small pieces of her last meal still in her stomach. DNA sequencing identified the meat as woolly rhino (or Coelodonta antiquitatis, if you’re fancy) and the puppies as wolves, not dogs.

But extracting a full genome’s worth of DNA from the rhino meat was a challenge. After 14,400 years in the permafrost, DNA molecules break down, leaving genomicists only small, degraded strings. Sorting the rhino’s DNA from the wolf’s was also no small feat.

The rhino’s DNA suggests that it came from a genetically healthy population that was large enough to avoid inbreeding. Inbreeding leaves its mark in descendants’ genomes in the form of long strings of homozygous genes, in which the individual inherits the same version, or allele, of a gene from both parents. It’s normal to have some homozygous genes, but a genome laden with lots of long stretches of homozygosity could be a sign of inbreeding over several generations. The Tumat rhino (or what was left of it) showed no such signs.

That came as a surprise, since woolly rhinos disappear from the fossil record about 400 years later. Already, the species was making its last stand in northeastern Siberia; its range had been shrinking eastward since around 35,000 years ago. But apparently, on the cusp of extinction, the species was still doing pretty well in northeastern Siberia (except for this particular rhino, who got eaten by a wolf after what one can only assume was a bad day).

In the genome of a 49,000-year-old woolly rhino from a few hundred miles east in Rakvachan, Siberia, Guðjónsdóttir and her colleagues found clues about the species’ even more ancient history. Big changes in population size, among other events, can leave traces in the genome, and the researchers used those to estimate that between 114,000 and 63,000 years ago, the woolly rhino population dropped sharply, from about 15,600 to about 1,600.

Those numbers refer to what ecologists call the “effective population,” which means the number of rhinos breeding and contributing to the group’s gene pool (so there would have been more than 1,600 running around, but not all of them were reproducing). After 63,000 years ago, the woolly rhino population seems to have leveled out.

According to ecologists, an effective population of 1,600 rhinos would have been more than enough to keep the species thriving. Smaller populations, especially with shrinking ranges, are more vulnerable to being wiped out by events like environmental change, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks. And small populations are also more likely to face the genetic consequences of inbreeding, a loss of genetic diversity, and genetic drift (in which potentially harmful mutations can pile up), leaving the species even more vulnerable. The whole thing can turn into a vicious cycle.

For most species, the threshold for avoiding those genetic pitfalls is an effective population of around 1,000.

Researchers had expected to find woolly rhinos in dire straits by 14,400 years ago. Prior to discovering the Tumat genome inside a wolf’s stomach, the most recently sequenced woolly rhino genome dated to 18,400 years ago (and it was found just a few miles from the Rakvachan rhino). That genome showed all the signs of a healthy, stable population. But by 14,000 years ago, woolly rhinos disappeared from the fossil record—so it looked like their population must have started its death spiral shortly after 18,400 years ago.

But it turns out that the last woolly rhinos in the world probably died off in just a few hundred years, starting sometime after 14,400 years ago. And the culprit was probably a period of rapid climate warming called the Bølling–Allerød interstadial. An interstadial is a warmer period between the deepest freezes of an Ice Age, and the Bølling–Allerød lasted from 14,700 years ago to 12,800 years ago. Across the northern hemisphere, temperatures rose sharply; ice sheets collapsed, sea levels rose, and the woolly rhinos’ world changed too fast.

When Guðjónsdóttir and her colleagues compared the Tumat rhino’s genome to the one from 18,400 years ago, they found the same very low level of inbreeding and genetic load (a buildup of harmful genes, often from inbreeding or genetic drift). Whatever happened to the woolly rhino gene pool in the end, it hadn’t happened yet when Tumat got eaten by wolves.

In fact, the end of the woolly rhinos may have come so swiftly that it didn’t have time to leave a trace in the genome. The only way to answer that would, of course, be to sequence the genomes of woolly rhinos who lived even closer to the species extinction. And we have to find them first.

The fate of the woolly rhino may eventually shed some light on what’s happening to modern species facing extinction.

“In the current biodiversity crisis driven by anthropogenic climate change, it becomes increasingly important to understand the underlying drivers of population declines and the propensity of species going extinct,” wrote Guðjónsdóttir and her colleagues in their recent paper.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has toyed with personalized answers in Gemini, but that was just a hint of what was to come. Today, the company is announcing extensive “personal intelligence” in Gemini that allows the chatbot to connect to Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube to craft more useful answers to your questions. If you don’t want Gemini to get to know you, there’s some good news. Personal intelligence is beginning as a feature for paid users, and it’s entirely optional.

By every measure, Google’s models are at or near the top of the AI heap. In general, the more information you feed into a generative AI, the better the outputs are. And when that data is personal to you, the resulting inference is theoretically more useful. Google just so happens to have a lot of personal data on all its users, so it’s relatively simple to feed that data into Gemini.

As Personal Intelligence rolls out over the coming weeks, AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers will see the option to connect those data sources. Each can be connected individually, so you might choose to allow Gmail access but block Photos, for example. When Gemini is allowed access to other Google products, it incorporates that data into its responses.

Google VP Josh Woodward claims that he’s already seeing advantages while testing the feature. When shopping for tires, Gemini referenced road trip photos to justify different suggestions and pulled the license plate number from a separate image.

Gemini will cite when it uses your personal data. If the personalized answer isn’t what you want, you can re-run any output without personalization. You may also use temporary chats to get the standard Gemini output without using your account data. Disabling access to one or all data sources in the settings is also always an option.

Perhaps sensing that feeding more data into Gemini would give many people the creeps, Google’s announcement explains at great length how the company has approached privacy in Personal Intelligence. Google isn’t getting any new information about you—your photos, email, and search behaviors are already stored on Google’s servers, so “you don’t have to send sensitive data elsewhere to start personalizing your experience.”

Having the chatbot regurgitate your photos and emails might still be a little unsettling, but Google claims it has built guardrails that keep Gemini from musing on sensitive topics. For example, the chatbot won’t use any health information it finds. However, you can still ask for it to look at that information explicitly.

Google also stresses that your personal data is “not directly used to train the model.” So the images or search habits it references in outputs are not used for training, but the prompts and resulting outputs may be used. Woodward notes that all personal data is filtered from training data. Put another way, the system isn’t trained to learn your license plate number, but it is trained to be able to locate an image containing your license plate.

This feature will be in beta for awhile as it rolls out, and it may take several weeks to reach all paid Gemini accounts. It will work across all Gemini endpoints, including the web, Android, and iOS.

Google also says it plans to expand access to Personal Intelligence in Gemini down the road. Unless Google flip-flops on the default settings, you can leave this feature disabled. That ensures Gemini won’t get additional access to your data, but of course, all that data is still sitting on Google’s servers. This probably won’t be the last time Google tries to entice you to plug your photos into an AI tool.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/deny-deny-admit-uk-police-used-copilot-ai-hallucination-when-banning-football-fans/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After repeatedly denying for weeks that his force used AI tools, the chief constable of the West Midlands police has finally admitted that a hugely controversial decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans from the UK did involve hallucinated information from Microsoft Copilot.

In October 2025, Birmingham’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG) met to decide whether an upcoming football match between Aston Villa (based in Birmingham) and Maccabi Tel Aviv could be held safely.

Tensions were heightened in part due to an October 2 terror attack against a synagogue in Manchester where several people were killed by an Islamic attacker.

West Midlands Police, who were a key member of the SAG, argued that the upcoming football match could lead to violence in Birmingham, and they recommended banning fans from the game. The police pointed specifically to claims that Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had been violent in a recent football match in Amsterdam.

This decision was hugely controversial, and it quickly became political. To some Jews and conservatives, it looked like Jewish fans were being banned from the match even though Islamic terror attacks were the more serious source of violence. The football match went ahead on November 6 without fans, but the controversy around the ban has persisted for months.

Making it worse was the fact that the West Midlands Police narrative rapidly fell apart. According to the BBC, police claimed that the Amsterdam football match featured “500-600 Maccabi fans [who] had targeted Muslim communities the night before the Amsterdam fixture, saying there had been ‘serious assaults including throwing random members of the public’ into a river. They also claimed that 5,000 officers were needed to deal with the unrest in Amsterdam, after previously saying that the figure was 1,200.”

Amsterdam police made clear that the West Midlands account of bad Maccabi fan behavior was highly exaggerated, and the BBC recently obtained a letter from the Dutch inspector general confirming that the claims were inaccurate.

But it was one flat-out error—a small one, really—that has made the West Midlands Police recommendation look particularly shoddy. In a list of recent games with Maccabi Tel Aviv fans present, the police included a match between West Ham (UK) and Maccabi Tel Aviv. The only problem? No such match occurred.

So where had this completely fantasized detail come from? As an inquiry into the whole situation was mounted, Craig Guildford, the chief constable of the West Midlands Police, was hauled before Parliament in December 2025 and again in early January 2026 to answer questions. Both times, he claimed the police did not use AI—the obvious suspect in a case like this. In December, Guildford blamed “social media scraping” gone wrong; in January, he chalked it up to some bad Googling.

“We do not use AI,” he told Parliament on January 6. “On the West Ham side of things and how we gained that information, in producing the report, one of the officers would usually go to… a system, which football officers use all over the country, that has intelligence reports of previous games. They did not find any relevant information within the searches that they made for that. They basically Googled when the last time was. That is how the information came to be.”

But Guildford admitted this week that this explanation was, in fact, bollocks. As he acknowledged in a letter on January 12, “I [recently] became aware that the erroneous result concerning the West Ham v Maccabi Tel Aviv match arose as result of a use of Microsoft Co Pilot.”

He had not intended to deceive anyone, he added, saying that “up until Friday afternoon, [I] understood that the West Ham match had only been identified through the use of Google.”

This has made a bad situation even worse. Today, in the House of Commons, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood gave a long statement on the case in which she threw Guildford under the bus and backed over him five or six times.

Mahmood blamed the ban on “confirmation bias” by the police. She said the Amsterdam stories they used were “exaggerated or simply untrue.” And she highlighted the fact that Guildford claimed “AI tools were not used to prepare intelligence reports,” but now “AI hallucination” was said to be responsible.

The whole thing was a “failure of leadership,” and Guildford “no longer has my confidence,” she said.

This last bit was something that everyone in the UK appears to agree on. Conservatives want Guildford to go, too, with party leaders calling for his resignation. MP Nick Timothy has been ranting for days on X about the issue, especially the fact that hallucination-prone AI tools are being used to produce security decisions.

“More detail on the misuse of AI by the police,” he wrote today. “They didn’t just deny it to the home affairs committee. They denied it in FOI requests. They said they have no AI policy. So officers are using a new, unreliable technology for sensitive purposes without training or rules.”</div>

            <h2>Financial Expert Says OpenAI Is on the Verge of Running Out of Money</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry continues to pour tens of billions of dollars into resource-intensive models and the infrastructure to run them. In the face of it all, their promises of kickstarting a technological revolution that could one day be immensely profitable remain convincing enough for investors to prop up sky-high valuations — at least for now.

But actually turning a profit is likely many years away for the vast majority of AI companies, and that’s if it ever comes. Who will stand to benefit from the rampant expenditures also remains a subject of heated debate, as corporations like Google, Meta, and OpenAI continue to race each other for dominance in the space.

Google and Meta already have successful businesses doing other things, but OpenAI doesn’t. That hasn’t stopped it from committing to spend well over $1 trillion before the end of the decade, an astronomical and extremely risky bet on scale even as its revenue lags. Users have shown a low willingness to pay for ChatGPT subscriptions, and the company has only begun exploring other revenue-generating avenues.

It all adds up to an enormous unanswered question: how long can OpenAI keep burning cash?

In a new essay for the New York Times, Sebastian Mallaby, senior fellow at the nonpartisan think tank Council on Foreign Relations, predicts that the Sam Altman-led company could run out of money “over the next 18 months.”

He argued that OpenAI’s competitors, industry stalwarts like Google, Microsoft, and Meta, could use the money they earned from their legacy businesses to pour hundreds of billions into developing and scaling their AI models — while OpenAI doesn’t have that luxury.

Mallaby is no AI hater. He’s extremely bullish on AI overall, arguing that “businesses usually take decades to deploy new technologies successfully,” whereas the AI industry has made “striking” progress in just three years.

In other words, Mallaby isn’t betting against a growing AI bubble — he’s singling out his predicted winners and losers of the ongoing AI race. And despite becoming a household name after the launch of ChatGPT just over three years ago, he expects OpenAI to become a footnote in AI history less than two years from now.

While OpenAI has raised record amounts of funding for a private company, the company is still “hemorrhaging cash,” burning through more than $8 billion in 2025 alone.

“Even if OpenAI reneges on many of those promises and pays for others with its overvalued shares, the company must still find daunting sums of capital,” Mallaby wrote. “However rich the eventual AI prize, the capital markets seem unlikely to deliver.”

After running out of cash, the researcher suggested that OpenAI could be “absorbed by Microsoft, Amazon or another cash-rich behemoth.”

But even with one of the biggest names in the game going under, Altman and his company will leave a lasting legacy behind, Mallaby argued.

An “OpenAI failure wouldn’t be an indictment of AI It would be merely the end of the most hype-driven builder of it,” he wrote.

Many other experts agree that 2026 could be a “make-or-break year” for OpenAI as pressure on the industry continues to mount.

Altman is holding onto his guns, declaring “code red” and doubling down on ChatGPT to keep up with the firm’s biggest competitor, Google.

“This is the WeWork story on steroids,” one venture capital boss, who is invested in one of OpenAI’s rivals, told The Economist last month. The coworking space company famously collapsed like a house of cards and went bankrupt in 2023 after years of turmoil, churning through billions of dollars by leasing and buying commercial real estate.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A passenger bailed from his Waymo robotaxi as the vehicle drove dangerously close to an oncoming railcar.

Viral footage of the incident, which took place last Wednesday, shows the car blundering down a stretch of light rail tracks in Phoenix, Arizona, as if it were an actual motorist lane it was supposed to be driving in. The passenger, smelling trouble, exits the car during one of its random stops without looking back.

“Oh get out get out get out!” the bystander taking the footage can be heard saying. Moments later, a railcar a few hundred yards directly behind the Waymo can be briefly seen beginning to pull out from the station.

But the Waymo’s antics weren’t over yet. After driving again, it then suddenly stops as another railcar comes lumbering down the opposing pair of tracks, while the one behind it appears unsure of whether to proceed. Piling one bad decision on top of another, the robotaxi decides to start reversing, but doesn’t leave the track before the video ends.

@Waymo what happened here? passenger said im out🤣 #waymo #fyp #fail #tiktokfail #funny

A Valley Metro spokesperson said that Waymo was notified about the incident after an employee noticed the baffling spectacle.

“At approximately 9 a.m. on Wednesday morning, a Valley Metro employee observed an autonomous Waymo vehicle on the northbound light rail tracks near Southern Avenue and Central Avenue in Phoenix,” the spokesperson said, as quoted by local news station KTVK. “Light rail operations staff responded to the scene, and Waymo was contacted. To minimize service impacts, northbound and southbound trains exchanged passengers before reversing direction to continue service.”

Waymo robotaxis, despite touting an impressive safety record, have been known to get into all kinds of bizarre traffic contretemps, many of them dangerous. The cars have been caught driving on the wrong side of the road, getting stuck in roundabouts, blowing through police standoffs, and ignoring stopped school buses. The company also faced intense outrage after one of its self-driving cabs ran over and killed a beloved bodega cat in San Francisco.

Scrutiny into the robotaxis’ safety and capabilities is higher than ever after seemingly its entire fleet went haywire during a power outage in the Bay Area last month, plunging the streets of San Francisco into chaos as the rudderless cabs piled up at intersections and blocked traffic.

Andrew Maynard, an emerging and transformative technology professor at Arizona State University, dismissed the latest Waymo incident as an edge case.

“I actually felt a little sorry for the car. It obviously made a bad decision and got itself in a difficult place,” Maynard told KTVK. “This is exactly one of those edge cases, what we call them. Something unexpected where the machine drove like a machine rather than a person.”

Waymo has not made a statement about the incident.

            <h2>Antarctica’s Former Largest Iceberg Is Now Completely Disintegrating</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/largest-iceberg-disintegrating">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An enormous iceberg that split off from the Antarctic ice sheet decades ago has turned an alarmingly bright shade of vivid blue — an alarming indication that it’s about to undergo complete disintegration before the much warmer summer months are over.

When it first detached in 1986, the ice giant known as A-23A was twice the size of Rhode Island, becoming one of the largest and oldest bergs to be tracked by scientists, according to NASA. In January 2025, it measured around 1,410 square miles, earning it the Guinness world record for the largest existing iceberg.

It has since shrunk to a mere 456 square miles, roughly the size of Manhattan, by early January following several major pieces breaking off over the last year. According to data by the US National Ice Center, several other icebergs have now overtaken A-23A in terms of total square miles.

While the berg’s birth 40 years ago isn’t believed to have been the result of human-induced climate change, it’s yet another pertinent reminder that we will continue seeing massive icebergs, or “megabergs,” calving from the melting Antarctic ice shelf as global temperatures continue to climb and warm ocean waters.

A satellite image highlighted by NASA on its website last week shows the enormous iceberg “sopping with blue meltwater” as it drifts off the coast of the southern tip of South America — a “giant swimming pool, as New Scientist put it. The image, which was taken on December 26 by NASA’s Terra satellite, shows pools of deep blue water visible on its surface, which, according to experts are clear signs of “ongoing disintegration events.”

“You have the weight of the water sitting inside cracks in the ice and forcing them open,” explained University of Colorado Boulder senior research scientist Ted Scambos in a statement to NASA.

The blue diagonal stripes visible in the satellite image are of particular interest. Experts believe they’re scour marks that date back to a time when A-23A was dragged across Antarctic bedrock hundreds of years ago.

“The striations formed parallel to the direction of flow, which ultimately created subtle ridges and valleys on the top of the iceberg that now direct the flow of meltwater,” added National Snow & Ice Data Center senior research scientist Walt Meier told NASA. “It’s impressive that these striations still show up after so much time has passed, massive amounts of snow have fallen, and a great deal of melting has occurred from below.”

The situation is dire enough that scientists believe A-23A could be months, if not weeks, away from disintegrating completely.

“I certainly don’t expect A-23A to last through the austral summer,” retired University of Maryland Baltimore County scientist Chris Shuman told NASA.

At the current rate, temperatures are already around three degrees Celsius warmer than expected — such a disintegration could accelerate.

A-23A left the relatively shallow waters near the Antarctic ice shelf in 2020, and spent several years drifting and spinning. It almost collided with South Georgia island last year.

NASA described its deathwatch as a “bittersweet moment.”

“I’m incredibly grateful that we’ve had the satellite resources in place that have allowed us to track it and document its evolution so closely,” Shuman said. “A-23A faces the same fate as other Antarctic bergs, but its path has been remarkably long and eventful. It’s hard to believe it won’t be with us much longer.”

Meanwhile, scientists race to better understand how icebergs behave and how shrinking glaciers due to global warming affect their famously unpredictable behavior.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rumors are running rampant online that Matt and Ross Duffer used OpenAI’s ChatGPT when producing the last season of “Stranger Things” after fans zoomed on a still from a behind-the-scenes documentary that appears to show that one of the brothers had the AI chatbot open while working on the script.

“WTF man, now we know why season 5 sucked,” wrote one upset fan of the show on X-formerly-Twitter in response.

Martina Radwan, director of the documentary “One Last Adventure: The Making of Stranger Things 5,” told The Hollywood Reporter in a new interview that she didn’t witness anybody using ChatGPT in the tv show writer’s room.

“No, of course not,” she said. “I witnessed creative exchanges. I witnessed conversation.”

Of course, a person making a hagiographic documentary about the production of the show for Netflix probably isn’t the world’s most neutral source. And she doesn’t quite shut the door on its use, either.

“But to me it’s like, doesn’t everybody have it open, to just do quick research?” she caveated in her hard-to-follow answer to the question.

Nonetheless, the online controversy and the interview show that many people who watch original entertainment don’t want a whiff of AI around their favorite movies or shows, though some production companies have already made forays into its use, most prominently in “de-aging” actors.

Controversies have erupted online when AI use has been unearthed, including its use in tweaking actor Adrien Brody’s Hungarian accent in the movie “The Brutalist” and for generating promotional posters for director Alex Garland’s movie “Civil War.”

Viewers and industry experts should expect more of these flashpoints to erupt as Hollywood bigwigs debate whether to use AI.

Some are stridently against the tech — director Guillermo del Toro said he would rather die than use it — but entertainment giants are rapidly jumping on board. Disney, for instance, recently signed a $1 billion licensing deal with OpenAI, which will allow users to play with Disney-owned characters in OpenAI’s video generator Sora.

The debate is far from over, though. Big tech has already eaten journalism’s lunch — and perhaps Hollywood is next on the menu.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Color us shocked: pretty much everyone hates that Elon Musk’s Grok has been digitally undressing photos of adults and children.

At least that’s the case in the UK, providing the closest thing we’ve currently got to a gauge of the public sentiment on the issue. In a new survey conducted by YouGov amid the latest controversy surrounding the xAI chatbot, a staggering 97 percent of respondents said that AI tools shouldn’t be allowed to generate sexually explicit content of children, and 96 percent said they shouldn’t be able to generate “undressed” images of minors only wearing clothing like underwear, either. Sanity may not prevail on X, but it does at least appear to still have a firm grip in real life.

The overwhelming consensus goes to show just how much of a nerve xAI and Grok struck over the past week and half as the bot allowed users to easily generate nudes or sexually charged images of people, many of them minors, whose photos were shared on X, Musk’s social media platform where Grok operates. The trend spiraled out of control so quickly that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated the bot was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute.

Outrage quickly spread against the appalling practice among the public and regulators, and some countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, moved to ban access to X outright. Prime minister Keir Starmer has hinted that the UK could follow suit. The saga also put pressure on Google and Apple for continuing to host X on their app stores, despite it violating the rules.

Yet xAI has not made an official statement regarding the Grok generations, which some experts say could be illegal — despite facing the public for some of Grok’s previous controversies, such as when it began styling itself as “MechaHitler” during a racist posting spree. Musk, meanwhile, simply joked that the whole affair was “way funnier” than the trends started by other AI chatbots.

Overall, the YouGov poll shows that the British public continues to despise Musk’s platform, with 65 percent holding a negative view of X, and only 12 percent holding a positive one.

Additionally, 87 percent believe AIs like Grok shouldn’t be allowed to generate “undressed” images of real adults in racy outfits like underwear, lingerie, or bikinis.

            <h2>Indie Developer Deleting Entire Game From Steam Due to Shame From Having Used AI</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An indie game developer experienced a moment of profound moral clarity, and is now deleting his partially-AI-made game from the digital storefront Steam.

The game, dubbed “Hardest,” is a free-to-play “rock-paper-scissors” roguelike card game released last July to mixed-to-negative reviews (of which there are barely thirty total.) Some users called it “soulless” and disparaged it for using AI art.

Now the developer, Eero “Rakuel” Laine, appears to agree with those haters. On January 10, Laine posted a surprise update to the Hardest page announcing that he would be deleting the game by the end of January, sounding penitent for his mortal sin of indulging in an AI shortcut.

“I made this game during the summer in [a] couple months and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free,” he explained. “But I have realized [that] AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment.”

“Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason the get more investment for their AI companies, that benefit no one, but rather suck resources from the economy from hard working people,” he added.

Laine clarified that he didn’t vibe-code the whole game, and actually programmed “everything myself,” so he’s ready to make a new game in the future with real, human-made assets. But his current game, he says, “is a disgrace to all game makers and players.”

“The girl I’ve been dating for a month made me realize this,” he added, in yet another wild twist.

The use of generative AI has been a hot button issue in art and entertainment, and game development has been no exception. In recent months, the debate over how it should be used in the industry, if at all, has been reignited over its role in the creation of several high profile titles.

When the fantasy RPG sensation Claire Obscur: Expedition 33 racked up a historical number of accolades at last year’s The Game Awards, including game of the year, concerned observers noted the fact that the creators had openly admitted to using AI assets during its development, though no AI is said to have made it into the final product. Then the Indie Game Awards announced that it was rescinding its GOTY award given to Expedition 33 because of its AI usage, blowing the debate wide open.

Adding to the swirling discourse, after dropping a trailer for its upcoming title Divinity at the Game Awards ceremony, the CEO of the Baldur’s Gate 3 maker Larian boasted that the studio would be using AI to “explore ideas” and “develop concept art.” The message seemed to be that AI in game development was here to stay, and would not be an obstacle to games having both critical and commercial success, as further evidenced by the popularity of new fan-favorite Arc Raiders, an multiplayer extraction shooter that uses AI to generate the voices of both player characters and NPCs. Perhaps the entire industry is overdue for an epiphany like Laine’s.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/app-downloads-declined-again-in-2025-but-consumer-spending-soared-to-nearly-156b/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The subscription economy helped boost mobile app revenues in 2025, even as app downloads declined for the fifth consecutive year, according to app intelligence firm Appfigures‘ annual report. In 2025, global downloads of all mobile apps and mobile games via the App Store and Google Play reached an estimated 106.9 billion, 2.7% lower than the year prior. Consumer spending, meanwhile, climbed 21.6% to reach an estimated $155.8 billion during the same period.

The data indicates that app developers, marketers, and publishers have been successful in getting their users to make in-app purchases or activate subscriptions, even as the number of new users downloading apps has been falling.

The report also reflected the continued shift away from mobile games as the primary revenue driver for the app economy. In 2025, consumers spent $72.2 billion on mobile games, accounting for about 46% of all spending within mobile apps. While that figure is up 10% year-over-year, spending on non-game mobile apps also increased. In fact, non-game app spending is up 33.9% year-over-year and reached $82.6 billion in 2025, Appfigures said.

While consumers may not like that nearly every app now has in-app purchases or a subscription model built in, this has offered a more sustainable path for app developers. Plus, the shift toward ongoing payments for apps has helped fuel an ecosystem of businesses serving the mobile app ecosystem. This includes subscription management platform RevenueCat, which raised a $50 million Series C this past year, and Appcharge, a startup helping mobile games improve their monetization, which announced a $58 million Series B back in August. This week, Liftoff Mobile, which helps market and monetize apps, filed for an IPO.

As revenue rose, downloads dropped again in 2025.

After reaching an all-time high of 135 billion in 2020 during the pandemic, downloads have been on the decline. This year’s figure of 106.9 billion installs was down from 109.8 billion in 2024, and follows slowed download growth between 2023 and 2024, when installs were down 3.3%.

Mobile game downloads saw a larger decline this year. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, down 8.6% year-over-year, after a 6.6% decline from 2023 to 2024. Non-game app downloads were essentially flat — they only saw a slight increase of 1.1% year-over-year, reaching 67.4 billion.

The full report also takes a look at the U.S. market specifically. Here, consumers spent an estimated $55.5 billion across all mobile apps, up 18.1% year-over-year from $47 billion in 2024. Downloads reached 10 billion, down 4.2% from the 10.4 billion in 2024. U.S. consumers spent $33.6 billion on non-game apps, up 26.8% year-over-year, and spent $21.9 billion on games, up just 6.8%.

U.S. non-game app downloads were an estimated 7.1 billion in 2025, while games were downloaded 2.9 billion times.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/ai-models-are-starting-to-crack-high-level-math-problems/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the weekend, Neel Somani, who is a software engineer, former quant researcher, and a startup founder, was testing the math skills of OpenAI’s new model when he made an unexpected discovery. After pasting the problem into ChatGPT and letting it think for 15 minutes, he came back to a full solution. He evaluated the proof and formalized it with a tool called Harmonic — but it all checked out.

“I was curious to establish a baseline for when LLMs are effectively able to solve open math problems compared to where they struggle,” Somani said. The surprise was that, using the latest model, the frontier started to push forward a bit.

ChatGPT’s chain of thought is even more impressive, rattling off mathematical axioms like Legendre’s formula, Bertrand’s postulate, and the Star of David theorum. Eventually, the model found a Math Overflow post from 2013, where Harvard mathematician Noam Elkies had given an elegant solution to a similar problem. But ChatGPT’s final proof differed from Elkies’ work in important ways, and gave a more complete solution to a version of the problem posed by legendary mathematician Paul Erdős, whose vast collection of unsolved problems has become a proving ground for AI.

For anyone skeptical of machine intelligence, it’s a surprising result — and it’s not the only one. AI tools have become ubiquitous in mathematics, from formalization-oriented LLMs like Harmonic’s Aristotle to literature review tools like OpenAI’s deep research. But since the release of GPT 5.2 — which Somani describes as “anecdotally more skilled at mathematical reasoning than previous iterations” — the sheer volume of solved problems has become difficult to ignore, raising new questions about large language models’ ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge.

Somani was looking at the Erdős problems, a set of over one thousand conjectures by the Hungarian mathematician that are maintained online. The problems have become a tempting target for AI-driven mathematics, varying significantly in both subject matter and difficulty. The first batch of autonomous solutions came in November from a Gemini-powered model called AlphaEvolve — but more recently, Somani and others have found GPT 5.2 to be remarkably adept with high-level math.

Since Christmas, 15 problems have been moved from “open” to “solved” on the Erdős website — and 11 of the solutions have specifically credited AI models as involved in the process.

The revered mathematician Terence Tao has a more nuanced look at the progress on his GitHub page, counting eight different problems where AI models made meaningful autonomous progress on an Erdős problem, with six other cases where progress was made by locating and building on previous research. It’s a long way from AI systems being able to do math without human intervention, but it’s clear that there’s an important role for large models to play.

On Mastodon, Tao conjectured that the scalable nature of AI systems makes them “better suited for being systematically applied to the ‘long tail’ of obscure Erdős problems, many of which actually have straightforward solutions.”

“As such, many of these easier Erdős problems are now more likely to be solved by purely AI-based methods than by human or hybrid means,” Tao continued.

Another driving force is a recent shift towards formalization, a labor-intensive task that makes mathematical reasoning easier to verify and extend. Formalization doesn’t require use of AI or even computers, but a new crop of automated tools have made the process far easier. The open-source “proof assistant” Lean, which was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013, has become widely used within the field as a way of formalizing proof— and AI tools like Harmonic’s Aristotle promise to automate much of the work of formalization.

For Harmonic founder Tudor Achim, the sudden jump in solved Erdős problems is less important than the fact that the world’s greatest mathematicians are starting to take those tools seriously. “I care more about the fact that math and computer science professors are using [AI tools],” Achim said. “These people have reputations to protect, so when they’re saying they use Aristotle or they use ChatGPT, that’s real evidence.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With news that Discord is kicking the tires on going public soon, other tech companies are starting to take their chances. Liftoff Mobile filed its first S-1 document late Tuesday, the first step in the process.

The company isn’t yet discussing how big this IPO will be: It has not yet filled in any data about the size of the offering or the stakes held by its principal shareholders. However, the IPO research firm Renaissance Capital reports the whisper number at $400 million, meaning that’s what the street thinks the company hopes to raise.The company offers a platform that helps mobile app developers market their apps and was formed in 2021 through a merger of Liftoff and Vungle. Blackstone acquired the majority of its shares at the time and the finance giant also appointed new leadership, meaning it is no longer a founder-run company. After the offering, Blackstone will remain the majority shareholder, according to the S-1 filing.

Another interesting tidbit: This listing, despite its relatively small expected size, has an unusually large number of bankers underwriting it. The offering has three joint lead bankers (Goldman, Jefferies, and Morgan Stanley) and another 12 banks assisting to sell, plus three other financial institutions, including Blackstone, involved. Whew! That could either be a sign of strong investor interest or the need to spread risk across many institutions.

Liftoff claims 140,000 apps use its services. It says it had 2025 revenues of over $519 million and a net loss of just over $48 million. The company also says it is carrying over $1.85 billion in debt.

            <h2>Digg launches its new Reddit rival to the public</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/digg-launches-its-new-reddit-rival-to-the-public/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The reboot of the early internet online community Digg, a one-time rival to Reddit, is moving forward. The company, which is today back under the ownership of its original founder, Kevin Rose, along with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, is launching its open beta to the public on Wednesday.

Similar to Reddit, the new Digg offers a website and mobile app where you can browse feeds featuring posts from across a selection of its communities and join other communities that align with your interests. There, you can post, comment, and upvote (or “digg”) the site’s content.

Originally a Web 2.0-era news aggregation site, Digg was once valued at $175 million in 2008 but was ultimately outpaced by Reddit. That earlier version was split up in 2012, with its largest stake sold to the incubator Betaworks, while LinkedIn and The Washington Post picked up other pieces. This iteration of Digg drew additional investment in 2016 but was later sold to a digital advertising company in 2018.

Meanwhile, Reddit continued to grow as a community-focused site that has since gone public and is currently generating additional revenue from content licensing agreements with major players in AI, including Google and OpenAI.

However, the rise of AI has presented an opportunity to rebuild Digg, Rose and Ohanian believe, leading them to acquire Digg last March through a leveraged buyout by True Ventures, Ohanian’s firm Seven Seven Six, Rose and Ohanian themselves, and the venture firm S32. The company has not disclosed its funding.

They’re betting that AI can help to address some of the messiness and toxicity of today’s social media landscape. At the same time, social platforms will need a new set of tools to ensure they’re not taken over by AI bots posing as people.

“We obviously don’t want to force everyone down some kind of crazy KYC process,” said Rose in an interview with TechCrunch, referring to the “know your customer” verification process used by financial institutions to confirm someone’s identity.

Instead, he proposes that Digg should pick up “little signals of trust along the way and bundle them all together into something that’s meaningful.”

Instead of simply offering verification checkmarks to designate trust, Digg will try out new technologies, like using zero-knowledge proofs (cryptographic methods that verify information without revealing the underlying data) to verify the people using its platform. It could also do other things, like require that people who join a product-focused community verify they actually own or use the product being discussed there.

As an example, a community for Oura ring owners could verify that everyone who posts has proven they own one of the smart rings.

Plus, Rose suggests Digg could use signals acquired from mobile devices to help verify members — for instance, the app could identify when Digg users attended a meetup in the same location.

“I don’t think there’s going to be any one silver bullet here,” said Rose. “It’s just going to be us saying … here’s a platter of things that you can add together to create trust.”

Before today’s public beta launch, the site offered 21 more generalized communities like gaming, technology, and entertainment, and was open to 67,000 users on an invite-only basis. Now anyone will be able to join and start their own communities on nearly any topic, no matter how niche — a top request from beta testers. The community managers (i.e., moderators) for these individual forums will be able to set their own rules, and their moderation logs will be shared publicly, so members can see what decisions are being made.

The site has also been redesigned since its private beta, now offering a new sidebar where you can pin your favorite communities and a main feed optimized for visual elements.

At launch, communities will only have one manager, but that will change in time, as the company adds more features, including those to customize the look and feel and functionality of individual communities with integrations and other tools. For instance, a movie reviews community could include scores from Letterboxd.

“We kind of opted for … let’s just keep building this plane as we fly it,” explained Digg CEO Justin Mezzell. “That means that it’s going to be very lightweight, and we’re just going to be aggressively shipping every week and just giving them new features as we go,” he added.

The company also plans to listen to its community managers about what they need and build accordingly, and it has brought on some Reddit moderators as advisers. Although Reddit was built on the back of volunteer moderators, Digg aims to find a model that improves the moderator experience. Plans on this front haven’t been fleshed out yet, however, but Mezzell said it “has to be a conversation.”

“We need to figure out a way to make this an equitable experience for everybody who’s actually building Digg into what it needs to become,” he noted.

In addition, the team is considering shifting its AI-created podcast about the interesting stories surfacing on Digg into a human-hosted version, as users have been requesting.

Rose told TechCrunch that the current team is small, giving them “years of runway” to find product-market fit.

“The beautiful thing about this launch is we’re finally at the place with Digg where it’s just that the foundational stuff is done, and now we can really start having fun,” he said.

Note: The rollout should begin around 4 PM ET.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google announced Wednesday the launch of a revamped Trends Explore page, now featuring Gemini-powered capabilities that automatically identify and compare trends related to your searches. The update is rolling out on desktop starting today.

The Trends Explore page has long served as a valuable tool for content creators, journalists, and researchers, making it easy to analyze search interest for any topic over time, across regions, and by category. The new Gemini experience streamlines much of the manual work involved in exploring trending topics, reducing research time, and surfacing connections that users might otherwise overlook.

The redesigned Explore page now features a side panel that automatically identifies and compares relevant trends in your area of interest. Users will also see a list of suggested Gemini prompts to help with deeper exploration.

​The page features a refreshed design, with dedicated icons and colors for each search term, making it easier to match them to their corresponding lines on the graph. Additionally, Google increased the number of terms users can compare and doubled the number of rising queries displayed on each timeline.

A Google blog post uses trending dog breeds as an example to illustrate the new capabilities. The AI automatically populates the graph with up to eight search terms, such as “golden retriever” or “beagle.” It also suggests related topics like “hypoallergenic dog breeds” or “large dog breeds” for further exploration. Users can hover over a term to edit it or use filters for country, time, and property to customize the Trends timeline.

​This update is part of Google’s ongoing effort to embed Gemini into its core offerings. The company has already added AI capabilities to Search, Gmail, Maps, and Docs.

            <h2>Bandcamp takes a stand against AI music, banning it from the platform</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/bandcamp-takes-a-stand-against-ai-music-banning-it-from-the-platform/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The music distribution platform Bandcamp announced in a Reddit post on Tuesday that it’s banning AI-generated music and audio.

“We want musicians to keep making music, and for fans to have confidence that the music they find on Bandcamp was created by humans,” the company said.

Bandcamp’s new guidelines state that music and audio generated “wholly or in substantial part by AI” is not permitted and that it will not allow the use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles.

So, if Drake had released “Taylor Made Freestyle” on Bandcamp, he would’ve had a problem (and maybe it would’ve been for his own good).

As AI music generators like Suno become more sophisticated, it’s become harder to avoid synthetic music — songs created with AI tools have topped charts on Spotify and Billboard. AI music now sounds real enough that it can be difficult to decipher how it was made.

In one high-profile example, Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her (supposedly organic) poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed To Know.” Her AI “persona,” Xania Monet, received multiple bids for record deals before signing with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.

The legality of AI-generated music is up in the air. Suno is currently facing lawsuits from major labels Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group, which allege the company trained its AI on copyrighted material from the labels.

This hasn’t deterred Silicon Valley, though. Suno raised a $250 million Series C round in November, which valued the company at $2.4 billion. While the raise was led by Menlo Ventures, Suno saw participation from Hallwood Media, the company backing Xania Monet.

The legal outlook doesn’t look good for artists. In a recent lawsuit, a judge ruled that Anthropic could use copyrighted books that it downloaded illegally to train its AI. What was illegal, the judge said, was that Anthropic pirated the books that it fed into its AI models. The company got a $1.5 billion slap on the wrist, which isn’t very significant for a company that’s valued at $183 billion.

Unlike Spotify or Apple Music, Bandcamp doesn’t pay artists per stream. Instead, Bandcamp allows artists to sell their music digitally alongside physical products like merch and CDs.

Bandcamp only makes money from its cut of artists’ sales — but even if it presents itself as an artist-first distributor, a tech company is still a tech company, and the bottom line matters. Looking at Bandcamp’s move optimistically, perhaps the company is confirming what artists hope to be true: No one is actually spending money to buy AI-generated music, at least not on Bandcamp.

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic’s David Frum discusses the menacing crises the Trump presidency is inflicting on the United States and its own movement to start 2026. David speculates that the recent lethal ICE incident in Minneapolis, the growing erraticism of Trump&#39;s rhetoric, and the targeting of Jerome Powell indicate that MAGA world is cracking. He argues that Trump’s unpredictable and escalating actions are taking the MAGA movement, the Trump presidency, the U.S., and the rest of the world down a path of doom.

Then, David is joined by Timothy Naftali, the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, to discuss perhaps Trump’s most brazen grift: his proposed presidential library in Miami. Frum and Naftali also discuss why comparisons of Trump to Nixon fall flat and how Trump’s actions in Venezuela reflect a policy of weakness.

Finally, David ends the episode with a discussion of Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum:  Hello, and welcome to this week’s episode of The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest this week will be Tim Naftali. You may know Tim from his many appearances on CNN, where he talks about the history of the presidency. Tim is a distinguished historian of U.S. diplomacy during the Cold War. He was also the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, and we’ll be talking about the many strange moneymaking schemes around the plan for a [Donald] Trump presidential library in Miami. And we’ll be talking about the chaos and danger of the Trump foreign policy as it stumbles toward conflict with Europe over Greenland, in South America over Venezuela, in Iran, in the Far East.

My book this week will be Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Brontë, and I’ll be talking about that and what it tells us about our changing attitudes toward children and toward cruelty.

But before the dialogue with Tim, before the book discussion of Jane Eyre, some preliminary thoughts about what we have seen in these remarkable early days of January 2026. It does seem that the MAGA movement and the Trump presidency have entered a kind of crazy death spiral. So many bizarre and menacing things have happened in just the past few days. There seems to be a kind of intensification of the crisis that has been with us since the beginning of the Trump era, the crisis that has been with us since the beginning of the Trump second term, and now, in 2026, a crisis that becomes ever more terrifying.

Over the weekend, there was a kind of rampage of ICE personnel in the city of Minneapolis. The weekend opened with the shooting death of a motorist in Minneapolis, Renee [Nicole] Good. And ICE seems to have reacted to the outburst of feeling about that shooting not by investigating the shooting, not by reconsidering its methods, but by using ever more brutal methods against ever more people in the city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota.

ICE seems to be acting more and more not like a proper federal law-enforcement agency, with all the high professionalism and exacting standards that Americans rightfully expect and usually get from federal law enforcement. It’s acting like an armed MAGA militia, like the armed force of a political party, occupying part of the country and part of the voting population on behalf of another part of the country and another bloc of the voting population.

This comes as President Trump gave an interview to The New York Times in which he said that one of his great regrets about his first term was that he did not order the National Guard to seize voting machines in the election of 2020. Now, back then, there is some question whether, even if he’d issued such a shocking and illegal and improper order, whether the National Guard would have executed it, but now he has this armed mass of ICE militia roaming the country, breaking laws, ignoring rules. He seems to see them as his tool for carrying out such schemes in the year ahead.

At the same time, other bizarre behaviors have been issuing. On Sunday night, we learned that the Trump administration had opened a criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell for obviously specious and fake grounds. The Federal Reserve is renovating its headquarters. It’s a big project. There’s some questions about how much the project should cost, as there often are in federal buildings. Some of the reason for the expense is because President Trump himself in his first term ordered marble and other fancy accoutrements. Jerome Powell has testified to Congress about the cost. It’s a very technical matter, and Donald Trump’s people have decided this is their chance to bring pressure to bear on Jerome Powell to force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates faster to help Donald Trump avoid catastrophe in the elections of 2026.

Jerome Powell then released a video denouncing the politicization of the Federal Reserve, denouncing the politicization of the Department of Justice that would allow itself to be used in such a way. Powell was promptly backed by a Republican senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina. But we’re left with a real question: What happens to the Federal Reserve now? Jerome Powell’s term is set to expire in May of 2026. Will any Trump nominee be trusted by anybody as anything other than a Trump stooge? Can the Federal Reserve ever cut interest rates again without it looking like it’s yielding to intimidation by the Trump administration? We may, in fact, find ourselves with higher interest rates than we otherwise would have because of Trump’s attempt to abusively use improper process of law and his shamefully weak U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to intimidate the Federal Reserve Board into adopting different monetary policies than the ones that the Federal Reserve, in its collective opinion, collective judgment, thought were appropriate.

This seems part of a quickening spiral, but it’s not all. The president has been issuing other kinds of crazy commands and fatwas into the economy, decreeing with no legal authority that credit card rates be cut, talking about American oil companies that he’s trying to bully into crazy and unprofitable investments in Venezuela. Over the weekend, he issued a Truth Social post in which he described himself as the “Acting President of Venezuela,” which is kind of a spoof, but also a scene out of Woody Allen’s Bananas where the aging authoritarian president seems to be losing his marbles. He’s not the acting president of Venezuela. No American president should even joke about such a thing. But this one may not be joking.

And finally, we have the eruptions of more and more people around Trump to justify the killing of the motorist in Minneapolis—three bullets into the side of a car for someone who was, as we can all see, trying to escape a confrontation and who was set upon by an officer who seemed bent on punishing her not for anything she did wrong, but for her attitude toward him, for her disrespect toward him—a killing that seemed to have been motivated by ego, not by any sense of self-defense.

We’re in a kind of crack-up of the MAGA world. It’s becoming more extreme, more at variance with America, as it feels its unpopularity intensifying because of the terrible economy. We had a job report at the end of the week before I record that showed that the United States in all of 2025 created fewer net new jobs than the population of the city of Spokane, Washington. The economy’s in trouble, and prices are rising. The Republican prospects for 2026 are diminishing—at least if there is a free and fair election in 2026. And the president’s mind is going to: How can he seize voting machines? How can he use an armed militia against his political opponents? How can he use law enforcement, or the pretense of law enforcement, to pressure the Federal Reserve into making monetary policy subordinate to Trump’s reelection wishes? How can he steal oil from Venezuela? How can he steal Greenland from the Danes?

Trump’s MAGA movement is spiraling on a kind of death cycle. It’s taking the MAGA movement, the Trump presidency, the United States, and much of the rest of the world along for the downward ride to doom. Now, we are not helpless, as individuals, as citizens, to correct course, to stop this ride, to prevent MAGA from doing what it wants to do. We’re going to have to act responsibly because there is a stark choice here. MAGA is not America as we knew America, as we believe in America. MAGA is not the America where rights are respected; where police serve the public, and they don’t attack and harm the public. MAGA is not the America where the law is independent of the president and where the dollar is something that can be trusted by the whole world.

MAGA’s America is one thing; America’s America is another. You can have the rule of law in America, or you can have the Trump MAGA regime, not both. This is going to be, in 2026, the year for choosing. I am hopeful that Americans will, together, choose right. But I have to be clear-eyed about what the alternative is, how dangerous it is, and how bent it is on the doom of everything good and decent about the America as you used to know it.

And now my dialogue with Tim Naftali. But first, a quick break.

Frum: Timothy Naftali is a senior research scholar and adjunct professor at Columbia University School of International [and] Public Affairs. He previously served as the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. His many books include the 1997 classic “One Hell of a Gamble,” the definitive account of the Cuban missile crisis from the Soviet point of view. He is a regular contributor to CNN, where he is their in-house presidential historian. Tim is a native of Montreal, Canada. We were undergraduates together at Yale in the early 1980s and have been friends ever since, although I note for the record that Tim was several classes younger than me and is therefore considerably better preserved. (Laughs.) Tim, welcome so much to The David Frum [Show]. Thank you for making time today.

Timothy Naftali: So you begin with a lie. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) No, no, you are an amazing specimen—intellectual, moral, and physical.

Frum: So we’ve got so many things to cover, but I wanna start drawing on your expertise as a founder of a presidential library. There is a project for a Trump presidential library in Miami. It will not surprise you to hear that this project is laden with scandal, but you think it’s not just the financial scandals that are important. So let’s talk about the financial scandal and the intellectual scandal of the Trump library.

Naftali: First of all, it’s great to be with you, David. I had the privilege of working for the National Archives and Records Administration, and I was appointed—I didn’t apply for the job, but I was appointed to be the first federal director of the Nixon Library. After Watergate, because of concerns that President Nixon would destroy his famous tapes and the documents, Congress seized his materials; President [Gerald] Ford signed the law, and so. And as a result, the Nixon materials couldn’t leave the Washington, D.C., area. So Nixon could not have a real presidential library, so he got an ersatz library. His family built a private Nixon Library—the museum was private. the archive was private—but it didn’t have any of his presidential materials, ’cause they couldn’t leave Washington, D.C.

Fast-forward about 10 years, for reasons that the Nixon family knows best, the Nixon family decided they didn’t wanna run this private library any longer; they wanted the federal government to run it. Well, for that to happen, they had to get Congress to change the governing law that affected the Nixon materials. Congress did change the law. The National Archives would then become responsible for the Nixon Library, would rename it, and would move the presidential materials from Washington, D.C., to Yorba Linda, California. And they needed a director for that, and they appointed me.

One of the challenges for my team was to establish the credibility of this new institution. Understandably, many Americans, not just those who are old enough to remember Watergate, were concerned about what might happen to the Nixon tapes and the Nixon papers if they were moved to Yorba Linda and perhaps, technically, under some kind of watchful eye of the Nixon family. And so it was really essential that the first federal director established the credibility of this space, that it’d be nonpartisan—not anti-Nixon, but not pro-Nixon. And so that was my job.

And among my responsibilities was to be the curator of the Watergate exhibit, the old Watergate exhibit. What we inherited basically made the argument that Watergate was a “coup” that happened in order to overturn the results of the 1972 election, and the Democrats pushed Nixon out, and that Nixon was mistreated. And given that we were moving to Yorba Linda, the documents, the materials that made clear that the president had been engaged in abuse of power—and he was never indicted, so we can’t say he was criminally responsible, but let’s say that there was heavy, heavy evidence that suggested the president had participated in criminal actions—in any case, how could you move those documents to Yorba Linda and then have in the public space up ahead, ’cause the archive was downstairs, material that contradicted the basic documents that we had? So the Watergate exhibit had to be changed. The Nixon Foundation said they couldn’t do it, and they asked me to do it, and the National Archives asked me to do it, so I was the curator of a Watergate exhibit, which was one way of establishing the credibility of the institution. And another way was to make sure a lot of materials were declassified and tapes were made available to the public, which we did. I was there for five years in total.

Frum: So let’s move forward in time from the Nixon Library, as you described it, to the project in the 2020s for a Trump presidential library. This library, as I read, is to be built in Miami on an extremely valuable piece of land, almost three acres big, on a highly developable strip of road where you could build condo towers or a hotel or something like that. The land formerly belonged to a local college. The land was transferred by the local college from the college’s ownership to the state government with no payment to the college, not the $65 million that is conservatively estimated, not the $100 million it might be worth, not more—nothing to the college. The state then transferred the land to a trust governed by representatives of the Trump family, and the idea is that some kind of Trump institution will be built on this parcel of land.

But there are a lot of hints that what will be built on the land is not just a library, as we’ve known it, not even the kind of crazy pharaonic library that you get for Barack Obama, but for-profit uses: condos, maybe a hotel. I’ve seen you quoted in stories about this project. What do you know about the coming Trump library? How does it compare and contrast to other presidential libraries that already exist?

Naftali: Well, I don’t know much more than what you’ve just described, David, but I believe in the idea of a presidential library, and I believe in the importance of nonpartisan public history. One of the things I learned out in Yorba Linda was that presidential libraries are important local institutions; we had a lot of students from local high schools and middle schools come to visit. Obviously, we had visitors from across the country. And we were able, in a sense, to try, as a team, to set a standard for public history.

So I believe in these institutions, and I am worried at the development, at the turn that these institutions have taken. You mentioned Barack Obama. President Obama had an opportunity to set a high standard for public history. We could debate his presidency, but what he did not have was a Watergate or an Iran-Contra. He did not have the sort of overwhelming scandal that allies of any president would have a hard time sort of softening, if not deleting entirely. So he had the opportunity to present, or to create, a model, a gem for public history, allowing the National Archives to do its job, overseeing a museum, but he didn’t do it. He decided that he wanted a private museum. Now, I’m not suggesting that Barack Obama wanted to re-create what we inherited and had to change in Yorba Linda, but it was clear that he wanted and his team wanted to be in control of how his presidency is portrayed.

Now we talk about Trump. Now, I’m not saying that President Trump would be doing what he’s doing now if Barack Obama had chosen to have a standard presidential library, but the fact that Barack Obama rejected the standard model of a presidential library just made it a little bit easier for President Trump to create what appears to be Trumpland. And I just think it’s disappointing. Our public institutions are under extreme stress; you’ve talked about this in your podcast on multiple occasions. And I think that, as a people, our self-confidence is directly proportional to how willing we are to talk about the peaks and valleys of our history. And one of the places where people can learn about the peaks and valleys of our history are these presidential libraries. And it’s sad that we’re gonna lose yet another opportunity to learn about the complexities of this era because the Trump library will be as disconnected from reality as possible.

You asked about corruption and Nixon. Before Watergate, Nixon put pressure on a House committee to give up federal land near San Clemente, which was actually part of Camp Pendleton, and allow him to use it for a library—so that’s public federal land, not state land. And Nixon’s people were putting pressure on getting that land. Of course, with Watergate, not only did that pressure campaign end, but the then-Nixon Foundation collapsed; the one that exists now was created well after Watergate. So the idea of putting pressure on a locality or on the federal government to get land that wasn’t really yours for a presidential library, that didn’t start with Trump. Nixon attempted to do it, but Watergate ended those particular desires.

Frum: But pre-Watergate Nixon, when he thought about, And we’ll have a for-profit use in this hypothetical Nixon Library; there will be a cafeteria, a gift shop, perhaps, he didn’t think, We’re gonna have a condo tower and hotel.

Naftali: No, of course not. That would have, by the way, obstructed the view from San Clemente. Of course, he didn’t wanna have … (Laughs.)

Naftali: Now, come on. Remember, Richard Nixon was a realist. No, no, no, of course not, but remember—let’s keep in mind that Donald Trump is our first developer president, and therefore, he thinks of everything in terms of development and, of course, self-enrichment, so I’m not surprised. Look, one of the things that’s clear about the Trump library is it’s gonna reflect the mores and the corruption of the era we’re living in, so it’ll be very representative of this period.

Frum: Yeah, I mean Nixon was a presidency who had a scandal, but Trump is a scandal who has a presidency. (Laughs.)

Frum: So with Nixon, there are a lot of—and I’ve seen this amazing and fascinating institution that has been developed there. There are different rooms because there are things you can say about Nixon that are not about Watergate: diplomatic overtures, maybe the single most important environmental record of any of the presidents, meeting and failing to overcome economic challenges, race relations, or crime. There are a series of Nixon stories that are separate from the Watergate scandal story. I don’t know if there’s any aspect of the Trump presidency, any, that isn’t touched by some really important story of self-enrichment or corrupt dealing or lawbreaking of some other kind. I don’t think there’s a one. There isn’t a room that is: Okay, this is the presidency apart from the scandal. And so, as you say, maybe it’s fitting that the whole library is itself kind of a scandal.

Naftali: Well, I think the first term had a few things that could be pointed to: Warp Speed. Of course, the Trump people don’t wanna talk about that; MAHA does not include vaccines. But I really—and this is a point of view that may seem old-fashioned now and naive—but I really believe that it is healthy for a country to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of our presidents, rather than seeing them as these totems or these saints that are perfect or are devils.

Nixon is complicated. One of the things about Nixon that people might find interesting is that he had a sense of shame. He had a sense of shame, and he had a sense of legitimacy. And his sense of legitimacy was his understanding of what the presidency should look like. And when he thought about the presidency, he was thinking about Dwight Eisenhower and he was thinking about Franklin Roosevelt. So that’s why he was so secretive. Yes, he had dark impulses, but he knew that the American people would not embrace them, and so he was not honest about them.

We live in a different period. We live in a period where we have a president who has been reelected despite the fact that he shared his dark impulses with the American people. And he is not constrained by shame. And Nixon had shame, so it meant internal constraint. And then he had guardrails. And of course, we all talk about them all the time, but his term—his time in office; he had a little more than one term—Richard Nixon had guardrails. And he would have been a worse president domestically had it not been for the guardrails. Well, we have now a president with similar, but not identical, dark impulses who has no sense of shame and no guardrails. And that’s why the Trump presidency, in its 2.0 version, cannot be compared to the Nixon presidency at all. The Trump first term could be compared because you had a president with dark impulses surrounded by good-government Republicans with guardrails. We’re in a different world now.

Frum: Yeah. Well, I think it needs to be stressed again and again with Richard Nixon that the president he most admired was the unlikely figure of Woodrow Wilson, who was the president that most voiced a kind of vaunting idealism, sometimes a little ethereal, out-of-this-world idealism, and Nixon admired that. Richard Nixon’s parents, especially his beloved mother, had been huge Wilsonians, and he admired him so much. There’s a story that William Safire tells—and I’ve never been able to find out whether Safire is wrong or right about the story, and we’ll just have to take it onto Safire’s testimony—but Richard Nixon, in his hideaway office in the Executive Office Building, had a desk that he pulled from the White House inventory—and you must know the story—that was described in the record as the “Wilson desk.” And he believed this was Woodrow Wilson’s desk, on which Woodrow Wilson typed his work. And Safire, who was a Nixon speechwriter, said he talked to the head of the whoever keeps these inventories, and he said, Look, it’s not the Woodrow Wilson desk; it’s the Henry Wilson desk, Henry Wilson being [Ulysses S.] Grant’s vice president.

Frum: But no one has the heart to tell the president that he’s got the wrong [Wilson]. (Laughs.) Now, again, I’ve not been able ever to confirm or deny this story, but Safire would be a pretty good authority; he was there.

Naftali: Well, one thing about Safire is he had a very nice metaphor for Nixon, which was that Nixon was a layer cake, and think of him as a layer cake, and you cut a slice and all these layers, and they’re different, and they’re somewhat contradictory.

One thing I wanna mention is that, yes, it’s true—Woodrow Wilson was a historical mentor of sorts—but so was de Gaulle. Richard Nixon admired [former French President] Charles de Gaulle, next to Eisenhower, of any living leader at the time. And of course, de Gaulle wasn’t Wilsonian at all. (Laughs.) He was the most Machiavellian of leaders. So Nixon’s a complicated man. The point, however—

Frum: But he was, in his own way, a man of great integrity and ethic who had refused to join the sellout of French national identity after the fall of France and had taken the enormous risk of going into exile with nothing, not even his family; they followed later. So that’s an inspirational example too, whereas Donald Trump’s example seemed to be Roy Cohn.

Naftali: Well, and one more thing: Again, Richard Nixon also understood the international system. He did not wanna destroy the architecture that [President Harry S.] Truman had constructed. Although he had real doubts about elements, of course, of the Great Society, he wasn’t about to dismantle the New Deal. He came from a poor family, and he recognized the importance of a safety net. He’s a complicated man.

One of the reasons we talk about him—not simply because he resigned, but he had these dark impulses, and he was a bigot, and he was an anti-Semite. And these dark passions motivated policy, at times, and so that’s why we talk about him: He was a flawed character. The difference, however, was he was a smart man, and he was a man who read, and he was a man who understood history, and he cared about history, and he did not wanna be an outlier. He was not someone who believed, I am the beginning and the end of American history. I have predecessors, and I have to be mindful of them, so that’s also a source of some constraint on his behavior.

Naftali: And I will be passing on to them a better country, I hope, than the one that I received. But remember, he was thinking in terms of the country. His self-dealing involved a $7,000—get this—a $7,000 shield around his pool in San Clemente. That was the great corrupt bargain of his presidency. Now, his crimes and his abuse of power are quite different, but when you talk about “What did he steal, if anything?,” what the Congress found was, yes, he found a way to get the Secret Service to say that it was in the interest of his protection that he have a screen around his pool.

Frum: By the way, that’s not a crazy claim.

Naftali: No, it’s not a crazy claim, but just to give you a sense of proportion.

Frum: It’s not a billion-dollar crypto scheme in which your investors lose 95 percent of their money. (Laughs.)

Naftali: No, no, no. No, he wasn’t a grifter. Keep in mind, Richard Nixon was not a grifter, and it’s important to keep that in mind.

Richard Nixon also believed in allies. He didn’t like all of them—he had some very choice things to say about [former Canadian Prime Minister] Pierre Trudeau and others—but he believed in alliances. He wasn’t about to disrupt and destroy what he had inherited, even though he differed from some of his predecessors. We live in an era with a president who is disrupting and destroying because he can.

Frum: Yeah. One of my pet peeves is: People will use the phrase about Trump “the most corrupt presidency in American history.” And to which I was saying, Okay, if you were to do the corrupt presidencies: Ulysses Grant, Warren Harding, who else would you—although, as you say, Watergate is not technically a corruption scandal, but let’s throw it in because we’re speaking loosely. Would you add anybody else to that list?

Naftali: Well, one of the problems for those of us who study this is that the documents are pretty sparse about congressional corruption in the 19th century; we have some documents about presidential corruption. But keep in mind, before Chester Arthur, ironically, pushes for civil service reform, and we get a nonpartisan professional civil service, government jobs were given away to the highest bidder. So, in a sense, you had a basic corruption at the core of presidencies because—

Frum: I wanna dissent for that. They were not sold to the highest bidder; they were given as rewards for party loyalty. So it wasn’t [that] there was a lot of cash that traded hands—because people who had cash to spend would not want a government job. They might want a government contract.

Naftali: I was thinking about being the head of the post office—or, actually—

Naftali: —the customs duty officer, or also, the person who had the concession on, in that era, the Indian land reservation, those people made lots of money. Also, that was the era when government documents were actually printed by private companies, and that particular contract was worth a lot of money. No, the president didn’t get any cash in return, but he was paying off an ally, and there was a business consequence for the ally.

Frum: And then you have Warren Harding, who himself was kind of a lecherous “slob,” as Alice Roosevelt [Longworth] called him, but doesn’t seem to have been on the take in any way—

Frum: The big corruption scandals were happening around him and with him being checked out and indifferent because he was not very intelligent and not very conscientious, but he was not, personally, a crook.

But the point I’m building to is that I don’t think you can compare any of these things to, for example, the Trump crypto business, where a president has made a billion dollars in less than a year in office selling assets that have just collapsed in [value] in the hands of the buyers. And this, to me, looks like that we need to say: This is not the most corrupt president in American history. If Trump were Russian, if Trump were Nigerian, he’d be one of the contenders for the most corrupt president in Nigerian or Russian history. He’s just outside the realm of anything ever previously contemplated for a president—not for an Indian lands commissioner, not for the head of the New York [Custom] House, but for a president in American history.

Naftali: If you look at the essence of all of these peace discussions, it is no surprise that sovereign-wealth funds are involved because we—not the American people, but we, our government—is seeking resources. So it’s not a peace agreement. What is happening is that we are engaging in some kind of bribery scandal with all these countries, where we are saying, Give us a piece of whatever your mineral resources might be—like in Congo, there are certain kinds, and in Ukraine—and we’re saying, We’ll help you by throwing our weight around, but in return, you’re gonna help us. And us is not the American people writ large, but the president’s—I would call them the chauvinistas or chovinistas, of Mar-a-Lago, the people that are close to the Trump family. They’re the ones likely—and the tech bros—they’re the ones likely to benefit from this.

This is, to use the term from Broadway, this is a musical crap game that is going from conflict zone to conflict zone, and the president is using this as a way to enrich himself and his allies. There is no precedent for this. And because there is no country as powerful as the United States, no authoritarian leader in the world has the opportunities for enrichment that Donald Trump has at the moment.

Frum: Well, this takes us, I think, to the Venezuela topic, which you wanted to discuss. Now, one of the things I have said, and I’ve said this in a more colloquial way that was open to be misunderstood, that I talked about wars for oil and how no one fights them. Well, that’s not quite right; people have fought wars for oil. But what I mean is that anyone who did his accounting wouldn’t do a fight for oil because the oil is available on the marketplace. You have to pay for it. Whether or not the oil is on land that is friendly to you or not, whether it’s your sovereign territory or not, you have to pay for the technology; you have the return on capital; you have to pay the people who work there; you have to build the infrastructure and the roads. If you do proper accounting, what you’ll [find is]: You know what, just buy it; don’t fight for it. The war costs way more than any benefit of the oil. But of course, if you don’t do the accounting, if you say, Well, no, my accounting is this: The public pays all the bills, and a small handful of insiders get all the benefits. Then, from the point of view of that small handful of insiders, then the war can make sense, which is what seems to be happening in Venezuela.

Americans of a certain age forget this: The United States is now again by far the largest producer of oil on Earth and by far the largest producer of natural gas on Earth. If you throw in Canada—and Trump wants to not throw in but grab Canada, but group the United States and Canada together, whether Canada retains its independence or not—almost 30 percent of the planet’s output of oil comes from the United States and Canada. And the price is at barely breakeven right now, so it’s not like we’re desperately short of it. As I record, it’s about $58 a barrel, and in most parts of North America, that’s a break-even price. So the idea of having lots more of it—for what? But there are people who say, If I can get my personal hands on Venezuelan oil, at someone else’s expense, then I personally can make a lot of money, even though it’s a crazy-bad deal for the American people.

Naftali: One of the things that students of the Cold War—some—missed was that we did not engage in our Cold War crusades in search of resources. In fact, the quagmire area was Vietnam, and there were, at the time, no resources whatsoever. We were in the business of regime change and regime construction because we were contesting the world with the Soviet Union, and we were also worried about the credibility of our alliances. When we were dragged into some countries, we were dragged in because of the weakness of our allies, and Iran is a perfect example. We toppled the government of Iran because the British had been pressing us to do this. Why—

Naftali: The 1950s. I’m bringing this up because what our president is doing now is what weak countries do, not strong countries. The British were weak, and they needed to control the oil refinery in Abadan, in Iran, and they did not want the Iranians to have a better share of the money that was really theirs. And so the British put pressure on us to help them. And we knew how weak the British were.

So it’s absolutely true that the mercantilist Trump vision of how states are powerful is a vision of a weak country, not a strong one. We have the resources to buy what we need. But I agree: What I think is going on is that his buddies are going to benefit, which is why he is dealing with the Congo and why he’s—I’m not sure what he’s getting from Thailand and Cambodia, but that’s why he’s interested in the Congo; that’s why he’s interested in Azerbaijan, and he called it Albania, but it’s Armenia. It’s because these places have resources, and he and his buddies would like access to it. It has nothing to do with the interests of the United States.

Frum: Yeah, it’s a private profit at public expense. And I think you are putting your finger on something very profound, which is: During the Cold War, at the time of American power, the American interest was always a world system. That’s why the United States from 1945 onward, and even before, rejected spheres of influence, because spheres of influence were for losers. The American view was, Sphere of influence? It’s the planet. We can’t necessarily make our writ run on every part of the planet all the time; there are other powers, some of them hostile. But our vision is of a planetary-wide system of collective security, free trade, American investment—we want the whole thing. And we believe that will be good for people; we believe that we’re bringing liberty and prosperity to other people, so it’s not something we’re cruelly imposing on others. But the ambition was large.

The sphere of influence is what declining powers want: Well, as we no longer can make our writ run broader and broader, so we want an area where we’re preserved and where other powers agree not to poach in our waters, because they could if there weren’t a deal. You’re going to talk about the Monroe Doctrine a little bit—

Frum:  The Monroe Doctrine was issued in the United States—I think you were going to say “was weak,” and so explain that.

Naftali: Well, the Monroe Doctrine—1823, the Spanish empire is collapsing in the Americas. There’s a great fear that the French and the Russians, what was called then the Holy Alliance, would come in, sweep back into the Western Hemisphere, and reimpose monarchical systems, in competition with our Republican system. And so the U.S. government wanted to say to the European monarchical powers, Stay away. We will be neutral in your conflicts in your sphere. Stay away from the Western Hemisphere. It was an anti-European doctrine. What happens over time is, as American power grows, the Monroe Doctrine becomes a more offensive doctrine.

Frum: I gotta pause you there, though, because this is a thing that I think not enough Americans realize when we talk about spheres of influence being for the weak. What was the enforcement mechanism for the Monroe Doctrine?

Naftali: Oh, it’s easy: the British navy. The British navy—  Frum: It was the British navy. (Laughs.) It was the British navy! The way the Monroe Doctrine worked was: The United States said to Britain, We will offer you privileged access, or favorable access, to our markets, which were—we fought two wars, the Revolution and 1812; there’s a lot of unpleasantness and ill feeling. Let’s put all of that behind us. Let us be permanent friends. (Laughs.) And your navy, which you pay for, will police the Arctic to keep the Spanish and everybody else out of what we are calling our hemisphere, but what we really mean is your hemisphere.

Naftali: Look, we could, and I don’t know if your listeners would wanna do this, but we could talk about the peculiar relationship between the Americans and the British. The British actually offered to have a joint statement that was something like the Monroe Doctrine; they actually offered it to the Monroe administration. And John Quincy Adams, who wanted to be president in 1824, realized—he was secretary of state at the time—realized that, because his father was John Adams and associated with the Federalists, which were associated with a pro-British party, that it would be political suicide if he participated in a joint statement with London. So he convinced Monroe, No, no, no, no joint statement with London. Let’s have a unilateral statement that says, “Europe out.” But the administration actually knew that it needed Britain; it desperately needed Britain. Even Thomas Jefferson, who was a former president by that point, and Jefferson never liked the British much, recognized that Britain could destroy the United States and wanted—this is as a former president—wanted the Monroe administration to be on good terms with Britain, so absolutely, the Monroe Doctrine was a product of weakness, not strength. It’s in the 20th century that, with the growth in American power, the Monroe Doctrine is pointed to as a source of strength. It wasn’t. That’s not its tradition.

Frum: And then, in the early 20th century, the United States has become strong, but is not yet the strongest. Then the United States becomes increasingly aggressive and militaristic in its enforcement of an exclusion zone, especially in the Caribbean—principally against the Germans, much less against the British, who still were a fearsome force in the 1890s, 1910s.

Naftali: Well, I’m gonna say something nice about lawyers. I don’t often say nice things about lawyers, American lawyers, but I wanna say this about American lawyers. So you have Theodore Roosevelt, who, because he desperately wants the [Panama] Canal, right, Theodore Roosevelt has something called the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, which basically says the United States can intervene at will in its sphere of influence, which is the Western Hemisphere, to protect American interests and American private interests. In the 1930s, American lawyers, Elihu Root and Henry Stimson, say, This is a bad policy. We don’t wanna be intervening. The United States, for example, had Marines in Nicaragua from 1912 to 1931. It was almost as long as we had troops in Afghanistan.

Naftali: And the position was: It’s foolish. These are expensive investments. And frankly, we don’t wanna be running these countries, because then we have to be involved in the day-to-day business of their politics, which are confusing. And anyway, they speak Spanish; Haiti speaks French. So what Stimson, who was secretary of state under Herbert Hoover, says is, We’re not doing this anymore. The Monroe Doctrine, it’s a doctrine of the United States versus Europe, not the United States versus Latin America. This is not in our interests. We are no longer gonna do this.

And so from 1931 until last weekend, our position in the Western Hemisphere was: We have an interest in an American system of free states. Different presidents had a different threshold for intervention, but the fact of the matter is, ultimately, what we want are all these states to govern themselves and for us to trade with them. It was not, We wanna find the resources we need and acquire them. That had been our policy before 1931. It hasn’t been since 1931, and now it has changed, and I sure wish the team in power did a little bit of historical work and realized why we got out of that business back in the early 20th century.

Frum: Well, they’re about to find out the hard way because, this intervention in Venezuela—maybe they’ve just bundled President [Nicolás] Maduro out of town, and they’re going to give him a trial and see what happens. I keep saying they have not calculated enough that he might be acquitted. You gotta think that there is a real chance that that could happen because it’s not a drumhead court-martial. It’s not a Pete Hegseth I take away your pension, and then you sue me. It’s going to be a real trial, and the defendant can win. And, by the way, and if the defendant wins, the defendant may have some tort claims (Laughs.) against the United States for the summary method with which he was removed, so that could all happen. They didn’t seem to have thought about that.

But if they are serious about trying to extract oil from Venezuela, the oil is in places where the road network isn’t good, where the electrical network isn’t good. I’m given to understand there are not remotely enough tankers in the world to begin moving Venezuelan oil at any scale. So all of those things are going to have to be built and paid for by somebody.

Naftali: Yes, and ask yourself, with the price of oil dropping—and you’re in the oil business—are you going to invest money into what could be a failed state? So then the question is, Okay, well, we—

Frum: With guerilla warfare a real possibility.

Naftali: Yeah. So then we ask the question, Oh, well, we don’t want a failed state. Oh, no, no, no, we don’t want a Somalia. No, no, no, no, no. And then the question is, Okay, how are you going to avoid a failed state with this particular approach to the transition in Venezuela? You’ve got a group of people whose intellectual worldview is fundamentally different from our—I don’t care how Machiavellian they might be; they are fundamentally different from the vision that the best of the Trump team has for Venezuela, by that, I mean Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio. How are you gonna manage that with them? Well, maybe you can’t manage it with them, which means we have to go, which means we find ourselves supervising the police, making sure there’s law and order, because no American businessperson is gonna wanna invest in Somalia or you name whichever failed country that might have access to oil—you name it, and they’re not gonna wanna do it—which means we’ve just managed to create a failed state in Venezuela, or at least, that’s the possibility.

It’s amazing to me the hubris that has led to this. But, by the way, as we’ve seen before, hubris begets hubris because we’re already talking about the next great American expedition and acquisition in the Western Hemisphere: Greenland.

Do you think the Trump library in Miami will, in fact, ever be built?

Naftali: Hmm. Well, after the first term, of course, the current president decided he hadn’t lost and his interest was in regaining power, not in legacy. And so there was no Trump library—there was no foundation for a Trump library after the first term. There seems to be some interest in legacy right now. After all, this is a president who wants his name on everything, so he’s clearly thinking about the future. It’s fascinating. He’s already putting his name everywhere, as if he’s about to retire. So I have a feeling that the old man actually wants a Trump library.

Frum: Let me develop the thought a little bit. He’s tapping out hundreds of millions of dollars for this Trump ballroom that is being built beside the White House. The estimate began at $200-something million. It’s risen to $300 million. I don’t know that there’s any real cost accounting going on here; I would not be surprised if it turns out to be a lot more than that. He won’t care, because he’s raising the money from people who are buying influence. They don’t care: Well, what does it cost to keep Trump happy? Twenty-five million dollars. I give it; I get something in return.

But a lot of those people are going to be tapped out. He’s not going to want to pay for the Trump library himself. He’s going to wanna turn to that same network of donors. And their calculus of interest in paying for it may be quite different after November than it is now. They’re not giving it because they like them so much; they’re giving it because they expect something from him. And that library advances to the extent that Trump can deliver benefits to people of whom he’s asking tens of millions of dollars.

Naftali: Well, we have to ask ourselves, To what extent will the government of Congo, will Qatar, will the UAE, will Saudi Arabia, to what extent are they gonna front-load payments to this library as part of elaborate agreements that the Trump team is engaged in? I wouldn’t be surprised if there are promissory notes for all these things that have already been established, and that would allow the Trump library to be sort of a laundering mechanism for whatever follows. So I wouldn’t put it past this team—I’m talking about the Trump team—that they are not thinking about ways to use this quasi-commercial Trump library as a place to park money, and money that we can get from governments that have an interest in what we’re deciding today, get it from them now. So they’re not gonna wait until December of 2028 to get this money.

Frum: Tim, thank you so much for your time and insight today.

Naftali: My pleasure. Thank you, David, for inviting me on.

Frum:  Thanks so much to Tim Naftali for joining me today on The David Frum Show. As mentioned at the top of the program, my book this week is Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Brontë. I opened this book series by discussing the masterwork by her sister Emily, Wuthering Heights, one of the darkest novels in the entire canon of English literature. Jane Eyre is a more assimilable document. It is much more like a classic love story, although very dark in its way. The story of Jane and her brooding, mysterious Mr. Rochester has, I think, enlivened a lot of high-school classes. I wanna discuss something that is not the love story, something that occurs earlier in the book Jane Eyre.

Jane Eyre tells autobiographically, in the first person, the story of a young English woman, starting from about the age of 10 until she is married and has children. The young Jane Eyre is an orphan who is sent to live with an aunt by marriage and cousins, who treat her neglectfully at best, quite brutally at worst. And the book opens with a searing depiction of the maltreatment and unkindness of the adult world to unwanted children. So here is a passage from the recollections of the young Jane Eyre, aged only 10. The aunt by marriage is named Mrs. Reed, and Mrs. Reed is the person referred to in the quote I’m about to read.

“Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.” The above is a quoted insult to the young Jane. “Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?

“‘Nothing, indeed,’ thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.”

Now, those are not a 10-year-old’s words. That’s not a 10-year-old’s vocabulary. But those are very much a 10-year-old’s feelings. And what I draw attention to here is this book, published in 1847, is the beginning of a new thing in English literature specifically and in world literature in general, which is attention to the vulnerability and feelings of the young child.

Now, it’s not invented in Jane Eyre. Oliver Twist is published in 1838, earlier, and I’m not scholar enough to know, but I’m sure somebody in English literature was doing this even before [Charles] Dickens and Charlotte Brontë. But it is something you will not find much of in the literature before 1800; nothing at all, I would think, before 1750; and nothing at all in Greek and Roman literature, and the other literatures that shaped English literature of the 19th century. It’s a new thought that is forming; a revolution against cruelty to the vulnerable, especially the young; a transformation in human consciousness expressed through literature and taught through literature.

Where does it come from, and what does it mean, this new thing in the world? Well, it comes from, in some ways, from a sort of secularized Protestant Christianity that a lot of the—Jane Eyre is a very religious person, and it’s a very religious book. Although the Brontës had not much use for the formally constituted clergy, the awareness of God and the person’s relationship to God is a powerful theme, especially in Jane Eyre, but in all the Brontë novels. It comes too, I think, from something that is happening in the material world around them. The 1840s are the beginnings of the moment where individual people in England would feel the power of the Industrial Revolution to transform humanity’s relationship to its environment.

When young Jane Eyre is sent off to school, there’s an outbreak of some kind of disease—maybe tuberculosis, maybe typhoid fever—that kills a lot of the girls. Now, Jane Eyre is written before the advent of modern germ theory. Neither the narrator nor the author understand where this disease comes from. But they do have a sense that something could and should be done about it, which is a new idea. As people become more masterful toward nature, they become more insistent that something better than what existed before could and should happen. And the way you measure this change, this transformation is, above all, in the status of the most vulnerable people in society and especially children. A revolution against cruelty, and you can see it happening in the pages of novels, and you can see it happening, especially, in the early parts of Jane Eyre.

It’s a remarkable thing to see a new idea coming into being, especially such a sweet and generous new idea as that of goodness and protectiveness toward children of every status, not just those who are children of kings, not just those who are heroes and gods, but every child. That’s the message of Jane Eyre. That’s a new idea in the world, and it’s one that we’re still integrating into our consciousness, but that has more and more power to shape and guide us, and should have more and more power to shape and guide us. The rejection of cruelty is one of the proudest things about modern humanity, and it’s good to meet it at the beginning of its career and to speed it along its way at this later phase in its career.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Greenland is 836,000 square miles, more than five times the size of California, and it’s mostly ice. President Trump has been threatening to commandeer the island, complaining that Denmark has neglected the Arctic territory. On Wednesday, I met with Peter Boysen, the chief of the Danish army, and asked him how his country plans to strengthen Greenland’s defenses.

Boysen, who has a lean frame and stoic features, ticked off air capabilities and cyber defenses—satellites, drones, and other technology that can collect data and establish “domain awareness.” In layman’s terms, that means figuring out exactly who’s doing what on the mostly uninhabited territory at the top of the world, which acts as a bridge between the European continent and the northernmost reaches of the Americas.

But then the army chief paused. “In order to maintain sovereignty, you need boots on the ground,” he said. He leaned forward over a small table in the Kastellet, a 17th-century fort in Copenhagen that still houses military offices, so that I could not mistake his meaning. “We need, of course, to have units that are able to deploy to Greenland in times of crisis to show presence.”

The crisis has come. The foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met today at the White House with Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. After the meeting, the Danish foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, called the dialogue constructive but acknowledged, “We didn’t manage to change the American position. It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Hours earlier, the Danish defense ministry announced a stepped-up military presence in Greenland, including aircraft, ships, and soldiers. A spokesperson for the Danish Defense Command told me that the military presence represents “routine task execution,” part of “preparation for upcoming activities,” and presented it as the fulfillment of promises made last fall to spend more on Arctic security, including on Greenland. Sweden’s prime minister said soldiers from his country were also arriving on Greenland today, and German personnel were expected to begin arriving tomorrow.

Danish lawmakers I spoke with suspected that the timing was not a coincidence. They said the government in Copenhagen wants to avoid inflaming tensions with the United States, but also knows it can’t sit on its hands. “If we want to have a credible deterrent, we have to send something,” said a member of the Danish parliament’s defense committee, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. A U.S. official in Copenhagen told me that the deployment is consistent with Denmark’s promises to boost Arctic deterrence, but was likely expedited because of tensions with the United States.

The move seems to offer the Trump administration a stark choice: Will you join our efforts or destroy them?

Denmark’s defense minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, appeared to preview the new military footprint in remarks to reporters yesterday. He said additional forces would showcase a “clear response to the challenge facing the Arctic,” but he characterized the deployment as a joint NATO effort, not a threat to the Americans.

Boysen struck a similar note in our conversation. He has been head of the army since 2024, helping lead a military buildup that stretches eastward to the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm and westward to Greenland. Historically, Denmark’s military hasn’t had a large permanent presence on Greenland, though its Joint Arctic Command is headquartered in the capital, Nuuk, and there are additional personnel at Station Nord, the northernmost military base in the world, as well as several other outposts. Despite Trump’s claims that adversaries are bearing down on the island, Boysen said Denmark’s foreign-intelligence service hasn’t identified an imminent threat—“from Russia or China or anybody else.” Current and former U.S. officials told me the same.

Boysen said Denmark deployed units totaling about 600 soldiers to the Arctic last year. With new conscription rules adding to the ranks of the Danish army, as well as joint NATO priorities in the polar region, he said the country’s “ability to operate up there will increase.” Danish authorities expect allies to step up their footprint on Greenland as well, Boysen told me, pointing to a Denmark-led exercise on the island in 2025, which included France, Germany, Sweden, and Norway. “So again,” he said, “I think some of our key allies would want to join us, including the Americans, on Greenland.”

Read: Trump seizing Greenland could set off a chain reaction

But Trump seems intent on a different path. He has ridiculed existing efforts to defend Greenland, and insisted that the United States must own the island, which has enjoyed home rule within the Kingdom of Denmark since 1979. A Cold War–era agreement signed by Denmark and the United States gave Washington broad latitude to conduct military operations on the territory, and the U.S. Space Force currently has a base on the island’s northwest coast. Rasmus Jarlov, a Danish lawmaker, told me that the Trump administration has yet to articulate a single objective on Greenland, aside from acquiring it. “That’s the challenge we have,” Jarlov said. “And, of course, since they already have full access, it’s a little hard to improve.”

“But,” the lawmaker added with a laugh, “we’re willing to try.”

Trump, for his part, doesn’t appear to be in the mood to negotiate. He wrote this morning on social media that anything less than ownership was “unacceptable.” Yesterday, after Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, vowed to cast his lot with Denmark over the United States, the president said that he didn’t “know anything about” Nielsen but that such a choice would be a “big problem for him.”

What would be a big problem, for everyone, is a U.S. military incursion in Greenland. For one thing, Article 5 of NATO’s charter compels members of the alliance to treat an attack on one as an attack on all. (It doesn’t contemplate what happens if NATO members attack one another.) There’s also a royal decree from 1952, issued in response to Denmark’s humiliating rout by Nazi forces in the Second World War, that compels the country’s soldiers to fight back if their territory is invaded. Boysen was unequivocal in describing the decree as a fact of military service. “You have to,” he said. “It’s an obligation.”

When I asked whether Danish forces would really fight back against Americans, he demurred. “This is highly political,” he said. “And I’m just a soldier.”

            <h2>Putin’s Explosive Message to Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/putin-oreshnik-lviv/685611/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Friday, Russia attacked Lviv, a major Ukrainian city near the Polish border, using Oreshnik: an intermediate-range, nuclear-capable ballistic missile. Security-camera footage captured brief flashes in the sky, the missile’s multiple warheads entering the atmosphere at 10 times the speed of sound, and then—impact. The missile that struck Lviv did not carry a nuclear payload, but it did carry a political one, at a moment when Vladimir Putin appears to be cornered and Donald Trump is more belligerent than ever.

Firing an Oreshnik comes with logistical headaches. The launch must be carried out by the Strategic Rocket Forces—the core of Russia’s nuclear triad—and it cannot be a surprise. Moscow notifies the United States in advance to avoid triggering a retaliatory strike. More important, without a nuclear payload, the missile has limited military value; Russia has other weapons capable of inflicting similar damage at a fraction of the cost. The most logical reason for Russia’s use of this weapon at this time is to remind America that it is still a superpower and that Putin is still in control.

Trump has been friendly to Putin—but not useful to him. Moscow entered 2026 under more U.S. sanctions than before Trump’s reelection, with a much-worse economy, and is unable to agree to any of the peace proposals on the table. The Kremlin is all smiles whenever Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is in town, and Putin still calls Trump ahead of the U.S. president’s meetings with Volodymyr Zelensky, but Oreshnik is the Kremlin’s statement piece. The missile’s launch means that Russia’s hopes for an agreeable Trump have more or less vanished—especially after U.S. forces captured former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on January 3.

Read: Why Maduro probably can’t count on Putin

Numerous pundits and opinion pieces suggested that Trump’s Venezuela raid would send a welcome signal to Russia and China: Spheres of influence are back, and the U.S. will dominate the Western Hemisphere while allowing China to invade Taiwan and Putin to freely go after the countries that were once part of the Warsaw Pact.

Beijing, however, is unlikely to be seriously reconsidering its decades-old Taiwan policy based on Washington’s 17th regime change in South America. As for Putin, he did not need any “signals” from George W. Bush to attack Georgia in 2008. He never received a green light from Barack Obama to annex Crimea in 2014 or intervene in Syria a year later. And even though Joe Biden upheld the so-called rules-based international order, Putin still launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Years before American bombs fell on Caracas, the Russian leader was waging the largest land war in Europe since World War II, alongside an ongoing hybrid campaign across the continent. He didn’t need U.S. Special Forces to storm Maduro’s compound to order Zelensky’s assassination—he’s already tried and failed repeatedly to have the Ukrainian president killed.

The expectation in Moscow was that America would be withdrawing from the world, but just in the past few weeks, Washington has bombed Nigeria, Syria, and Venezuela, and issued threats to bomb Iran (again), should the Islamic Republic open fire on protesters, which it has done. The Kremlin tried to shield an oil tanker that the United States was determined to seize—allowing it to fly the Russian flag, issuing diplomatic warnings, and even shadowing it with Russian military vessels, reportedly including a submarine. The U.S. Coast Guard took the ship anyway and then seized a second tanker near Venezuela.

On January 3, Russia lost a major foothold in South America. In the past two decades, Moscow has provided $34 billion to Venezuela, mostly to purchase Russian-made weapons, and loaned it $3.15 billion that now may not be paid back. Russia also signed a defense-cooperation pact with Cuba last spring. The Trump administration is threatening that country, too, and Moscow is not really in a position to prevent Washington from raiding Havana.

Washington’s rhetoric toward Moscow has changed as well. While visiting shipbuilders in Newport News, Virginia, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth quipped about the Venezuela operation, “Seems those Russian air defenses didn’t quite work so well, did they?” When asked what safeguards were in place to prevent escalation with Russia over Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered one of the most unpleasant lines Moscow could hear: “We’re not concerned about an escalation with Russia with regards to Venezuela.” He added that the United States has always expected Moscow to provide only “rhetorical” support for the Maduro regime. He then wished Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, a merry Christmas.

Putin’s options for retaliation are limited at best. Ukraine was supposed to be for Russia what Venezuela was for the U.S.—a quick, victorious war against a much smaller neighbor. That war has now lasted longer than the Soviet campaign against Nazi Germany (1941–45). This time, however, no cavalry, no army reserves, and no Soviet tank divisions will be plowing through Europe. Russia has lost many, if not most, of its tanks. It has no navy capable of defending allied regimes such as Venezuela and Cuba against the United States. After spending years trying to conquer Ukraine, Putin has effectively narrowed Russia’s room for maneuver to Ukraine’s borders alone. A Russian “victory” now amounts to little more than a flattened village with a Russian flag planted in the rubble. Even then, success is never assured: Putin believed he had captured the small city of Kupiansk, until Zelensky posted a video of himself there. Thus comes the symbolic firing of the intermediate-range Oreshnik—one of the last ways for Russia to project its power.

Trump is especially reactive to anything nuclear, or the “n-word,” as he calls it. Last summer, he announced tariffs on India and an additional penalty for purchasing Russian oil, and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev responded on Telegram that Trump should “revisit his favorite movies about the living dead and recall just how dangerous the mythical ‘Dead Hand’ can be”—a reference to Russia’s Cold War–era automatic nuclear retaliation system. Trump fired back on Truth Social: “Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that.”

As evidenced by new sanctions on Russian oil, the seizure of Russian tankers, and the continuing flow of American weapons to Ukraine, Putin has repeatedly overplayed his hand with the president of the United States. What’s worse for Putin—and possibly for the world—is that this Trump is on the warpath. Most of his recent press conferences have included references to bombing or regime-changing one country or another (the list now includes a NATO country, too). This is not the real-estate or cryptocurrency Trump. This is Trump with guns—a leader whose doctrine boils down to “ICE for Americans. Delta Force for everyone else.”

On Friday, Fox News’s Peter Doocy asked Trump whether he would ever order a mission to capture Putin. Trump replied, in part, “I don’t think it’s going to be necessary. I’ve always had a great relationship with him.”

The statement read as deeply insulting to the Russian leader. Still, launching an intermediate-range ballistic missile to send a message to this new version of Trump may not play out the way Putin intends. Rather than reasserting Russia’s power, it risks putting two aging authoritarians with nuclear stockpiles on a path of mutual escalation—one of the most dangerous developments since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, and perhaps even since the Cold War.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The protests in Iran are real. The country’s economic desperation runs deep, and millions of citizens want to see a corrupt and repressive regime gone. The violent crackdown on the protests is also real and appears to have cost thousands of lives. Yet the accounts, photos, and videos coming out of Iran are riddled with accusations of AI manipulation and fakery that have the effect of calling even what’s true into doubt.

There’s a term of art for the benefit that accrues to bad actors when they sow public uncertainty as to whether anything at all is real: It’s the liar’s dividend, and it’s very much in evidence in Iran.

AI-generated or -enhanced online content has become a global problem for those seeking to understand or document protest movements, because it allows interested parties to shape narratives. In 2025, AI-generated images of real protest moments muddied the view of events in Turkey, and AI-generated content became a mobilization tool for Nepal’s Gen Z uprising. But Iran is perhaps the most fraught arena of all. Multiple political factions, foreign governments, and the Iranian regime itself are all competing to shape the narrative of current events. And the tools for fabricating reality have never been as advanced and accessible as they are today.

Arash Azizi: The Islamic Republic will not last

Videos of Iran circulating on social media show crowds moved by an array of convictions and desires. Some simply chant against the regime; others chant for Reza Pahlavi, the crown prince of Iran’s deposed monarchy, or invoke his father, the last shah. Numerous confirmed videos show demonstrators venting economic anguish and hatred for Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; the security forces; and the Islamic Republic itself. All of these views of the protests are grounded in Iran’s complex reality. Yet the presence among them of images and videos that have been—or are even suspected of being—doctored with AI, mislabeled, misattributed, or spliced with content from other places or times has given oxygen to the dark imaginings of the movement’s enemies within the regime.

As a diaspora Iranian who has studied online deception, censorship, and surveillance efforts for almost 15 years, I take a particular interest in Iran’s information environment. At the human-rights organization Witness, I’m involved with something called the Deepfake Rapid Response Force, which helps journalists and human-rights defenders assess manipulated media. We have plenty to work with during the current Iran crisis.

What we are seeing is not a single disinformation campaign but something much messier. Iran’s information ecosystem has been shaped by extreme distrust of the Islamic Republic’s official media; social-media influence efforts coming from both the regime and foreign powers; and rampant distortions of online content—some deceptive, some careless, some well intentioned—that make verifying what Iranians are actually saying or doing during these protests difficult. The liar’s dividend redounds to the regime more than anyone else.

Iran’s nationwide uprising erupted on December 28. And within hours, regime-aligned accounts began dismissing authentic images from the protests as AI-generated.

An early, high-profile case involved a picture that came to be known as Iran’s “tank man” photo. Its source was a low-quality video that had been captured with a zoom lens on December 29, showing a protester facing down security forces in Tehran. A BBC Persian journalist posted a screengrab from the video the same day, and that image, which had a higher picture quality, began to circulate. The event was real: It has been verified from multiple angles and by fact-checkers. But somewhere along the line, someone enhanced the still image of it with AI editing tools, likely to make the blurry original screengrab sharper and more shareable.

Regime accounts seized on visible artifacts from AI enhancement as opportunities to dismiss the photo and other footage from the protests. “It’s all AI slop,” one regime account with a visibly AI-generated profile photo opined. “Just when you think Zionists can’t be more pathetic, they prove you wrong.”

Deepfakes have given AI a reputation for being deceptive. But many commonly employed image-editing tools use generative-AI capabilities, for better or worse. The public does not generally know how to distinguish good-faith use of these tools from malicious fakery. And this allows bad-faith actors such as the Islamic Republic, which has spent decades undermining protests and dissidence, to use not only AI itself but also the suspicion it generates as an accelerant.

The same pattern has played out with audio manipulations. On December 30, an account presenting itself as affiliated with the Mujahedin-e Khalq—a controversial exiled opposition group known as the MEK that has an armed wing and was once designated a terrorist organization by the United States—posted a video in which pro-Pahlavi chants are clearly dubbed over protest footage. The account then “exposed” the video as manipulated and used it to claim that monarchists were fabricating support. Within hours, pro-regime accounts had reposted this content to amplify the accusation that pro-Pahlavi chants were fake.

What was striking was that the alleged MEK account both introduced the manipulated video and was the first to call it out. Moreover, regime-aligned accounts were ready to rebroadcast that post almost immediately. Iranian researchers have long documented the regime’s use of opposition personas on social media to sow confusion, divide the opposition, and discredit authentic documentation, and leaked documents and videos from within the regime have confirmed the practice.

Within a day of the supposed MEK post being published, a Russian propaganda account set the AI-enhanced “tank man” photo alongside the allegedly manipulated Pahlavi audio and presented both as proof that the protests were a foreign fabrication. The loop was closed: manipulated content introduced by what may have been a regime account, amplified by pro-regime voices, then aggregated by Russian state-aligned media as evidence of an AI-driven Western psyop.

If that cycle isn’t complicated enough, consider that the regime’s accusations capitalize on at least one documented instance of manipulation by monarchists. On December 29, Manoto, the London-based Persian-language channel aligned with the monarchist opposition, aired footage of crowds chanting in favor of Pahlavi. The audio is real—but traceable to a memorial for Khosrow Alikhordi, a human-rights lawyer whose suspicious death last month drew thousands of mourners. It had been lifted and overlaid onto unrelated protest footage. Whether the doctored video was planted by hostile actors or intentionally created by someone within the royalist camp, the effect was the same: It handed malicious accounts exactly the precedent they needed.

Royalists are not the only anti-regime camp that has either generated or circulated fake content that serves their narrative. On December 30, Radio Farda and other accounts shared a 2020 video, as though it were footage of the current protests, of protesters chanting, “No to the oppressor, be it the shah or the leader.” BBC Verify’s Shayan Sardarizadeh flagged the misattribution.

The Islamic Republic has a habit of attributing authentic, homegrown dissent to Israeli and American conspiracies. This supposed foreign subversion then becomes a pretext for repression. The latest crisis is no different in that regard—but now foreign actors are helping boost the regime’s narrative by sharing doctored, misleading content that the regime can then expose.

Israel has been using AI-generated content to push anti-regime and pro-Israeli narratives in Iran since at least last summer’s 12-day war. The Citizen Lab, a research and policy center based at the University of Toronto, points to AI-fabricated footage of a supposedly surgical strike on Evin Prison, among other examples. A Haaretz investigation found that Israeli influence operations were promoting ideas aligned with Iranian monarchist factions.

Shortly before the protests broke out last month, an Israeli diplomat shared a montage of four alleged strikes on Iranian command centers during the June war captioned, “very precise.” Our analysis found that of the four clips, one is authentic footage that had aired on Iranian state television; the other three show signs of having been generated by AI. BBC Verify traced the video montage to an Instagram account that has more than 120,000 followers and identifies itself as “Islamists and Khomeinists’ Nightmare” and “Media Warfare Expert.” When users pointed out the manipulation of the air-strike footage, the diplomat did not delete the post. He acknowledged that parts of it may have been AI-manipulated, but argued that the video still demonstrates the precision of Israel’s operations—in other words, he stood by admittedly fabricated content because it illustrates a story he wanted to tell.

Perhaps similarly, on January 1, the Israeli Foreign Ministry posted an image on its Persian-language X account of Iranian police blasting two protesters with a water hose. The image was AI-altered: The original, published by BBC Persian’s Farzad Seifikaran the day before, shows the protesters being hosed down from a distance and then an officer approaching with a loudspeaker, not a hose.

These sorts of interventions may be meant to boost the opposition to the Islamic Republic, but the use of doctored media has other, no doubt unintended, effects. Actors with a vested interest in hiding what is happening in Iran’s streets use the existence of untrustworthy content promoted by foreign powers to convince the public that all documentation of the protests is a foreign deception. The dividend again accrues to the Islamic Republic.

Sometimes the problem is not manipulation at all but just the impossibility of capturing a fractured reality. On December 29, Iran International shared footage from a march in the town of Malard, where a crowd was chanting for Pahlavi. Another user posted a different angle of the same street and the same march, only with different audible slogans. One user who had shared the first footage issued a correction; others accused the Pahlavi camp of spreading falsehoods. But who is to say that on that long street, different crowds at different moments didn’t simply chant different things?

This is epistemic fog. Even without deception, people operating in good faith, trying to verify what they have seen, cannot know what is representative. Such knowledge is elusive in any case: Iran is a country of more than 90 million people whose aspirations can hardly be generalized from any single video or protest chant.

Journalists, courts, human-rights investigators, and protest movements everywhere have long depended on shared standards of proof. Today we are seeing what happens when those standards collapse. When any image can be dismissed as possibly synthetic, those in power no longer need to suppress speech. They have only to raise questions that undermine belief in a shared reality.

Since Thursday evening, the Iranian regime has thickened the fog to near impenetrability with a national internet shutdown and a blackout of communication with the outside world. From where I stand, the information picture has fractured further. Verified footage has slowed to a trickle; what comes out largely passes through Starlink terminals. Diaspora Iranians are frantic, unable to reach family members. Death-toll figures vary wildly, as documentation organizations struggle to access data: The range now sits between 12,000 and 20,000 dead, but the full scale is unknown.

Our Deepfake Rapid Response Force has been trying to help validate legitimate human-rights documentation that is sometimes falsely tagged as AI. An enormous effort is afoot among human-rights organizations to accurately count the dead. Meanwhile, regime accounts have been disseminating footage from counterprotests in favor of the Islamic Republic—clips that some opposition accounts suggest are AI-generated, and that official news media vehemently insist are real. Everyone is primed to distrust everything, and the shutdown ensures that nothing—not the scale of the protests, the severity of the crackdown, or the state of the regime—can be witnessed in real time.

The Iranian regime has spent more than four decades undermining the credibility of dissent. Now it has AI not just as a tool for creating fakes but as a rhetorical weapon. Every glitch, artifact, and even protective blur becomes evidence that nothing can be trusted. In a world where policy makers and platforms invest in AI detection and fact-checking, perhaps ordinary people would not be fighting through such darkness, or bad actors reaping such dividends.

What Iranians want and are fighting for is a question only they can answer. And their answer deserves to be heard—not shaped by foreign governments, dismissed by regime propagandists, or drowned in fog that others have helped create.</div>

            <h2>The Climate Question That Economists Cannot Answer</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most Americans now accept the basic physics of climate change—that manmade greenhouse-gas emissions are raising global temperatures. Yet the public discussion of climate change is still remarkably broken in the United States. Leaders of one political party frame climate change as an existential emergency that threatens human life and prosperity. Leaders of the other dismiss it as a distraction from economic growth and energy security.

Economists like me, trained to think about trade-offs, are uneasy with both camps. But, in practice, we have helped fuel the extremes of this dysfunctional debate. High-profile economic studies claim to quantify the global damages that will be caused by climate change centuries into the future and have produced estimates that range from modest to catastrophic. They have lent a veneer of scientific authority to arguments for both complacency and alarm, even though these studies are far too limited to support either position.

Last week, the United States withdrew from the world’s climate treaty, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, among other international agreements and organizations that the White House said ran counter to “national interests, security, economic prosperity, or sovereignty.” President Trump and his allies have previously claimed that climate change poses only a minor threat and have cherry-picked economic studies to support that view. In July, for instance, the administration released a report arguing that mainstream economics showed such negligible damages from climate change that any strong policy response was unjustified.

The report relies heavily on the work of the Yale economist William Nordhaus, who pioneered the use of economic models to quantify certain categories of damage caused by climate change. Nordhaus weighed those damages against the potential costs of reducing emissions, to identify what he called the “optimal” global-emissions path. This was groundbreaking work that won him the Nobel Prize in 2018, but his conclusions cut against the goals the world had set out in the Paris Agreement three years earlier: to limit warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Because Nordhaus’s model showed relatively modest damages and high costs of avoiding them, it implied that only limited efforts should be taken to reduce warming. The optimal pathway that he presented in his Nobel Prize lecture entails well more than 3 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100, similar to projections of where the world appears headed today.

Although Nordhaus himself has long supported climate policy, in particular a carbon tax, opponents of climate policy have embraced his results as validation of doing nothing at all. Before becoming U.S. secretary of energy, Chris Wright wrote that Nordhaus’s damage estimates show that climate change is “far less urgent” than other societal priorities and that reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, a key goal of the Biden administration, is “neither achievable nor humane.”

At the opposite end of the spectrum, similar economic models are invoked to justify climate action at almost any cost. The Network for Greening the Financial System—a global consortium of central bankers and financial supervisors—had relied on a prominent study showing that climate change could reduce per capita incomes by 20 to 60 percent, compared with a world without climate impacts, by 2100. Events widely regarded as economic catastrophes—wars, financial crises, pandemics—are often shown to cause permanent income losses of single-digit percentage points.

That study, by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, was retracted from the journal Nature last year because of methodological errors. (The paper’s authors have said the issues raised were fair, and they are revising the article in hopes of republishing it.) The retraction, however, has largely been treated as an isolated incident, because the study was just one contribution to a growing body of research estimating that large economic damages will come from climate change, as well as disastrous noneconomic effects, including warming-induced deaths. Almost any climate policy appears cheap by comparison.

The implication of these studies, sometimes made explicit, is that economic evidence strongly supports the Paris Agreement’s climate goals. Climate advocates, in turn, cite those targets to argue against new fossil-fuel infrastructure, such as liquefied-natural-gas terminals on the Gulf Coast and natural-gas pipelines in the Northeast.

Few economists embrace these all-or-nothing views on climate policy. Many would point out, for instance, that oil and natural-gas development could lower energy prices and spur economic activity that supports local communities. Conversely, jettisoning climate policy altogether amounts to giving up humanity’s insurance policy against the risks that would be posed by a climate like we’ve never experienced. There is broad support within the profession for climate policies such as carbon prices and emissions standards that aim to reduce emissions with minimal economic disruption. Indeed, the central message of Nordhaus’s work is the importance of balancing the benefits and costs of climate action, rather than identifying any particular pathway forward.

Despite this, the most visible use of climate-economics analysis today is to advance extreme arguments that most economists do not agree with. How did that happen?

One important reason is that policy makers want these damage estimates. Elected officials want to show that the benefits of their preferred climate policies exceed the costs. When I worked at the Council of Economic Advisers, part of my job was to implement an executive order from President Biden to “capture the full costs” of greenhouse-gas emissions in regulatory decisions. Many other jurisdictions similarly require the use of climate-damage estimates in policy processes.

The economic analysis of climate change is a worthwhile endeavor: It can help identify where climate risks are concentrated, who bears them, and which responses are most likely to reduce harm. But quantitative estimates of aggregated global damages over centuries lie far beyond our analytical capabilities. Small changes in assumptions—for example, how damages scale with rising temperatures or how humans mitigate and adapt to those risks—can yield results that appear to justify virtually any policy response. In other words, these models can display a pessimistic worldview in which climate damages accelerate to catastrophic levels, or a more optimistic one in which human progress keeps damages relatively modest. They offer little help in determining which of these futures is coming.

Uncertain projections can still be useful. The challenge is to establish criteria that distinguish the projections that offer meaningful guidance from those whose uncertainty is so great that they mainly offer a false sense of precision. On this front, climate economics has fallen short. Estimates that suggest economic models are capable of comprehensively quantifying climate damages over centuries continue to feature prominently in top academic journals, at conferences, and in the writings of influential economists, effectively granting carte blanche to those who wish to use such figures to advance their agendas.

This problem is neither new nor obscure. Many economists have warned that attempts to quantify climate damages far into the future risk overstating what the discipline can credibly deliver. Among the most prominent was the Harvard economist Martin Weitzman. In a 2009 paper, he advised economists to avoid presenting estimates of aggregated climate damages as if they were “accurate and objective,” and instead urged economists to stress openly that they might be “arbitrarily inaccurate” given their reliance on subjective and deeply uncertain assumptions. That intellectual humility, he argued, “might go a long way toward elevating the level of public discourse concerning what to do about global warming.” Weitzman himself emphasized the possibility of catastrophic climate outcomes, even if unlikely and unquantifiable, as a motivation for stronger action, in part by underscoring the fragility of climate-damage estimates that appeared to justify weaker responses.

Experts being clearer about what economics can and cannot tell us would not resolve disagreements about climate policy. But this would make it harder to treat speculative damage estimates as decisive evidence for unsupportable claims. The full effects of climate change are unknowable, and a more constructive public discussion about climate policy will require getting more comfortable with that.</div>

When we had our last set of quakes here in Humboldt we lost VZ coverage in my town because the cell tower had inadequate backup power. Verizon promised to bring a generator out and then... didn&#39;t. Had no phone service for three days.

I&#39;d get something else but it&#39;s all shit here. ATT? Fuck that. US Cellular? I know from experience trying to call people that they will regularly just tell callers to go fuck themselves instead of allowing them to leave you a voicemail. T-Mobile has 0 towers here.

Yeah, VZW has been sucking ass for a while now.  My main carrier is Tmo, which has a pretty solid buildout in my home areas, but I have VZW as backup for when I travel.

Lately, one of the main areas in which I use VZW has been seeing dialup-modem-level performance, and as an added bonus, MMS quit working entirely on their network.  They tell me to check the APNs, which doesn&#39;t work because Verizon demanded that Google lock users out of APN settings.  I got it to work for a while by manually editing settings

They have no reason to trust anybody, just like the US and Israel have no reason to trust Chinese software.

I would have thought that China had already mandated home-grown solutions for cybersecurity a long time ago.

The fact that they suddenly feel compelled to do it now, in a wholesale fashion and at an accelerated pace, is yet another indication of how badly the US has shat the bed when it comes to its reputation for stability and reliability

And in actual reality, while both the US and Israel have gotten caught and are clearly doing error-seeding to create vulnerabilities (see Cisco, for example), the Chinese are either not doing it or are decades ahead of everybody else. Somehow I doubt it is the latter.

They probably tried to renew a VMWare license and went scorched earth.

Some groups of people are just not trustworthy.

Hiring the people with entirely the wrong qualifications. Yes, it may make them a bit faster. But they need to be able to do everything competently without the tool or they cannot reliably check what it gives them. At the same time, &quot;learning&quot; to use a chat-bot is really simple and anybody that passes all the other requirements should easily be able to learn it. This is not a &quot;core qualification&quot; in any sense.

&quot;The focus is on collaboration and reasoning rather than technical AI expertise,&quot; CaseBasix said.&quot;

Nah, the focus is on whether the person can use AI, get paid for 4 hours of time and McKinsey can bill the client for two months of &quot;work&quot; through some contractual hoops.

AI can fully replace McKinsey. Whenever I need a degraded business strategy and a sub-optimal process, I ask AI for an analysis &quot;The McKinsey Way&quot;. Note: the AI often outperforms it on the first run so you may need to go a few extra rounds to get it exactly right. That&#39;s all part of the McKinsey way too.

Also good for replacing McKinsey: A magic 8-ball

This should immediately make it clear to applicants how badly you will be treated at McKinsey.

It&#39;s clear Bozo&#39;s vision is that he gets to look at what every body does on &quot;their computer&quot;, and nothing to do with what actual ownership might become.

A lot of non-techy folks would likely jump at this, especially if it&#39;s part of some &#39;connectivity bundle&#39; that comes with a thin client screen and keyboard, phone service, and streaming service.

How long before folks rolling their own are looked at sideways by LE?

How long before folks rolling their own are looked at sideways by LE?We&#39;re nearly there. I imagine the suspicion I would be under explaining to some goon that, no, I do not have any social media history to share because I do not have any social media accounts. To answer your question: we&#39;re this close.

Privacy concerns aside (and they&#39;re very real), every time we&#39;ve looked at any kind of cloud vs locally owned equipment, it has not only cost more, but a lot more, like twice as much, over the life of the equipment.

DRAM prices have become increasingly untenable for consumers

Indeed. We have gone back and forth between local computing and remote computing as the preferred way, simply because both ways have strong advantages and strong disadvantages. None is the &quot;one true way&quot; and anybody characterizing one option as such is an idiot or a liar. Hence what is better (local, remote or mix of the two) depends very much on what you do and what your requirements and limitations are.

Lots of people have visions of things that aren&#39;t here. They&#39;re called &quot;hallucinations,&quot; and it&#39;s the one human ability that AI has mastered fully.

Perhaps that joke about Zuck being a robot isn&#39;t entirely a joke after all.

I wouldn&#39;t want a dumb box either, but most regular folks are scared of their computers. If they even need one, on the rare occasions that happens, I think they&#39;d be perfectly potty with a dumb box supplied by their ISP. They no longer have to worry about updates, any viruses are the ISP&#39;s problem. Most folks do not use a lot of different apps. And right now their phone has already greased this slide.

I call those people future Apple users and that is not derogatory.  If non-techie non-gaming people ask me for a new laptop recommendation I just tell them to go spend the money and get a Macbook and they&#39;ll be happier than any Dell or HP shitterbox.

It is not going to happen. The market would need to massively shrink before consumer computer hardware would go away. It would need to shrink massively again before the same would happen for industrial computer hardware. And there are things that will not work with remote computing for a long time, like CAD applications. I talked to some people that tried. The lag was killing their engineers.

Hence, no, the market for PC-type hardware will NOT go away.

The market would need to massively shrink before consumer computer hardware would go away. It would need to shrink massively again before the same would happen for industrial computer hardware.Between the first and second shrinks, on what machine would high school students taking a programming class do their coursework?

If your load is not completely flat all day, i.e. it&#39;s a real load, do you provision for peak load and let the excess sit idle all day or do you accept instantaneous throughput constraints?

I provision my development workstations for a heterogeneous load. When a task is constrained by throughput of one resource, such as compiling a large program using a lot of CPU, I temporarily switch to another task that uses a different resource. This could be system library updates (which are network and disk bound), updating doc comments of the code that I wrote (which is thought bound), or reading documentation (which is network and thought bound).

This was my thought.    What do the &#39;terminals&#39; to these &#39;rented computers&#39; look like?

How much &#39;local processing&#39; do they need to do the communication and display?    Wouldn&#39;t they still need RAM and hardware of some sort?

This was my thought. What do the &#39;terminals&#39; to these &#39;rented computers&#39; look like?Thin clients have been around at least since X terminals in the early 1990s [wikipedia.org].How much &#39;local processing&#39; do they need to do the communication and display? Wouldn&#39;t they still need RAM and hardware of some sort?One could do a useful thin client that &quot;just&quot; runs X, VNC, or RDP on 256 MB of RAM and a cheap ARM processor. This isn&#39;t enough for (say) a development workstation unless you&#39;re using tools made for RAM capacities typical of 2003, which means no Visual Studio Code with LSP-driven tooltips.

I imagine it would be a monitor with network capabilities that you can plug a mouse and keyboard into, that&#39;s it. Everything is streamed. Nothing is processed locally. Just a dumb monitor that doesn&#39;t do anything unless it&#39;s connected to their service.

They can pry my RTX 5070 from my cold dead hands....

Fuck dummy terminals.  This idea has been pushed by corporate elites for decades...

You still need hardware to access cloud resources. May as well make that hardware capable in its own right--it&#39;s not expensive, especially if you don&#39;t care about gaming.

The idea of ownership is disappearing in this country.

I don&#39;t &quot;rent&quot; electricity, I pay for someone else to generate it and then I own what I&#39;ve consumed.  It does not get returned to the company and there are no restrictions on how I use it.

I&#39;m gonna have to say that&#39;s how I want my computer, too.  I might delegate certain tasks but I&#39;m never buying into this subscription based cloud computer crap.

You might not &quot;rent&quot; electricity (actually, electricity capacity) if you can accept that your instantaneous demand may not be met. If you have peaks that have to be met, you actually do rent the electrical capacity.

Analogies are descriptive, not prescriptive. Adding constraints merely to break the analogy doesn&#39;t disprove the analogy, especially if they also break the analog.

Since the invention of the computer user, it has only been a matter of time before someone managed to find a way to make the drug dealer model applicable and we&#39;re most of the way there.

I might delegate certain tasks but I&#39;m never buying into this subscription based cloud computer crap.For the most part, a lot of people are most of the way there. Specifically, they will use an online office suite which keeps most of their data offsite. I had a friend who, through a series of poor choices, managed to lose access to his google account (and several years of data) after switching phone numbers. As he described

Maybe not you personally because your usage is so small that it is basically a rounding error to the utility, but commercial users are subject to power factor constraints and time of use constraints.  It&#39;s a shared, limited resource.

If the work version is called an XStation, is the gaming version called a Playbox? The marketing departments of Sony and Microsoft might have something to say about that.

So the &quot;vision&quot; is that the ultra-rich own all the computers and everyone else gets to rent them. Sounds like the vision for real estate: The ultra-rich will own all the properties and we will all get to rent them. And food: The ultra-rich will own all the farmland and we get to buy the food from them.

What this really is, is the WEF vision of &quot;You will own nothing and you will be happy&quot;. There will be no middle-class allowed to own property: Just the ultra-rich owning everything and the rest of us will be a &quot;working class&quot; only allowed to work to survive.

This is just &quot;Neo-feudalism&quot;. A few ultra-rich and a serf class.

Time to break out the guillotines, friends.

Second, how could removing customers from the market entirely, other than a small handful of massive corporations, possibly be good for hardware manufacturers?

&quot;The 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s want their computers back.&quot;

You are pretending that isn&#39;t how most computing is consumed today.

At home, most of the stuff I do is through a browser. At work, all the real work is done on machines in different places that I drive through ETX, VNC, etc.

I see all the &#39;not a chance&#39; responses, but I&#39;d argue that the current Chromebook ecosystem comes pretty close to this: the majority of Chromebook hardware is designed to run a centrally-managed OS platform that enables access to larger services--just like a typical thin client; and the data and applications it runs are already &#39;rented&#39; from Google using ad revenue & Google app subscriptions.

If Google added remote-hosting services for apps that can&#39;t run locally (and resurrected Stadia under a new name cause that&#39;s what Google does best), I think it would fulfill this &#39;vision&#39; in all the meaningful ways...

Is the difference between this new idea and a Chromebook just a middle-ware layer where the processing/rendering takes place?   So instead of interacting with a browser, I interact with a picture of a browser and the &#39;computer&#39; that generated that picture interacts with the actual webpage?

Is there a way to &#39;rearchitect&#39; everything to not need a dedicated &#39;middle-ware&#39; layer, but instead your &#39;display terminal&#39; receives feeds of pre-computed and pre-rendered webpages and applications from multiple sources?

Was the mainframe. And when the computer was down, your business was down. But computers were expensive, and not every business needed a full computer, so the time sharing companies became a thing, and when their computer was down, your business was down. Everyone had a bad time, so as soon as personal computers became a thing, they became a thing. And the internet happened, and they forget the lessons of the old days and then reinvented it a piece at a time. So we now have the time sharing services that br

It&#39;s because (a) the internet has become fast enough that there&#39;s no penalty for a cloud-based solutionIn the city, maybe. In rural areas outside the service area of cable and fiber, the penalty is nearly a second of speed-of-light latency to and from the geostationary satellite and the data transfer overage bill from the ISP at the end of the month. Likewise for work done on a laptop while riding public transportation to or from home: if it isn&#39;t completely local, you incur a mobile hotspot/&quot;tethering&quot; bill from your cellular ISP.

As long as computing exists, it was always an oscillation between a local computing focus and a remote computing focus. Sometimes one is the preferred way, sometimes the other. None of these technologies are &quot;100 years old&quot; and only somebody completely clueless (or lying) would characterize them as such.

Why this oscillation? Simple: Both approaches have rather strong advantages that the other one lacks. At the same time, both approaches have rather strong drawbacks. A sane strategy mixes both and uses the s

Try high end gaming on a &quot;thin client&quot;.High-stakes gambling, whether on casino games or on the outcome of sport matches, has never needed a lot of local computing power. JRA PAT (Japan Racing Association Personal Access Terminal) was an application to bet on horse races that ran on a Super Famicom with a 3.6 MHz 16-bit CPU, 128 KiB of RAM, and 64 KiB of VRAM. The same machine hosted Vegas Stakes, an application that simulated casino gambling.

I think we&#39;ve long hit the point of computing as service for commercial computing. Businesses need the flexibility to scale processing and storage capacities pretty widely, and they also don&#39;t want to deal with staffing for maintenance of physical computing system.

But for consumers, the &quot;power grid&quot; analogy doesn&#39;t hold up as well. A commercial user who needs to store a bunch of data or do a bunch of number crunching does need terminals proportional to those needs. You can manage petabytes of storage with o

Guess, whom I view as a giant dick peeking out of a polo shirt...

They have been saying that since the 1990&#39;s. We&#39;ve constantly been told that personal hardware would be pointless and everything is going back to old school server-workstation architecture, and it still hasn&#39;t happened.

&quot;VoidLink is a comprehensive ecosystem designed to maintain long-term, stealthy access to compromised Linux systems, particularly those running on public cloud platforms and in containerized environments,&quot; the researchers said in a separate post.

This article was republished in partnership with Balls and Strikes.

In October 2019, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in Bostock v. Clayton County, a case about whether a federal civil rights law that prohibits employment discrimination based on “sex” extends to gay and transgender Americans too.

On paper, right-wing culture warriors had good reason to be optimistic that the court’s answer would be no. A year earlier, President Donald Trump had replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, who occasionally sided with the liberals in cases about LGBTQ+ rights, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a staunch conservative with a track record of adopting the movement’s preferred positions when it mattered most. His confirmation gave the right what it had sought for decades: the five Supreme Court votes necessary to turn its policy agenda into binding precedent.

Eight months later, though, a six-justice majority of the court held that federal employment protections indeed protect trans people in the workplace. The basic logic of Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion in Bostock, which Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberals joined, is that if an employer treats a transgender man differently than it would treat a man assigned male at birth, the workplace is treating that trans man differently “because of sex.”

Conservative types who had expected Kavanaugh’s confirmation to pay immediate dividends promptly lost their minds. In a dissent joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito called the majority’s argument “deceptive” and its conclusion “preposterous.” One conservative activist accused Gorsuch of abandoning textualism and succumbing to pressure from “college campuses and editorial boards”; another compared Bostock to Dred Scott, the 1857 Supreme Court case that denied citizenship to Black Americans and more or less started the Civil War. In a somber speech on the Senate floor, Missouri Republican Josh Hawley declared that the decision heralded “the end of the conservative legal movement.”

Bostock felt like ancient history on Tuesday morning, when the court heard oral argument in Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. BPJ, two cases about state laws that ban trans women and girls from playing on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. This time, the members of the court’s conservative bloc sounded far more comfortable with imposing some limits on legal protections for trans people. In an exchange with West Virginia Solicitor General Michael Williams, Roberts sought to distinguish these cases from Bostock, asserting that a “sex-based classification” about sports eligibility might not “necessarily” implicate transgender status, and thus might not be discriminatory at all. Williams, realizing he was getting good news from a justice whose vote he needed, had the sense to quickly agree.

After Roberts, counting to five gets easy. Last year, in a different case about trans rights, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a concurrence, joined by Alito and Thomas, in which she opined that trans people are probably not a “suspect class” for purposes of equal protection and that trans sports bans are thus likely constitutional. Kavanaugh, another Bostock dissenter, did not join Barrett’s opinion, but his questions at oral argument in Hecox and BPJ suggest that he is willing to give states some flexibility in the name of preserving the sanctity of women’s sports. Even if—and this is a huge if—Gorsuch were to stick to the logic of Bostock, the conservatives still have the votes to allow lawmakers to legislate their trans constituents out of existence.

The shift from the court’s approach in Bostock has less to do with substantive legal issues than with the evolving social and political context in which the justices will decide these cases. Bostock came five years after the court’s landmark decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, in which the justices held that the Constitution protects the right of same-sex couples to marry. Although conservatives mourned that case in the same way that they would mourn Bostock, Obergefell was consistent with established trends in public opinion: A month before the court decided the case, Gallup found that 60 percent of Americans supported marriage equality—an all-time high, and up from just 27 percent two decades earlier.

In the wake of Obergefell, legal protections for trans people seemed, for a moment, as if they might be on the same trajectory. North Carolina’s “bathroom bill,” which Republicans passed in March 2016, was an economic and public relations disaster that cost the state thousands of jobs, billions in investment and tax revenue, and the privilege of hosting the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. In a 2017 survey, about 70 percent of respondents said the country was becoming “more tolerant” of transgender people, and slightly more than 50 percent wanted the government to “do more to support and protect” them. To anyone whose brain was not pickled in right-wing media, Bostock was not some outrageous act of judicial overreach, but a simple, overdue acknowledgment of what most people believed that the law required.

The right responded as it has always responded to threats to its cultural relevance: by redoubling its efforts to incite a moral panic, vilifying trans people as dangerous and anti-woman. Since 2021, state lawmakers have introduced more than 2,500 bills that target trans people, including more than 1,000 just last year. On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump, who during his first term sought to ban trans people from serving in the military, promised more of the same if voters returned him to the White House. Attack ads in swing states contrasted Democratic nominee Kamala Harris as “for they/them” and Trump as “for you.” In October, the month before the election, Fox News aired at least 47 segments about trans athletes, up from six in September—nearly a sevenfold increase.

This steady drumbeat of transphobic agitprop was maybe even more successful than its proponents had hoped. Today fundamental legal protections for trans people—the same protections the conservative-controlled court extended in Bostock—are less popular than they were three years ago, according to Pew Research Center data from February 2024. This is true among not only Republican voters but also Democrats looking to apportion blame for Harris’ loss. In the aftermath of the 2024 election, some Democratic politicians publicly argued that the party’s support for trans rights had contributed to its losses at the ballot box. One Democratic member of Congress went so far as to parrot vile anti-trans talking points to the New York Times, explaining that he did not “want to discriminate against anybody” but did not believe that “biological boys should be playing in girls’ sports.”

Back in 2018, YouGov found that 29 percent of Americans thought that society had gone “too far in accepting people who are transgender.” Today that number has increased to 36 percent. Support for explicitly anti-trans policies like bathroom bans, sports bans, and bans on gender-affirming care for young people is stronger than it was as recently as two years ago. Sports bans like those at issue in Hecox and BPJ are especially popular, supported by two-thirds of voters, including 45 percent of Democrats, according to Pew.

The most important predictor of the court’s behavior is its ideological composition. The confirmation of Barrett in late 2020, which cemented the current six-justice conservative supermajority, certainly made outcomes like Bostock less likely. But the court’s apparent willingness to retreat from Bostock in Hecox and BPJ is not just a product of its changing membership. It is also the result of a cynical campaign to dehumanize trans people and to ensure that whenever the court decided that it was ready to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, Americans who might have otherwise been supportive of those rights would be just fine with that result.

Perhaps the most ominous sign for the future of trans rights is that Trump’s 2024 election has emboldened anti-trans activists like never before. Since taking office, the president has issued executive orders that (among many other things) require passports to display the holder’s sex assigned at birth, that pull federal funding from certain providers of gender-affirming care, and that (again) ban trans people from military service. On its shadow docket, the court has backed Trump by rejecting requests to temporarily block some of these orders from taking effect. The result is a vicious cycle of bigotry: anti-trans voices persuading voters to elect anti-trans politicians who pass anti-trans laws blessed by anti-trans judges and celebrated in anti-trans media outlets, which then whip voters into an anti-trans frenzy all over again.

The eventual opinions in Hecox and BPJ will be long on legalese and explain in excruciating detail why, notwithstanding the result in Bostock, the court’s precedent empowers Republican lawmakers to stop trans women and girls from playing women’s and girls’ sports. The better explanation for the decisions will be much simpler: The conservative movement spent years working to prevent anything like Bostock from happening again. The justices are simply delivering the payoff.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2026 is going to be a chance to answer a pretty strange question: What if one of the most powerful and theoretically coveted jobs in the world was actually one that very few wanted to keep?

The job is that of a senator or a member of Congress. NPR is tracking the number of lawmakers who have decided to throw in the towel this year. It’s a record: By last count, we’ve got 11 senators headed for the exit and 47 House members doing the same. Some are running for a different office. Others have gotten sick. Still others, like Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene, have just decided to leave without even finishing out their terms.

Political scientist David Faris has been tracking all this too.

“There’s a sense that you can’t achieve anything in the American Congress right now,” Faris says. “It’s too broken. You have standard retirements compounded by a greater sense of the institution’s dysfunction and weakness vis-à-vis the executive branch.”

The congressional chaos is an opportunity for Democrats that will come mainly in November, when all 435 members of the House and a third of the Senate face their constituents in the 2026 midterms.

One of the things that’s helpful if you’re trying to predict what’s going to happen in these midterms is that we’ve been here before. Meaning: We’ve had a congressional election like this one, in 2018, two years after President Donald Trump was first sworn into office. Back then, Democrats gained 40 seats in the House—enough to retake the lower chamber of Congress. Members like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar were sent to Washington. According to Faris, the conditions leading up to that election were in some ways less favorable to Democrats than they are now.

Things are looking up for the party’s chances of retaking the House, and the Senate is in play in a way it wasn’t a year ago. But, he cautions, it’s all taking place against this backdrop of “very deep and persistent abnormality.”

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Faris about the case for a blue wave, and how to manage expectations for the midterms. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Polling is an interesting and important part of your case for why a blue wave is imaginable in 2026. You look at Democrats’ own internal polling for the past decade or so and see how it matches up with how the election actually went. And you say there’s been a shift. Can you explain that?

David Faris: Sure. In the off-year elections in 2025, which seem like 7,000 years ago but were actually two months ago, Democrats overperformed the public polling across the board in a way that they have never done in the Trump era. [These included the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, Zohran Mamdani in New York, and smaller local contests.] These are races where we didn’t have good public polling but where Democrats clearly blew out the expectations in a pretty significant way.

Even in 2017, when Democrats won these same gubernatorial elections and we were all feeling good in roughly the same way, the candidate in Virginia did beat his polling, but the candidate in New Jersey did not. And you didn’t have a blowout victory in, say, the Virginia House of Delegates in the way that you did in 2025.

So the results just weren’t as definitive.

In 2017 they were pretty much across-the-board good. But what’s different is that Democrats beat their polling here, so there’s some evidence that if the electorate is composed roughly the same way in 2025 and 2026, it might actually be underestimating Democrats.

Right before the holiday break, there were a couple of prominent stories that have been on my mind, and I wanted to talk to you about them. One was in Politico, and the other was in New York magazine. They basically made opposite cases about this whole blue-wave notion. The Politico article looked at the prospects for Democrats to take the House and be competitive in the Senate, and it asserted that those prospects are a far cry from 2018 because a gerrymandered map is a tighter map for Democrats. They could get a lot of votes, but those votes are going to be diluted and it’s possible they won’t translate to seats—or at least not enough seats for what they call a comfortable majority. What do you make of this argument?

I don’t care how comfortable the victory is. It’s like if you’re running for a flight and you just slip in right as the door is closing at the gate, and they’re like, “We’re going to stick you in the back by the toilets.” I don’t care.

A five-seat majority is a five-seat majority. The reality is, if we have the gavel, we can do things that we wouldn’t otherwise be able to do. Politico is not wrong about the obstacles to a truly historic wave happening here. I will note that if you go back to the past few cycles, these predictive analyses about what size margin the parties need to do X, Y, and Z have been very wrong. For example, there was a Brennan Center analysis in 2018 that said something like, “Democrats could win the national popular vote by 7 or 8 points and still not retake the House.” And that turned out not to be true.

One thing Republicans are really worried about right now actually does relate to the results in the Virginia House of Delegates. The way that Democrats were able to flip 13 seats in that chamber was by flipping a bunch of Trumpy districts. If Democrats could win double-digit Trump districts—in places where the president won by 10 points or more—and be competitive in those districts, then none of these gerrymanders are safe.

I mentioned that there were two articles. The other, in New York magazine, basically makes your case: The Democrats don’t need to do much to retake the House. They need to win a handful of seats. What I took away was that even if the party does well this cycle, it may still feel tight in Congress, and so the question becomes: How comfortable with acting aggressively in a tight environment are Democrats? Because, historically, they have not been comfortable in that situation, acting aggressively, right?

I think that this is a bigger problem in 2029 than in 2027. Say we have a new Democratic president with, like, a 10-seat majority in the House and a one-seat minority in the Senate. That’s when I would be worried about this narrative of “Wow, we didn’t do as well as we had hoped” or “This isn’t really that big of a repudiation of Trump, and maybe we better move to the center.” For taking one or both chambers of Congress as the opposition party, I’m not sure that those dynamics are as important for the next couple of years.

Can we look at the math here? If this blue wave is going to happen, Democrats need to flip three seats to claim a majority in the House, and four seats to win control of the Senate. That doesn’t seem like a lot when I say it out loud, but it can be, and I know that in the Senate it’s harder than in the House. Can you explain that a little bit?

The Senate is tricky because it is elected in three classes. Every two years, a third of the Senate is up for reelection.

And sometimes there are more Republican seats, and sometimes there are more Democratic seats, right?

Yes. So it’s an artifact of the map and the partisanship of the states at any given time, how good or bad your Senate map is for you. In 2018, when Republicans gained seats in the U.S. Senate, even in a Democratic-wave year, that was a famously horrific map for Democrats.

It’s not as horrific as 2018, but it’s not great. There’s Maine, where Susan Collins is like a zombie who keeps surviving election after election after election in a pretty blue-leaning state. In 2020 she beat her polls by, like, 9 points to hold that seat. I mean, it was unbelievable.

But it’s where Democrats are focusing. It seems as if there’s some navigability here. Where else are they focusing? Thom Tillis is retiring in North Carolina. Does that seem like a place Democrats are eyeing?

Yeah—every cycle we’re within 2 points of winning North Carolina, and every cycle we lose it by 2 points. But North Carolina was very close in 2024. And Democrats are playing defense in a bunch of Trump-voting states. Michigan and Georgia are probably the most important ones. Those are going to be tough races. And in Minnesota, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith is retiring. If we lose any of those seats, we’re not taking the U.S. Senate. The optimistic case is that we hold those seats.

And then we get some kind of fantasy wish-cast Barbie Dream House candidates.

Yes, and this is the same position we were in in 2024, when we had to hold all the tough races, then we had to get a win in a couple of places where we haven’t won in a long time. And there was a brief moment in the summer of 2024 when it looked as if that might be possible. And then things ended up turning out very badly, including Bob Casey losing his seat in Pennsylvania. It complicates the math for Democrats in the Senate for the next six years, right? That was one of the worst outcomes of the night, in my mind, aside from, of course, that we elected a fascist who’s destroying the country.

Is there anything I’m leaving out here that we need to consider?

I do think that all the pieces of the optimism case tied together—like the big shift among Latino voters—will come into play in a really serious way. And young people. They did not drift right in the same way that the popular imagination says they did. But to the extent that they did, they flipped way back to 2018 levels of support for Democrats.

Gen Z men have never been as far right as people say they are. They’re still far more liberal than their elder counterparts. It’s just that what’s happening is that the young men who are on the right are, like, psychotic. The young men who vote Republican tend to be part of this shitposting internet culture—but the numbers aren’t there for them. Gen Z is still a far more liberal generation than Gen X–ers or boomers. But the people who are on the right are significantly more to the right than we would maybe like them to be.

This conversation feels less like “Get ready for a blue wave” and more “Get ready to feel the pain in some way.” Whether you’re a Democrat, Republican, whatever, pain is coming.

Our whole politics is painful right now. I sometimes feel embarrassed to walk into my political science classrooms. The students that I’m talking to, this is their whole conscious adult life. College freshmen right now were 8 years old when Trump walked down the escalator. And so their whole conscious experience of politics as a sentient, quasi-adult human is this nightmare politics that never ends. People don’t necessarily want to study politics under those conditions, and I can’t blame them.

In April 2010, a state-of-the-art offshore oil rig operated by BP exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. The blast killed 11 and ignited a fireball so large it could be seen from 40 miles away. For nearly three months, Americans watched as BP (formerly British Petroleum) tried desperately to cap the Macondo well 5,000 feet below the surface. More than 134 million gallons of oil blackened the Gulf from Florida to Texas.

The Deepwater Horizon spill remains one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. More than 15 years later, coastal communities in the Gulf are still recovering from the devastation of their economies and ecosystems. But the passage of time naturally dulls the horror for people farther away.

BP and the Trump administration appear to be counting on that. As the world fixates on Venezuela’s oil reserves, industry and regulators are quietly paving the way for reckless projects much closer to U.S. shores.

Indeed, the company responsible for Deepwater Horizon is trying to open its next chapter in the Gulf: a massive new hub for offshore drilling that could give it access to 10 billion barrels of crude oil. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is currently reviewing BP’s proposal for Kaskida, among the first of several planned ultra-deep-water oil projects. Although BOEM sent back BP’s initial proposal in August, the company has since resubmitted what the agency has characterized as minor modifications. BOEM now has until March to issue its decision.

The proposal itself is riddled with red flags, demonstrating that BP has not learned from the worst oil spill in U.S. history. It utterly fails to prove that the project could operate safely under the high temperatures and pressures of ultra-deep-water drilling. Instead, it seems the London-based company is hoping that Donald Trump’s obsession with fossil fuels will push it over the finish line.

I helped document the lessons of the Deepwater Horizon disaster as the lead investigator for the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill commission. President Barack Obama convened our bipartisan group of science, policy, and industry experts a month after the Macondo blowout began—and a good two months before the industry was able to cap it. As millions of gallons of oil were pumping daily into waters owned by the American public, the president gave us a simple but important job: Figure out what happened so that the oil industry, the federal government, and Gulf communities could ensure it would never happen again.

We wrote an entire book to document our technical findings, but it’s easy to sum up our broader observations: In the decades leading up to the disaster, oil companies had been undertaking riskier and riskier projects even as government safety standards grew increasingly outdated. Industry executives were trusting themselves to the point of willful ignorance. Ambition and shareholder pressure created a culture of complacency in which oil and gas executives convinced themselves that they could do no wrong, despite incidents that should have warned them otherwise.

Executives at BP and every other oil company all told me they never thought that something like the Deepwater blowout could happen. With billions of dollars at stake, they just couldn’t overcome the temptation to drink their own Kool-Aid.

Protecting people, private property, and our public lands from this kind of industry complacency is supposed to be the job of expert, nonpartisan regulators. But in the years leading up to Deepwater Horizon, fossil-friendly politicians of both parties had steadily starved regulatory agencies of resources, authority, and independence.

Scientists and engineers who were supposed to supervise the industry got captured by it instead. They knew that risks were increasing as the wells were getting deeper and more dangerous, but they trusted the oil companies’ assurances. Our report found that by the time of the Deepwater Horizon calamity, federal regulators had been routinely rubber-stamping new ventures into deep water.

The underwater volcano of oil from the Macondo well blew apart BP’s complacency—for a time. The company was forced to reckon with the reality that no one knew how to stop a blowout from a well as big and as deep as Macondo. BP’s drilling proposal for the well should have provided a viable plan for a worst-case scenario, but it didn’t. And overwhelmed and underresourced regulators didn’t respond to that gigantic red flag.

We had a major opportunity to learn from Deepwater Horizon. But other industry players distanced themselves from BP rather than internalize the lessons. When I talked to them, they appeared to be in denial. While I wasn’t entirely shocked when BP executives told me that they never thought a blowout like Macondo could happen on one of their projects, I was stunned when other industry execs insisted that it would not have happened on any of their projects.

None of them recognized that their company’s hubris was just one instance of an industrywide culture of complacency.

The public should expect our government to address this complacency through expert oversight. But 15 years on, and despite the dedicated advocacy of the bipartisan Deepwater Horizon commission and others, Congress has done nothing to address the budgetary and structural problems that plague the agencies tasked with providing it. Congress hasn’t touched the liability limits that enable the industry to gamble with public health. The Department of the Interior did issue modest improvements to drilling regulations in 2016, but it rolled them back during the first Trump administration in what the American Petroleum Institute hailed as a “modernization” effort.

The second Trump administration has been even friendlier to industry. Executive orders have reversed a number of Biden-era offshore restrictions to fast-track permitting and weaken technical requirements (e.g., adjusting various technical constraints to allow drilling under higher pressures and enable more output). The Elon Musk–led DOGE project also shuttered regional offices and fired regulators.

The administration’s quest to accelerate drilling with inadequate regulations and fewer regulators is a recipe for disaster that leaves the industry largely to its own devices. And judging by its half-baked proposals, BP has either forgotten the lessons of what it termed a “catastrophe” or decided that catastrophe is an acceptable risk. After all, the company’s shareholders can still count on the American taxpayer and the communities of the Gulf to bear most of the costs of a spill, just as they did last time.

The proposed Kaskida project is even riskier than Macondo was. It is over 1,000 feet deeper, and drilling overall is becoming more challenging as ever-stronger storms rip across a heating Gulf with ever-increasing regularity. Yet BP’s proposal reveals that the company is not meaningfully better prepared to cap a deep-water well than it was 15 years ago. It took 87 days to cap Deepwater Horizon; according to the BP proposal, it would take 90 to 100 days to stop a spill from Kaskida.

Members of Congress have found even that dismal figure optimistic, concluding that the company underestimates the magnitude of a worst-case scenario at Kaskida by using a questionable methodology. In a scathing letter to BOEM in August, lawmakers urged Acting Director Matthew Giacona to reject the project. They correctly noted that BP’s proposal “fails to meet basic regulatory standards,” including neglecting to show that the company possesses the necessary equipment to contain a high-pressure spill. Under the law, the fact that BP hasn’t met current regulatory standards should be sufficient to deny the application.

Yet it seems that federal agencies have gone from merely failing to regulate the oil industry to actively advocating for it. The first Trump administration saw oil companies as its “partners.” The second Trump administration treats them as its “customers.”

Fossil-fuel giants have, of course, exploited the White House’s “customer service” stance to demand accelerated approval of new oil and gas pipelines and export terminals. They’re scrambling to secure long-term leases to some of the more than 1 billion acres of our public waters that the administration is offering up for drilling. They aim to lock in lengthy property rights and economic advantages that will insulate them from the reality of the inevitable clean-energy transition. That includes a new era of ultra-deep and high-risk drilling in the Gulf.

Kaskida is very much part of this pattern. And it’s just the beginning: BP has already submitted an additional production proposal for another ultra-deep-water project called Tiber, and companies like Chevron and Beacon Offshore Energy have proposed a slew of multibillion-dollar ultra-deep-water projects in the Gulf.

Even as the administration is bending over backward to green-light risky offshore oil projects, it is doing all it can to stop renewable-energy projects that create jobs and deliver gigawatts with far less pollution and climate impact. If BP were proposing to build wind towers instead of drill wells at Kaskida, it wouldn’t have a chance.

The Trump administration and BP are trying to carry on as if nothing has changed since Deepwater Horizon. In some ways, they’re right. The regulations still are not strong enough, the companies aren’t any wiser, and there’s even more oil money in politics.

But some things have changed. Renewable energy has become cheaper and increasingly more reliable than fossil energy, and it is getting more so every day. At the same time, the risks of fossil-fuel extraction are a lot less hypothetical. Every American adult can summon up searing images from the Deepwater Horizon spill.

We know that the oil industry has not operated in good faith, that our regulators aren’t protecting us, and that the American public, particularly Gulf communities, will bear the costs of the next disaster. If we witness another Deepwater Horizon, no one will be in a position to plead ignorance.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s campaign to punish Sen. Mark Kelly—a retired Navy captain—for urging members of the armed forces to disobey unlawful orders, is even more outlandish, and legally baseless, than it seems at first glance.

This past November, in a 90-second video addressed to service members, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers who had served in the military or in intelligence agencies stated that the Constitution was under threat from abroad and here at home, and that “our laws are clear—you can refuse illegal orders. … You must refuse illegal orders.”

The video failed to mention President Donald Trump’s name or any of his policies, but in the wake of military actions and threats he was making at the time, especially toward Venezuela, the message was clear.

In response, Trump denounced the video as “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS … punishable by DEATH!” He added, a bit later, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!”

Hegseth characteristically chimed in with his own denunciations and, last week, issued a formal letter of censure, which could lead to a demotion of Kelly’s rank, reducing his benefits. Kelly could even be recalled to active duty, then court-martialed, an act that would remove his military status entirely and even land the senator in prison.

On Monday, Kelly filed a lawsuit against Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, the Department of Defense, and the Department of the Navy, claiming that they were trying to deny his constitutional rights and requesting a federal judge to block them from carrying out their threats.

Kelly’s case seems to be a slam dunk. Even if the judge allows Hegseth and Phelan to pursue their censure, it is extremely unlikely—though I hesitate to say impossible, because nothing is impossible with this administration—that the senator’s persecutors will succeed.

First, and most obviously, the notion that Kelly and his colleagues committed sedition, treason, or any sort of crime with their video is preposterous. They were not encouraging service members to defy specific orders—only reminding them that they are obligated not to follow unlawful orders. In this, the lawmakers were merely reciting the clear language of military law.

Second, even if this were seditious (or even if Kelly had made some truly treasonous remark), retired officers cannot be demoted for things they say or do after they retire. “The statutes on this are absolutely clear,” Eugene Fidell, a senior scholar specializing in military law at Yale Law School, told me on Tuesday. (Retired officers can be demoted for things they had said or done on active duty, but no one is even pretending that Kelly’s record as a Navy pilot was anything but salutary.)

Third, retired officers can be court-martialed for sedition. If found guilty, they could be stripped of all military rank or even imprisoned. However, a court-martial would require a trial in a military court, with the prosecutors presenting evidence of criminality. Even Hegseth must realize that the more hard-line military court would likely dismiss a case based on a video in which Kelly recites a fundamental plank of military law.

Could Hegseth just go ahead and sign an order demoting Kelly and docking his retirement pay? Actually, no. According to Fidell, the secretary of defense has the authority to demote only flag officers—that is, generals and admirals. Kelly’s rank of captain, the highest of the U.S. Navy’s senior officers, is one notch below rear admiral, the lowest-ranking flag officer.

However, Phelan, the secretary of the Navy, could sign such an order. If he did, Fidell told me, Kelly could sue him in federal claims court—and very likely succeed at getting his pay restored and making the Pentagon’s civilian leaders look appallingly petty. The consequences could be deeply demoralizing, within the Pentagon and at U.S. military bases (not that this possibility has deterred Hegseth from his antics so far).

Kelly sees what’s really going on here. In a statement released while filing his lawsuit, Kelly said that Hegseth’s “unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: If you speak out and say something that the president or secretary of defense doesn’t like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted.” He added, “That’s not the way things work in the United States of America, and I won’t stand for it.”

Actually, this does seem to be the way things work in the United States of America now. I know of a few officers who are hesitant to speak out against Trump or his policies precisely because they fear retribution—and lack the access to resources, high profile, and legal protections that Kelly enjoys as a member of Congress. There is also a disposition among many officers, bred in them from their days as cadets, to steer clear of political activity, even if it’s meant to protest the politicization of the military.

Still, there are rumblings of change. Kelly’s suit is one. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s video pushback against the Trump Justice Department’s criminal investigation is another. The votes of a few (remarkably few, but still a few) Republican lawmakers—voicing new dissent against Trump’s war-making powers in Venezuela, his imperial threats against Greenland, and even his desire to kill Obamacare—may be more wavelets in a turning tide.

Meanwhile, the crusade against Captain Kelly seems doomed to a proper flameout.

            <h2>Ignore rosy datacenter expansion projections – there isn't enough power</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/datacenter_expansion_power_limit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A looming shortage of electrical power is set to constrain datacenter expansion, potentially leaving many industry growth forecasts looking overly optimistic.

In its latest report, &quot;Five Predictions for 2026,&quot; Uptime Institute says that power will become the defining constraint on datacenter growth in 2026 and beyond.

This is because it simply isn&#39;t possible to add extra grid and generating capacity at the same rate as new server farms are popping up, so something is going to have to give.

The AI-driven infrastructure boom can be traced back to the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022. But even before that, a shortage of available power saw moratoriums slapped on new datacenter builds in Amsterdam, Dublin, and Singapore, as well as delays to projects elsewhere.

Since then, the rate at which new capacity is added has effectively doubled, with Uptime estimating that the total global datacenter power load associated with AI will hit 10 GW by the end of 2026.

Part of the problem is that some of the planned AI facilities are enormous, but these can likely still be built in about three years, while a large solar farm takes about five years, a wind farm or gas turbine generator site around six, and nuclear power plants at least a decade.

When average datacenter sizes were smaller, pockets of spare grid capacity could be found to serve them, Uptime says. But today, projects are being measured in hundreds of megawatts, and even gigawatt facilities are planned. Sourcing this amount of power in the timescales needed is a challenge in almost any location.

The first wave of large campuses opted for one of two strategies to secure large amounts of power at short notice, the report states – on-site gas turbines or to repurpose power formerly used by cryptocurrency miners.

But high demand means that buyers are now facing shortages of gas turbine generator equipment, with a three to four-year waiting list, and prices have doubled in some markets.

Meanwhile, the supply of available sites formerly occupied by cryptocurrency mining operations in places where power is (or was) plentiful and cheap, is running out.

Uptime spells out the bottom line bluntly: &quot;It is unclear how the industry will continue to deliver capacity at the rate that many projections forecast.&quot;

But even if datacenter growth slows, there still remains the problem of their greenhouse gas emissions, and operators will increasingly consider carbon capture and storage (CCS) schemes in future, the report claims.

A projected 75-125 GW growth in server farm power requirements through 2030 will likely have to be met through on-site and grid-based natural gas generation, putting the industry&#39;s aggressive net-zero emission commitments at risk.

These commitments can&#39;t simply be disregarded, as they are enforced by regulations in some regions, or baked into contracts with enterprise customers, which need to account for emissions in their own corporate sustainability reports.

However, Uptime notes that of six carbon capture technologies it identifies, only amine solvent systems are commercially available. These systems use absorption by chemical solvents to remove carbon dioxide from the exhaust gas stream.

There are five others, of which solid sorbent and chilled ammonia systems appear to be the most promising, but these are still in early development and not markedly cheaper or more efficient, the report states.

But storage of captured carbon is a major limiting factor in the adoption of such systems, depending on the availability of an accessible (and permitted) geological formation for this purpose. This could become a significant factor in where datacenters are sited, Uptime states, and will also likely rule out retrofitting CCS systems to most existing generation capacity.

According to the report, Google has already inked a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a gas-fired generator site using CCS in Illinois, while Microsoft has expressed its openness to procuring electricity from such facilities.

One of the main issues facing CCS systems to date has been cost, but Uptime says the economics look better compared with the cost of procuring carbon offsets or energy attribute certificates (EACs), which can range from $10 to $1,000 per metric ton. The cost of electricity from a generator site using CCS will be comparable to or less expensive than buying energy plus offsets, making it competitive with other low-carbon energy options.

Interestingly, Uptime claims that amid all the AI hype, most datacenter operators are &quot;continuing to plan in the face of uncertainty,&quot; rather than executing on clearly AI-driven demand. Meanwhile, the need for general-purpose compute, storage, and connectivity remains strong and is likely to persist regardless of the trajectory of AI applications.

But a segmentation in the industry is emerging. The most demanding AI workloads are driving a distinct class of high-density infrastructure with greater power and cooling requirements. The majority of datacenter capacity, however, continues to support more traditional workloads. This separation may ultimately benefit the industry by clarifying risks, investment priorities, and operational strategies. ®

Hindsight is 20/20, of course, and the roughly five million Small Business Administration COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan applications used to train PRAC&#39;s &quot;Fraud Prevention Engine&quot; were only available after the programs were already up and running, by which point billions of dollars had been paid out and later identified as potentially fraudulent.

Regardless, PRAC executive director Ken Dieffenbach told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee at a Tuesday hearing that it&#39;s time to put those lessons to work to prevent other cases of government fraud, something that the Trump administration and Republican congressional leaders ostensibly care a great deal about.

&quot;The time is now to use this data to prevent fraud schemes before taxpayer dollars are lost and hold wrongdoers accountable,&quot; Dieffenbach told the Committee.

According to the PRAC director, the Fraud Prevention Engine was developed as a proof of concept &quot;to determine if such a model could be developed and to identify and address any technical hurdles.&quot; By Dieffenbach&#39;s account, it appears the project was a success.

The Engine was built with a bunch of modular components, including unsupervised machine learning models used to detect anomalies, supervised ML that identifies patterns consistent with pandemic fraud cases, and rules-based flags that catch invalid Social Security and employer identification numbers. According to Dieffenbach, such small anomalies can often identify hidden connections, like shared bank account numbers among supposedly independent applicants, that suggest fraud.

And it can do it quickly: Dieffenbach said the AI can process 20,000 applications per second.

&quot;We estimate that had our Fraud Prevention Engine been in use in March 2020 it would have quickly … flagged potentially tens of billions of dollars in payments for further scrutiny before the funds were disbursed,&quot; Dieffenbach told the Oversight Committee.

PRAC says it has helped recover just over $500 million so far, a small fraction of the payments Dieffenbach says the Engine could have flagged before disbursement.

In other words, there&#39;s a lot of work to be done, and that&#39;s just on pandemic fraud. Dieffenbach isn&#39;t stopping the Fraud Prevention Engine&#39;s work at PRAC&#39;s COVID loan recovery efforts, though.

Trump&#39;s budget reconciliation bill passed last summer extended PRAC&#39;s mandate to cover fraud detection and prevention in programs funded under the law, pushed the Committee&#39;s end date out to September 30, 2034, and provided $88 million in funding to support its expanded oversight work.

Since then, PRAC has begun working with Inspectors General across multiple agencies to deploy the Fraud Prevention Engine and related analytics in support of oversight of programs funded by the reconciliation law. Dieffenbach said the effort has already helped identify specific programs where PRAC&#39;s data and technology can provide valuable insights.

&quot;We have identified several specific programs where our data and technology can provide valuable insights,&quot; the director said.

Pete Sessions (R-TX), a member of the Oversight Committee, says the Engine needs to find a permanent home before PRAC disbands in eight years.

&quot;A permanent solution that maintains the analytic capacities and capabilities that have been built over the past six years is necessary and needed,&quot; Sessions said. &quot;Its database is billions of records deep and it has begun to pay for itself.&quot;

We reached out to PRAC to learn if it&#39;s been in discussions to find a permanent home for the Engine, but didn&#39;t hear back. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/france_fines_free_free_mobile/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The French data protection regulator, CNIL, today issued a collective €42 million ($48.9 million) fine to two French telecom companies for GDPR violations stemming from a data breach.

Free and Free Mobile are two separate businesses, respectively overseeing fixed-line and mobile services, owned by Iliad Group. The fines relate to an October 2024 breach that led to the data of more than 24 million individuals being compromised, including financial information such as IBANs.

In its judgment, CNIL noted that the attack began on September 28, 2024, and the companies were made aware of the intrusion on October 21 via a message from the attacker responsible. Free ousted the attacker from its systems the following day.

The attackers gained access to Free&#39;s network via the company VPN before connecting to Free Mobile&#39;s subscriber management tool, MOBO. Even though the attacker only gained access to Free Mobile&#39;s application, MOBO, at the time, allowed users to search for the data belonging to customers of both Free and Free Mobile, including their IBANs, provided they were subscribers of services.

A post-mortem of the attack revealed that the attacker began exfiltrating customer records on October 6, 2024, including those related to the total 24,633,469 fixed and mobile contracts. This was broken down into 19,460,891 Free Mobile contacts and 5,172,577 Free contracts.

At the time of the attack, Free Mobile had around 15.5 million subscribers, while Free had approximately 7.6 million. The companies were fined €27 million ($31.4 million) and €15 million ($17.4 million), respectively, based on Iliad&#39;s €10 billion turnover and €367 million profit posted in 2024.

The regulator said that the companies contravened GDPR in three ways: by failing to properly secure personal data, failing to adequately communicate the breach to those affected, and failing to comply with data retention laws.

Announcing the fine, CNIL said: &quot;The restricted panel found that on the day of the data breach, the companies had not implemented certain basic security measures that could have made the attack more difficult.

&quot;In particular, it noted that the authentication procedure for connecting to the VPN of Free Mobile and to that of Free – used especially for remote work by the company&#39;s employees – was not sufficiently robust.

&quot;Furthermore, the measures deployed by Free Mobile and Free to detect abnormal behavior on their information systems were ineffective.&quot;

The nature of the data that was stolen came into consideration when deciding the fine, as did the companies&#39; data retention policies.

CNIL noted that both Free and Free Mobile lacked the necessary capabilities to sort former subscribers&#39; data in a way that retained only the necessary information for accounting purposes.

They also lacked an adequate data-deletion mechanism at the time of the attack, and when it came to notifying their users about the attack, the initial email lacked key details users needed for a comprehensive understanding of its consequences. ®

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has quietly maintained support for an OS that&#39;s nearly 18 years old, but its time has finally passed - the Windows Vista-powered Windows Server 2008 took its last breath this week.

January 13 marked another milestone for legacy systems, as support for the software - codenamed Longhorn Server - expired for customers that bought Microsoft Premium Assurance (PA).

Extended support ended for Windows Server 2008 on January 14, 2020. It was possible to keep the lights on until January 10, 2023, via Extended Security Updates. A fourth year came courtesy of Azure, which took the code to January 9, 2024, but that was it for anyone without PA.

The long-defunct plan was a paid add-on to Software Assurance that kept security updates flowing for 6 years. It was eventually phased out in favor of Extended Security Updates to ease the transition between software versions. However, Microsoft said, &quot;We will honor the terms of Premium Assurance for customers who already purchased it.&quot;

The final patch means an end of support for the Windows Vista codebase, which was released to manufacturing in 2006 and made generally available in 2007. The Vista-derived Windows Server 2008 was released in 2008.

The extinction event was logged on social media, with one person noting the lengthy time in which updates for the Vista codebase kept flowing: &quot;It&#39;s so strange to think that updates for Vista existed for a longer time than updates for XP did, considering the... &#39;small,&#39; difference between their reception and usage.&quot;

In another corner of the Microsoft universe, the US vendor called time on some modems in Windows 10 this week.

The January 13, 2026, Windows 10 patches (for which many users will need Extended Security Updates to access) marked the end of the road for several models, as the company announced that the agrsm64.sys, agrsm.sys, smserl64.sys, and smserial.sys modem drivers were being removed.

&quot;Modem hardware dependent on these specific drivers will no longer work in Windows,&quot; Microsoft said.

This doesn&#39;t mean all modems, but the removal of the likes of agrsm.sys means that hardware using the legacy Agere modem chipset won&#39;t function. The driver family has been noted as a vulnerability, and given its legacy nature, removal makes more sense than hoping for a patch. ®

            <h2>'Imagination the limit': DeadLock ransomware gang using smart contracts to hide their work</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/deadlock_ransomware_smart_contracts/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers at Group-IB say the DeadLock ransomware operation is using blockchain-based anti-detection methods to evade defenders&#39; attempts to analyze their tradecraft.

First spotted in July 2025, the DeadLock group has attacked a wide range of organizations while almost managing to stay under the radar.

It abandons the usual double extortion approach in which cybercrooks steal data, encrypt systems, and threaten to post it online for all to see if the victim refuses to pay a ransom.

For starters, it does not have a data leak site (DLS) where it could publicize attacks. In cases where victims refuse to pay, it cannot lean on reputational damage to push for a fee. Instead, researchers say the group threatens to sell the data on the underground market, a tactic experts have previously said could just be hot air.

But for the researchers at Group-IB, the old-school encryption-only model is not the most notable aspect of the DeadLock operation. Its use of Polygon smart contracts to obscure its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure is an unusual move that&#39;s slowly gaining popularity.

Once a victim&#39;s systems are encrypted, DeadLock drops an HTML file that acts as a wrapper for the decentralized messenger Session. This file replaces an instruction for the victim to download Session to communicate with DeadLock.

By using blockchain-based smart contracts to store the group&#39;s proxy server URL - the one victims connect to before communicating with the criminals - it allows DeadLock to rotate this address frequently, making it difficult for defenders to permanently block its infrastructure.

&quot;This exploit of smart contracts to deliver proxy addresses is an interesting method where attackers can literally apply infinite variants of this technique; imagination is the limit,&quot; said Xabier Eizaguirre, threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, in a write-up shared with The Register.

Eizaguirre also noted that analysts recently observed North Korean state-sponsored attackers using similar techniques.

In October, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) reported North Korean attackers had been using methods it dubbed &quot;EtherHiding&quot; since February 2025.

Attacks involved hiding malware inside smart contracts – an evolution in tradecraft that GTIG threat hunters said represented a new kind of bulletproof hosting.

DeadLock&#39;s use of smart contracts to conceal its infrastructure is what researchers know most about the group at present.

Details such as how it typically gains access to victim networks are not yet known, Group-IB said, although earlier reports from Cisco Talos linked the group to using bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) techniques and exploiting vulnerabilities to kill EDR processes.

The Register asked Group-IB for more information, including about why researchers don&#39;t know much more about how it carries out attacks. ®

            <div id="article-text">The AI-driven datacenter construction frenzy shows no signs of slowing, but neither do concerns that the whole edifice could collapse under the weight of its own hype and mounting investment demands.

Moody&#39;s 2026 Outlook report on the global datacenter market, seen by The Register, forecasts business as usual, with demand for server farm capacity continuing to rise in support of AI, cloud computing, and internet services.

The financial services biz estimates at least $3 trillion in investment is required to keep pace with the projected level of capacity expansion between now and the end of the decade. This covers the cost of buildings, the IT infrastructure, and the power required to keep the lights on.

However, the report flags worries over power grid constraints and construction bottlenecks, warning that demonstrating actual revenue generation will become &quot;increasingly important in the AI ecosystem&quot; to silence growing chatter about an &quot;AI bubble.&quot;

Question marks over sustainability are hardly new. McKinsey & Company warned in May 2025 that huge sums are being invested in AI on demand forecasts amounting to little more than educated guesswork.

MIT researchers claimed 95 percent of enterprise organizations had seen no return from their AI efforts so far, and Moody&#39;s itself says circular deals involving companies like OpenAI and Microsoft are spooking investors.

Capital spending by six hyperscalers in the US – Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Oracle, Meta, and CoreWeave – approached $400 billion in 2025 and is on track to hit $500 billion in 2026, then $600 billion in 2027. A chart in Moody&#39;s report shows total global investment peaking in 2029, before declining in 2030.

New datacenter development faces growing headwinds, primarily access to power in most markets, with utilities and power generators hard pressed to meet unexpected electricity demand surges.

Moody&#39;s also notes that local opposition to new builds has increased in some markets, often due to public concerns about their consumption of electricity and water, plus the impact on utility bills.

However, regions with &quot;supportive laws&quot; will continue to attract development, with some governments tweaking regulatory frameworks to encourage AI datacenters. The UK announced &quot;AI Growth Zones&quot; with streamlined planning processes last year.

As the risks mount, developers are coming under growing pressure from clients to shorten construction schedules so that hyperscale tenants can add new capacity as soon as possible.

But this collides with issues including high demand for skilled labor, building materials, and essential equipment, driving up construction costs.

Some tenants are now willing to shoulder delivery risks they previously avoided, including exempting power and utilities availability from completion requirements, the report claims.

On those circular deals, Moody&#39;s notes that OpenAI has signed sizeable contracts for gigawatts of new datacenter capacity and other assets while attempting to grow its revenue base.

Most financing for these assets relies on long-term leases with hyperscalers like Microsoft or Oracle, but &quot;OpenAI&#39;s growing presence in the AI ecosystem poses a growing credit risk depending on its success,&quot; the report states.

OpenAI suffered a net loss of $11.5 billion or more during the quarter to September 30, 2025, as The Register reported. ®

The upcoming M3 will be BMW’s first proper all-electric M-series sports car. It’s quad motor setup is sure to pack a punch.

BMW teased its forthcoming all-electric M-series performance sedan today, promising that the quad-motor M3 sports car would feature specs that are truly next level when it arrives in 2027.

The M3 will have four electric motors and simulated gear shifting, a feature that is quickly becoming a must-have for electrified sports cars. BMW says the setup unlocks the benefits of both rear and all-wheel drive, with the ability to decouple the front axle.

Four motors, though, is a bit of an outlier in the performance world. Tri-motors, sure, you can find plenty, like Tesla Model S Plaid and Lucid Air Sapphire. But four motors are bit a rarer: the only ones I could think of are the Rivian R1T and R1S Quad, Rimac Nevera, and the electric Mercedes G-Wagen (or G580 with EQ Technology, if you prefer).

The electric M3 will also be built on BMW’s Neue Klasse platform that promises more efficient batteries, lightning fast charging, and higher powered computers. The architecture will be 800-volt, the regenerative braking will be highly efficient, and if the camouflaged pictures are any indication, it will be a real looker on the streets.

Speaking of computers, the M3 will have four of them, unified under its oddly named “Heart of Joy” component that aggregates all the traction, stability, and electric motor management functions of the vehicle. That means when software updates are made available, the vehicle’s brain will be able to receive them over-the-air faster than BMW’s current processors.

The M3’s simulated gear shifting will feature a “newly developed soundscape” that “channels pure emotion.” Like other automakers, BMW is loathe to alienate its loyal M-series customers by giving them all the torque but none of the gearing feedback. And now a fake “soundscape” will accompany all that shifting. Porsche, Hyundai, and Dodge are also on board the fake EV gear shifting bandwagon.

BMW has been promising a proper electric M-series for years, after releasing a string of i-series M performance vehicles. The upcoming M3 will be the first to bear the proper M badge, but certainly not the last.

A smart lock is an easy solution to some common problems. Locked yourself out? Need to let a friend in to water the plants? Your latchkey kid lost their key? Hands are full, and it’s raining cats and dogs? A smart lock solves all of these problems and more.

One of the best smart home upgrades you can make, a smart lock gives you remote control access to your house from anywhere, plus easy, key-free ways to unlock and lock your door. Smart locks also remember everything that happened, so they can tell you when your door was unlocked, and sometimes who did it.

For most people, control and convenience are big enough selling points. However, smart locks also work nicely with other smart home devices, including video doorbells and smart lighting. My favorite way to integrate locks in my home is with an evening smart home routine, which locks the doors, dims the lights, and sets my thermostat to sleep mode. We have four exterior doors, so it saves me from walking around the house at night checking everything is secure.

Having a connected lock on your door is as secure as a standard lock, and sometimes more. Most smart locks have the same security ratings as their non-smart counterparts (see FAQ for more details), and it’s harder to physically pick a lock without a keyway. Plus, any smart lock is more secure than leaving a spare key under a flowerpot.

I’ve been testing smart door locks for six years and have installed more than 30 for this guide alone. Here are my top picks for your front door. Whether you want the best of the best, don’t want to replace your existing lock, are on a budget, or want a smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock, there are great options for every need.

I install each lock on one of four exterior doors and use it daily for at least a week. I evaluate the ease of installation and setup, including adding codes and registering biometrics such as fingerprints, faces, or palms. I connect the locks to various smart home platforms and test integrations through automations and routines.I assess all control methods offered — physical keys, codes, biometrics, Home Key, and auto-lock/unlock — checking for speed and reliability. I test remote features like app control, code sharing, and platform integrations.Design, aesthetics, and how the lock pairs with devices like video doorbells are also considered. I test accessories like external keypads and any unique features offered. For battery life, I estimate the duration based on performance during my testing window and conduct long-term testing on top picks.

A good smart lock should have at least three ways to unlock in case one method fails. My favorites are fingerprint and keypad since they don’t require you to carry anything with you, but other options include phone apps, auto-unlock via geofencing, voice control from your phone or watch, physical keys, NFC fobs, and Apple Home Key. Home Key is awesome, but you have to have an iPhone or Apple Watch — for now. Every smart lock in this list also has the option to auto-lock after a set time. This means you don’t have to remember to physically lock your door.

A key feature of a smart lock is the ability to control your lock when you’re away from home, either remotely using the app or by sending a code to someone so they can manually unlock it. My preferred option is remote control, as sometimes it’s just easier to unlock the door for someone and then lock it when they leave, even if you’re 2,000 miles away.

Smart locks broadly use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and/or Thread to allow you to control them from an app. My least favorite option is a Bluetooth lock that uses a dedicated bridge to connect to Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is power-hungry and drains batteries fast, so some door locks use a bridge as an intermediary. This is fiddly and annoying (especially if someone unplugs it accidentally). I prefer locks with built-in Wi-Fi or those that can connect to a multi-purpose hub or bridge, such as an Apple Home Hub or an Echo smart speaker. Locks that connect over Thread are starting to become more popular; they require a Thread border router, but offer longer battery life and out-of-home control.

Most Wi-Fi smart locks have a battery life of under six months, which is a pain. Those that use Bluetooth last longer, but need that extra hub or bridge for out-of-home control. Thread is a new connectivity option that promises longer battery life but also requires a second device (a Thread border router). (See the FAQ for more on this.)

The lock should have the option to assign “virtual keys” or unique codes to other household members, service people, or a neighbor looking in on your dog. These should be easily revoked or assigned only for specific times. The app should also have a log/alerts that let you know who accessed your door and when.

A good smart lock should be compatible with at least some of the major platforms, so you can schedule the lock, set up home automation routines, and use features like tapping your phone to your door to unlock it. New standards like Matter and Aliro are working to bring universal compatibility between smart locks, smartphones, and smart home platforms. (See the FAQ for more on this.)

The Kwikset Halo Select is a good-looking, reliable smart lock with top-notch security ratings, broad smart home compatibility, and the best auto-unlock function I’ve tested to date.

I strongly believe a smart lock should look good on your door, and the Halo Select does exactly that, plus it can blend in with both traditional and contemporary door sets. (But I could do without the prominent Kwikset branding.)

Of the four entry methods — a keyway (which is re-keyable), a touchscreen keypad, app/smart home control, and auto-unlock by location — I liked the last one the best. It worked so well that I didn’t mind that it lacks a fingerprint reader or Apple Home Key.

My experience with automatic unlocking on other locks (which uses a combination of Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi to determine your location) has been generally frustrating, but on the Halo Select, it’s been flawless. It unlocks just as I approach my porch, making coming home and opening the door a virtually hands-free experience.

The Select can also auto-lock based on your location, not just after a set amount of time, as most locks offer. I also like the Halo Select’s LED lock indicator on the touchscreen, which tells you at a glance if the door is locked or unlocked.

The Halo Select has built-in Wi-Fi and a Thread radio, but you have to pick one.

If you set it up with Wi-Fi, you can use the Kwikset app and connect to Amazon Alexa and Google via the cloud. With Matter, you can connect to those platforms locally and also to Apple Home and others, but you won’t be able to use the Kwikset app after setup, so you lose the auto-unlock feature, among others.

Kwikset’s auto-unlock feature worked flawlessly in testing

Matter-over-Thread does promise better battery life — and long-term testing bears this out — as well as the ability to easily share the lock with other ecosystems. I set it up in Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings via Matter with no issues and could control it with all three via routines, automations, and voice commands.

It’s a shame to have to choose between using Matter and some of this lock’s best features, but this is a problem across Matter, not specific to Kwikset. Kwikset’s solution allows you to use its advanced features today while still having the future-proofing potential of Matter for tomorrow.

Kwikset recently launched the Halo Select Plus, which we’re currently testing. This adds Apple Home Key support, but at $329, you’re paying a lot more for this one added function. Other recent updates include new finishes for the Halo Select line.

Inexpensive Good fingerprint readerOffline access codesLong battery life

No Wi-Fi No smart home supportLarge rear housing

Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0 / Access options: Fingerprint, keypad, app / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: One year / Security Grade: ANSI/BHMA Grade 3 / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: N/A

The Wyze Lock Bolt is a good choice if you want something inexpensive and useful and don’t care about smart home integration — or prefer a lock without it. It’s not sleek or stylish; it’s just a big hunk of black plastic (there’s also a satin nickel version). Out of the box, it doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems, but it does have an easy-to-use backlit keypad and a lightning-fast fingerprint reader. It’ll auto-lock if you want, and it’s half the price of most smart locks in this list.

In addition to the fingerprint reader and keypad, the Wyze Lock Bolt can be controlled over Bluetooth, and its range is very good. I could lock the door from my bedroom at the other end of the house using the Wyze app. That’s important, as there’s no way to lock the door on a schedule (although you can enable auto-lock).

The Wyze doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems

The Bolt doesn’t integrate with smart home platforms, but if you don’t need to control your lock with your voice or plan to add it to any smart home routines, you won’t miss those features. It also delivers up to a year of battery life on four AAs — I tested it for three months and it only lost 15 percent.

But without Wi-Fi, I couldn’t check on it or control it when I was away from home, so turning on the auto-lock option is a must. If I wanted to let someone in while I was gone, I couldn’t unlock the door remotely, but I could generate an offline code in the Wyze app and share that. This uses similar technology to two-factor authentication codes and worked perfectly in my testing.

Since I tested the lock, Wyze has introduced an integration with its Wyze Video Doorbell Pro that lets you unlock the Bolt remotely when paired with the doorbell — but it doesn’t let you lock it remotely, which is odd. Of course, if you enable auto-lock, this is less of an issue.

Lightning fastNice, compact designSimple to installSupports Wi-Fi and Matter over ThreadNo account requiredBroad smart home compatibility

No Apple Home KeyProprietary charging cableNo door sensor included

Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Matter-over-Thread / Access options: Key, app, voice, fingerprint and keypad (sold separately) / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Non-removable, rechargeable / Battery life: Up to 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings

The Nuki Smart Lock is the most advanced retrofit smart lock we’ve tested, and a worthy replacement for our previous pick, the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock. It features a compact design and lightning-fast locking — even quicker than manually turning the lock — and it works over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Matter over Thread, the latter of which enables out-of-home control and notifications through any Matter-compatible smart home platform.

Whereas most smart locks feature a big, bulky design, the Nuki Smart Lock boasts a minimalist style with a premium look and feel. Installation is straightforward — simply remove the thumbturn from your existing deadbolt, replace it with a blackplate, and snap the Nuki into place. Once it’s installed, you can get up and running without signing up for an account, which is a rare feature for a smart lock.

The Nuki app gives you access to multiple settings and customization options. In addition to standard features like key sharing with family members and enabling auto-lock and auto-unlock, it supports schedules, an activity log, and a convenient Night Mode, which can lock the door at a set time, disable auto-unlock, and enable auto-lock.

If you don’t have a Matter hub and a Thread border router — like a HomePod — Nuki’s Premium service provides remote access, lock activity notifications, and integration with rental platforms like Airbnb. Nuki Premium was previously offered as a monthly subscription, but as of December 3rd, 2025, the cost is now folded into the purchase of each lock. That means the Nuki Smart Lock is now more expensive up front at $199 (up from $159); however, the good news is that premium features are no longer behind a paywall. Those who already have Nuki Premium will also be able to continue using the premium features for the lifetime of the product without an added fee.

Additionally, Nuki offers an optional keypad, which supports both PIN codes and fingerprints, making it easy for friends, family, and guests to gain access without needing to download an app. Although the fingerprint reader works well, there is no backlight, making nighttime use tricky without a porch light. The current keypad doesn’t support Apple Home Key, though Nuki is planning to release one with ultra-wideband unlocking (UWB) and NFC support.

Nuki’s smart lock has a built-in battery that can last for months, and it only takes a few hours to fully recharge. While a non-removable battery raises concerns about longevity — smart locks generally use AA batteries — Nuki claims it should last 10 years. After that, the company says a replacement plan will be offered.

Easy installOption of fingerprint keypadA year of battery life

Requires Wi-Fi bridgeKeypad is big and uglyNo support for Matter

Connectivity: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (with plug-in module) / Access options: Key, app, voice, keypad and fingerprint reader sold separately / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA alkaline batteries / Battery life: 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings

Starting at $130, the Yale Approach is a more affordable retrofit lock with no monthly subscription. It’s super easy to install, looks nice, and has a good list of features — auto-lock, auto-unlock, app and voice control. Add the Bluetooth keypad to get one-touch locking, key code, and fingerprint access.

The Approach replaces your thumb turn, so you can still use your current lock and key — making it a great option if you are renting and don’t want to annoy your landlord. It has a nice, slim profile and blends in better than the rear housing of most smart locks.

The lock comes in black or silver and took me less than five minutes to install. It uses four AA batteries and promises 12 months of battery life. This is because there is no built-in Wi-Fi; instead, it uses an included plug-in bridge.

The bridge adds out-of-home control and connection to smart home platforms, including Alexa and Google Home, but there’s no Apple Home support). This allows for voice control and adding it to smart home routines. Yale told me there’s an onboard Thread radio that will be activated to support Matter, but didn’t say when this would arrive.

The optional Bluetooth keypad lets you control the lock from the outside without using an app or key, and it worked promptly and reliably. There’s the option of a fingerprint version, and that was similarly a good experience — just touch and open. The keypad also allows you to lock the door when you leave by pressing the Yale logo button.

The keys are a bit sensitive; I frequently get double inputs when pressing. But I liked the LED indicator that notifies you with green if your code was accepted or red if there’s an issue. This made it easy to know if the input worked, as the lock is very quiet — it’s hard to hear it locking or unlocking.

My biggest disappointment is the look of the keypad. It’s big, wide, and black, with prominent white numbers that don’t disappear when not in use — it looks a bit like a toy keypad on your door.

The Yale Assure 2 line — previously my top pick — has something for everyone. There’s an option with or without a keyway, with a touchscreen keypad or a physical keypad, or with Apple Home Key, but my favorite model is the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with a built-in fingerprint reader. It costs $279.99, and the built-in fingerprint reader is fast and efficient. I tested the touchscreen version, but Yale recently released a keypad version. Unless you really value the clean look of the touchscreen (which is blank when off), go with the keypad — it’s much easier to use.

The Yale Assure 2 is a good-looking lock that works with every smart home platform with its swappable modules. Its slimline design (both front and back), wide smart home compatibility, easy-to-use app, and good selection of unlocking options — including fingerprint unlock — make it a great option for your front door.

The lock supports Bluetooth out of the box and works with the Yale Access app and Apple Home app (which adds remote unlocking if you have an Apple Home hub). Along with a keycode, fingerprint reader, or key, you can also choose to use auto-unlocking. Auto-unlock is a decent alternative to fingerprint unlock, but I found I often had to wait at the door for a second or two before it worked. Still, it’s faster than fumbling through a purse for keys when your hands are full.

Support for other platforms and remote unlocking comes through Yale’s ingenious swappable networking modules, which cost around $80 each. There’s a Wi-Fi module to add Alexa and Google Home integration and a Z-Wave module for compatibility with (some) SmartThings hubs, Ring Alarm, and other Z-Wave hubs. Yale promised support for Matter via a Matter-over-Thread module back in 2022, but this still hasn’t materialized. They have announced a different lock that uses Thread, but it doesn’t have a fingerprint reader. I plan to test this soon.

I tested the Wi-Fi module in the Assure 2 Touch, which worked well with Amazon Alexa and Google Home. It allowed me to add the lock to Alexa Routines, lock and unlock it with my voice, and control it away from home. The downside is that control over Wi-Fi is considerably slower than over Bluetooth and drains the battery more quickly. Yale estimates up to a year on Bluetooth only, compared to six months over Wi-Fi; I got about four months.

Support for Apple Home and Home KeyWorks over ThreadEasy-to-use keypadNice design options that may match your hardware

Connectivity: Wi-Fi or Thread / Access options: Key, keypad, app, voice, Apple Home Key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Up to six months / Security Grade: ANSI Grade 1 / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Apple Home Key, Amazon Alexa, Ring, and Google Home

Apple Home Key lets you use your iPhone or Apple Watch to tap to unlock your door in much the same way as you tap to pay. It uses an NFC chip in the lock, and is fast, efficient, and secure. There are no apps to open, no buttons to press, and no need to unlock your phone (although you can add that step as an extra security layer). However, it does require an Apple device; it won’t work on Android.

Home Key took a while to gain adoption, but there are now several options (and should soon be more as Apple has made it part of Matter). The Schlage Encode Plus is still the best option — if one of the most expensive — as it has a built-in keypad and works over Thread.

The keypad is useful for giving access to people with whom you can’t share a Home Key (sharing is quite limited), and Thread makes for a rock-solid connection. While it won’t be updated to support Matter, the Thread radio adds better battery life and a more stable connection to Apple Home than Bluetooth. I have had numerous connectivity issues in HomeKit with Bluetooth-only locks.

To use Home Key, you need to have an Apple Home Hub, such as an Apple TV or HomePod. Adding the lock to the Home app automatically adds the Home Key card to your Wallet, as well as that of anyone else you have added to your Apple Home. That’s much easier than getting household members to download a whole new app for the door lock. I should know — I try regularly.

To allow someone not in your household to control the lock, you’ll have to give them a standard PIN, which you can do in the Apple Home app or the Schlage Encode app. If you like, you can set this lock up entirely in the Home app and never have to use the manufacturer’s app.

If you don’t want a smart lock that looks like a smart lock, there’s the Level Lock Pro. It doesn’t feature a chunky battery box or prominent branding, yet it packs a ton of technology inside the footprint of a traditional lock. The newer model features an upgraded processor, Matter-over-Thread support, a passive infrared sensor for presence detection, and a built-in door sensor to tell you if the door is open or closed, not just locked. It also comes in one of two discreet finishes, matte black or nickel, and offers up to a year of battery life with a single CR2.

In terms of execution, the faster dual-core Bluetooth/Thread chip delivers more reliable performance than earlier models — including our former pick, the Level Lock Plus — and the lock offers support for multiple access options. You can unlock the Lock Pro with a regular key, Apple Home Key, the Level app, voice control, auto-unlock, or a touch-to-unlock mode. We found the auto-unlock feature to be finicky at times, though, and the installation can be a headache on older doors. It’s also pricey, starting at $349 (plus an optional $79 Wi-Fi bridge).

That said, if you want a lock that offers premium features and a sleek design, the Lock Pro feels like the brand’s most fully realized vision of what a minimalist smart lock should be.

The Aqara U300 is a lever-style smart lock; it replaces a knob or lever lock on a door with a single borehole rather than a door with a deadbolt lock with two holes. This type of lock is traditionally found on interior doors, pedestrian doors into garages, or side doors.

There are options for smart lever locks from Yale, Schlage, and Lockly, but the U300 is the only one with Home Key compatibility and a built-in fingerprint reader. It also works over Thread and supports Matter.

I installed it on my garage door, and it works like a charm. The fingerprint reader is right where you put your thumb to open the door, so I barely notice it unlocking as I walk in. It also has a keypad, and I can use my iPhone or Apple Watch for Home Key. It’s set to auto-lock by default, but you can enable passage mode directly on the lock if you don’t want it to stay locked all the time.

It paired to Matter easily — I set it up in Apple Home and could add a code and Home Key all without even opening the Aqara app. Because it uses Thread, there’s no need for an Aqara hub. Thread also enables up to 10 months of battery life, according to Aqara.

I love the idea of using smart locks on other doors in my home. I could see this working on a basement door, a home office, or any other room you like to keep people out of. However, I would like to see a way to permanently enable passage mode. Currently, you have to do it on the device, and it reverts to auto-lock after an undetermined period. This makes it somewhat useless for interior doors. It’s also very large and only comes in black or silver, so it likely wouldn’t blend in with your interior decor. A slimmer option, in more colorways, designed for inside use would be nice to see.

The U300 is expensive at $230, but it’s similar to other outdoor-rated options (it’s IPX4-rated). The addition of Thread — a protocol that works over a mesh network — makes it easier to extend connectivity further to places like a shed or garage.

Very expensiveNighttime video is not greatNo package detectionHomeBase required for most smart alerts

Connectivity: Wi-Fi or Eufy HomeBase / Access options: Key, palm unlock, keypad, app, voice / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, AAA backup / Battery life: Five months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade 1 / Works with: Matter (including Apple Home), Amazon Alexa, and Google Home

Eufy’s new FamiLock S3 Max combines a smart lock and video doorbell in one device and features a digital peephole and a wave-to-unlock function. It also has a keyway and keypad and supports Matter-over-Wi-Fi, so it can work with all the major smart home platforms.

My favorite of all these features is the video screen on the inside part of the lock, which shows a live feed of who is on the other side of the door. If you have a peephole or a window in your door, this might not be much use — and you can opt to get the lock without the screen for $50 less. But as a quick way to confirm who is at your door before opening it, it’s super handy.

The lock has another fairly unique feature: palm vein recognition technology. This lets you wave your hand over it to unlock it, and is an alternative form of biometric access to the popular fingerprint reader.

Palm unlocking isn’t any faster or easier than using your fingerprint, though, and I found it harder to get used to. But once I got the hang of it, it worked reliably. Both my kids also picked it up quickly, and my husband, who has trouble with fingerprint locks in general, really liked it.

The main reason to buy this lock is for the video doorbell feature. The FamiLock’s 2K camera provides clear, crisp video during daylight hours and decent night vision, although my protruding door frame reflected the LEDs, causing the footage to blow out a bit.

The 180-degree diagonal field of view meant I could see top to bottom and all of one side (not the other side, though, due to the aforementioned door frame). But packages and people were clearly visible, which is most of what you want to see with a doorbell camera.

There’s no fee for viewing recorded footage of visitors in the Eufy app, and videos are stored locally on the device. Live view and recording pulled up promptly in the app, and the doorbell can alert you when it sees a person. For more advanced smart alerts, including facial recognition, you need to connect it to a Eufy HomeBase.

Bear in mind, Matter integration only controls the lock, as cameras aren’t supported by the standard yet, so the benefits of using Matter are fairly limited. (If you’re looking for a biometric Matter lock, Eufy’s E30 is a good fingerprint lock that uses Matter-over-Thread.)

Adding a video doorbell to a smart lock puts a lot of strain on the battery. While you can adjust several settings to help save power, Eufy says you’ll only get about five months of battery life from the lock’s giant 15,000mAh removable battery. Handily, four AAA backup batteries are tucked into the top to keep it functioning while you’re recharging the battery (which takes a while). I’ve been testing it for over a week, and the battery indicator hasn’t budged yet.

At $400, this is a very expensive lock, but it works well and provides dual functionality of a doorbell and door lock.

I was very impressed with the Lockly Visage. The first facial recognition residential smart lock on the market, it also features a fingerprint reader, a keypad, a keyway, and Apple Home Key — that’s a lot of high-tech ways to unlock your door. And while it’s probably too much lock for most people, if you are a super smart home user or a major gadget nerd, you’ll love this lock.

I was skeptical about the facial unlocking at first, but it worked really well, opening a second or two before I put my hand on the handle. The only caveat is that I had to be approaching face-on, which in most cases I was, but the couple of times I approached from a slightly odd angle, it failed to unlock. In those cases, though, I had the option of using my fingerprint or Home Key.

There’s also a touchscreen keypad, which is mainly useful for handing out codes to guests and visitors whose faces and fingers you don’t want to scan into your lock. The keypad is probably my least favorite part of the lock; it’s very small, which is good for the overall look, but fiddly to access. It’s also hard to see in bright light. But with all the other ways to unlock, this isn’t a deal-breaker.

Note that the Visage doesn’t take video or still images; its infrared camera is only used for facial recognition, data for which is stored on the device. Lockly does have a video doorbell version for $429, though that doesn’t have facial recognition.

Surprisingly, despite all the tech packed into it, the lock is compact and stylish-looking and works with the redesigned Lockly Home app, which is now more straightforward and easier to use. The lock works over Wi-Fi and supports Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa, but there’s no support for Matter.

Lockly claims eight months of battery life with its included rechargeable 10,000mAh battery. Uniquely, it comes with two batteries, so you can swap one and keep the lock online while charging the other.

At $350, the Lockly Visage is very expensive, but considering the tech packed into this lock, plus the two batteries, it’s not outrageous. Its solid build, broad smart home compatibility, and multiple very cool ways to control it make this a great lock.

Concerns about someone hacking your connected door lock are largely unfounded; it’s a lot easier to physically force a deadbolt lock or break a nearby window than it is to hack a smart lock. All residential door locks are rated for physical security by the Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA) standard, accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The deadbolt locks in this guide meet BHMA standards (retrofit locks aren’t rated, as it depends on the deadbolt they’re attached to). There are three levels: 1 is the highest, 3 is the lowest, and 2 is the norm for most residential locks. (You may also see letter grade ratings, a newer system introduced in 2021). Some “meet the standard” but aren’t accredited.

Most deadbolt locks are simple to install, requiring about 30 minutes and a screwdriver. If you have an older door, you may have to make some modifications, but smart locks are designed to be adjusted to suit standard doors.

Smart locks that work over built-in Wi-Fi will last 3 to 6 months. Those that use Bluetooth and have an optional plug-in module to connect to Wi-Fi will go 8 to 12 months. Those that rely just on Thread should last up to a year (I haven’t been able to test one for long enough to know for sure). Remember, if you have a lock that can use Thread and Wi-Fi (like the Schlage Encode Plus), Wi-Fi will drain the batteries quicker than Thread — so avoid activating the Wi-Fi if you can.

Most smart locks without a keyhole have some form of exterior power option to allow you to charge it enough to access the door when you’ve ignored the continuous warnings the app and lock have sent you to tell you the battery is running low. Most use a USB-C port to connect to a portable power bank, but some, like Yale, use a 9-volt battery to provide enough power to bring them back to life.

Auto unlock is a feature on several smart locks that uses a combination of GPS, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi to determine where your phone is in relation to your front door and automatically unlock it for you as you approach. Your smartphone’s GPS determines your location, and Bluetooth then talks to your lock when you’re close enough, telling it to unlock. The lock will switch to away mode when GPS tells it you’ve left a radius around your home, and to back or home mode when you return. You do need to keep the lock manufacturer app open on your phone for this to work (it can run in the background).

Matter is a smart home standard designed to make connected devices more interoperable, reliable, secure, and easier to use. The benefit of a Matter smart lock now is future-proofing. Today, it doesn’t add much that most locks can’t already do (and, in some cases, less). But it means your lock should work with all the big smart home platforms in the future and will work with any Matter-compatible device now, such as smart plugs and smart lights, for home automation routines (for example, to shut off all your lights when you lock your door).A major benefit of a Matter lock is that you can share the lock across platforms without downloading additional apps, setting up accounts, or linking services through the cloud. This lets you use the same lock with Apple Home and Google Home, should you want, and you can control it with both voice assistants. The downside is that not all platforms support creating PIN codes for Matter smart locks with keypads (Google Home and Alexa don’t offer this yet). Additionally, Matter doesn’t support voice PIN codes, which platforms like Google Home use to authorize remotely unlocking door locks using smart speakers and smart displays.Matter locks with NFC that work directly with Matter (not through a bridge) can now support Apple Home Key through the Apple Home app (iPhone only).

If a lock uses Matter-over-Wi-Fi or connects through a bridge, you will need a Matter controller from the platform on which you want to use it — a HomePod or Apple TV for Apple Home, a Nest hub or smart speaker for Google Home.If the lock uses Matter-over-Thread, you will need a Matter controller and a Thread border router. These can be the same thing — a HomePod is both, and a Nest Hub Max is both. But the Thread border router doesn’t need to be platform-specific. So, if you have an Apple TV or an Eero Wi-Fi router that supports Thread and a smart speaker from Nest that’s a Matter controller — you could use a Thread lock over Matter in Google Home.

There’s a new standard coming to smart locks called Aliro. This is being developed by Apple, Samsung, and Google, along with major lock and chip manufacturers, to help smart locks integrate more seamlessly with smartphones. It is slated to have two main functions, UWB and NFC unlocking. UWB is a hands-free auto-unlock tech that uses a UWB radio in the lock and your phone to know when you’re approaching the door and automatically unlock it. NFC lets you tap your phone or watch to your lock to unlock it; it’s essentially Apple’s Home Key function, but not limited to iPhones, and Samsung and Google both plan to adopt it.

This year’s CES introduced a bevy of unique headphones, including Fender’s first set and a pair that roll up to become a Bluetooth speaker when you want to share your music with friends. However, despite the interesting advancements, we doubt any of them will dethrone our favorite pair for travel: the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. Thankfully, the first-gen noise-canceling cans are currently on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Bose in several colors for $279 ($150 off), matching their lowest price to date.

Although Bose introduced a second-gen pair of the QC Ultra in September, the original flagships offer many of the same hallmarks for $120 less, at least at the moment. They feature a comfortable build and a foldable design that makes them ideal for long flights and road trips, along with a commendable 24 hours of battery life. More importantly, they offer best-in-class noise cancellation and a pleasing, balanced sound signature that preserves highs and lows even when you dial back the volume. That’s on top of a natural-sounding transparency mode designed to pipe outside noise in and an Immersive Audio feature, which, while still hit or miss, can offer new depth to select tracks.

If you do decide to go with the first-gen model over Bose’s latest pair of headphones, you’ll only be giving up a handful of somewhat iterate update. The QC Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) — which also happen to be on sale for $50 off at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo — let you eke out slightly more battery life (30 hours vs. 24 hours), support lossless audio over USB-C, and feature an improved transparency mode. They also support Bluetooth 5.4 and a new Cinema Mode designed to bring dialogue to the forefront, though, for most people, we’d argue none of the features are worth shelling out an additional $120 for.

Netflix is launching its first pair of original video podcasts, hosted by Saturday Night Live alum Pete Davidson and NFL commentator and former star Michael Irvin. While The Pete Davidson Show makes its debut on January 30th, you can find Irvin’s The White House on the streaming service on January 19th.

The two shows will join Netflix’s growing slate of video podcasts that it has licensed from Spotify, iHeartMedia, and Barstool Sports, including My Favorite Murder, The Bill Simmons Podcast, and Pardon My Take. As part of these deals, the shows licensed by Netflix can’t appear in their entirety on YouTube, which has grown to become the biggest platform for podcasts. Bloomberg first reported on Netflix’s plans to create its own podcasts last year.

The Pete Davidson Show will put out new episodes every Friday, featuring Davidson and guests inside his garage having “candid, no-holds-barred conversations.” Netflix says it will reveal Davidson’s first guests and more details about the show soon.

Irvin, who spent over a decade as a wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys, will host The White House with a rotating cast of cohosts and guests, including former NFL pro Brandon Marshall, who will also produce the show. The White House, named for the mythic party house Irvin ran during his NFL heyday, will air two episodes per week.

Verizon phones across the US have had trouble connecting since about noon Eastern, Verizon says it’s aware of the issue.

The first big outage of 2026 is here, as Verizon customers across the US, including several of our phones, complain that service has been spotty or nonexistent starting at around noon ET, with phones switching to SOS Mode and being unable to connect. This cell service outage follows a “software issue” that cut off service for many people in August for several hours, and while Verizon has acknowledged the issue, there is no word yet on when it will be fixed.

We are aware of an issue impacting wireless voice and data services for some customers. Our engineers are engaged and are working to identify and solve the issue quickly. We understand how important reliable connectivity is and apologize for the inconvenience.

The most recent update from Verizon’s news account on X posted at 2:14PM ET says:

Verizon engineering teams are continuing to address today’s service interruptions. Our teams remain fully deployed and are focused on the issue. We understand the impact this has on your day and remain committed to resolving this as quickly as possible.

On DownDetector, the number of reports listed has dropped to about 130,000 after peaking with nearly double that at around 1PM ET, but according to our own testing, as well as other posts on social media, many phones are still offline or only connecting intermittently. We have contacted Verizon, and will update this article when more information is available.

Update, January 14th: Added Verizon update.

            <div id="article-text">Three years after being caught off guard by ChatGPT, Gemini appears to have everything it needs to take down OpenAI and everyone else.

Three years after being caught off guard by ChatGPT, Gemini appears to have everything it needs to take down OpenAI and everyone else.

If you want to win in AI — and I mean win in the biggest, most lucrative, most shape-the-world-in-your-image kind of way — you have to do a bunch of hard things simultaneously. You need to have a model that is unquestionably one of the best on the market. You need the nearly infinite resources required to continue to improve that model and deploy it at massive scale. You need at least one AI-based product that lots of people use, and ideally more than one. And you need access to as much of your users’ other data — their personal information, their online activity, even the files on their computer — as you can possibly get.

Each one of these elements is complex and competitive; there’s a reason OpenAI CEO Sam Altman keeps shouting about how he needs trillions of dollars in compute alone. But Google is the one company that appears to have all of the pieces already in order. Over the last year, and even in the last few days, the company has made moves that suggest it is ready to be the biggest and most impactful force in AI.

A lot of the necessary infrastructural work happened last year. In November, Google released Gemini 3, which is widely regarded as the best overall large language model on the market. It wins in most (somewhat dubious) benchmark tests, and most experts agree it is either at or near the top of the list for most tasks. Its reign won’t be forever, of course — we’re still very much in the “there’s a new best model every six weeks” phase of AI — but Google has proven its best work is consistently the industry’s best work.

One important factor for Gemini 3 was the way it was trained: using Google’s own TPUs, a highly specialized chip the company has been building for years for exactly this sort of purpose. Google is certainly susceptible to some of the manufacturing problems and RAM price hikes everyone else is, but unlike nearly all of its competitors, it’s not dependent on Nvidia’s supply chain. Google is able to optimize its entire system to make it better, faster, and cheaper. Nobody else has this kind of full-stack control of its AI destiny.

So what do you do when you have the tech in place? Put it in front of people and put it to work. On Monday, Google and Apple announced that Gemini will power the next-generation Siri that’s coming later this year. This is a big win for Apple, which is reportedly paying $1 billion a year in the hopes of turning Siri into an AI assistant that is actually useful for a change.

Siri immediately becomes one of the most popular ways people will interact with Gemini

For Google, it’s just as important. Apple saying “this is the best technology available” is obviously a powerful signal to the market, but even more than that, Siri immediately becomes one of the most popular ways people will interact with Gemini. Apple’s Craig Federighi said in 2024 that Siri processes “something like 1.5 billion requests every day,” and while we don’t know the exact details of the new deal, presumably some large percentage of those will soon run through Gemini. (Here’s hoping “set a timer,” the only thing Siri continues to do well, doesn’t get a new and more complicated back end.) Compare that to ChatGPT, which Altman said last year gets 2.5 billion prompts per day. The Gemini app is growing fast yet still way behind ChatGPT, but adding Siri to the mix will help Google catch up more quickly.

A technology deal is not the same as Gemini fully usurping Siri, of course, and Google would surely like to also have Siri punt questions to Gemini the way it currently does with ChatGPT. But the deal still matters because every user matters: The more user activity and data these companies can collect, the better their models and products can be. The recent search trial was in part about this very flywheel, and it holds just as true with AI.

Google’s other announcement this week is an even bigger flex. It announced an opt-in feature called “Personal Intelligence,” which connects Gemini to the vast ocean of information Google has about you in order to give you better responses. Every time you ask it a question, Gemini can now answer it by looking at your recent searches, the videos you watch on YouTube, your emails, your photos, your files, and more. You really can’t overstate how big a deal this is: Google no longer has to ask you to give it lots of context, hope you provide excellent and detailed prompts every time, or build out complicated custom instruction systems. Google already knows a scary amount about you, and now Gemini does, too.

Right now, Personal Intelligence is in beta for a subset of paying AI customers. Eventually, Google plans to bring it to everyone, everywhere. And it plans to bring it to the most important Google product of all, the most popular webpage on the planet: its search engine. AI Mode in Search is for now still just a tab to the side of the general search results, but Google very clearly sees it as the future of Search. And it wants to turn Gemini into a portal to all of Google’s data about you, the internet, and the world.

In 2022, when ChatGPT launched, it was clear that Google had been caught flat-footed. But credit where it’s due: For a company not exactly known for its ability to focus on a coherent product strategy, Google managed to marshal its considerable resources in a single direction. Now, if chatbots are in fact the future — and most of the AI industry continues to bet that they are — there is simply no other company currently set up to truly compete with Google. Google has the models. It has the resources to improve them. It now has the distribution necessary to get people to use its bots, and the data required to make them uniquely personal and useful. At least for now, ChatGPT has the brand power, and the daily active users. But Google has almost everything else. Even the iPhone.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Next-gen nuclear is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. If you want to learn more about why it made the list, sign up to receive The Spark, our weekly newsletter all about energy and climate change, tomorrow. You can also check out the rest of the technologies on the list here.

Africa is still early in the process of adopting AI technologies. But researchers say the continent is uniquely hospitable to it for several reasons, including a relatively young and increasingly well-educated population, a rapidly growing ecosystem of AI startups, and lots of potential consumers.

However, ambitious efforts to develop AI tools that answer the needs of Africans face numerous hurdles. Taken together, researchers worry, they could hold Africa’s AI sector back and hamper its efforts to pave its own pathway in the global AI race. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Massive structures, with thousands of specialized computer chips running in parallel to perform the complex calculations required by advanced AI models. A single facility can cover millions of square feet, built with millions of pounds of steel, aluminum, and concrete; feature hundreds of miles of wiring, connecting some hundreds of thousands of high-end GPU chips, and chewing through hundreds of megawatt-hours of electricity. These facilities run so hot from all that computing power that their cooling systems are triumphs of engineering complexity in themselves. But the star of the show are those chips with their advanced processors. A single chip in these vast arrays can cost upwards of $30,000. Racked together and working in concert, they process hundreds of thousands of tokens—the basic building blocks of an AI model—per second. Ooooomph.

Given the incredible amounts of capital that the world’s biggest companies have been pouring into building data centers you can make the case (and many people have) that their construction is single-handedly propping up the US stock market and the economy.

So important are they to our way of life that none other than the President of the United States himself, on his very first full day in office, stood side by side with the CEO of OpenAI to announce a $500 billion private investment in data center construction.

Truly, the hyperscale datacenter is a marvel of our age. A masterstroke of engineering across multiple disciplines. They are nothing short of a technological wonder.

People hate them in Virginia, which leads the nation in their construction. They hate them in Nevada, where they slurp up the state’s precious water. They hate them in Michigan, and Arizona, and South Dakota, where the good citizens of Sioux Falls hurled obscenities at their city councilmembers following a vote to permit a data center on the city’s northeastern side. They hate them all around the world, it’s true. But they really hate them in Georgia.

So, let’s go to Georgia. The purplest of purple states. A state with both woke liberal cities and MAGA magnified suburbs and rural areas. The state of Stacey Abrams and Newt Gingrich. If there is one thing just about everyone there seemingly agrees on, it’s that they’ve had it with data centers.

Last year, the state’s Public Service Commission election became unexpectedly tight, and wound up delivering a stunning upset to incumbent Republican commissioners. Although there were likely shades of national politics at play (voters favored Democrats in an election cycle where many things went that party’s way), the central issue was skyrocketing power bills. And that power bill inflation was oft-attributed to a data center building boom rivaled only by Virginia’s.

This boom did not come out of the blue. At one point, Georgia wanted data centers. Or at least, its political leadership did. In 2018 the state’s General Assembly passed legislation that provided data centers with tax breaks for their computer systems and cooling infrastructure, more tax breaks for job creation, and even more tax breaks for property taxes. And then… boom!

But things have not played out the way the Assembly and other elected officials may have expected.

Journey with me now to Bolingbroke, Georgia. Not far outside of Atlanta, in Monroe County (population 27,954), county commissioners were considering rezoning 900 acres of land to make room for a new data center near the town of Bolingbroke (population 492). Data centers have been popping up all across the state, but especially in areas close to Atlanta. Public opinion is, often enough, irrelevant. In nearby Twiggs County, despite strong and organized opposition, officials decided to allow a 300-acre data center to move forward. But at a packed meeting to discuss the Bolingbroke plans, some 900 people showed up to voice near unanimous opposition to the proposed data center, according to Macon, Georgia’s The Telegraph. Seeing which way the wind had blown, the Monroe county commission shot it down in August last year.

The would-be developers of the proposed site had claimed it would bring in millions of dollars for the county. That it would be hidden from view. That it would “uphold the highest environmental standards.” That it would bring jobs and prosperity. Yet still, people came gunning for it.

Why!? Data centers have been around for years. So why does everyone hate them all of the sudden?

What is it about these engineering marvels that will allow us to build AI that will cure all diseases, bring unprecedented prosperity, and even cheat death (if you believe what the AI sellers are selling) that so infuriates their prospective neighbors?

There are some obvious reasons. First is just the speed and scale of their construction, which has had effects on power grids. No one likes to see their power bills go up. The rate hikes that so incensed Georgians come as monthly reminders that the eyesore in your backyard profits California billionaires at your expense, on your grid. In Wyoming, for example, a planned Meta data center will require more electricity than every household in the state, combined. To meet demand for power-hungry data centers, utilities are adding capacity to the grid. But although that added capacity may benefit tech companies, the cost is shared by local consumers.

Similarly, there are environmental concerns. To meet their electricity needs, data centers often turn to dirty forms of energy. xAI, for example, famously threw a bunch of polluting methane-powered generators at its data center in Memphis. While nuclear energy is oft-bandied about as a greener solution, traditional plants can take a decade or more to build; even new and more nimble reactors will take years to come online. In addition, data centers often require massive amounts of water. But the amount can vary widely depending on the facility, and is often shrouded in secrecy. (A number of states are attempting to require facilities to disclose water usage.)

A different type of environmental consequence of data centers is that they are noisy. A low, constant, machine hum. Not just sometimes, but always. 24 hours a day. 365 days a year. “A highway that never stops.”

And as to the jobs they bring to communities. Well, I have some bad news there too. Once construction ends, they tend to employ very few people, especially for such resource-intensive facilities.

These are all logical reasons to oppose data centers. But I suspect there is an additional, emotional one. And it echoes one we’ve heard before.

More than a decade ago, the large tech firms of Silicon Valley began operating buses to ferry workers to their campuses from San Francisco and other Bay Area cities. Like data centers, these buses used shared resources such as public roads without, people felt, paying their fair share. Protests erupted. But while the protests were certainly about shared resource use, they were also about something much bigger.

Tech companies, big and small, were transforming San Francisco. The early 2010s were a time of rapid gentrification in the city. And what’s more, the tech industry itself was transforming society. Smartphones were newly ubiquitous. The way we interacted with the world was fundamentally changing, and people were, for the most part, powerless to do anything about it. You couldn’t stop Google.

You could stand in front of it and block its path. You could yell at the people getting on it. You could yell at your elected officials and tell them to do something. And in San Francisco, people did. The buses were eventually regulated.

The data center pushback has a similar vibe. AI, we are told, is transforming society. It is suddenly everywhere. Even if you opt not to use ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini, generative AI is  increasingly built into just about every app and service you likely use. People are worried AI will harvest jobs in the coming years. Or even kill us all. And for what? So far, the returns have certainly not lived up to the hype.

You can’t stop Google. But maybe, just maybe, you can stop a Google data center.

Then again, maybe not. The tech buses in San Francisco, though regulated, remain commonplace. And the city is more gentrified than ever. Meanwhile, in Monroe County, life goes on. In October, Google confirmed it had purchased 950 acres of land just off the interstate. It plans to build a data center there.

The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Sodium-ion batteries are making their way into cars—and the grid

For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. Enter: sodium-ion batteries.

They work much like lithium-ion ones: they store and release energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. Read why it’s poised to become more important to our energy future.

Sodium-ion batteries are one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Take a look at what else made the list.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese companies showcased everything from AI gadgets to household appliances to robots, and the overall mood among them was upbeat. Here’s why.This story was first featured in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter giving you the inside story of what’s going on in AI. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Monday.

At some point this month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial.

The volunteers—who are covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

However, some experts warn the trial is too small, and likely won’t reveal anything useful. Read the full story.

While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains.

By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. And their output encapsulates how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI. Read the full story.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch.

The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.”

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.
