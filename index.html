            <h2>5 changes to know about in Apple's latest iOS, macOS, and iPadOS betas</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/5-changes-to-know-about-in-apples-latest-ios-macos-and-ipados-betas/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week, Apple released the first developer betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, macOS 26.4, and its other operating systems. On Tuesday, it followed those up with public beta versions of the same updates.

Usually released around the midpoint between one major iOS release and the next, the *.4 updates to its operating system usually include a significant batch of new features and other refinements, and if the first beta is any indication, this year’s releases uphold that tradition.

A new “Playlist Playground” feature will let Apple Music subscribers generate playlists with text prompts, and native support for video podcasts is coming to the Podcasts app. The Creator Studio version of the Freeform drawing and collaboration app is also available in the 26.4 updates, allowing subscribers to access stock images from Apple’s Content Hub and to insert AI-generated images.

But we’ve spent time digging through the betas to identify some of the more below-the-surface improvements and changes that Apple is testing. Some of these changes won’t come to the public versions of the software until a later release; others may be removed or changed between now and when the 26.4 update is made available to the general public. But generally, Apple’s betas give us a good idea of what the final release will look like.

One feature that hasn’t appeared in these betas? The new “more intelligent Siri” that Apple has been promising since the iOS 18 launch in 2024. Apple delayed the feature until sometime in 2026, citing that it wasn’t meeting the company’s standards for quality and reliability.

Reports indicated that the company had been planning to make the new Siri part of the 26.4 update, but as of earlier this month, Apple has reportedly decided to push it to the 26.5 release or later; even releasing it as part of iOS 27 in the fall would technically not run afoul of the “2026” promise.

Before we begin, the standard warning about installing beta software on hardware you rely on day to day. Although these point updates are generally more stable than the major releases Apple tests in the summer and fall, they can still contain major bugs and may cause your device to behave strangely. The first beta, in particular, tends to be the roughest—more stable versions will be released in the coming weeks, and we should see the final version of the update within the next couple months.

In macOS 11 Big Sur, Apple added an on-by-default “Optimized Battery Charging” toggle to the operating system that would allow macOS to limit your battery’s charge percentage to 80 percent based on your usage and charging behavior. The idea is to limit the time your battery spends charging while full, something that can gradually reduce its capacity.

The macOS 26.4 update adds a new slider similar to the one in iOS, further allowing users to manually specify a maximum charge limit that is always observed, no matter what. It’s adjustable in 5 percent increments from 80 to 100 percent.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that limiting your charge percentage can lengthen the useful life of your battery and reduce wear, but there’s nothing that will fully prevent a battery from wearing out and losing capacity over time. It’s up to users to decide whether an immediately noticeable everyday hit to battery life is worth a slightly longer service life.

In the current macOS betas, enabling a charge limit manually doesn’t disable the Optimized Battery Charging feature the way it does in iOS. It’s unclear if this is an early bug or an intentional difference in how the feature is implemented in macOS.

Apple has been infamously slow to adopt support for the Rich Communication Services (RCS) messaging protocol used by most modern Android phones. Apple-to-Apple messaging was handled using iMessage, which supports end-to-end encryption among many other features. But for many years, it stuck by the aging SMS standard for “green bubble” texting between Apple’s platforms and others, to the enduring frustration of anyone with a single Android-using friend in a group chat.

Apple finally began supporting RCS messaging for major cellular carriers in iOS 18, and has slowly expanded support to other networks in subsequent releases. But Apple’s implementation still doesn’t support end-to-end encryption, which was added to the RCS standard about a year ago.

The 26.4 update is the first to begin testing encryption for RCS messages. But as with the initial RCS rollout, Apple is moving slowly and deliberately: for now, encrypted RCS messaging only works when texting between Apple devices, and not between Apple devices and Android phones. The feature also won’t be included in the final 26.4 release—it’s only included in the betas for testing purposes, and it “will be available to customers in a future software update for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS.”

Encrypted iMessage and RCS chats will be labeled with a lock icon, much like how most web browsers label HTTPS sites.

To support encrypted messaging, Apple will jump from version 2.4 of the RCS Universal Profile to version 3.0. This should also enable support for several improvements in versions 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 of the RCS standard, including previously iMessage-exclusive things like editing and recalling messages and replying to specific messages inline.

As part of the macOS 12 Monterey/iPadOS 15 beta cycle in 2021, Apple attempted a pretty radical redesign of the Safari browser that combined your tabs and the address bar into one, with the goal of increasing the amount of viewable space on the pages you were viewing. By the time both operating systems were released to the public, Safari’s default design had more or less reverted to its previous state, but the “compact” tab view lived on as an optional view in the settings for those who liked it.

Tahoe, the Safari 26 update, and iPadOS 26 all removed that Compact view entirely, though a version of the Compact view became the default for the iPhone version of Safari. The macOS 26.4, Safari 26.4, and iPadOS 26.4 updates restore the Compact tab option to the other versions of Safari.

Originally introduced in the iOS 17.3 update, Apple’s “Stolen Device Protection” toggle for iPhones added an extra layer of security for users whose phones were stolen by people who had learned their passcodes. With Stolen Device Protection enabled, an iPhone that had been removed from “familiar locations, such as home or work” would require biometric Face ID or Touch ID authentication before accessing stored passwords and credit cards, erasing your phone, or changing Apple Account passwords. Normally, users can enter their passcodes as a fallback; Stolen Device Protection removes that fallback.

The iOS 26.4 update will make Stolen Device Protection on by default. Generally, you won’t notice a difference in how your phone behaves, but if you’re traveling or away from places where you regularly use your phone and you can’t use your passcode to access certain information, this is why.

It’s possible to switch off Stolen Device protection, but doing so requires biometric authentication, an hour-long wait, and then a second biometric authentication. (This extended wait is also required for disabling Find My, changing your phone’s passcode, or changing Touch ID and Face ID settings.)

Apple’s Rosetta 2 was a crucial support beam in the bridge from the Intel Mac era to the Apple Silicon era, enabling unmodified Intel-native apps to run on the M1 and later processors, with noticeable but manageable performance and responsiveness hits. As with the original Rosetta, it allowed Apple to execute a major CPU architecture switch while keeping it mostly invisible to Mac users, and it bought developers time to release Arm-native versions of their apps so they could take full advantage of the new chips.

But now that the transition is complete and the last Intel Macs are fading into the rearview, Apple plans to remove the translation layer from future versions of macOS, with some exceptions for games that rely on the technology.

Rosetta 2 won’t be completely removed until macOS 28, but macOS 26.4 will be the first to begin warning users about the end of Rosetta when they launch Intel-native apps. Those notifications link to an Apple support page about identifying and updating Intel-only apps to Apple Silicon-native versions (or universal binaries that support both architectures).

Apple has deployed this “adding notifications without removing functionality” approach to deprecating older apps before. Versions 10.13 and 10.14 of macOS would show users pop-ups about the end of support for 32-bit apps for a couple of years before that support was removed in macOS 10.15, for example.</div>

            <h2>Microsoft's new 10,000-year data storage medium: glass</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/microsofts-new-10000-year-data-storage-medium-glass/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Archival storage poses lots of challenges. We want media that is extremely dense and stable for centuries or more, and, ideally, doesn’t consume any energy when not being accessed. Lots of ideas have floated around—even DNA has been considered—but one of the simplest is to etch data into glass. Many forms of glass are very physically and chemically stable, and it’s relatively easy to etch things into it.

There’s been a lot of preliminary work demonstrating different aspects of a glass-based storage system. But in Wednesday’s issue of Nature, Microsoft Research announced Project Silica, a working demonstration of a system that can read and write data into small slabs of glass with a density of over a Gigabit per cubic millimeter.

We tend to think of glass as fragile, prone to shattering, and capable of flowing downward over centuries, although the last claim is a myth. Glass is a category of material, and a variety of chemicals can form glasses. With the right starting chemical, it’s possible to make a glass that is, as the researchers put it, “thermally and chemically stable and is resistant to moisture ingress, temperature fluctuations and electromagnetic interference.” While it would still need to be handled in a way to minimize damage, glass provides the sort of stability we’d want for long-term storage.

Putting data into glass is as simple as etching it. But that’s been one of the challenges, as etching is typically a slow process. However, the development of femtosecond lasers—lasers that emit pulses that only last 10-15 seconds and can emit millions of them per second—can significantly cut down write times and allow etching to be focused on a very small area, increasing potential data density.

To read the data back, there are several options. We’ve already had great success using lasers to read data from optical disks, albeit slowly. But anything that can pick up the small features etched into the glass could conceivably work.

With the above considerations in mind, everything was in place on a theoretical level for Project Silica. The big question is how to put them together into a functional system. Microsoft decided that, just to be cautious, it would answer that question twice.

The difference between these two answers comes down to how an individual unit of data (called a voxel) is written to the glass. One type of voxel they tried was based on birefringence, where refraction of photons depends on their polarization. It’s possible to etch voxels into glass to create birefringence using polarized laser light, producing features smaller than the diffraction limit. In practice, this involved using one laser pulse to create an oval-shaped void, followed by a second, polarized pulse to induce birefringence. The identity of a voxel is based on the orientation of the oval; since we can resolve multiple orientations, it’s possible to save more than one bit in each voxel.

The alternative approach involves changing the magnitude of refractive effects by varying the amount of energy in the laser pulse. Again, it’s possible to discern more than two states in these voxels, allowing multiple data bits to be stored in each voxel.

Reading these in Silica involves using a microscope that can pick up differences in refractive index. (For microscopy geeks, this is a way of saying “they used phase contrast microscopy.”) The microscopy sets the limits on how many layers of voxels can be placed in a single piece of glass. During etching, the layers were separated by enough distance so only a single layer would be in the microscope’s plane of focus at a time. The etching process also incorporates symbols that allow the automated microscope system to position the lens above specific points on the glass. From there, the system slowly changes its focal plane, moving through the stack and capturing images that include different layers of voxels.

To interpret these microscope images, Microsoft used a convolutional neural network that combines data from images that are both in and near the plane of focus for a given layer of voxels. This is effective because the influence of nearby voxels changes how a given voxel appears in a subtle way that the AI system can pick up on if given enough training data.

The final piece of the puzzle is data encoding. The Silica system takes the raw bitstream of the data it’s storing and adds error correction using a low-density parity-check code (the same error correction used in 5G networks). Neighboring bits are then combined to create symbols that take advantage of the voxels’ ability to store more than one bit. Once a stream of symbols is made, it’s ready to be written to glass.

Writing remains a bottleneck in the system, so Microsoft developed hardware that can write a single glass slab with four lasers simultaneously without generating too much heat. That is enough to enable writing at 66 megabits per second, and the team behind the work thinks that it would be possible to add up to a dozen additional lasers. That may be needed, given that it’s possible to store up to 4.84TB in a single slab of glass (the slabs are 12 cm x 12 cm and 0.2 cm thick). That works out to be over 150 hours to fully write a slab.

The “up to” aspect of the storage system has to do with the density of data that’s possible with the two different ways of writing data. The method that relies on birefringence requires more optical hardware and only works in high-quality glasses, but can squeeze more voxels into the same volume, and so has a considerably higher data density. The alternative approach can only put a bit over two terabytes into the same slab of glass, but can be done with simpler hardware and can work on any sort of transparent material.

Borosilicate glass offers extreme stability; Microsoft’s accelerated aging experiments suggest the data would be stable for over 10,000 years at room temperature. That led Microsoft to declare, “Our results demonstrate that Silica could become the archival storage solution for the digital age.”

That may be overselling it just a bit. The Square Kilometer Array telescope, for example, is expected to need to archive 700 petabytes of data each year. That would mean over 140,000 glass slabs would be needed to store the data from this one telescope. Even assuming that the write speed could be boosted by adding significantly more lasers, you’d need over 600 Silica machines operating in parallel to keep up. And the Square Kilometer Array is far from the only project generating enormous amounts of data.

That said, there are some features that make Silica a great match for this sort of thing, most notably the complete absence of energy needed to preserve the data, and the fact that it can be retrieved rapidly if needed (a sharp contrast to the days needed to retrieve information from DNA, for example). Plus, I’m admittedly drawn to a system with a storage medium that looks like something right out of science fiction.

            <h2>FDA reverses surprise rejection of Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/fda-does-u-turn-will-review-modernas-mrna-flu-shot-after-shocking-rejection/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Food and Drug Administration has reversed its shocking refusal to consider Moderna’s mRNA flu vaccine for approval.

The refusal was revealed last week in a sharply worded press release from Moderna. Subsequent reporting found that the decision was made by political appointee Vinay Prasad, the Trump administration’s top vaccine regulator, who overruled a team of agency scientists and a top career official in rejecting Moderna’s application.

In an announcement Wednesday morning, Moderna said the FDA has now agreed to review its vaccine after the company held a formal (Type A) meeting with the FDA and proposed a change to the regulatory pathways used in the application.

“We appreciate the FDA’s engagement in a constructive Type A meeting and its agreement to advance our application for review,” Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s CEO, said in the announcement. “Pending FDA approval, we look forward to making our flu vaccine available later this year so that America’s seniors have access to a new option to protect themselves against flu.” The agency is expected to provide a decision on the vaccine by August 5, 2026.

Prasad’s ostensible reason for initially refusing to review the application was based not on Moderna’s vaccine, mRNA-1010, but on the established flu vaccine Moderna used for comparison in its Phase 3 trial. Moderna used licensed standard-dose influenza vaccines, including Fluarix, made by GlaxoSmithKline, in the trial, which involved nearly 41,000 adults aged 50 and older. In a letter to Moderna dated February 3, Prasad said this choice “does not reflect the best-available standard of care,” and therefore the trial was not “adequate and well-controlled.”

Moderna acknowledged that FDA scientists had previously suggested that the company use a recommended high-dose flu vaccine in trial participants 65 and older. But the agency ultimately signed off on the trial design with the uniform standard dose, calling it “acceptable.” Moderna, meanwhile, agreed to add a comparison of a high-dose vaccine to some older participants and provide the FDA with additional analysis.

Agency insiders told reporters that a team of career scientists was ready to review the vaccine and held an hourlong meeting with Prasad to present the reasons for moving forward with the review. David Kaslow, a top career official responsible for reviewing vaccines, also wrote a memo detailing why the review should proceed. Prasad rejected the vaccine application anyway.

According to today’s announcement, the FDA reversed that rejection when Moderna proposed splitting the application, seeking full approval for the vaccine’s use in people aged 50 to 64 and an accelerated approval for use in people 65 and up. That latter regulatory pathway means Moderna will have to conduct an additional trial in that age group to confirm its effectiveness after it’s on the market.

Andrew Nixon, spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed the reversal to Ars Technica. “Discussions with the company led to a revised regulatory approach and an amended application, which FDA accepted,” Nixon said in a statement. “FDA will maintain its high standards during review and potential licensure stages as it does with all products.”

The FDA typically takes a levelheaded approach to working with companies, rarely making surprising decisions or rejecting applications outright. While Prasad claimed the rejection was due to the control vaccine, the move aligns with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s broader anti-vaccine agenda.

Kennedy and the allies he has installed in federal positions are particularly hostile to mRNA technology. Moderna has already lost more than $700 million in federal contracts to develop pandemic vaccines. Next month, Kennedy’s MAHA Institute is hosting an anti-vaccine event that alleges there’s a “massive epidemic of vaccine injury.” The event description claims without evidence that use of mRNA vaccines is linked to “rising rates of acute and chronic illness.”

Vaccine makers and industry investors, meanwhile, are reporting that Kennedy’s relentless anti-vaccine efforts are chilling the entire industry, with companies abandoning research and cutting jobs. In comments to The New York Times, Moderna’s president, Stephen Hoge, said, “There will be less invention, investment, and innovation in vaccines generally, across all the companies.”</div>

            <h2>Record scratch—Google's Lyria 3 AI music model is coming to Gemini today</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/gemini-can-now-generate-ai-music-for-you-no-lyrics-required/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow called music “the universal language of mankind.” Is that still true when the so-called music is being generated by a probabilistic robot instead of a human? We’re about to find out. Google has announced its latest Lyria 3 AI model is being deployed in the Gemini app, vastly expanding access to AI music generation.

Google DeepMind has been tinkering with Lyria for a while now, offering limited access in developer-oriented products like Vertex AI. Lyria 3 is more capable than previous versions, and it’s also quicker to use. Just select the new “Create music” option in the Gemini app or web UI to get started. You can describe what you want and even upload an image to help the robot get the right vibe. And in a few seconds, you get music (or something like it).

In case there was any uncertainty about whether Lyria tracks still counted as a human artistic endeavor, worry not! Unlike past versions of the model, you don’t even have to provide lyrics in your prompt. You can be vague with your request, and the model will create suitable lyrics for the 30-second song. Although with that limit, “jingle” might be more accurate.

In addition to the track, each music creation job will come with an album cover-style image created by the Nano Banana model. Gemini will also have a pre-loaded set of AI tracks that you can choose to remix to your heart’s content. The Lyria 3 tools are also coming to Google’s Dream Track toolkit for YouTube Shorts, which will pair nicely with the Veo AI video options.

So what kind of tracks can you expect Gemini to spit out? Google has provided some examples:

Prompt: I’m feeling nostalgic. Create a track for my mother about the great times we had as kids and the memories of her home-cooked plantains. Make it a fun afrobeat track with a true African vibe.

Prompt: Quintessential 1970s Motown soul. Lush, orchestral R&B production. Warm bassline with melodic fills, locked into a steady drum groove with crisp snare and tambourine. Vintage organ harmonic bed. Three-piece brass section. Gritty, gospel-tinged male tenor lead.

Prompt: Wistful and airy. Soft, breathy female vocals with intimacy. Rapid-fire drum and bass rhythm, low-passed and softened. Deep, warm bass swells. Dreamy electric piano chords and subtle chime textures. Rainy city vibes.

Prompt: An authentic A capella Sea Shanty featuring a robust male choir singing in a traditional call-and-response format. The piece is entirely vocal, relying on synchronized foot-stomps on a wooden deck and sharp handclaps to provide the rhythmic pulse. The lead is a weathered male baritone with a gravelly timbre who sings the narrative ‘chant’ lines. He is immediately answered by a powerful male choir singing in rich, rugged harmony on the ‘response’ lines. The voices are recorded with a natural room reverb that simulates the acoustic environment of a wooden ship’s deck, giving the vocals a resonant, atmospheric quality. The performance is energetic and driving, with the choir leaning into the rhythm of the stomps to create a sense of focused, communal effort. There are no instruments, only the layered textures of collective male voices spanning tenor, baritone, and bass ranges, all contributing to a confident, monolithic sound.

AI-generated music is not a new phenomenon. Several companies offer models that ingest and homogenize human-created music, and the resulting tracks can sound remarkably “real,” if a bit overproduced. Streaming services have already been inundated with phony AI artists, some of which have gathered thousands of listeners who may not even realize they’re grooving to the musical equivalent of a blender set to purée.

Still, you have to seek out tools like that, and Google is bringing similar capabilities to the Gemini app. As one of the most popular AI platforms, we’re probably about to see a lot more AI music on the Internet. Google says tracks generated with Lyria 3 will have an audio version of Google’s SynthID embedded within. That means you’ll always be able to check if a piece of audio was created with Google’s AI by uploading it to Gemini, similar to the way you can check images and videos for SynthID tags.

Google also says it has sought to create a music AI that respects copyright and partner agreements. If you name a specific artist in your prompt, Gemini won’t attempt to copy that artist’s sound. Instead, it’s trained to take that as “broad creative inspiration.” Although it also notes this process is not foolproof, and some of that original expression might imitate an artist too much. In those cases, Google invites users to report such shared content.

Lyria 3 is going live in the Gemini web interface today and should be available in the mobile app within a few days. It works in English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese, but Google plans to add more languages soon. While all users will have some access to music generation, those with AI Pro and AI Ultra subscriptions will have higher usage limits, but the specifics are unclear.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s that time of year—a new budget Pixel phone is about to hit virtual shelves. The Pixel 10a will be available on March 5, and pre-orders go live today. The 9a will still be on sale for a while, but the 10a will be headlining Google’s store. However, you might not notice unless you keep up with the Pixel numbering scheme. This year’s A-series Pixel is virtually identical to last year’s, both inside and out.

Last year’s Pixel 9a was a notable departure from the older design language, but Google made few changes for 2026. We liked that the Pixel 9a emphasized battery capacity and moved to a flat camera bump, and this time, it’s really flat. Google says the camera now sits totally flush with the back panel. This is probably the only change you’ll be able to identify visually.

Google also says the new Pixel will have a slightly upgraded screen. The resolution, size, and refresh rate are unchanged, but peak brightness has been bumped from 2,700 nits to 3,000 nits (the same as the base model Pixel 10). Plus, the cover glass has finally moved beyond Gorilla Glass 3 to Gorilla Glass 7i, which supposedly has improved scratch and drop protection.

Google notes that more of the phone is constructed from recycled material, 100 percent for the aluminum frame and 81 percent for the plastic back. There’s also recycled gold, tungsten, cobalt, and copper inside, amounting to about 36 percent of the phone’s weight. The phone also continues to have a physical SIM slot, which was removed from the Pixel 10 series last year. The device’s USB-C 3.2 port can also charge slightly faster than the 9a (30 W versus 23 W), and wireless charging has gone from 7.5 W to 10 W. There are no Qi2 magnets inside, though.

Internally, the Pixel 10a is even more like its predecessor. Unlike past A-series phones, this one doesn’t have the latest Tensor chip—it’s sticking with the same Tensor G4 from the 9a. That’s a bummer, as the G5 was a bigger leap than most of Google’s chip upgrades. The company says it stuck with the G4 to “balance affordability and performance.”

In fairness, Google has managed to keep the price steady at $499. With components like RAM and storage in short supply this year, prices could rise for many device refreshes.

Google’s position is that the Pixel 10a still offers a good value despite the middling upgrades compared to last year’s phone. It keeps the Pixel camera experience (which is admittedly great) available at a lower price than the flagship phones. While you get better results with the more expensive Pixels, the 9a was still one of the mobile photography options in 2025. With identical camera hardware in 2026, we expect the 10a to be the same.

But why not make the Pixel 10a a bigger upgrade? Making a better phone theoretically means you sell more of them, right? There are a few possibilities.

By slowing the improvement of the A-series Pixels, Google is making the Pixel 10 look like a better option for buyers. Upgrading the processor and adding features like PixelSnap could make the 10a too appealing compared to the $800 Pixel 10—Google’s A-series phones have been regularly recommended over the flagships due to the lower price and similar capabilities. The Pixel 10’s camera is also less capable than the Pixel 9 was for that generation, making it that much more similar to the A-series.

Component prices are also a concern for 2026. While smartphone development cycles can easily range from 18 to 24 months, Google may have decided late in the game to stick with the Tensor G4 in this phone to offset the higher cost of storage and memory. Google has stressed that it wanted to keep the A-series at its traditional $499 price. As a major player in AI, an industry that is vacuuming up all those parts, Google may have had insight into the coming shortage before most.

Whatever the reason, the Pixel 10a is looking like a very modest upgrade. If you still think it’s the right phone for you, Google will take your money starting today. The device is at the Google Store for $499 with 128GB of storage, and some carriers should begin offering the phone soon. The 256GB version runs $100 more. The Pixel 10a is available in Lavender, Fog, Obsidian, and the new Berry color.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/what-the-chinese-art-of-tian-tsui-has-to-do-with-kingfishers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In Qing dynasty China, artisans augmented decorative pieces by incorporating iridescent kingfisher feathers—a technique known as tian-tsui. Scientists at Northwestern University’s Center for Scientific Studies in the Arts have used high-energy X-ray imaging to achieve unprecedented nanoscale resolution of the unique structure of those feathers, presenting their findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

As previously reported, nature is the ultimate nanofabricator. The bright iridescent colors in butterfly wings, soap bubbles, opals, or beetle shells don’t come from any pigment molecules but from how they are structured—naturally occurring photonic crystals. In nature, scales of chitin (a polysaccharide common to insects), for example, are arranged like roof tiles. Essentially, they form a diffraction grating, except photonic crystals only produce specific colors, or wavelengths, of light, while a diffraction grating will produce the entire spectrum, much like a prism. In the case of kingfisher feathers, the color is due to the microscopic ridges that cover the parallel rows of keratin strands that grow along the central shaft.

Also known as photonic band-gap materials, photonic crystals are “tunable,” which means they are precisely ordered to block certain wavelengths of light while letting others through. Alter the structure by changing the size of the tiles, and the crystals become sensitive to a different wavelength. They are used in optical communications as waveguides and switches, as well as in filters, lasers, mirrors, and various anti-reflection stealth devices.

The 19th century poet Gerard Manley Hopkins paid homage to the kingfisher’s brilliant plumage in his poem “As Kingfishers Catch Fire,” but Chinese poets and artists were extolling their praises long before that. Tian-tsui (“dotting with kingfishers”) is a prime example of how much the feathers were valued. The feathers were cut and glued onto gilt silver and used as inlays for things like fans, hairpins, screens, and panels, or headdresses—carefully oriented in intricate patterns to enhance the dazzling hues. The feathers were so popular, in fact, that kingfisher populations were declared endangered following the Chinese Communist Revolution. The last tian-tsui studio closed in 1933.

The Northwestern team started looking at kingfisher feathers in tian-tsui objects via postdoc Madeline Meier, who has a background in chemistry and nanostructures and was interested in combining that expertise with studies of cultural heritage. The first step was to identify the bird species whose feathers were used in Qing dynasty screens and panels, as well as other materials used. Researchers carefully scraped away the topmost layers and imaged the feathers with scanning electron microscopy to get a better look at the underlying nanostructure. Hyperspectral imaging revealed how different areas of the screens absorbed and reflected light.

The team also made use of the center’s partnership with Chicago’s Field Museum, comparing the screen feathers with the museum’s vast collection of taxidermied bird species. The screens and panels contained feathers from common kingfishers and black-capped kingfishers, as well as mallard ducks (used to add green hues). Finally, X-ray fluorescence and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy enabled them to create a map of the various chemicals used in the gilding, pigments, glues, and other materials.

Most recently, the lab has partnered with Argonne National Laboratory and used synchrotron radiation to get an ever-better look at the nanostructure of kingfisher feathers. Synchrotron radiation differs from conventional X-rays in that it’s a thin beam of very high-intensity X-rays generated within a particle accelerator. Electrons are fired into a linear accelerator (linac), get a speed boost in a small synchrotron, and are injected into a storage ring, where they zoom along at near-light speed. A series of magnets bends and focuses the electrons, and in the process, they give off X-rays, which can then be focused down beam lines.

That makes it ideal for noninvasive imaging, since, in general, the shorter the wavelength used (and the higher the light’s energy), the finer the details one can image and/or analyze. It has become a popular technique for imaging fragile archaeological artifacts without damaging them—like Qing dynasty headdresses with inlays of kingfisher feathers. In this case, the imaging revealed that the feathers’ microscopic ridges have an underlying semi-ordered, porous, sponge-like shape that reflect and scatter light, thereby giving the feathers their gloriously brilliant hues.

“Long admired in Chinese poetry and art, kingfisher feathers have amazing optical properties,” co-author Maria Kokkori said. “Our discoveries not only enhance our understanding of historical materials but also reshape how we think about artistic and scientific innovation, and the future of sustainable materials.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After being merged with Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI, SpaceX is gearing up for a $1.25 trillion IPO — but since the entity is still currently private, it’s remained mostly out of reach of everyday investors.

But Powerlaw Corp, a fund that owns stakes in buzzy and not-yet-public companies including SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic, is giving retail traders an early taste of what could be in store for them. As Bloomberg reports, the $1.2 billion fund announced in a regulatory filing that it’s looking to give mom-and-pop investors a shot at buying in.

“With the pool of capital in private markets, the best companies are not choosing to go public,” Powerlaw investor and Jazz Venture Partners managing partner John Spinale told Bloomberg. “This robs the public the ability to access the high-growth firms.”

Powerlaw will act as the intermediary and charge shareholders a 2.5 percent management fee. The fund is planning for a direct listing, meaning that it will sell existing shares by current stockholders, unlike an IPO, which involves selling new shares to raise capital.

However, the fund will still need approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission before it can go ahead.

“Our investment objective is long-term capital appreciation,” the regulatory filing reads. “We seek to achieve our investment objective by investing in a concentrated portfolio of approximately 15 late-stage technology companies.”

Powerlaw’s portfolio includes six AI companies, including xAI, Perplexity, OpenAI, and Anthropic, as well as predictions market platform Kalshi, and even Palmer Luckey’s defense contractor Anduril.

“The fund reflects [parent company] Akkadian’s mission to democratize access to Silicon Valley’s premier technology investments,” the filing reads.

But taking advantage of the service could come with risks. For one, shareholders may not see immediate gains when share prices of these companies rise due to the way Powerlaw structures its trades. Closed-end funds also routinely trade at a significant premium to their actual holdings.

Information could also be hard to come by as privately traded companies like SpaceX and OpenAI aren’t required to disclose financial statements publicly. And a more prosaic possibility: these hype-fueled stocks could eventually crash for a variety of reasons.

And a similar investment platform, called Linqto, which aimed to allow accredited investors to invest in private and pre-IPO companies, filed for bankruptcy in July of last year after facing alleged security violations, further highlighting the inherent risks of trying to invest in private companies through an intermediary.

            <h2>Skeptic Builds “Havana Syndrome”-Style Device, Tests It on Himself, Suffers Grim Consequences</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the strangest stories in contemporary statecraft refuses to go away.

New reporting by the Washington Post revealed that a Norwegian government scientist has been secretly working on a pulse-energy weapon, an approximation of the fabled “Havana syndrome” gun, which may or may not even exist. Specifically, the weapon was described as a device capable of emitting powerful pulses of microwave energy.

Here’s where things get truly weird. In 2024, after the unnamed scientist had presumably produced a working unit, he became skeptical of its efficacy. So he did what any self-respecting man of science would do, and turned the weapon on himself in an attempt to demonstrate microwave weapons are harmless, WaPo reported.

The result was unfortunately pretty gnarly. Instead of proving the tech to be harmless, the weapon did what it was built to do, scrambling the man’s brain and bringing on a host of “neurological symptoms” associated with the infamous Havana syndrome, four people with knowledge of the event told WaPo.

Though the medical community has no precise working definition of Havana syndrome — preferring the term “Anomalous Health Incidents” — these fabled symptoms experienced by US and Canadian embassy staff in Havana, Cuba are said to include head or ear pain, loss of balance or dizziness, insomnia, confusion, brain fog, emotional distress, and nausea.

Never ones to waste an opportunity, the event spurred at least two separate visits from CIA and US State Department apparatchiks, according to WaPo. That may have something to do with a 2024 Department of Homeland Security operation to buy a pulsed-radio weapon for eight-figures, news of which broke earlier this year.

It’s just the latest episode in a decade-long search to link US foreign adversaries to Havana syndrome, a vague and highly-suspect charge that was once considered debunked. As far as this incident goes, anyone hoping it would reveal further insights into the geopolitical legend will be disappointed.

For one thing, WaPo‘s government sources noted that successful production of a weapon in US-allied Norway does nothing to prove that foreign adversaries are conspiring to use direct energy devices out in the open. (That’s in keeping with a 2023 report by five US intelligence agencies, which concluded it was “highly unlikely” that Havana syndrome was the result of a malicious direct-energy attack, though that hasn’t stopped hawkish politicians from claiming otherwise.)

One source poured even more cold water on the whole thing, sharing their opinion that the scientist’s symptoms don’t line up with the “classic” effects of Havana syndrome.

Still, the Norwegian incident has reinvigorated the claim that direct energy weapons are capable of inducing brain damage — whether its creators believe it or not.

            <h2>Tesla Robotaxis Crashing Vastly More Often Than Human Drivers</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/advanced-transport/tesla-robotaxis-crashing-more-human-drivers">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ostensible point of robotaxis is that they’re supposed to be safer drivers than humans.

According to updated filings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration examined by Electrek, the Elon Musk-owned automaker has reported another five crashes involving its capital-R “Robotaxis,” for a total of 14 documented collisions since the service began operating in Austin, Texas last June.

The newly reported crashes were submitted by Tesla last month and occurred between December 2025 and January 2026. They include a collision with a fixed object at 17 miles per hour, a crash with a bus while the Robotaxi was stationary, a crash with a truck at four miles per hour, and two incidents in which the Tesla backed into a pole or tree.

Because Tesla heavily censors its crash reports, it’s impossible to get a clear idea of what happened in any of these incidents. No amount of blank ink, however, can cover the fact that the Robotaxis are getting into accidents at a high rate — a rate, Electrek calculates, that’s not only worse than its competitors, but the fallible human drivers it’s supposed to outmode.

Based on the mileage data shared in Tesla’s Q4 2025  earnings, the EV blog estimates that the Robotaxi fleet accumulated roughly 800,000 miles by mid-January. Divide that by fourteen, and that works out to a crash once every 57,000 miles. Compare that to Tesla’s Vehicle Safety Report, which claims that the average American driver experiences a minor collision every 229,000 miles, and it means the Robotaxis are crashing at a rate four times higher than human motorists.

It looks even worse when you compare Tesla’s fleet to Waymo’s, a company that Musk constantly tries to pick fights with, insisting that his self-driving cars are superior. Across over 127 million fully driverless miles, Waymo averages an accident around every 98,000 miles.

Even this already sizable gap may slightly flatter Tesla. In reality, Waymo’s fleet comprises over 2,000 robotaxis, while Tesla has less than fifty. Waymo operates in several major US cities, while Tesla is limited to a small area of just one. And though it’s been vague about how much it relies on remote teleoperation, Waymo cars are considered fully driverless, meaning there’s no human driver or safety monitor inside the vehicle. Or for that matter, outside it: Tesla reportedly resorted to having a human-driven car tail its Robotaxis to fulfill a Musk boast that the service would start giving rides with no supervisor in the cabs.

In short, Waymo and Tesla aren’t in the same league.

The new crashes weren’t the only alarming takeaway in the updated NHTSA data. Tesla also quietly revised a report for a July 2025 crash that was originally described as causing “property damage only.” Now, a new version submitted in December said that the injury severity was “Minor W/Hospitalization.” It took Tesla nearly half a year to properly report that someone was hurt by one of its cars.

The delay isn’t an isolated incident. The NHTSA previously launched an investigation into Tesla for repeatedly failing to report crashes in time, sometimes several months after the accidents occurred. It also heavily censors its reports by redacting crucial details like crash narrative under the guise of protecting “confidential business information.” The practice is legal, but shady. As Electrek notes, it’s the only robotaxi company that systematically censors these details in all of its NHTSA filings.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Is the AI bubble going to burst? Will it cause the economy to go up in flames? Both analogies may be apt if you’re to believe one leading expert’s warning that the industry may be heading for a Hindenburg-style disaster.

“The Hindenburg disaster destroyed global interest in airships; it was a dead technology from that point on, and a similar moment is a real risk for AI,” Michael Wooldridge, a professor of AI at Oxford University, told The Guardian.

It may be hard to believe now, but before the German airship crashed in 1937, ponderously large dirigibles once seemed to represent the future of globe-spanning transportation, in an era when commercial airplanes, if you’ll permit the pun, hadn’t really taken off yet. And the Hindenburg, the largest airship in the world at the time, was the industry’s crowning achievement — as well as a propaganda vehicle for Nazi Germany.

At over 800 feet long, it wasn’t far off the length of the Titanic — another colossus whose name became synonymous with disaster — and regularly ferried dozens of passengers on Trans-Atlantic trips. All those ambitions were vaporized, however, when the ship suddenly burst into flames as it attempted a landing in New Jersey. The horrific fireball was attributed to a critical flaw: the hundreds of thousands of pounds of hydrogen it was filled with were ignited by an unfortunate spark.

The inferno was filmed, photographed and broadcasted around the world in a media frenzy that sealed the airship industry’s future. Could AI, with its over a trillion dollars of investment, head the same way? It’s not unthinkable.

“It’s the classic technology scenario,” Wooldridge told the newspaper. “You’ve got a technology that’s very, very promising, but not as rigorously tested as you would like it to be, and the commercial pressure behind it is unbearable.”

Perhaps AI could be responsible for a catastrophic spectacle, such as a deadly software update for self-driving cars, or a bad AI-driven decision collapsing a major company, Wooldridge suggests. But his main concern are the glaring safety flaws still present in AI chatbots, despite them being widely deployed. On top of having pitifully weak guardrails and being wildly unpredictable, AI chatbots are designed to affect human-like personas and, to keep users engaged, be sycophantic.

Together, these can encourage a user’s negative thoughts and lead them down mental health spirals fraught with delusions and even full-blown breaks with reality. These episodes of so-called AI psychosis have resulted in stalking, suicide and murder. AI’s ticking time bomb isn’t a payload of combustible hydrogen, but millions of potentially psychosis-inducing conversations. OpenAI alone admitted that ChatGPT that more than half a million people were having conversations that showed signs of psychosis every week.

“Companies want to present AIs in a very human-like way, but I think that is a very dangerous path to take,” Wooldridge told The Guardian. “We need to understand that these are just glorified spreadsheets, they are tools and nothing more than that.”

If AI has a place for us in the future, it should be as cold, impartial assistants — not cloying friends that pretend to have all the answers. A shining example of this, according to Wooldridge, is how in an early episode of “Star Trek,” the Enterprise’s computer says it has “insufficient data” to answer a question (and in a voice that is robotic, not personable.)

“That’s not what we get. We get an overconfident AI that says: yes, here’s the answer,” he told The Guardian. “Maybe we need AIs to talk to us in the voice of the ‘Star Trek’ computer. You would never believe it was a human being.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The real estate industry has seized on generative AI with a passion. Realtors have made extensive use of the tech, manipulating photos of properties beyond recognition by giving facades and interiors a heavy coat of AI-generated paint. Text descriptions of properties have turned into a heap of ChatGPT-generated buzzwords, devolving an already frustrating house hunt into a genuinely exasperating experience.

Making sense of what a rental apartment actually looks like in the real world has regressed into a guessing game. We’ve already come across bizarre listings of inexplicably yassified houses with smoothed-over architectural features, misplaced trees, nonsensically rearranged furniture, and mangled props.

But now, a listing for a property in the Washington, DC area has taken the cake. Renters seeking a new home in the capital made a horrifying discovery while browsing listings: what can only be described as an Eldritch horror poking her disfigured head out — from somehow both inside and outside — of a bathroom mirror.

In other words, it’s the kind of nightmarish creature only a flawed AI algorithm could’ve cooked up — and that only a time-strapped realtor could fail to notice before posting for the whole world to see.

The listing for a property in Fort Totten, a suburb in northern DC, has since been taken down from Apartments.com. Other instances of the same listing still exist on other sites, such as Redfin, but no longer include the mangled picture of what one Reddit user described as their “sleep paralysis demon.” Helpfully, the Internet Archive backed up a snapshot of the listing before it was pulled.

“Genuinely the worst possible thing to scroll past before I fall asleep,” one horrified user wrote. “That thing somehow struck raw primal fear in me at an unparalleled record high.”

The Zillow listing for the property includes what appears to be either the original or a differently edited photo of the same bathroom, suggesting the realtors may have attempted to edit out personal cosmetic items the previous renter had left behind on the vanity.

Besides the nightmarish creature, a mysterious ottoman was added to the middle of the bathroom floor, strengthening the case that an AI tool was involved.

“And then, for some reason, the AI added an uncanny valley blow-up doll reaching through the mirror for bathroom salad,” one user wrote.

Futurism has reached out to the real estate company behind the listing for comment.

It’s not even the first bathroom demon renters have come across lately. A separate Reddit user noticed what appears to be a miniaturized woman holding a smartphone disconcertingly crouched on the top of a toilet tank.

“How do you not notice the melted demon crawling out of the wall before you hit publish?” one baffled user wrote, responding to the suggestion that AI image editing tools may have been involved. “That s*** made my stomach drop.”

Whether the image — which includes a watermark for the cooperative realtor tool MLS but no indication that it was edited with AI — broke any rules before it was taken down remains unclear, as rules can vary significantly. As Giraffe360, an AI image editing tool for real estate photos, points out on its website, MLS organizations “consistently prohibit” edits that remove or alter structural elements, erase or modify views, or digitally renovate or upgrade interiors or exteriors.

“Here’s a simple test: if an edit would require physical renovation to achieve in real life, it shouldn’t be in an MLS listing photo,” the website reads.

Whether an Eldritch horror climbing out of a bathroom mirror requires a physical renovation remains unclear at best.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the past few months, Tesla has been making a major pivot away from its highly lucrative electric vehicles toward humanoid robots, a pet obsession of CEO Elon Musk’s. That restructuring campaign seems to be ahead of schedule, with Tesla’s electric vehicle sales plunging to astonishing lows.

The EV maker hit a four-year low in the US last month, selling 17 percent fewer cars in January compared to the same period last year, indicating the company’s core business is falling apart as Musk focuses his attention elsewhere.

An even more stark situation is playing out across the pond. According to an analysis by CleanTechnica using data from EU-EVs.com, which tracks battery electric vehicle registrations in European countries, Tesla’s overall sales in January of 2026 were down precipitously from the same point just two years ago. Across 13 European markets, Tesla vehicle sales were down 49.5 percent between January 2024 and January 2026, based on public vehicle registration data. Compared to the same point in January 2025, sales in 12 of these markets were down 23 percent.

Tesla’s European loss leaders include Norway, where sales dropped an astonishing 93 percent in two years, from 1,108 units in January 2024 to a measly 83 in January of this year. In the UK, registrations went from 1,591 units to just 714, a 55 percent fall. The Netherlands, meanwhile, saw sales drop 81 percent.

There were some small bright spots, like Ireland, where sales increased from 66 in January 2024 to 143 in January of this year. Finland, too, saw a 33 percent rise over the two years, from 169 vehicles to 224.

Unfortunately for Tesla’s shareholders, those aren’t nearly enough to stop the hemorrhaging. Though Musk’s political antics have undoubtedly done some heavy brand damage across Europe, he’s not the only reason for the slump. Tesla’s faltering sales also come amidst tense labor disputes in Germany and Sweden as a tidal wave of Chinese-made EVs floods the zone.

Whether the company is even interested in boosting its performance in Europe is unclear, but if these numbers are any indication, it would be a major uphill battle.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SeatGeek announced on Wednesday a new integration with Spotify, bringing a seamless ticket-buying experience for Spotify users.

Now, when Spotify users browse an artist’s page or upcoming tour dates, they will see ticket links powered by SeatGeek for concerts at these participating venues, allowing for a streamlined purchase process.

Currently, the integration is available for a select group of venues where SeatGeek serves as the primary ticket seller. Specifically, it covers SeatGeek’s 15 major U.S. venue partners, including State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Nissan Stadium in Nashville, and AT&T Stadium in Arlington. (So, although SeatGeek is a major player in the secondary ticketing space, this integration is exclusive to venues where it operates as the primary ticketing platform.)

This is a strategic win for SeatGeek. With direct placement in the Spotify app, SeatGeek is positioned to reach millions of active music fans as they discover upcoming events, increasing the chances of converting listeners into ticket buyers.

Although SeatGeek has made significant strides in the space, it continues to face competition from heavyweights Ticketmaster and AXS.

These rivals command a greater share of the ticketing market, bolstered by long-term contracts with many top venues and event organizers. It’s estimated that Ticketmaster alone services 53 of the top 68 US arenas. Even Barclays Center, which switched from Ticketmaster to SeatGeek in 2021, quickly reversed course less than a year into a seven-year agreement and ended the deal to return to Ticketmaster.

Notably, the latest partnership follows Spotify’s announcement that it has helped artists generate over $1 billion in ticket sales by linking fans with live events through its ticketing partners. The company works with more than 45 ticketing partners, including Ticketmaster, AXS, Eventbrite, DICE, and Bandsintown.

Spotify previously experimented with direct ticket sales in 2022.

This also isn’t SeatGeek’s first time teaming up with a popular app. The company partnered with Snapchat in 2018, allowing users to buy tickets directly within the social app.

Separately, Spotify’s latest earnings call occurred last week, where the company reported having more than 750 million monthly users and 290 million paid subscribers. Spotify projects these numbers will rise to 759 million users and 293 million paid subscribers in the current quarter, highlighting its continued focus on profitability.

            <div id="article-text">Amazon has hundreds of thousands of robots in its warehouses, but that doesn’t mean all of its robotic initiatives are a success story.

The ecommerce giant has halted its Blue Jay warehouse robotics project just months after unveiling the tech, as originally reported by Business Insider and confirmed by TechCrunch.

Blue Jay, a multi-armed robot designed to sort and move packages, was unveiled in October for use in the company’s same-day delivery facilities. At the time, the company was testing the robots at a facility in South Carolina and said it took Amazon significantly less time to develop Blue Jay — only about a year— than it did to develop its other warehouse robots, a speed the company credited to advancements in AI.

Amazon spokesperson Terrance Clark told TechCrunch that Blue Jay was launched as a prototype — although that was not made clear in the company’s original press release.

The company plans to use Blue Jay’s core technology for other robotics “manipulation programs” with employees who worked on Blue Jay being moved to other projects.

“We’re always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,” Clark told TechCrunch over email. “In this case, we’re actually accelerating the use of the underlying technology developed for Blue Jay, and nearly all of the technologies are being carried over and will continue to support employees across our network.”

Amazon also unveiled the Vulcan robot last year, which is used in the storage compartments of the company’s warehouses. Vulcan is a two-armed robot, with one arm meant to rearrange and move items in a compartment while the other is equipped with a camera and suction cups to grab goods. The Vulcan can allegedly “feel” the objects that it touches and was trained on data gathered from real-world interactions.

Amazon has been developing its internal robotics program since 2012 when it purchased Kiva Systems, a robotics company whose warehouse automation technology formed the foundation of Amazon’s fulfillment operations. It surpassed 1 million robots in its warehouses last July.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mastodon, a decentralized, open source social media platform and alternative to larger apps like X and Threads, announced on Wednesday its plans to make its app more approachable for newcomers while also targeting creators with the launch of new features.

The changes follow the expansion of Mastodon’s core development team over the past 18 months to include people with experience across web and mobile and backend, as well as the hiring of a dedicated designer, according to a new blog post co-authored by Mastodon’s technical director, Renaud Chaput, and product designer, Imani Joy. The post outlines the app’s future direction.

The app, which is part of the fediverse — a larger, decentralized social web operating on the ActivityPub protocol — was thrust back into the spotlight when Elon Musk acquired Twitter, now called X, in October 2022. Since then, it has seen occasional growth spurts, but has often struggled to retain new users due to its more complicated setup. On Mastodon, you don’t simply create an account with a username and password; you also have to pick a server to join — an additional step that often confuses those new to decentralization.

Today, Mastodon sees somewhere between 750,000 and 1 million monthly active users, depending on the source. One third-party tracker puts the figure closer to 750,000, while another estimates as many as 1 million. Mastodon’s own site says the figure is around 785,000.

As part of its coming updates, the organization says it will try to make this onboarding process more understandable, while also promoting smaller servers.

To date, new users have often defaulted to picking the largest servers, but that undermines the power of a decentralized web. As the blog post notes, “Mastodon is best when communities are spread across many independent servers, each with its own character and focus.”

New admin tools will help indie server operators handle maintenance and moderation duties more easily, including a feature to use external blocklists. The organization will also offer ways to set up content scanning for detecting illegal content and spam, along with other tools to reduce media storage usage by serving remote media posts through a trusted third party.

In addition, Mastodon will look to bring on more content creators, including public figures, journalists, and institutions, with a series of updates to its app. To do so, it’s introducing a redesigned user profile that lets individuals showcase their work as well as an enhanced compose experience. Also in the works is a new email notification option that would allow someone to follow their updates, even if they don’t yet have a Mastodon account. That could appeal to those who want to follow newsletter writers, reporters, thought leaders, and other creators, while allowing those creators to reach a wider audience.

The changes follow the rollout of other new features in recent months, including Quote Posts, similar to the feature on X and others, but with more user controls, and plans for its own take on Starter Pack-style user recommendations, called Collections.

The updates follow a shift in leadership at Mastodon: founder Eugen Rochko stepped down as CEO after the platform announced its transition to a nonprofit structure at the beginning of the year. In his place, Austria-based Felix Hlatky, has taken over as executive director. In addition, Mastodon recently announced it will split Hlatky’s duties with Dr. Marius Rothermund, a certified German lawyer. Dr. Rothermund will primarily provide legal expertise during the restructuring, which involves three markets — the U.S., Germany, and Belgium.

            <div id="article-text">The data breach that hit blockchain-based lending giant Figure affected nearly a million customers, according to a security researcher.

Last week, Figure confirmed a data breach allowed hackers to steal “a limited number of files” from its systems. The company did not provide specifics on what kind of data was stolen nor say how many customers were affected.

On Wednesday, Troy Hunt, a security researcher and creator of the data breach notification site Have I Been Pwned, analyzed the data allegedly taken from Figure and found it contained 967,200 unique email addresses associated with Figure customers.

The data also included customer names, dates of birth, physical addresses, and phone numbers.

Figure did not respond to a request for comment, and to ask if the company disputes Hunt’s findings.

The cybercrime group ShinyHunters told TechCrunch last week that it was to blame for the cyberattack targeting Figure. The group published 2.5 gigabytes of data allegedly stolen from Figure on its leak website, where the hackers shame their victims and publish stolen data if they fail to extort the hacked companies.

            <div id="article-text">Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs has secured a $200 million investment from software design giant Autodesk as part of a larger $1 billion round from backers including AMD, Emerson Collective, Fidelity, Nvidia, and others.

World Labs, which emerged from stealth in 2024 with $230 million at a $1 billion valuation, declined to say whether the latest round boosted its valuation. However, reports a month ago suggested it was aiming to raise at a $5 billion valuation.

The partnership between World Labs and Autodesk will see the two companies collaborating to explore how World Labs’ models — AI systems that can generate and reason about immersive 3D environments — can work alongside Autodesk’s tools, and vice versa, starting with a focus on entertainment use cases.

For World Labs, Autodesk’s investment is a signal that its product has commercial appeal. The startup’s first world model product, Marble, released last November, lets users create editable, downloadable 3D environments.

Autodesk is one of the biggest developers of 3D CAD (computer-aided design) software. Its platform underpins architectural, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and entertainment workflows. That focus on the built world makes investment in advanced spatial AI a natural extension of its core business.

Or as Li put it in a statement: “Autodesk has long helped people think spatially and solve real-world problems and, together, we share a clear purpose: building physical AI that augments human creativity and puts more powerful tools in the hands of designers, builders, and creators.”

As part of the deal, Autodesk will serve as an advisor to World Labs, and the two will collaborate at the “research and model level.”

Daron Green, Autodesk’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch the partnership is still in its early days, so the precise form it’s going to take hasn’t been determined yet.

“You could anticipate us consuming their models or them consuming our models in different settings,” Green said.

He mused that customers might like to start with a world-model-based sketch in World Labs (say, of an office layout) and then drill down on certain design aspects (like the design of the desk), which is where Autodesk’s tech might come in.

“Similarly, you might want to take an object that you’ve designed in our [platform], and put it in a context that you create through one of [World Labs’] prompts,” Green said.

Green added that data sharing is not part of the agreement.

Green said the two companies plan to start with media and entertainment use cases. Most companies building world models — including Google DeepMind and Runway — see gaming and interactive entertainment as an initial go-to-market strategy.

Autodesk already works with most major media production companies and has been training models for character animation.

“These are close to world models,” Green said. “They’re a characterization of an animal in the world that’s responding to physical constraints like time, maybe a terrain it needs to traverse. So there’s a physical understanding in the model, and you can see how that might be combined [with World Labs’ tech]. You’re not just animating the dog, but you’re giving it a world within which it can now interact.”

The partnership with World Labs supports Autodesk’s broader push to integrate more AI features across its software portfolio. The company is developing “neural CAD,” a new kind of generative AI model trained on geometric data that can reason about components and entire systems. Put simply, it can generate working 3D models, not just images, with an understanding of how those designs would function in the real world.

Autodesk’s neural CAD models are already being integrated into the firm’s product design and architecture products as a step toward more advanced spatial intelligence. But World Labs’ models could help extend that capability beyond individual design files toward more holistic digital representations of the physical world.

Green thinks different AI systems, including large language models, world models, and neural CAD will be combined in the future to improve designs for Autodesk’s customers.

“If AI is to be truly useful, it must understand worlds, not just words,” Li said in the statement. “Worlds are governed by geometry, physics, and dynamics, and reconciling the semantic, spatial, and physical is the next great frontier of AI.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google on Wednesday introduced its latest entry-level Pixel smartphone. The $499 Pixel 10a launches with new AI software capabilities and minor hardware updates. The smartphone is available for preorder now with shipments starting March 5.  It comes in Lavender, Berry, Fog, and Obsidian.

The Pixel 10a features a completely flat back, which means the camera bar blends with the back of the phone and lies flat when you place it down on a surface.

Google notes that the smartphone’s 6.3-inch Actua display is 11% brighter than the Pixel 9a. It also has faster charging than its predecessor, with more than 30 hours of battery life and up to 120 hours with the “Extreme Battery Saver” setting turned on.

The Pixel 10a comes with the same Tensor G4 chip that powered last year’s Pixel 9a. It features a 48 MP main camera, which Google says is the best camera on a phone under $500, along with a 13 MP ultrawide camera.

After debuting a set of AI-powered camera features on the Pixel 10 series last summer, Google is now bringing them to the A-series phone. The “Auto Best Take” feature captures multiple frames in one shutter press and automatically selects the best version so everyone looks good in a group photo, while the “Camera Coach” feature gives users step-by-step guidance on lighting and composition.

Additionally, Google is bringing Satellite SOS to the A-series for the first time, allowing users to connect with emergency services even when they don’t have Wi-Fi or cellular service.

As with recent Pixel phones, the Pixel 10a will come with seven years of software and security updates.

It’s worth noting that the Pixel 10a doesn’t have the “PixelSnap” magnetic Qi charging feature on the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.

The smartphone’s arrival comes just ahead of Apple’s upcoming new entry-level phone, the iPhone 17e. The device is expected to cost $599, like last year’s iPhone 16e.

Google also announced that it’s launching Pixel Buds 2a in two new colors, Berry and Fog, to go with the Pixel 10a.

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, David opens with a warning about President Trump’s escalating efforts to bend American institutions to his will. David explains how episodes including the Justice Department’s attempted prosecution of members of Congress, the political pressure on the Federal Reserve, and the campaign-style appeals delivered at Fort Bragg represent a systematic attempt to erode the guardrails of American democracy.

Then, David is joined by Mona Charen, a contributor at The Bulwark and longtime conservative commentator. Together, they reflect on their shared political evolution—from their early days as Reagan-era conservatives to their break with today’s Republican Party. They discuss what they believe they got right and what they got wrong, how Trump transformed the conservative movement, and why the version of conservatism they once believed in may be gone.

Finally, David discusses “My Early Beliefs,” the 1938 essay by John Maynard Keynes, and explores what Keynes’s reflections on changing one’s mind can teach us about political growth.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest this week will be Mona Charen, and we will be discussing things we’ve changed our mind about since our days as young Reaganites a long, long time ago.

My book this week will be an essay on a similar theme, “My Early Beliefs,” by John Maynard Keynes, in which the great English philosopher and economist discusses how his views had changed from the early 20th century to the time in which he delivered this essay, just before the Second World War.

But before either the dialogue or the book, some thoughts about a remarkable development in the week just past. One of the defining characteristics of the Trump years has been the determination of President [Donald] Trump and the people around him to turn into instruments of presidential will federal agencies that were always thought of as more or less independent and apolitical. The Department of Justice, well, it’s part of the administration, for sure, and the attorney general is an appointee of the president. But there had always been a belief that the actions of the Department of Justice, especially the criminal-enforcement actions, were not dictated for political reasons by the president.

Well, that idea has just gone up in smoke in the Trump years. This has been the most nakedly political Department of Justice perhaps since [President] Warren Harding’s in the 1920s and maybe the most in history because of the recent event where Jeanine Pirro, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia—supposedly acting on her own but obviously acting at the command of Attorney General [Pam] Bondi, who was acting, obviously, at the command of Donald Trump—when the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia actually tried to indict six members of Congress, four of them members of the House of Representatives, two of them United States senators, for making a video urging U.S. military personnel to obey lawful orders and not to obey illegal orders, which you would think is something that would be as basic as telling the president of the United States not to take bribes. How could such a statement be controversial unless the president was taking bribes and unless the military was contemplating illegal orders? So they took offense for that reason, and they tried to prosecute members of Congress.

Now, the speech of members of Congress is protected not only by the First Amendment, like as yours and mine is, but by the speech and debate clause of the Constitution, which puts very severe limits on the ability of anybody to punish a member of Congress for something that the member of Congress said. And yet the Department of Justice tried just that. Happily, a grand jury completely rejected the charges—there was reportedly not a single member of the grand jury who took this seriously; it was unanimous rejection, an unparalleled humiliation for the Trump Justice Department. But the litigation of other attacks on those members of Congress continues.

At the same time, we saw in this past weekend a really shocking event, where President Trump traveled to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Fort Bragg is now Fort Bragg again—it was renamed, and it’s now de-renamed—and so Fort Bragg is what we will call it. And at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, a state where there’s a Senate election in 2026, a Senate election that may prove decisive for controlling the balance of the United States Senate after 2026, President Trump appeared onstage with the Republican candidate for Senate and urged military personnel to vote for that candidate.

President Donald Trump: We have another man who is running for the Senate, Michael Whatley, if here’s here—I don’t know. Michael? Michael. (Applause.) Michael, will you come here for a second, please? He’s running for the Senate. And if he gets in, you’re gonna be taken care of. If he doesn’t get in, we’re gonna be stripping the military like they always do, the Democrats.

Frum: The military is, of course, the most important apolitical institution. Presidents address the military all the time, but they are not supposed to make political speeches, rally speeches, to ask the military to vote a certain way. That’s unheard of. That’s shocking. It’s the prelude to authoritarian rule.

Now, fortunately, again, as with the rejection of the attempt to indict members of Congress for what they said, the attempt to mobilize the troops as political actors, that also looks to have fallen flat. Reporters who were present noted that the soldiers, who maybe were warned by their commanding officers, made a point of clapping for the president’s appearance, clapping when the president talked about raising their pay—well, that’s traditional—but keeping very quiet when the president made his pitch that they should vote for the president’s preferred candidate for United States Senate. But in both cases, these are mere instances of failure, not stories of the successful pushback by institutions. But there is a story from the past week that is a much happier story about institutions actually resisting.

One of the most important independent institutions in the United States government is the Federal Reserve. Again, the president appoints members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, but they are not in any way the president’s creatures. And the theory of the Federal Reserve—which is created by act of Congress, not by an action of the executive—is: The Federal Reserve makes monetary policy based on facts and realities, as best they can determine in their judgment, and not for political reasons. There have been deviations from this ideal; they’ve usually ended in catastrophe: inflations, depressions. And in recent times, the Federal Reserve has been generally regarded by all people, Republicans and Democrats, as setting a model of independence.

President Trump has now made some new appointments to the Federal Reserve. He’s appointed a new chairman to replace Jerome Powell, the existing chairman; Powell’s term expires in May, and President Trump has put forward a nominee. But not content with simply replacing Powell, which, of course, is his right as Powell’s term expires, President Trump has tried to put pressure on Powell to cut interest rates by bringing up all incredible things or by preparing to bring—it’s not filed yet—a criminal investigation of Powell for some series of nonsense charges. Now, the charges aren’t filed, but the president has been huffing and puffing and the Department of Justice has been subpoenaing Powell as if these actions were ready.

And at the same time, he has brought forward a successor—[Kevin] Warsh looks like a solid B, maybe a B-plus nominee. He looks a little partisan. That is, he’s a Republican, of course, and in Democratic terms, he’s always calling for higher interest rates; in Republican terms, he calls for lower interest rates. He seems to be much more a creature of politics than an ideal Fed chairman should be. But he’s obviously an intelligent person, he’s got some knowledge and experience, and he’s not the cringing sycophant that some of the other candidates for the job that Trump might have chosen were. So in a pretty unimpressive Westminster dog show, he may be the least mangy poodle, so fine; pick [Kevin] Warsh.

But Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who is outgoing, has said, I am not going to consider any nominee by the president, meritorious or not, unless we end these full prosecutions, these sinister prosecutions, that Trump has instituted against one Federal Reserve governor already, Lisa Cook, and is threatening against another, Jerome Powell, because they wouldn’t cut interest rates as fast as he wanted. Until these prosecutions are at an end, no consideration of any nominee whatsoever. And because of the closely balanced nature of the Senate and the rules of the Senate, Tillis may be able to make this stick. And if he is joined by other United States senators, then there’s a real trial of strength to say, The president cannot treat the Federal Reserve as an instrument of his vengeance and policy and his crass ambitions to cut interest rates and try to get some inflationary juice into the economy before the election of 2026. No one will be considered until the prosecutions are ended.

That’s more than just a defeat; that is institutional counterpoise against the attempt by the president to corrupt institutions. He has successfully corrupted the Department of Justice. He’s trying to corrupt the military, so far with minimal success, but things may get worse. And he is attempting against the Federal Reserve. In the Federal Reserve case, there is resistance, and Senator Tillis is doing exactly the right thing, and let us hope that more senators join him: absolutely no consideration of any Trump nominee to the Federal Reserve until this menace against the existing governors is completely dropped, quashed, withdrawn, defeated, given up, abandoned, sealed forever—only then.

And the irony, of course, is that if President Trump doesn’t do this and the Senate continues not to act, Powell’s term continues. He remains as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors even if he’s not chairman. He will stay on the Board of Governors, and the Board of Governors can at that point elect its own acting chairman, and it may still be Powell. So the punishment for Trump’s attempt to pervert the Federal Reserve may be getting more of what he doesn’t like, which would be a fit irony. But the best outcome: End this nonsense. Ideally, replace Bondi with an attorney general with some integrity, but failing even that, just end these shameless prosecutions, end these shameless acts of intimidation, drop the cases, close them, and then let the Senate consider the Warsh nomination on its merits, such as they are.

Frum: Mona Charen is a contributor and podcaster at The Bulwark. A graduate of Barnard, she began her career in journalism at National Review. During the Reagan administration, she served as Nancy Reagan’s speechwriter. She was a panelist on CNN’s Capital Gang in the 1990s and is the author of four books, most recently, Hard Right: The GOP’s Drift Toward Extremism, published in 2023. She was an early and prominent leader of the Never Trump movement and stayed that way. Mona was also one of the very first people to welcome my wife and me to Washington when we arrived in the 1990s, so it’s a double pleasure to welcome her today on The David Frum Show. Mona, thank you for joining.

Mona Charen: So glad to do so. David, you guys improved Washington immensely. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) All right, so let me ask you, for the benefit of those whose memory has lapsed or who were maybe born more recently than some of us—

Charen: A lot of people were born more recently than we. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) Would you mind recapitulating your political journey, from the start until Donald Trump appeared on the scene a decade ago?

Charen: Well, I don’t wanna bore people too much, but I became interested in politics out of a sense of gratitude. My family came to this country at the turn of the century—turn of the last century, I should say. And I became aware at a young age of what had happened to Jews who were left behind in the communities from which my grandparents had fled and understood that this was political in nature. And so when I was in my adolescence, not something I recommend as a fun way to spend your teenage years, but I sort of immersed myself in Holocaust studies and trying to make sense of how human beings could have done that. And the result was that it made me very, very grateful for the institutions, the stability, the human-rights protections that the United States affords, and so that kind of made me a conservative. Some people have said the primary emotional response of a conservative is gratitude, whereas the primary emotional response of a liberal is dissatisfaction, wanting to improve things.

And so I became interested in reading conservative writings. I also was highly aware that totalitarianism wasn’t just a phenomenon of the right, with the Nazis and the fascists, but that the communists were just as bad, or almost as bad, I would say. And so I was an anti-communist from a young age as well, became a conservative, began reading Bill Buckley in my local paper, and then reading National Review, then began to read other conservative thinkers. I was very drawn to Edmund Burke because he was—it spoke to me, right? He was a gradualist. He didn’t want any abrupt changes that he saw as dangerous and possibly contributing to despotism. And so that’s how I became a conservative, and I stayed that way for a very long time. And I was a conservative columnist and speaker and all of that—pundit. But with the rise of Trump, I saw the destruction of pretty much everything that—

Frum: —I want to take the story up to 2016 and then slow down. I wanna go fast through the—

Frum: So where were you in the election of 2012?

Charen: I felt that [Barack] Obama was a bad president. I didn’t agree with a lot of the things that he did. I liked that Romney—I remember when Romney was asked which industries the U.S. should be backing as the industries of the future and he said, I don’t know. And he said, And no one else knows either. I loved that. (Laughs.) That kind of modesty about what government can do or know, I liked all of that, so.

Frum: So you were on board with the conservative program into the second Obama term.

Frum: When Donald Trump declared for president on that June day in 2015, did you take it seriously?

Charen: No, not a bit. And I remember, I think it was the Huffington Post said that they were going to only cover him in their entertainment coverage, not in their political coverage, and I thought that was about right.

Frum: At what point did you decide or accept that this might be a real thing?

Charen: When he continued to dominate the polls, when I saw that even the grotesque—there are a few things that stand out, of course, but the threatening violence against protesters at his rallies, mocking a handicapped reporter, scorning John McCain’s heroism—all of those things that I thought would have disqualified him obviously didn’t, and I began to worry. And then I remember, the primaries in 2015 really gave me chills that—or I guess it would have been 2016 by then—

Frum: So this is a very full buffet, and you can have more than one serving and make more than one trip. But as I hear you talking about your reaction, you are emphasizing, in the first trip to the buffet, the human qualities of Donald Trump. As you’re describing it here, that was the first reaction, the first repulsion.

Frum: And how did the rest follow? Because you start with a human reaction, but since then, you’ve had, as we’ll continue to discuss, a pretty dramatic political evolution. But you started with a human response, that this human being was violent and disgusting.

Charen: Yes, but he was also the antithesis of what I regarded as conservative virtues. So for example, he encouraged people to believe that he personally, through force of will, could solve huge problems that face us as a country. I thought that was the antithesis of everything that conservatism believed; it was Caesarism.

And then, of course, all of his various heresies, like his attacks on free trade and his racism, which, again, I thought was the fulfillment of every fever dream of the left that thought conservatives were all racists underneath, that if you scratched them, you’d find that they were really racist. And here, along comes Trump, who confirms this. So I resented that as well.

Frum: You were one of the contributors to the 2016 Never Trump special issue of National Review. I recently went back and looked at that. There about two dozen contributors. Some stayed true to their original position. Some flipped. Some have just become kind of shifty. (Laughs.)

Frum: But was that a moment where you still regarded yourself as a member in good standing of the conservative community?

Charen: Oh, boy, that feels like a lifetime ago, but at the time, we still believed, I guess, naively, that National Review had the kind of authority within the movement that we could speak ex cathedra and anathematize Donald Trump, and that people would take that seriously and they would say, Well, look at all these conservatives of long standing, who have stature within the movement, and therefore, if they say he’s not good, then that will be crippling for—I don’t know if we quite thought it’d be crippling, but we did think we had influence, and we didn’t.

Frum: Well, and I should stress that that issue was published, I believe, in January of 2016, so before any Republican primaries. Conservatives had the memory that, in 2012, there had been a lot of wacky novelty candidates who rose in the polls.

Frum: Date Michele Bachmann; marry Mitt Romney.

Frum: And I think a lot of people in January 2016 thought, That’s going to be the pattern here again.

Frum: Date Donald Trump; marry Marco Rubio.

Charen: Yep, that’s right. Herman Cain—yeah, there were a bunch of them—and Ben Carson, of course, also ran in 2016, and I thought he was similar. And I remember discussing this with other people in 2012, that it was a little dismaying to see what was happening in the primaries and saying, The base has some appetites here that are a little worrisome. And in the end, they settled on Romney, but it was a tell that they were flirting with all those other sort of crazy candidates.

Frum: All right, so where were you on Election Night 2016? Do you remember?

Charen: I should have been. (Laughs.) Yeah, no, I was at my computer live-blogging and live-tweeting and all that, yeah.

Frum: So when do you internalize that there may be a bigger set of issues here than just the human reaction to Donald Trump, that he’s speaking to somebody, and he’s speaking to a lot of people, and he’s speaking to a lot of people that you knew and trusted, and not just the famous base but to peers and friends of yours? How does that dawn begin to rise?

Charen: Well, [National Review editor] Jonah Goldberg put it best many, years ago where he had an article where he said it was watching people that he knew and believed he understood gradually become Trumpy was like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where people, they just were absorbed into this thing. And so I watched one after another, and for a long time, it was a subject of grief for me that I watched these people that I respected bend the knee. It was an ongoing process that took years, and during that time, unfortunately, I lost many friends.

Frum: So Jonah Goldberg, whom you know well and I know, I think, less well, but I know, he would say—and I’m not going to gainsay this, although I think these statements can’t ever be fully true—but he would say, I haven’t changed my mind. I’ve stayed here, and the world has moved, but I’ve been constant. I certainly wouldn’t make that claim for myself. In fact, I’ve changed my mind about a lot of things, some of them in reaction to Donald Trump, some of them in reaction to other things. Where would you situate yourself in that spectrum of saying, I’ve stayed put; the world has moved, and my statement: The world moved, and I moved with it and against it, but I moved too.

Charen: So there did come a point after the initial shock and grief where I was actually not quite grateful, but at least appreciative of the fact that, in my 60s, because of the changing nature of American life, I was forced to reevaluate many things and see it through new eyes and including looking back at my own beliefs and possibly changing my mind on things. And I felt, in a way—I wouldn’t have chosen it, but I did feel like it was a bit of a gift because at our stage of life, people mostly get stuck and rigid, and so I was forced to be a little bit more flexible, and I’ve changed my mind about many things. Look, there are certain things that I still believe and have always believed, but I find myself without a political party that also believes those things, so.

Frum: I’m gonna give you, then, in a moment, an inventory of things you’ve changed your mind about and things you have not.

Frum: You decide which of those inventories you’d like to catalog first.

Charen: So one big thing is I’ve always been interested in race relations and racial progress in America. If I go back on my work over the decades, I wrote a lot about school choice and about school reform and about family formation and other things where I felt that those were the areas to focus on to lift up African Americans, who lag behind whites and Hispanics on many social indexes. But part of my focus was a belief that the worst days of racism were really behind us, that only really kooks and fringe figures were still, like, old-fashioned racists in America, and that the new problems were things like the teachers’ unions were too powerful and didn’t allow school experimentation and reform, and family structure was a problem in the Black community—of course, in all communities, but it started in the Black community, with family breakup—and that we needed to focus more on building up family structure because that was so important for people’s success.

And what I saw in the last 10 years showed me that I had underestimated the degree to which the naked racism that had been part of American history, and which I was very familiar with but did not think persisted to this day, I now think that was wrong, that there is a tremendous amount of it and that it was naive of me to believe that we had conquered it. So that’s one thing.

Frum: Where are the things that you feel like, I’m still the same as ever; I still believe these things?

Charen: So I still believe that free markets are the best approach to many public-policy challenges. I still believe passionately in free trade. Looking for a party. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) Yes, that is the issue where there was the most continuity between Trump 1 and [President Joe] Biden and now Trump 2, wasn’t it, that—

Frum: I had the recent experience of talking to a group of important Democrats and saying, I just want you all to repeat after me the words free trade.

Frum: They just can’t. Free and fair trade—no, no. No, no: free trade.

Frum: Can’t do it. And say, “Tariffs are bad.” And they say, Well, I’m against dumb tariffs.

Frum: I say, As opposed to smart tariffs? There are smart tariffs? For ideological reasons, for interest-group reasons, it’s very hard for—and there’s a lot of this—if we do move beyond Trump, I worry how much the next president, if there is a free and fair election in ’28, how much will the next president unravel, considering how little of the tariffs of Trump 1 Biden unraveled?

Charen: Yeah, agreed. So that’s one. Similarly, I continue to believe in market-oriented solutions to climate change. I think that the idea of creating prizes for new technology or all these kinds of things that economists have taught us are effective, that’s the direction that I would go. I’m afraid, again, there’s no constituency for that.

Let’s see. Fiscal discipline, worry about the debt—again, no party. (Laughs.) But more deeply, I am a believer in tradition and procedure and law and respect for tradition, so that’s one of the things that I find most horrifying about this populist era that we’re in, is that, going back to our earlier conversation about why I became a conservative, it’s the institutions, the procedures, the protections in law that it took hundreds and hundreds of years to enshrine in our system are critical, and so the idea that President Trump is now running roughshod over law and has allies aplenty in the MAGA movement who are ready—in his first term, he was trying to do it pretty much by himself; now he has eager allies. They’re destroying our system of justice and civil liberties in this country, and they’re destroying our international posture. And maybe I should mention, as that’s another thing I still believe in, I still believe the United States should be the leader of the free world, should have alliances, should stand up for countries that are invaded by aggressive neighbors, rather than finding common cause with their oppressors.

Frum: You put your finger there on something that I’ve really been wrestling with a lot, and I recently had this conversation with David Brooks, so let me raise it again with you. And I don’t have yet a developed view on this—I think about it all the time, so I don’t wanna be glib and pretend this is an easy question, and at the end of it, if you were to turn the tables, I wouldn’t know what to answer. So that said, there is a big part of me that wishes that [Attorney General] Merrick Garland and Joe Biden were right in their first-term approach, which is: Donald Trump was this unfortunate error that the American people made. They’d had a pretty good track record of picking presidents to that point; they got one wrong. The Electoral College was maybe to blame. And the thing to do was just to tidy up the mess and move on with as little recrimination and backward-looking as possible.

There is another view, which is: That failed, that Trump came back. As he often said of himself, “I became worse”; he did. The people around him became even worse than that. And we have now a full-throated attack on every American institution, the abuse of law, and it’s not clear to me you can just dust this off and tidy up and move forward without serious backward-looking and accountability. I wrestle with that question. Do you have any guidance to offer, or are you as stuck in the predicament as I am?

Charen: So I guess what you’re describing is lustration. And I think, in order to get to that point, you have to be more advanced than we are. We are still too divided and polarized to even begin to grapple with “How do we fix and put back together what’s been destroyed?” So part of the problem with the Merrick Garland thing was, and the whole approach—the people who said, Trump is a criminal, and we have to prosecute him, and they believed very firmly in the justice of that, and I understand it, but at the same time, it was done badly, I think, because that New York case really was politically motivated, and it’s the one case that they got. But it allowed the MAGA forces to say, You see? Both sides abused the judicial system for political ends, and therefore, when we do it, it’s just what was done to us. This is just payback. And so that’s a risk when you decide to use the justice system that way.

I hope that there will come a time when there’s enough recognition across party lines that we’ve gone off the rails that there will be an openness to a true accounting. There are people who are committing real crimes, including the president of the United States right now. The blowing up people in boats who you just suspect may be drug traffickers is a prime example. But it’s gonna take time and a huge amount of persuasion, and more than the persuasion, it’s gonna take more experience of the awfulness for the American people to get to the point where they’re ready for an accounting.

Frum: Let me go back to the very beginning and raise something, and this is something I think we share. I think we both came to conservatism in great part because of our Jewish identity, because of our inheritance of mass murder of the Jewish people in Europe. In my case, it was almost all of my father’s family came out and they lived, and the vast majority of his family who were left behind, they died. And had my father’s parents made a slightly different decision in 1930, my father would have been murdered at about the time of his ninth, 10th, or 11th birthday. So that’s the starting point, I think, of both of our politics: We come to conservatism by our Jewishness.

The Trump presidency has raised some very special questions, very haunting questions for American Jews. On the one hand, as you say, it’s a highly bigoted presidency, a highly chauvinist presidency, and Trump certainly has won the support of people who are increasingly not only outspoken, but flamboyantly anti-Semitic. At the same time, Donald Trump acted to support Israel, to win a much more decisive outcome in the Gaza war than the Biden presidency or a Kamala Harris presidency. And he’s acted against the Iranian nuclear program, which is an existential genocidal threat to the half the Jewish people who live in Israel.

Most American Jews are opposed to the Trump presidency, but many of the most active and prominent American Jews are quite passionately in support of his presidency for the reasons I mentioned and for others as well. How do you, as someone who, as you said, began your political journey because of this Jewish inheritance, how do you make sense of Trump as a Jewish woman?

Charen: My feeling about this is—there are a couple. One is that there is a tendency all too common to say, Well, whatever else he may be, at least he’s good for my group. And that is not a principled position to take, in my opinion, but also, I think it misses the bigger importance of what his destructiveness means for the Jewish people, among many others, because he is destroying the United States as a bulwark of free nations and a strong alliance. And so even though for now, he has taken positions that seem to please the [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu government and supporters of Israel, first of all, he’s for sale, so who knows if that will last. It’s never about his true beliefs; it’s always about what’s good for him, and certainly, there are many people on the planet who have a lot more to offer him in that regard than the Jews do, so who knows how long that would last. But also, a secure Israel and a secure Jewish people depend on moral and principled leadership of the United States.

So let’s leave Israel aside for just a second. What Trump is doing to poison the social conversation here at home, to allow in these voices, to really mainstream people like Nick Fuentes and Tucker Carlson, that is deeply frightening. That’s where we live. (Laughs.) And it is opening the door to the kind of—there’s a lot of left-wing anti-Semitism, but frankly, the right-wing variety still scares me a little more because it is truly Nazi-like in its ferocity against Jews.

Frum: Yeah. Let me push back on that just a little, and again, I say this in a spirit of uncertainty, not in the spirit of argument. So the polls look pretty bad for Trump and his party at the moment that we speak. Who knows whether that will continue. Who knows whether Trump will try to find some way, by fraud or by force, to seek a third term. He says so, and I think by now, we should take those warnings seriously, although the body does fail us all in the end. Trump’s running mate and the presumptive front-runner for the 2028 Republican nomination, assuming there’s still a Constitution in 2028, is J. D. Vance, who’s very close to Tucker Carlson, and I will argue this with some of my more, again, Israel-oriented Republican friends, but I think is clearly not a friend to either the Jewish state or the Jewish people.

On the other hand, assuming there is an election and J. D. Vance is the Republican nominee, he will be running against a nominee from a party that just vetoed the most plausible-looking running mate for Kamala Harris because he was Jewish and because he wouldn’t renounce his support for Israel and wouldn’t hedge his condemnation of anti-Semitic outbursts on American college campuses, and where important voices in that party are saying that the test, their most important test for their support in 2028 is Holocaust inversion, that they are looking for a nominee who will say that the perpetrators of the attempted annihilation of Israel on October 7, 2023, that those attempted perpetrators were the victims of a Nazi-like genocide and the victims, who fought back in self-defense, they were the Nazis who committed a genocide. And that’s, for important parts of the Democratic Party, going to be the litmus test for their candidate in 2028.

It’s great that everyone’s so interested in the Jews as the Issue One. (Laughs.) I sometimes wonder, Why did we have to be so fascinating?

Charen: (Laughs.) You know that old saying—there are only two kinds of people in the world who are fascinated by Jews: Jews and anti-Semites. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) Well, yeah, but it turns out that, well, a lot of people are fascinated by Jews. So how do you make sense of this, is [the fact] that you may, given life and health and the continued existence of the United States Constitution, may be called upon next time to make a choice between someone who is backed by domestic anti-Semitism and someone who won their nomination by making some kind of deal or arrangement or truce with those who do Holocaust inversion against the Jewish state and the Jewish people?

Charen: Yeah. It’s a very, very difficult time for the Jewish people, honestly. I think we were born at a time after the Holocaust when anti-Semitism was at epic low rates because of the Holocaust, and that is over. Our children and grandchildren will not be living in that world; they’ll be living in a world where it’s come roaring back. And you’re right—the problem on the left is considerable, but it’s untested as of now. So we know that the anti-Semites are very close to power on the Republican side. As you say, J. D. Vance is very close to Tucker Carlson, and Candace Owens is a huge influencer, and all of that. On the left, it is, for now, the precinct of the hard-left progressives. It’s untested as to whether that will become the dominant strain in the Democratic Party. We’ll see. That would be very, very worrisome.

Frum: Let me, as we wind up, take you back to the beginning and ask you, as you look back on the political views you had in the earlier part of your life, do you now feel regret or do you feel like, I got benefit from it even if I don’t hold to all of it these days?

Charen: Got benefit from what—from the views?

Frum: The things I believed between age 20 and age 40, I regret those things, or I don’t regret them, because I couldn’t be where I am and, in fact, there’s some value to them.

Charen: No, there are certain things that I am proud of from that period. I was a firm anti-communist. I think it’s a great boon to humanity that communism is largely a thing of history now. And there are many other issues that I think conservatives were right about. But the world has changed. The conservatism that I signed up for is completely gone. There’s no coherent set of ideas that is held by a movement, far less a party, now that is recognizable.

Frum: Yeah, again, I may be projecting my own thoughts onto you. This is a question I’ve been wrestling with a lot; I’ve been thinking about this. I’ve been working on a memoir for a long time, and I’ve been wrestling with these questions, that there are things that, when I look back on the world of my early political views, things that I thought were important, that were the defining thing—as you say, anti-communism, free markets, free trade. And that turned out to be something I cared about but that most of the people I was associated with, turned out, they never cared about it very much at all. And then [there were] other things that I dismissed as irritating or awkward or embarrassing or marginal paranoias and bigotries and conspiracism, and that turned out to be really important to a lot of the people I was formerly associated with.

On the other hand, I do sometimes think that the reason for the prominence of the Never Trump Republicans in the anti-Trump coalition is not just their novelty value; I mean, everyone likes a conversion story. But also, I think there’s something important that we bring, and that is a sense of that this is a group that has a unique sense of the uniqueness of what is happening now. And I’m sure you’ve seen often in the comments you get from readers or viewers or listeners, they’ll say something [like], Aha, we warned you that the moment Dwight Eisenhower beat Adlai Stevenson, Trump was the inevitable outcome—

Frum: No, he’s not the inevitable outcome of Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush and George W. He’s different. And we’re here to tell you that as people who liked all those people. He’s different. And because we liked all those people, we can tell you how and why he’s different in a way that the typical commenter who’s blaming Dwight Eisenhower for being the start of Donald Trump can’t tell you.

Charen: Well, yeah, the people who are kind of—and I’ll say this—I think they’re kind of smug, and they say, This was always conservatism, and this is just the full flowering of all the things that conservatism always was. I say that is absolutely not the case. One thing that pops right into my head, for example: David Duke ran for governor of Louisiana. The president of the United States at the time was George H. W. Bush. He said, We want no part of him, even if he’s a Republican, even if he gets the Republican—that’s not who we are, etc. That was just normal, that the party would, and the movement would, reject that kind of thing. Today? They’d say, He’s anti-woke—

Frum: Make him the head of the Department of Homeland Security! (Laughs.)

Frum: He’s got the mission. (Laughs.) And he’s got a lot of guys who’d make perfect recruits for our new paramilitary force. (Laughs.)

Charen: Exactly, he can start making those videos for ICE. Yeah, no, it’s really sad and pathetic, but anyway. But that is different, and we’re here to report that we lived through it and we would not have tolerated that kind of thing. We left when this became the party. So it obviously wasn’t the party in 2000.

Frum: Yeah. Are there realistic circumstances where you can see yourself reimagining yourself as a Republican and a conservative again—obviously, there are fantastical circumstances, but realistic circumstances where you can imagine yourself feeling at home again?

Charen: Not until this whole generation dies off, and since I’m gonna die off before they do, no.

Charen: (Laughs.) Because the Republican Party and the conservative movement have both been so deeply corrupted. And so, no, I cannot imagine. There is an argument that, in the 1970s and 1980s, when the neoconservatives, who had all been Democrats—some of them remained Democrats—but when they moved toward the Republican Party, they brought with them a way of thinking and ideas that were incredibly rejuvenating for conservatism. And possibly, the migration of some former conservatives into the Democratic Party can do the same thing? That’s maybe a little bit fanciful, but I hope so.

Frum: And if you were to say, what are the gifts? What are the things that they might bring with them, like the magi?

Charen: (Laughs.) The appreciation—so I’ll tell you one quick story, if I can. I was at a meeting with a bunch of people who spanned the spectrum but leaned heavily to the left, and we were talking about how elections are run in this country. And before the advent of Trump, there were a lot of liberal reform bills and things that wanted to centralize the way we run elections in this country and limit the power of states to control it. And so I remember chatting with this person. I said, The fact that the Constitution gives this power to the states looks pretty good right now, doesn’t it? And he said, Yeah. (Laughs.) So some of those limitations on what government power can do, which are sort of our birthright as conservatives—we’re suspicious of government power. Unlike liberals, who always think only of what good it can do, we’re very imbued with, No, it can also be really, really dangerous. So maybe we bring a little bit of that perspective to policy making.

Frum: Tell us at the end, finally, about the work you’re doing now. What are the things that, in your personal work, you think are important, that get you up in the morning?

Charen: Well, sometimes it’s hard to get up in the morning because the news is really depressing. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) Okay, so while you’re there, in bed, pulling the covers over your head and thinking, Maybe this was all a terrible dream, the voice of conscience that says, No, you have to get out and doing, what is that voice reminding you of?

Charen: It is remembering how important—just [George] Orwell’s line about It’s the duty of intelligent men to state the obvious, keep saying it, being unafraid to say the things that a lot of people in mainstream media and, certainly, in the business world and in many of our institutions, people are afraid to be honest and tell the truth. And so those of us who have been foolish enough to lose all our friends by telling the truth in the past can continue to tell the truth as we see it, and maybe that still has value. (Laughs.)

Frum: Mona Charen, thank you so much for joining me today on The David Frum Show.

Frum: Thanks so much to Mona Charen for joining me today on The David Frum Show. As mentioned at the top, my book this week is actually an essay, “My Early Beliefs,” by the great English economist John Maynard Keynes. Since Mona and I spent so much time discussing our own political evolution, I thought it might be interesting to turn to what is maybe the most famous such discussion ever written, and that is Keynes’s essay, which he delivered as an after-dinner speech in 1938.

Keynes graduated from Cambridge in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1938, he and a group of his Cambridge friends gathered together for a dinner to look back on the changes in their lives over the past third of a century. Keynes delivered this paper talking about the way that he and his friends had changed their minds about important issues. In the last bit of this essay, which is only 13 pages long, Keynes reflects on one of the important shocks that came to him and came to his friends since their undergraduate days.

Now, the early part of the 20th century was, if you were an Englishman of bourgeois background, as Keynes was and as his friends were, a time of extraordinary security. Those of you who have recently watched on your own or with children the Mary Poppins movie will remember George Banks, the patriarch banker, singing, “It’s [grand] to be an Englishman in 1910.” And so, if you came from John Maynard Keynes’s background, so it was; it was good to be an Englishman in 1910 or 1904 or ’05, when Keynes was at Cambridge.

But in the interval between their undergraduate days and 1938, when the essay was delivered as an after-dinner speech, in that interval, the world had passed through the First World War, the Communist revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, the rise of fascism, inflations, depressions, and was now, in 1938, on the edge, very visibly, of a second and even more terrible world war. The age of security that Keynes had grown up in was gone forever, and a lot of Keynes’s thinking and work in his later years dealt with the shock to the sensibility of someone raised in that secure world of Edwardian England dealing with a new world of communism, fascism, wars, inflations, depressions.

And so I wanna quote from the later part of the essay a passage that I think resonates through the ages to our time now. He’s talking about this group of friends, and he says of them, “In short, we repudiated all versions of the doctrine of original sin, of there being insane and irrational springs of wickedness in most men. We were not aware that civilization was a thin and precarious crust erected by the personality and the will of a very few, and only maintained by rules and conventions skillfully put across and guilefully preserved. We had no respect for traditional wisdom or the restraints of custom. We lacked reverence … for [everything and everyone]. It did not occur to us to respect the extraordinary accomplishments of our predecessors [in] the ordering of life (as it now seems to me to have been) or the elaborate framework which they had devised to protect this order.”

As I look back on my early beliefs and the beliefs Mona and I discussed, I realized that Mona and I, our political evolution can be described by exactly the opposite direction. We began as young conservatives—in my case, as early as the 1970s—very aware of, as Keynes put it, that civilization was “a thin and precarious crust.” What we were not enough aware of was the flip side of that. Just as Keynes had to discover the power of order, I think Mona and I—I won’t speak for her; I’ll speak only for myself—that those of us who were conservatives then and are less conservative now, I don’t think we were aware enough that it wasn’t just order that was needed but also the justice and fairness that caused that order to be, to quote Keynes again, something a little bit more than “the personality and the will of a very few.” That the order that we valued so much gained its power because of a broad consensus based on the personality and the will of a great many, and the way to get that great many to back the order was through a sense in most people, in many people, that the order was just. And that if the order was ever felt to be unjust, unfair, to favor only that very few whom Keynes described, then it would have to be maintained in ways that were harsher and more tyrannical than the order that we valued and that we remembered.

I think we all go through evolutions in life, and that’s one of the tragic blessings or one of the blessed tragedies (laughs) of growing old is that you get this critical distance on what you thought before and what you think now. And maybe the outcome that we’re all groping to is to say, How do we hold onto things that we thought were true when we were young, that were correct intuitions when we were young, and how do we enrich them as we get older? That is the topic that Mona and I have spent our time together discussing, we’ve spent so many years of our lives working together on. I’m very glad to have had her today to discuss this working out with me on The David Frum Show.

Thanks so much to you for listening and watching The David Frum [Show]. I hope you will subscribe and share this program widely, that the success and continuation of the program depends on your subscriptions and your sharing. As always, the best way to support the work of this program, if you’re minded to do that, is by subscribing to The Atlantic, and then you can support the work not only of me but of all of my Atlantic colleagues. Thanks so much [for] joining me today on The David Frum Show. See you next week for another episode of The David Frum Show. Bye-bye.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/2026/02/nick-miroff-wins-2025-polk-award-immigration/686035/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Atlantic’s staff writer Nick Miroff is the recipient of the 2025 George Polk Award for immigration reporting for his coverage of the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Miroff broke the story in March 2025 that the Trump administration had erroneously deported Abrego Garcia to a Salvadoran prison despite his protected immigration status, and reported on developments before and after Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States.

At The Atlantic, Miroff has reported extensively on immigration and President Trump’s mass-deportation campaign, including breaking the news last month that Greg Bovino was ousted from his position as Border Patrol “commander at large”; chronicling battles raging inside the Department of Homeland Security; reporting on ICE’s status following its withdrawal from Minneapolis; revealing that more than a third of ICE recruits at the agency’s training academy in Georgia failed the ICE personal-fitness test; and co-reporting a profile of Stephen Miller, detailing how Miller acts as an accelerant for the president’s most incendiary impulses and shapes the lives of individual Americans in nearly every realm.

The George Polk Awards were established in 1949 to commemorate George Polk, a CBS correspondent murdered in 1948 while covering the Greek civil war. The awards place a premium on investigative and enterprising reporting that gains attention and achieves results, and honor special achievement in print, online, or broadcast journalism. An announcement is below from The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg:

Big news this morning: Nick Miroff has been named the winner of the 2025 George Polk Award for immigration reporting. This recognition is greatly deserved, because Nick has owned this beat like no other reporter. Working with his wonderful editor, Jenna Johnson, Nick has not only delivered scoop after scoop, but he has contextualized, deepened, and—this one is particularly important—complicated our understanding of America’s current immigration crisis. Though he is winning this award in large part for breaking the news of the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia (and for his continuing coverage of that case), Nick’s stories on the internal workings of ICE and other government bureaucracies deserve equal praise.

Nick only joined us last year, but he has made himself completely integral to The Atlantic’s reporting. As you all know, he also broke the story that Greg Bovino was ousted from his position as the Border Patrol’s “commander at large”; he covered the battles raging inside DHS; he revealed that more than a third of ICE recruits at the agency’s training academy in Georgia failed the ICE personal-fitness test; and he co-reported our recent excellent profile of Stephen Miller.

The Polk Awards are among journalism’s most prestigious, and I’m so pleased to see Nick—and Jenna, and the whole team—receive this outstanding recognition.

            <h2>The Worst-Case Future for White-Collar Workers</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/ai-white-collar-jobs/686031/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

White-collar workers are getting nervous, with good reason. Sure, 98 percent of college graduates who want a job still have one, and wages are ticking up. Sure, some companies that cite the labor-saving, efficiency-promoting effects of ChatGPT and Claude as they let employees go are just “AI washing”—talking about algorithms to distract from poor managerial decisions.

But the labor market for office workers is beginning to shift. Americans with a bachelor’s degree account for a quarter of the unemployed, a record. High-school graduates are finding jobs quicker than college graduates, an unprecedented trend. Occupations susceptible to AI automation have seen sharp spikes in joblessness. Businesses really are shrinking payroll and cutting costs as they deploy AI. In recent weeks, Baker McKenzie, a white-shoe law firm, axed 700 employees, Salesforce sacked hundreds of workers, and the auditing firm KPMG negotiated lower fees with its own auditor. Two CNBC reporters with no engineering experience “vibe-coded” a clone of Monday.com’s workflow-management platform in less than an hour. When they released their story, Monday.com’s stock tanked.

Maybe algorithm-driven changes will happen slowly, giving workers plenty of time to adjust. Maybe white-collar types have 12 to 18 months left. Maybe the AI-related job carnage will be contained to a sliver of the economy. Maybe we should be more worried about a stock-market bubble than an AI-driven labor revolution.

I don’t think anyone knows what will happen, or even what is happening now. AI technology is changing at an exponential pace, and changing the workforce in a thousand hard-to-parse ways. But if AI quickly eliminates white-collar work, the country is going to end up in something much stranger than a downturn, and something much harder to recover from too.

The United States is adept enough at handling the labor-market damage caused by recessions. Congress slashes taxes, writes stimulus checks, and fattens unemployment-insurance payouts. Washington amps up infrastructure spending and patches holes in the budgets of state and local governments. The Federal Reserve drops interest rates down to zero and purchases hundreds of billions of dollars of safe assets, making borrowing cheaper for families and encouraging businesses to invest. Demand increases, pushing the unemployment rate down and GDP up.

But if white-collar layoffs cause a downturn, Washington might not be able to restore hiring and lift consumer spending as it has done before. Businesses wouldn’t need the skills workers possess. Firms wouldn’t want to hire the legions of accountants, engineers, lawyers, middle managers, human-resources executives, financial analysts, PR types, and customer-service agents they just laid off. (Writers would be fine, I choose to believe.) The United States would have a “structural” unemployment problem, as economists put it, not a “cyclical” demand problem.

The country has struggled with structural joblessness in the past, but the problem has tended to afflict blue-collar workers, not white-collar ones. The labor market is normally womblike in the security it delivers the college-educated. The downsizing trend of the 1990s did not actually result in the pool of office jobs shrinking. Even during the Great Recession, the unemployment rate for workers with a bachelor’s degree never went higher than 5.3 percent. For workers with only an associate’s degree or some college credits, it hit 9 percent; for workers with only a high-school diploma, 11.9 percent.

In this new economic paradigm, the educated and well-to-do would fare worse than their less-educated and lower-income neighbors. The main bulwark against joblessness—the unemployment-insurance system—wouldn’t meet the challenge. Payments last for only so long: six months at most currently, 18 months during the coronavirus pandemic. If AI eliminated the need for office work, many people would be unemployed for years; their earnings would potentially fall, their mental health would deteriorate, and their chance of finding a new position would diminish with every month that passed. Plus, the unemployment system isn’t designed to support six-figure earners. Most state payments max out at $500 or $600 a week, a quarter of what many upper-middle-class employees earn. Young workers would face their own challenges: The pool of entry-level white-collar jobs would shrink, as it already is, pushing recent graduates’ income down for years, even decades.

If rich households cut back on spending, many businesses that have nothing to do with AI—grocery stores, gas stations, retail shops, hairdressers, restaurants—would suffer and the labor market would keep deteriorating. The housing market would begin to falter; home prices in many regions would fall and fewer properties would go to market. Tax revenue might fall. Bond yields might go up as the country’s deficits increased, making it harder for the Fed to stimulate investment. Rank-and-file workers’ incomes would drop at the same time that executives using AI to cut costs would see their wealth increase. Inequality would rise to even higher heights. The 0.01 percent would pull away from the 0.1 percent, which would pull away from the 1 percent.

White-collar workers would go through what blue-collar workers went through beginning in the 1970s. Advances in machine technology improved productivity and depressed employment in Detroit; Pittsburgh; Gary, Indiana; and Worcester, Massachusetts. Rust Belt communities fell apart and never recovered. Then China joined the World Trade Organization, and globalization spurred another round of job losses, causing even more permanent damage. Affected workers ended up poorer, less happy, and less healthy. They died sooner. Their kids were worse off too.

To get the economy going again during the AI transition, the country would need to figure out how to get white-collar workers back to work. And I really mean figure out—essentially from scratch. Existing workforce-training initiatives have yielded “muted” and “inconclusive” results. Existing displaced-worker initiatives have “dubious” value. These kinds of programs offer net-negative value to participants, taxpayers, and “society as a whole,” studies have found. Community-college programs have the strongest track record, but the overwhelming majority of office workers have a two-year or four-year degree already. The country doesn’t have answers that don’t involve upskilling, education, or trying and failing to compensate the losers.

Silicon Valley leaders are enamored of one policy Hail Mary: the establishment of a universal basic income, in which the government would provide all adults with $1,500 a month or so, no strings attached and in perpetuity. It’s not as crazy an idea as it sounds; think of it as Social Security for everyone, or an extension of the earned-income tax credit to families without any earned income. The cash would ensure that every family kept its head above water, and redistribute the wealth generated by rising productivity. “People will be freed up to spend more time with people they care about, care for people, appreciate art and nature, or work toward social good,” Sam Altman of OpenAI has argued.

But UBI is a dystopian outcome, not a utopian one. For families to thrive in this new post-work paradigm, the government would need to redistribute a lot more than $1,500 per person per month, necessitating confiscatory taxes on corporations—taxes they would fight tooth and nail. The bigger problem would be that Americans would hate a world without work, where the jobless rate floats at 30 percent instead of 4 percent. Many Americans like working. They like having somewhere to go during the day. They like trading watercooler stories with their colleagues. They like getting promoted and starting their own firms. They are proud of earning a living. Long-term unemployment destroys people’s mental and physical health, and generates toxic societal unrest. Politicians love saying that Americans want a hand up, not a handout—and they aren’t wrong.

Perhaps Americans would adjust, and American culture would adjust in turn. Maybe people would become more interested in and fulfilled by leisure, art, and other activities. But it’s hard to imagine social capital being divorced from actual capital. It’s even harder to imagine the country becoming more egalitarian and its politics more participatory, instead of developing a hyper-wealthy techno-oligarchy and a dispossessed and teed-off underclass. Some people would spend their time gardening, volunteering, painting, exercising, or learning. Others would spend hours a day watching short-form videos and never leave their apartments.

I don’t really think society will come to this. Throughout history, people have used technology to become more productive and prosperous without reducing the demand for human labor overall. Then again, maybe I’m just in denial.</div>

The urge to visit Beijing has gotten stronger lately among allies of the United States. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who referred to China last year as his country’s biggest security threat, made the trip last month, as did his British counterpart, Keir Starmer. Next week, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who heads the largest economy in Europe, plans to meet with Xi Jinping during a three-day visit packed with discussions of security and trade.

In a speech this past weekend at the Munich Security Conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. “will always be a child of Europe.” But the geopolitical divide between the U.S. and China has made Canadians and Europeans look more like the children in a bad divorce, shuttling between two feuding parents, pleasing neither, and risking retaliation if they take sides. Carney said as much in a memorable speech last month in Davos, where he bemoaned the fact that the superpowers are now vying for dominance in ways that place their own self-interest over cooperation. And they are prepared to dole out punishment to those who offend them. “Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,” Carney said.

That approach has forced Canada and other medium-size nations to pursue the same transactional self-interest, Carney noted. Hence his Beijing visit a few days before he gave the speech. “We are seeking to ensure our own economic resilience,” Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand, who traveled with Carney to Beijing, told us last week. “That means we have to diversify our trading partners.” And what about Carney’s statement in April, during his election campaign, about the looming security threat from the Chinese? Has it disappeared?

The diplomat stiffened. “Let’s take a step back,” she said, before offering a disquisition on all that President Trump had done to Canada since returning to office a year ago, including imposing steep tariffs on Canadian-made steel, aluminum, cars, and lumber. “Canada is seeking to double non-U.S. trade over the next 10 years,” Anand said. “That was the purpose of the trip.”

Canada’s overtures to Beijing clearly got Trump’s attention. In a post on Truth Social last week, the president wrote that Carney “wants to make a deal with China—which will eat Canada alive. We’ll just get the leftovers! I don’t think so.” Trump then threatened to prevent a newly built bridge between Ontario and Michigan from opening, at least until Canada starts treating the U.S. “with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve.”

It can be hard to keep track of the insults and intimidation that U.S. allies have faced from the Trump administration over the past year. But the indignities have been enough to make many traditionally steadfast American partners talk in private about a permanent rupture in relations with Washington. Carney’s speech in Davos brought the hand-wringing into the open, and it offered a way for “middle powers” to move forward by banding together against global hegemons like the United States.

But in practice, Carney’s response to Trump’s bullying has been a newfound openness to China. He agreed on a plan, during his visit there last month, for the Chinese to lower trade barriers on a variety of Canadian goods, including beef, lobsters, and pet food. As of yesterday, Canadian citizens are now allowed to travel to China without a visa for up to 30 days. “We are forging a new strategic partnership,” Carney declared.

Yet given the power differential between China and Canada—or, for that matter, between China and any NATO ally other than the United States—such a partnership will not be among equals. And were Canada in the future to veer back toward the U.S., which remains by far its biggest trading partner, Carney could expect the kind of retaliation from Beijing that Trump now threatens. In other words, Canada and others might consider the smart move to be economically and diplomatically hedging their bets between Washington and Beijing. But they are just as likely to get stuck between a pair of repelling magnets, pushed and pulled by the world’s superpowers.

Plenty of European countries have been here before, swinging between the U.S. and China, and they have learned the perils. During the Biden administration, the U.S. pressured its allies to take a harder line against China, and many complied. Among the most eager was the tiny nation of Lithuania, which blocked Chinese companies from building its 5G communications network and other infrastructure.

“At least temporarily, it had a positive impact on our relations with the United States,” the president of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda, told us. In part to keep the good vibes going, his government antagonized China further in 2021 by allowing Taiwan to build a representative office in Vilnius, the capital. (China sees Taiwan as a rogue province and aims to take it back by force if necessary.)

The Lithuanian decision to welcome Taiwan earned applause from the American foreign-policy establishment; the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, referred to Lithuania as a “trailblazer” in the push to counter Chinese influence in Europe. Lithuania shares an approximately 180-mile-long border with Russia and would not be able to defend that frontier without help from its allies in the NATO alliance. “For us, being so vulnerable, and being in such a sensitive place on Earth, it’s very important to keep the focus of the United States on the one hand and of European allies on the other hand,” Nausėda said.

But the price of maintaining that focus “was quite dramatic,” he said. “China started economic coercion against us.” Lithuanian diplomats were forced to leave their embassy in China, which moved to temporarily block the import of Lithuanian goods. The government in Vilnius hoped the confrontation would pay off with a greater American commitment to its country’s security. “It was a strategic choice,” Gabrielius Landsbergis, who was the foreign minister of Lithuania during the Biden administration, told us. “And our cooperation with the previous administration was very successful.”

Soon after Trump returned to the White House, however, the security dividends that Lithuania had earned began to dissipate. Under the new administration, “small countries do not matter,” Landsbergis said, summarizing Trump’s approach to geopolitics. “That’s a problem for us. When great powers begin carving up the world, we find ourselves no longer at the table, but on the menu.”

In recent weeks, as the tensions between the U.S. and Europe have intensified, the Lithuanian government has come to regret its decision to stand up to Beijing. Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginienė said earlier this month that it had been a “big mistake” to allow the opening of the Taiwanese representative office. “I believe that Lithuania really jumped in front of a train and lost,” she told the Baltic News Service.

China seems ready to accept Lithuania’s atonement. A spokesperson for its foreign ministry said the door to Beijing remains open as long as Lithuania intends to “correct its wrongdoings at an early date.” But Lithuania’s president does not see a strategic turn toward China as an option at this point. Even as other European countries are rushing to foster relations with Beijing, the Lithuanians intend to stick with the Americans. “There’s no alternative,” Nausėda said in our interview. For the moment, at least, they are stuck with Trump.

Over the long term, if Europeans want to avoid falling under the sway of either of the world’s two dominant superpowers, they can try to form their own geopolitical center of gravity. But that would require speaking with one voice, and their scattershot outreach to China makes that difficult. In December, when French President Emmanuel Macron visited Beijing, his team reportedly wanted the European Union’s most senior official, Ursula von der Leyen, to accompany him.

“This was seen as an effort to ‘Europeanise’ his dealings with Beijing,” the South China Morning Post reported at the time. The Chinese authorities reportedly turned down the idea, preferring instead to deal with European leaders one by one, and Macron agreed to come without his EU counterpart. In preparation for next week’s trip, Germany’s Merz met on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference with Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister. Wang applauded the German leader for planning the trip in a way that would maintain Berlin’s “strategic autonomy and self-reliance.”

That approach has raised concerns among Germany’s smaller allies in Europe, who worry that they could be left behind. Petr Pavel, the president of the Czech Republic, does not have the option of traveling to Beijing. “I am persona non grata in China,” Pavel told us in an interview last week. The Chinese banned him from the country last summer, after he paid a visit to India to wish a happy birthday to the Dalai Lama, who turned 90 in July. (China regards the spiritual leader of Tibet as a separatist “wolf in monk’s clothing.”)

The timing of Pavel’s meeting with the holy man looks unfortunate in hindsight. It took place only a few months before U.S. relations with Europe reached a crisis point, when Trump, in January, threatened to seize the island of Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally. The resulting rupture sent the Europeans scrambling to line up trips to Beijing. But when we asked Pavel about his regrets, he said he has none. “We have to understand that China is not an ally,” he said. “It is at best our competitor.”

Pavel understands the desire among some of his peers to look to Beijing amid the rising tensions with Washington, but he would prefer they take a more confident and unified approach. “Europe should become its own zone of influence,” he said. “Not looking eastwards and then westwards and back again, always being afraid for our security, but instead to become stronger and on our own, economically stronger and also militarily.” That may be the better long-term strategy, but there remain serious doubts whether the Europeans can pull it off.

Carney is leading his own effort to form, in effect, a third superpower that can resist the gravitational pulls of both the United States and China. Talks are under way among Canada, the European Union, and 12 Indo-Pacific nations to form a new trade alliance that would potentially represent the world’s largest economic bloc. Asked about it yesterday, Carney told reporters that “Canada can play a role” in forming a new alliance, adding that his country is in a “unique position” to “broker a bridge” between the two groups of nations in Europe and Asia.

In the meantime, the U.S. is demanding more if Ottawa wants to remain in Trump’s good graces. In August, Trump increased tariffs on Canadian goods to 35 percent, saying Carney’s government hadn’t done enough of what Washington wants. Last month, Trump threatened to decertify any aircraft made in Canada until the Canadians certify American-made Gulfstreams. Canada is now reconsidering its decades-old agreement to buy F-35A fighter jets from Lockheed Martin and may instead buy Swedish-made Saab JAS 39 E Gripens.

The pressure on Canada seems to be part of a broader Trump-administration strategy to reinvigorate American industries and limit—maybe even eliminate—any products that don’t carry a Made in America label. When Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick spoke to a Toronto audience last year, he suggested that Canada should not even be making cars. It would be better, he suggested, to consolidate the entire North American auto industry in the U.S. Needless to say, that has been viewed in Canada as just another way the U.S. is seeking to flex its muscles at Canadians’ expense.

“We are being bombarded with complaints, grievances, tariffs, more tariffs,” Giles Gherson, president and CEO of the Toronto Region Board of Trade, Canada’s largest chamber of commerce, told us. “As soon as the concessions are made and they’re pocketed, new demands show up—and relentlessly.”

Ultimately, Trump’s posturing toward Canada isn’t about Canada. It’s about seeking to sustain Washington’s superiority over China and making sure that American allies know their place. The president won’t let anything—not even a very public dispute with America’s friendly neighbor to the north—get in the way.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, is the sort of highly selective institution that jockeys for the unofficial title of Harvard of the South. Recently, the university’s chancellor had a new idea: What if Vanderbilt was also in San Francisco? Maybe it could become the Harvard of the West too.

Last month, Vanderbilt announced that it was acquiring the facilities of the financially insolvent California College of the Arts and would be converting the space into a new campus. Private universities have been experimenting with satellite campuses for decades. Typically, these outposts are either overseas or limited to a graduate program or two. The Vanderbilt expansion, set to open in 2027, will be different: It will include a full-blown, four-year undergraduate college, not in Abu Dhabi but in the San Francisco Design District. This new tactic, pioneered by Northeastern University a few years ago, is taking the satellite-campus concept to its logical extreme: the national-chain model of undergraduate education. If it works for Vanderbilt, other selective institutions are likely to follow—because no one really wants to be the Harvard of the South. Everyone wants to be Harvard. Perhaps the way for excellent regional schools to develop a national reputation is to set up shop around the nation.

For most of the history of higher education, a university has been ineluctably tied to a particular city: Bologna. Oxford. Cambridge. The other Cambridge. In the United States, the first wave of satellite campuses began to appear in the post–World War II period as the share of Americans attending college surged. To meet growing demand, public universities opened branches in far-flung areas of their state. (Most Texans, for example, live far from Austin.) That’s how systems such as the University of California evolved into sprawling behemoths.

Rose Horowitch: The college backlash is a mirage

The next phase of expansions was very different. In the 2000s, some private institutions began establishing international outposts to cash in on global demand for their prestige. Northwestern University started awarding bachelor’s degrees out of a campus in Qatar in 2008. Columbia opened a Middle East research center in Amman, Jordan, in 2009. The next year, New York University established an undergraduate campus in Abu Dhabi; NYU Shanghai followed not long after. Less selective institutions are trying this approach as well: The University of New Haven recently announced that it would create a campus for undergraduates and grad students in Riyadh. “You would find some authoritarian petro-state somewhere that had a ton of money and was very impressed by the brand allure of high-class American universities,” Kevin Carey, the vice president of education and work at the think tank New America, told me.

More recently, colleges have focused on domestic expansion, creating outposts in the nation’s capital. Nearly 20 institutions have satellite campuses in Washington, D.C. Some are small, occupying a floor of an office building; others, including the University of Southern California and Arizona State University, have their own buildings emblazoned with their school’s logo in massive font. In 2019, Johns Hopkins University, based in Baltimore, paid more than $370 million to acquire a new home for its School of Advanced International Studies in the building that had previously housed the Newseum. D.C. campuses tend to confer graduate degrees and serve as a home base for undergrads interning on Capitol Hill and K Street. They also give university leaders easy access to government officials.

The school that has come closest to a true brick-and-mortar national-chain model is Northeastern University, which is known for its emphasis on combining academics with career-focused internships. In the 2010s, as the university’s officials realized that they could attract only so many students to Boston, the school began setting up campuses to reach more markets. “A university cannot be defined by its campus,” Joseph Aoun, Northeastern’s president, told me. “We’re going to them rather than asking them to come to one campus.” Since 2011, Northeastern has opened eight graduate-focused branch campuses in major cities across the U.S. and Canada. These are designed to help students network and land a job in their preferred city after graduation. Northeastern has used this strategy to enroll more students—raising tuition revenue—without increasing the main campus’s acceptance rates. “Going back about 25 years ago, Northeastern was a top-150 university,” Peter Stokes, a higher-education consultant who previously worked at Northeastern and helped launch its expansion, told me. “Today it’s a top-50 university.”

Most graduate programs are small. Setting up a full undergraduate campus is a much more ambitious undertaking. In 2022, Northeastern acquired Mills College, in Oakland, absorbing the school’s real estate and some tenured faculty, and creating Northeastern University at Oakland. Two years later, it merged with Marymount Manhattan College to create a New York–based undergraduate campus. Aoun calls Northeastern a “global university system.” He said, “We don’t like to call them branch campuses, because our model is not to export into another city or another country what we have been doing in Boston.”

Now comes Vanderbilt, adopting a similar strategy. Daniel Diermeier, the school’s chancellor, is widely perceived within higher ed as trying to elbow into the Harvard-Yale-Stanford stratum. When I asked him if the expansion plan is an effort to rise in the rankings, he deflected, saying that “​​our aspiration is to be innovative.” But he did not deny a certain ambition. “A core component of being a great university in the 21st century is to be part of an innovation economy,” he said. He pointed to Stanford in the 1990s, when the university and its surrounding area became the global center of the tech industry. “If you believe that, then it matters where you are,” Diermeier told me. “Location becomes a strategy.” It’s easier to entice the top computer-science professors to work in the Bay Area than in Nashville. Diermeier expects the San Francisco campus to eventually host 1,000 students and 100 faculty members. (Vanderbilt is also opening a graduate campus in West Palm Beach and recently opened a study-away program in Manhattan.)

Ian Bogost: The accidental winners of the war on higher ed

The education-franchise model—Diermeier calls it “network campuses”—can be a risky proposition. Drexel University, in Philadelphia, tried to improve its reputation by opening a graduate-focused satellite campus in Sacramento. The effort fizzled out six years later. Middlebury College, in Vermont, is similarly winding down its graduate programs in Monterey, California. “It can become like managing an empire,” Stokes said. “It’s like being Rome in the fourth century. If you get too geographically dispersed, it can be difficult to maintain the front of the empire.”

For top schools, the biggest risk might be brand dilution. Ivy League universities are highly unlikely to open new campuses around the country. Their power and prestige depend on exclusivity. The institutions in the next tier down are exclusive, too, but they’re also more willing to experiment. Vanderbilt has less of a national brand to dilute—indeed, that’s the problem it’s trying to solve.

Other top-tier schools will therefore be watching to see how Vanderbilt’s expansion plays out, and some may follow suit. The population of American 18-year-olds is expected to peak this year, followed by a precipitous decline. Stokes’s consulting firm has identified nearly 400 private colleges that are at risk of closure in the next five to 10 years. Everyone’s jockeying to be in the best position on the other side of the crisis. “For institutions like Northeastern and Vanderbilt, taking advantage of this weakening and precarity that certain institutions are experiencing, that creates an opportunity for them to get real estate,” he said. Small colleges in major cities or Sun Belt states, which have seen a population boom, are valuable sites for branch campuses. Aoun said that at least one college asks to be acquired by Northeastern each week. Ryan Allen, an education professor at Soka University of America, calls it higher education’s “Age of Conquest”: The big schools will get bigger, and the smaller schools will be absorbed. Soon, high-school seniors who get accepted into a top college might start having to answer a question that their parents never did: “Which location?”</div>

            <h2>Hegseth’s Firing Campaign Reaches Down Into the Ranks</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/hegseth-pentagon-butler-driscoll/686028/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a Pentagon meeting last year, passed a note to Army Secretary Dan Driscoll about one of Driscoll’s top aides, asking, in effect: Why hasn’t this guy been fired yet?

The aide, Colonel Dave Butler, a former infantry officer, is a longtime leader in Army public affairs (not a specialty Hegseth embraces) who worked closely with the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley (whom Hegseth despises). On Thursday, Hegseth finally got his way: Butler was pushed out.

The issue was not that Butler was incompetent in his job; quite the opposite. Both Driscoll and the Army’s chief of staff, General Randy George, are said to have valued his advice, experience, and the reforms that he initiated—and it was their endorsement, when combined with Butler’s previous assignment with Milley, that ruined his chance of making the rank of general.

Defense secretaries don’t usually get involved in decisions about the careers of colonels and other mid-level commanders, given that the lead civilian in the Pentagon is supposed to oversee war planning, a department of 3 million people, and America’s nuclear arsenal. Ever since the World War I era, when the United States established a large-scale standing force, individual branches have typically had a say in promotions and other personnel decisions. These choices are supposed to be based on merit.

Hegseth, more than any other of his predecessors, has weighed in on the makeup of the military’s top leaders. He has fired or sidelined dozens of three- and four-star officers, in many cases without any clear reason other than their perceived disloyalty to Hegseth’s beliefs, alleged support for diversity programs, or coziness with people regarded as foes of the administration.

With Butler’s removal, Hegseth has displayed a willingness to reach further down in the ranks—there are roughly 4,000 colonels in the Army alone—and demonstrated that, one year after his appointment, he still doesn’t feel that his campaign of purges has gone far enough.

“The secretary of defense is spending his time doing things that those well below his pay grade should be doing,” Kori Schake, who directs foreign and defense policy at the American Enterprise Institute and released a book last year about civil-military relations, told us. “And he is not doing the things that only the secretary of defense can do.”

Hegseth’s office referred our questions to the Army. The spokesperson Cynthia Smith said in an email that Butler would retire: “His integral role in the Army’s transformation efforts will be missed.”

Butler, who declined to comment, wasn’t a typical colonel. Over the past dozen years, he emerged as a powerful force within the Army as an adviser to the top officers, including Milley, who clashed repeatedly with Trump, particularly after the summer of 2020, when Milley had said that he regretted walking alongside Trump after federal forces cleared Lafayette Square of protesters. Before that, Butler worked under the now-retired General Austin “Scott” Miller, the head of Joint Special Operations Command and a onetime chief of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. That put Butler in the room for major decisions both for the Army—he helped organize the Army’s 250th-anniversary parade in Washington, D.C., in June—and for U.S. defense policy more broadly.

More recently, Butler served as a top adviser to Driscoll and George, and he was understood to be highly valued by both men. But Butler was also divisive, in part because of his influence over so many parts of the military—and the public-affairs community.

Hegseth and Driscoll have had a tense year. Driscoll, a confidant of Vice President Vance, has emerged as a rival at the Pentagon to the former Fox News host. Unlike Hegseth—who arrived in his position following a bruising confirmation process that surfaced allegations of mismanagement, heavy drinking, and sexual assault—Driscoll cuts a clean-living profile, has won allies in Congress with his more genial demeanor, and at times has outshone his boss.

While Hegseth has focused on internal purges and the campaign of strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, Driscoll’s star has risen with his participation in U.S. efforts to mediate an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Driscoll was in Geneva today on that assignment, working with two of Trump’s special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. (Driscoll couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.)

After last year’s meeting where Hegseth questioned Driscoll about Butler, both Driscoll and George kept Butler in their inner circle. For the Army, it was not just about protecting Butler’s place. It was also about standing up for Driscoll’s and George’s roles in deciding who leads their force.

Top Army officials, over Hegseth’s objections, decided to keep Butler in the promotion queue during the past year. But Hegseth’s stonewalling of Butler’s advancement was one reason that a larger group of proposed promotions, which needed sign-off from Pentagon leadership before being sent to the White House, was delayed for months, defense officials told us. Some Army officials had hoped that the extra time would ultimately benefit Butler. But after another meeting between Hegseth and Driscoll on Thursday, Driscoll followed Hegseth’s order and removed Butler. “The Army delayed this inevitable decision and in the end Hegseth said, ‘Enough’s enough,’” one defense official told us.

Butler’s ouster wasn’t primarily a result of Hegseth’s rivalry with Driscoll, according to people familiar with the situation. Rather, they said, it stemmed more from Hegseth’s antipathy toward military officials closely associated with Milley. Hegseth and Trump have both accused Milley of treason, and Trump once suggested that Milley should be executed. One of Hegseth’s first actions after taking office was removing Milley’s official portrait from its place in a Pentagon hallway. Earlier this month, Hegseth replaced General James Mingus, the Army’s widely respected second in command who also had worked on the Joint Staff under Milley. Hegseth installed General Christopher LaNeve, one of his own aides, in the post. LaNeve supported the decision to remove Butler, a former defense official told us.

Hegseth and his staff have shown a particular interest in Pentagon PR. An Air Force colonel who served as spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Dan Caine was removed over a years-old social-media post asking for better support for Afghans as U.S. forces withdrew. Hegseth also censured Senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, after the retired Navy captain published a video urging troops to refuse unlawful orders. And Hegseth implemented a rule that effectively required reporters to seek Pentagon approval before publishing stories or they would risk losing their press accreditation, leading hundreds of journalists to walk out in the fall.

News of Butler’s ouster appeared to have the effect that Hegseth desired as word spread across the military’s public-affairs community. Officials told us that they feared angering Hegseth and also saw his interference as a direct contradiction of what the military teaches its commanders: that strong leaders focus on the job the military needs them to do, not on anyone else’s role.

“Hegseth’s decision speaks to a broader effort to shape the long-term trajectory of the military,” one former defense official told us. “By getting involved at the colonel rank, Hegseth could reshape the military three, five, seven, even 10 years down the road.”

Such micromanaging in the officer ranks because of political or personal animus risks further polarizing the military and undermining its status as one of America’s final refuges from hyper-partisanship.</div>

AI will increase the number and diversity of jobs. It creates more and more bullshit for people to do. Until we have free food delivery service and mansions for all, there will be jobs.

For a moment, let&#39;s ignore the economic elephant in the room that is inflation and pretend UBI will work as advertised.  You&#39;re still stuck living on a fixed government income, which only lets you participate in capitalism in a very limited manner.  UBI offers no upward mobility if you really can&#39;t find work because the robots took all the jobs you&#39;d be qualified for.

You don&#39;t have a lot of income to justify this, but you used to be able to justify this with clicks, views, eyeballs, and the fact that you employ a lot of technical people.

I&#39;ve worked with a lot of white collar workers who basically fill out forms, shuffle forms, collate form data into reports, etc.. As a db guy, I made a lot of their work easier by interconnecting databases and providing live reports.

Only bureaucratic inertia prevented me from going further - there was no &#39;fuzzy thinking&#39; required.  You have rules for collecting the data, rules for extracting what you want from it.  Rules, rules, rules.  No AI required.

Print money and give it away?  Great plan, I wonder how that will work out.

Money for UBI has to come from somewhere. The notion that we can inflate our way out of debt and into the future is a recipe for disaster.

            <div id="article-text">Electric buses are proving unreliable this winter for Vermont&#39;s Green Mountain Transit, as it needs to be over 41 degrees for the buses to charge, but due to a battery recall the buses are a fire hazard and can&#39;t be charged in a garage. 

Spokesman for energy workers advocacy group Power the Future Larry Behrens told the Center Square: &quot;Taxpayers were sold an $8 million &#39;solution&#39; that can&#39;t operate in cold weather when the home for these buses is in New England.&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;re beyond the point where this looks like incompetence and starts to smell like fraud,&quot; Behrens said. 

&quot;When government rushes money out the door to satisfy green mandates, basic questions about performance, safety, and value for taxpayers are always pushed aside,&quot; Behrens said. &quot;Americans deserve to know who approved this purchase and why the red flags were ignored.&quot; 

General manager at Green Mountain Transit (GMT) Clayton Clark told The Center Square that &quot;the federal government provides public transit agencies with new buses through a competitive grant application process, and success is not a given.&quot;

Seem like a uniquely American problem. https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/0... [cnbc.com]

Are batteries different in Norway? This smells like typical corruption and incompetence.

Are batteries different in Norway? This smells like typical corruption and incompetence.Clearly the batteries delivered are somehow different and the ones delivered to Vermont weren&#39;t appropriate. This shouldn&#39;t be a question of the officials though. The basic function of a bus is to drive around the place and if it&#39;s sold in Vermont that means driving around the place in the cold. A bus that fails that is not of &quot;merchantable quality&quot; (look up the Uniform Commercial Code) and so the company that made them should have to fix them and until they do they have a duty pay for replacements.Now, US judges are no doubt allowing companies to weasel out of the UCC. That is a big problem.

I did a bit of digging. The busses are Canadian, and the batteries are German. A little surprising as you would expect both of those to be used to sub 5C temperatures.

FWIW the ones in Norway use Chinese batteries, and many of the busses are made in China too. They have no issues with low temperatures, and in fact often use NMC batteries because they perform well in cold climates. I don&#39;t know what chemistry the ones in these busses are, but it sounds quite old if they can&#39;t charge below 5C.

Nope, EV buses aren&#39;t working in any Canadian city either.  My guess is that Norway is willing to pay more for electricity while most North American cities are going to expect them to perform the same purpose for the same cost.

This is funny because I got into an argument with someone recently who didn&#39;t believe me about not working in Canada.

Halifax has had 60 electric buses in it&#39;s fleet since May of last year [ctvnews.ca] (and yes, they are charged indoors).  Maybe people argue with you because you are full of shit.

So I stand corrected.  But Halifax also only goes down to -10 or so.  Not really fully representative of a Canadian city.

Montreal has 41 fully electric busses. This winter we hit roughly -40 with windchill, and we get around 217cm (85 inches) of snow a year. They&#39;re from the same Canadian bus manufacturer (New Flyer) as the Vermont busses, but we charge them inside the garage, so the temperature is not relevant for charging. The reason Vermont can&#39;t charge them indoors is due to the limitations of their garage, not their busses.

All that said, Montreal is focusing on replacing all busses with hybrid instead of electric. The bu

Good point! Let&#39;s see just how poorly EVs are performing in the cold in Norway [motor.no].

Just because they&#39;re selling doesn&#39;t mean they perform well in the cold. That isn&#39;t a direct correlation...

Norway subsidized EV purchases and taxes ICE vehicles, EVs are exempt from those taxes.

No it&#39;s just that the temperatures in Norway&#39;s major cities, being coastal, are more moderate than a lot of the coldest climates in North America.

Elektrotrucker just documented a long-haul electric semi trip through Scandinavian countries.  In Sweden he had relatively warm temps, only -5 or so.  By the time he ended up in Finland it was -35.  He had a major problem keeping the cabin warm at those temps.  Battery thermal management systems consumed a lot of power too. His efficiency dropped from about 1 kwh/

One other thing was that Elektrotrucker found that regenerative braking was a bit sketchy in icy conditions.  But that&#39;s not all that different from drivers having to be careful with jake brakes in icy conditions too.

Not that these concerns aren&#39;t worth discussing but consider the narrative in this article and who is presenting it:

&quot;energy workers advocacy group Power the Future&quot;

Now for one thing &quot;energy workers&quot; pretty much means &quot;oil and gas industry&quot; and when you go the website of Power the Future it&#39;s full of them representing themselves on Fox news. &quot;We believe America is blessed with abundant and reliable energy sources that have been the lifeblood of our national advancement and prosperity.&quot; Come on, that&#39;s a dog whistle as loud as a bullhorn.

Second one is &quot;Institute for Energy Research&quot; and that itself has a Wikipedia entry &quot;IER is often described as a front group for the fossil fuel industry.[3][4][5] It was initially formed by Charles Koch, receives donations from many large companies like Exxon, and publishes a stream of reports and position papers opposing any efforts to control greenhouse gasses.&quot;

So is there a real issue here? Maybe but the article and how it&#39;s being presented is presenting a narrative, exactly the type of thing climate deniers accuse their opposition of doing all the time.  Interesting aint it?

That&#39;s not really blaming the government either, what he says is correct; The grant is there to give a leg up for places to try something new, it being new means it could have growing pains as we see here, issues that in the article they are already addressing.

This is my point, this is fossil fuel lobbyists doing &quot;perfect is the enemy of good&quot; as a backhanded tactic.

In this case I don&#39;t think they want perfect, they just want them to do the same thing as diesel buses for the same cost.

I know you&#39;re not saying that but anyone who says that is making the argument of a child and should be discarded, a complete inability to take in the context of each thing and judge it accordingly and take the pros and cons and adjust accordingly.  They&#39;re not the same as diesels other than they are both bus shaped.

So is there a real issue here?You make some good points regarding the source and underlying agenda, but ...it needs to be over 41 degrees for the buses to charge, but due to a battery recall the buses are a fire hazard and can&#39;t be charged in a garage. rather sounds like an actual issue that needs investigating, irrespective of who reported it, or why.

...it needs to be over 41 degrees for the buses to charge, but due to a battery recall the buses are a fire hazard and can&#39;t be charged in a garage.

Sure but you&#39;re doing the same thing by leaving out the context of that issue:  the trucks originally were working with charging in any temp and in the garage but then there was a fire risk issue with a recall on the batteries so the manufacturer did a software update for safety that places restrictions on charging to mitigate fire risk until the replacement.

Now sure that kinda sucks in the winter sure but this is somewhat new tech but that is hardly showing the idea is failing or anywhere close to &quot;fraud&quot; as the narrative here is presented.  Meanwhile the bus company already said they have more busses with newer batteries on order.

If the article was called &quot;new EV bus program experience growing pains in winter&quot; that&#39;s more fair to whats happening.

Oh and the part i left out, this would have to be framed in comparison to traditional diesel busses.  Do they never have safety recalls? Heres one of a tranditional bus model having to do recalls of 16000 units due to safety recalls.  Does that means buses are a failed concept and the manufacturer should be charged with fraud?  Have no diesels had recalls due to their DPF systems? Carbon coking or other ICE specific problems?

https://news.buses.org/motor-c... [buses.org]

It sounds like extreme incompetence on the part of the designers, or at least someone in the chain.

Lithium batteries can&#39;t be charged as fast when they are cold, which is why some EVs automatically heat their batteries when you navigate to a charger. They can still be charged slowly though, and the charging warms them up so that speed eventually improves. Given these are likely being charged overnight, it shouldn&#39;t be an issue.

Maybe the problem is not the battery, but the inverter, if they are charging from

Agreed and the thing is this type of article doesn&#39;t even allow us to have that conversation, it&#39;s already made it&#39;s determination.

The batteries can be charged below 41degrees?

The buses aren&#39;t considered a safety hazard?

The people that funded the study don&#39;t change the above three facts.

And here we have the classic &quot;just do talking points, don&#39;t worry about context!&quot;

It&#39;s stupid that they would need to charge in a garage, as battery warming pads are available aftermarket.

But it&#39;s even stupider that the GM for Green Mountain Transit thinks the barrier to charging under 41 degrees &quot;is simply a software update&quot;. No it&#39;s not, genius, if you charge under 40 degrees you destroy your battery. They really need to have more transparency on these govt projects. Anybody who has a basic knowledge of electronics, or even campers, could fix this.

so everyone in VT with electric vehicles are &quot;destroying&quot; their batteries when they charge everyday? it hasnt been above 40 in 2 months.. you  are stupid.

Yes these busses do not work.  Electric Busses in Canada DO work.https://en.byd.com/news/byd-el... [byd.com]

Those Canadian busses are made in China.  Trump hates China.  The Vermont busses are made in America.

The problem is NOT &quot;government rushes money out the door to satisfy green mandates&quot;  The green mandates had nothing to do with the problem.

The problem was incompetent people in the government that did not get a proven system.

Actually, it&#39;s just the opposite to what you say here.

https://nationalpost.com/opini... [nationalpost.com]

An op-ed piece on a right wing newspaper.

There are links to other news sources in that article.  Try clicking on some of them to get information from more direct sources if you like.

so no the problem was rushed green mandates actually.  Buy American is and should be a high priority objective for government spending that green or efficiency targets. What should have happened is the state should have told the vendor, look we want to go EV but we need something we can charge outdoors in the Vermont winter where we generally expect to have X days per year around $(insert temp, below which it is acceptable to cancel bus service)  you will get the contract when we can charge at that temperat

My understanding is the new Postal EVs rather under performed in cold weather too. No if you read the story, the actual problem is the batteries need to be replaced due to fire risk, but replacement batteries are not available for another 18-24 months. In the meantime, the manufacturer recently put in software locks to prevent charging under 41F. That&#39;s the real problem.

Lol you cite propaganda from an EV bus company as evidence that they are working?  Toronto has tried them but they cannot be brought into full service without bringing a whole lot more charging all the way along routes.  One bus died on route in Toronto showing 15% battery remaining.

The money that bought the buses (under the Biden admin, I suspect), required the buses to be made in the U.S. why does this have anything to do with Trump? Did Trump approve the federal money, the busses were ordered, built, delivered to VT all in 2025?

From the linked-to article: (spoiler alert, they were bought under Biden admin, not &quot;China-hating Trump&quot;)

From 2020-2024, the [Federal Transit Administrationâ(TM)s] priority for grants had been low or no emission vehicles, with grant requests for diesel buses often not awarded,â Clark said.âoeThis was part of a concerted effort of the previous administration to accelerate public transitsâ(TM) migration to replace diesel buses,â Clark said.âoeTo be competitive for a grant, GMTâ¦saw electric battery buses as the pathway to get the most new buses,â Clark said. âoeGreen Mountain Transitâ(TM)s priority is new buses, regardless of the type.âClark informed The Center Square that GMTâ(TM)s âoeelectric battery buses are 90% paid for by federal and Volkswagen settlement funds.â

We still live in a capitalist economy.  Cities can&#39;t run EV buses if they cost way more and require all kinds of charging infrastructure that ICE buses didn&#39;t.

&quot;Way more&quot; is carrying a lot of effort and cities can and should build exactly that type of infrastructure.  If EV busses are anything like EV cars the cost upsides are in the long term and considering most busses run everyday the TCO over their probably 2 decade lifetime should be quite high instead of burning diesel all day long.

Even more so for busses than cars it makes pretty obvious sense since they already have dedicated depots they return to end of shift and they also spent quite a lot of time idling

I have been saying that cities should put more money into public transit for years and years.  No one listened to me either.

Buses are used by &quot;the poors&quot;.  Nobody on either side of the aisle considers this an issue worth changing their vote over.  The only reason we&#39;re even hearing about it is because the libertarian and right-wing media loves to get their base stroking their egos over the massive ICE pickup trucks they have parked in their driveways.

Of course, if your point was that America is uniquely bad at public transportation - that&#39;s true, but it&#39;s because the auto industry owns all the politicians.

So enough money needs to be put into it so that it is a comfortable experience.  But people complain about high taxes as it is.  And you can&#39;t out price the poorest of the poor.

The buses are fine to drive in winter. The issue is the buses cannot charge in temperatures under 41F at the moment. What is missing is that the buses were able at one point and why. From the article [vermontdai...onicle.com]:

Clark also explained that the five electric buses were “operating well” until November 2025 when the batteries “were recalled for fire hazard.”
The recall prompted a software update from New Flyer to “decrease the likelihood for fire” that “included only allowing the bus to charge to 75% and to not allow charging when the battery is below 41 degrees,” Clark explained.
“Previously we could charge in any temperature to 100%,” Clark said.“Since the barrier to charging under 41 degrees is simply a software update, the manufacturer could find a technical solution that could resolve the problem this week,” Clark said. “We are seeking a financial remedy from New Flyer that could lead to litigation if not resolved.”
“New Flyer has indicated that replacement batteries will be installed within 18-24 months,” Clark said.The actual problem: The buses need replacement batteries as the current ones pose a fire risk. To allow the buses to operate with existing batteries, software restrictions were installed to not allow the buses to charge under 41F. The software could be changed or the buses could get their replacement batteries sooner.  The summary makes it seems like there are zero solutions to the issue.

The buses clearly need  safer batteries, but in the meantime why not build a steel recharging shed off to one side and put in fire suppression. Then at least the vehicles can be charged.

Whether they are safe to ride, that&#39;s another problem !

..of technical problems, the quote seems to be a political statement from an EV haterIt would be more informative if the actual technical problems were discussedGiven the political nature of the quote, methinks the problems were exaggerated

There is no such thing as a New Flyer SE40. They are model XE40.

The spec sheet  [californiahvip.org] tells us that &quot;The battery chemistry is Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC), providing the best balance of energy, power, safety, and life.&quot;

Not having a battery heater is shit, especially in climates where it regularly freezes, like Vermont... but also anywhere it can freeze.

I agree that there is fraud involved, in that what New Flyer claims about NMC batteries is false. But they decided to buy t

A failure of judgement or lack of expertise on the part of the contracting organization doesn&#39;t mean they were engaged in fraud. I think we can apply Hanlon&#39;s Razor to this:

Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect.

Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect.

As much as I didn&#39;t want whatever questionable source that is to get anymore clicks, I had to dig in a little more on the recall.

From what it says, a safety concern with the batteries prompted the initial &quot;recall&quot;. The &quot;fix&quot; for that recall was a software update that then prevented charging below 41 deg and limited charging to 75% - and even that only &quot;decreased the likelihood for fire&quot;. It didn&#39;t actually solve the problem.

The transit GM guy says a fix for the 41 deg charge barrier is &quot;simply a software up

Don&#39;t laugh.  Diesel heaters are a good solution to keep the batteries and cabin warm.  I&#39;m sure some say that&#39;s crazy and defeats the purpose of using an EV in the first place, and is an unacceptable compromise, but I strongly disagree.  I&#39;m really surprised EVs in cold climates don&#39;t embrace this.  Sure burning diesel makes EV people uncomfortable, but it&#39;s a lot less diesel than an ICE bus would burn, and it lets the EV system work at its most efficient state all winter long.  Such a hybrid system makes

Diesel heaters seem impractical. If I understand you correctly you want to burn the Diesel. That means you&#39;ll somehow need to put the Diesel inside the bus, or install overhead Diesel lines, or have huge Diesel tanks at every charging station.

It seems easier to erect some sort of &quot;shed&quot; to put the bus in and heat that lightly.

(Solaris and others have had support for them for decades). But then when he would ignore that LAN Manager clients were leaking weak hashes on the network, and that NTLM barely fixed the problem and 20 years later it&#39;s still being exploited for credential hijacks.

Once again a reminder of the risk of using Microsoft software (and many other, but not all, proprietary systems). Now it&#39;s an &quot;unspecified code error&quot;, so I&#39;ll speculate a bit, but there&#39;s plenty of history here, so we can guess the truth.

There are ways for external software to interface with Exchange / Office 356. In fact, AI systems could happily be built to work directly with IMAP and other standardized interfaces. That&#39;s what Microsoft would expect external software companies to use and they would almost always mean that simple correct configuration of the mail server would stop that software being able to see the contents of these mails at all.

Instead of giving their own software the standard interfaces and allowing everyone who uses it to have control in the standard ways, Microsoft wants Copilot to have an advantage over the competition. They allow non standard, special interfaces for Copilot whilst the competition have to stick with the standards and suffer slower development. The user suffers from more complexity (two separate interfaces), more bugs and, like here, total loss of control and security. Microsoft sells out the user for more of their own sales.

&quot;Here&#39;s a summary of all your confidential emails.  It would be a shame if this all got out somehow.&quot;

But hey, lets claim incompetence and not malice even though they are indistinguishable at this point.

You can&#39;t run badly tested software relying on alpha level technology (AI) and have any reasonable expectations it&#39;s going to work properly. Why are people doing this? There&#39;s a reason AI is being banned in any workplace with NDAs, trade secrets, and customer data.

All the CEOs and MBAs out there mandating that their employees use AI daily as much as possible, despite only being alpha testing level, are idiots.

This comes from the company who JUST suggested AI is ready to take away pretty much ALL white collar jobs within the next 18 months.

Sounds like this means that DLP isn&#39;t integrated at the lowest levels but is just a bolt-on thing that&#39;s advisory at best. Makes me wonder if this also means cross-tennant protections aren&#39;t as robust as one would assume.

The AI sucking down all your confidential data accidentally let you know it&#39;s been scarfing down all your data. We&#39;ll try to fix it so it keeps your confidential emails from returning a summary to you while it continues to scarf them down going forward. Sorry &#39;bout the mix-up.

How is this different from Outlook previewing the first few lines of an email?

Does outlook send emails off to a remote server to generate the summary or is it locally generated?

Can anyone other than the intended recipient of the email see the AI-generated summary of confidential emails?

IF, as I suspect but don&#39;t know, the local PC generated summaries are only viewable by the proper, logged in recipient of the confidential email, what&#39;s the problem?

Now, if confidential emails are flying out to off-site MS AI

If they could break the confidentially THIS easily and amateurishly, those emails were never actually confidential in the first place.I am wondering in how much legal trouble that puts M$, especially over in Bxl.

The three letter agencies are very pleased.Huge time saver!

Are your garbage bins not precisely in the location required by your home owners&#39; association? Lawn a trifle too long, or maybe cut with an unapproved pattern?

Do you live in a &quot;border&quot; city, i.e. one that is within 100 miles of a coast, land border or international airport? Have you been engaging in antisocial behaviour such as gathering in groups and/or protesting outside of designated free speech zones?

Have you carried identifiable literature or membership insignia from a non-state sanctioned organization, or entered or exited a known or suspected meeting place of such an organization or residence of known or suspected members of such an organization?

Look at it this way: this is not the first mass surveillance tool available to government agencies. Pick any of the ones currently deployed and you will be able to find a history of agents abusing the system to stalk their ex-girlfriends, domestic partners, etc. and even attempt to interfere with their lives or liberties (see spiteful additions to the Do Not Fly list).

That&#39;s individual abuse alone, before even considering the propensity for law enforcement agencies to deploy technologies unlawfully or inappropriately, or for an agency or administration to inappropriately label a group of people criminals for exercising speech rights the government finds inconvenient.

>why is being able to scan for undesirables bad

Because the word is softer than your skull. Mass scanning benefits the scanners and those connected, not your commoner ass. You probably think it could never affect you, until suddenly it&#39;s an &quot;outrage&quot; and you learn about the three-a-day you and everyone simply never get hauled in for because enforcement is selective. Always has been. The legal system is a cudgel for those above you to weaponize and on occasion some rule that keeps peasants off each other.

The tech could be good if it reduced real crime, murder, theft, burglary, vandalism, etcThe tech is really bad if it is used for political purposes, minor traffic violations, or evidence in divorce cases

For the slow in the audience, this was the purpose all along. The &quot;find missing dogs&quot; thing was the marketing approach to sell this furthering of this new addition to the surveillance state.

Trump’s “Board of Peace” emerged from last year’s ceasefire negotiations to govern Gaza after the war. But since then, the board has evolved into a motley group of countries that are willing to pay a billion dollars to join a body that has Donald Trump as its chairman for life. They also have mostly stopped talking about Gaza.

Two American politicians drew top billing at this past weekend’s Munich Security Conference, where U.S. and European political leaders gather each year to mull the state of the trans-Atlantic alliance—a topic that is now teeming with suspense and peril.

The headliners were Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Europeans hoped Rubio would mollify their concerns about President Donald Trump’s commitment to the continent’s defense—or at least erase the memory of last year’s main speaker, J.D. Vance, whose unabashed hostility toward the Western alliance and firm embrace of Germany’s neo-Nazi party set off the crisis between the two continents today.

In this context, they viewed AOC as a possible harbinger of the U.S. leadership’s next generation and wondered—some with excitement, some with dread, almost everyone with curiosity, because she had never appeared at the conference before—just what her ascension might bode.

As it turned out, Rubio proved disappointing, while AOC was too vague to leave behind an outline of the alliance’s future or her chances of rising to its helm—though she expressed reassuring sentiments with (for the most part) encouraging eloquence.

Rubio received a standing ovation at the end of his keynote address on Saturday, mainly because he spoke softly and uttered a few welcome lines that the likes of Vance or, worse still, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (who did not attend the conference) would never utter—for instance, “the United States and Europe … belong together,” “We are part of one civilization,” and “Our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.”

These lines inspired his interlocutor, at the start of a Q&A period, to note “the collective sigh of relief throughout this hall” during the secretary’s “message of reassurance and partnership.”

But those listening with more jaded ears, and nearly everyone who read the transcript afterward, saw it as what might be called Vance-and-Hegseth lite—warm and friendly in tone but pure MAGA in substance, or as Politico paraphrased his message: “Join Donald Trump’s campaign to reshape the world for Washington’s benefit, or get out of the way.”

The traditions that Rubio invoked, in recalling the alliance’s past, were those of nationalism (a subtle rebuke to the European Union, an open rejection of free trade, and a dismissal of international law), Western civilization as Christian civilization (ignoring not just Judeo-Christian heritage but the roughly 25 million Muslims who live in Europe), and the “unapologetic” mission “to build a vast empire out across the globe.”

His call for alliance unity was an invitation for “you” (Europeans) to “join us” (Trump’s America) on our path. His speech—at the world’s most preeminent security conference—did not mention Russia, NATO, or China, but instead listed as the West’s biggest dangers “fear of climate change, fear of war, fear of technology,” and the “mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies, the continuity of our culture, and the future of our people.” To renew our alliance, he said, means to “restore a place in the world” that will “rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.”

We’ve heard this phrase “civilizational erasure” before, from Trump himself. It translates, pretty explicitly, to Make America (and now Europe as well) White Again.

After his appearance in Munich, as if to confirm this impression, and to splash water on those who tried to interpret the speech as a beacon of hope, Rubio flew to Budapest, where he publicly embraced Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and told him, “I say to you with confidence that President Trump is deeply committed to your success because your success is our success, because this relationship we have here in central Europe through you is so essential and vital for our national interests in the years to come.”

Rubio’s wish for Orbán’s “success” should be viewed in two contexts. First, the prime minister is facing a tough election; Rubio’s words amounted to an open endorsement by Trump. Second, Orbán is universally seen as the EU’s outlier—the Union’s most outspoken critic of democracy, supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and opponent of military aid to Ukraine. In wishing for Orbán’s success, Rubio was thumbing his nose at the entire spectacle—the very purpose—of the Munich Security Conference. Basically, he was repeating, through his actions, Vance’s aggressively hostile speech last year.

If Rubio had gone to Munich after Hungary, the gist of his speech would have been grasped without illusion. Even before the speech, he gave what should have been seen as a hint of his real intentions by brushing off a meeting, which he’d been scheduled to attend, on the security of Ukraine.

Usually several members of Congress attend the Munich conference, though this time House Speaker Mike Johnson barred the funding of their flights, in anticipation of the impasse that froze the Department of Homeland Security’s budget. Still, a few made their own way, notably Sen. Lindsey Graham—who, at one session, said, “Who gives a shit who owns Greenland? I don’t.” (Too bad he couldn’t have summoned the courage to say that a month ago, when Trump threatened war over the question). A few politicians who are assumed to have presidential aspirations also managed to attend: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (who stressed the vital relations between her state and Canada), California Gov. Gavin Newsom (who proclaimed that his state still observed tight laws on greenhouse gases), and the aforementioned AOC.

AOC was the big curiosity, and the two panels where she spoke—one on populism, the other on U.S. foreign policy—were hot tickets. She had never been to the conference before. She was there to lay out a vision of an alternative, progressive foreign policy—and therein lay the mystery: What is a progressive foreign policy in the era of Trump?

A decade ago, progressives would have been, and still would be, anti-war, but would they now support NATO and the armament of Ukraine, if just to distinguish themselves from MAGA isolationists? And how would a progressive fit the U.S. into Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s assertion of “middle” nations’ power in his speech earlier this month at the Davos conference?

Before this weekend, I had never heard AOC speak at length, without a script, on foreign policy (or many other topics), and, following the panels streamed on YouTube, I found her for the most part impressive. She argued that income inequality fueled the resentment that triggered the rise of right-wing populism. She noted (as did Carney, though less pointedly) that the “rules-based order” has always excluded the poor from its benefits and the powerful from its obligations, and mused that, contrary to those who say we’re in a “post-rules-based order,” we might be in a “pre-rules-based order.” The real question, in any case, was “rules for whom.” She advocated a “working-class-centered” policy, in part for its own sake, in part to “stave off authoritarianism.” She supported firm commitment to allies, especially those that share our values on human rights and democracy, and adherence to treaties, regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans had signed them.

She didn’t quite explain what a “working-class” foreign policy might entail. (President Joe Biden talked about “a foreign policy for the middle class,” tying the idea to an industrial policy that let the U.S. compete with China in high tech; it’s unclear whether AOC would go there.) Nor did she address how a commitment to alliances would affect the balance between social spending and defense spending. In that realm, she (already famously) fumbled a question on whether she’d defend Taiwan from an attack (though, in fairness, the “strategic ambiguity” of U.S. policy on that question is confusing even to seasoned experts—she just hadn’t been briefed on the proper clichés to utter).

She still needs some seasoning in this sphere, but this was her first exposure, and she’s just 36 years old. She could acquire another 30 years of seasoning and still emerge younger than Trump was the first time he ran for president.

But just as Rubio revealed his true colors on his first stop after Munich, AOC made what could turn out to be her most enduring impression after the conference as well. Rubio stood alongside Europe’s most authoritarian leader, in Budapest. AOC met and spoke with some of its most prominent left-liberal leaders, in Berlin.

She spoke first to leaders of Germany’s Social Democratic Party/SPD and then to its Left Party/Die Linke—both full-house events, mainly about leftish issues, which they had rarely heard about from an American politician, especially one as prominent as AOC.

But apart from the issues, AOC stressed the importance of sticking together. Whatever they might try to accomplish, she said at the first event, the approach “has to be coalitional.”

We have to grow our ranks … because if we go separately, we will lose it all. … Everyone has something to give here, and that’s why I’m proud to meet with Die Linke tomorrow and to be here with SPD today, because we cannot let the right win.

This was a stern message to the two groups of German politicians, who have sharp divisions, despite knowing very well that, a century ago, similar divisions between social democrats and socialists abetted the rise of Hitler. Today, SPD and Die Linke together hold 19 and 10 percent of the seats in Germany’s parliament, respectively. The far-right-wing party, the AfD, holds 24 percent. (The centrist Christian Democratic Union holds 33 percent, and the Green Party holds 13 percent.) Together, the two left-leaning parties outflank AfD; apart, they can get crushed.

AOC is pursuing the same theme back in Washington. Back in 2018, when she was first elected as a Bernie Sanders–type democratic socialist, she formed a huddle with a few like-minded House members who called themselves the Squad. Now she is a power- and coalition-builder, even helping to raise money for centrist Democrats—who ask her for help, knowing that they need her constituents to push them over the edge, just as AOC knows she needs the moderates to push her agenda.

The U.S. probably hasn’t shifted quite left enough to elect AOC president in 2028. (It’s questionable whether she could even win upstate New York in a race for the Senate.) But domestic alliances are shifting, just as global alliances are shifting. In weighing the contestants for America’s top leadership positions, it’s worth noting that Trump, Rubio, and Vance endorse Orbán and the AdF—while AOC tries to unify the SPD and Die Linke.

Which of these sides should America be on?

Last week, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to allow reasonable time for detainees at the Whipple detention center in Minneapolis to access legal counsel. In a 41-page decision, Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel excoriated the government for policies and practices that “all but extinguish” a detainee’s right to counsel. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to professor Linus Chan, the James H. Binger Clinical Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota and the faculty director of the Detainee Rights Clinic, where he represents people who are being detained by ICE or in danger of being detained by ICE.

Dahlia Lithwick: The Justice Department will likely appeal this order, but in the meantime, how much of a difference will this make for folks swept up by ICE in Minnesota, assuming they get 72 hours before being removed to Texas, per the new order? What kind of a difference will this make for clients like yours?

Linus Chan: It’s going to be a huge difference. But also, it’s just returning things to the status quo. And I will be frank, it’s not as if the status quo was a paragon of attorney access, but at the same time, there had always been an operative norm that detainees should be able to talk to their lawyers and not suddenly be transported out of state with no ability to let their loved ones know what’s going on, and even themselves maybe not knowing what’s going on. So this is really important.

Under the old processes, they would get detained, and then they would go through what’s called processing—they might have their biometrics done, there might be an interview with an officer to confirm information that they have in the system, and after that conversation, they would then be put in a holding area for a few hours, and then put into one of the county jails in Minnesota. Most of the time the person’s stay for detention would be either in Minnesota or around the Midwest.

One of the big departures in current practice from what it was in the past was that ICE’s logistical acumen has reached the point of arresting someone at, let’s say, 9:00 in the morning and having them on a plane by noon. It was working like clockwork. People were not going through that longer process I described. They were going very, very quickly, and they could find themselves suddenly in El Paso or New Mexico, most often in Texas because the detention capacity in Texas has grown a lot.

Now, let’s assume this is a client of yours. Even if you knew they were at the Bishop Whipple building, there was no easy way to contact them. If you went online to the detainee locator, a lot of the time it would say the person is in custody, but it would not tell you where they were. It would direct you to call ICE at this number. Of course I’ve done this, I’ve called the number, and nobody ever picks up. It’s just a dead number. So then you have no idea at all what’s going on, but you do know how quickly they have put people on an actual plane out of the country, and have done so even when they legally should not be able to.

On top of that, we have a Trump administration that says that even if they know that it was a mistake, they don’t have to correct that mistake. Once a person is no longer in U.S. custody, they say this is a foreign-power problem, and they don’t have any means to fix it if they are out of the country.

The biggest source of concern and trauma comes from family members who are trying to figure out whether their family member has been kidnapped or whether they’re in immigration detention, and they can’t find out for several hours. So the fact that we have this order that is both trying to make sure that there is attorney access as well as to slow that process down, of transfers, can be tremendously important and powerful. It also gets into another issue which was in terms of habeas access.

Do you want to talk about how that’s changed? Because it seems to me that’s a cornerstone. I think people glaze over because it seems hypertechnical, but this is really where the rubber meets the road.

Habeas, the great writ, is in our Constitution, it’s an English tradition that predates our country, and it’s the general idea that if the government wants to imprison someone, then at some point or another, they need to justify that imprisonment. And if that imprisonment violates any law, and in this case, the United States, violates the Constitution, then a court can order that person to be released.

The history of the writ of habeas corpus and immigration is a very long one. In fact, it goes all the way back to the Chinese exclusion cases, back in the 1860s, 1870s, 1880s, where the federal government was trying to exclude Chinese people from coming to the United States, even if in some cases they were U.S. citizens or had the proper documentation. The way that people would challenge the laws or challenge the policy was through the writ of habeas corpus. There was a period of time. before what’s called the administrative period, where the writ of habeas corpus was the only way to challenge an order of deportation. Let’s say you were ordered deported and you now faced banishment from your country. The only way to get a judge to look at it was to give a writ of habeas corpus.

In the intervening years, there’s been a shift that started most dramatically in the late 1990s, where Congress really did not want immigrants to file writs of habeas corpus to challenge removal orders. So they started to take away the ability of courts to do that. In 2005, there was passage of what’s called the Real ID Act, which was a post- 9/11 piece of legislation that came from this idea that the problem with immigration enforcement was too much review, that there was too much legal process. So they cut it off and basically said that no court can look at the lawfulness of immigration deportation orders, even through habeas, that there is one way, and the only way is through what’s called a circuit court review, having the federal appellate courts eventually review it. That was a huge dramatic change.

But it didn’t prevent people from arguing that their detention was unlawful, while it prevented people from arguing that their removal or their deportation order was unlawful. And that has become so important, because this administration is deliberately using detention as the tool and as the weapon to try to push as many people out as possible. And they are explicit about this. When the students were getting notices that suddenly their visas were being revoked, they were getting letters that said, By the way, if you don’t want to end up detained, you might want to leave now. On the CBP One Home app, they say, You don’t want to get detained, right? Go ahead and sign up to get $1,000 and leave. There’s a reason they are gleefully talking about all the money that they’re using to build detention camps, because it’s driving that.

When they expand detention, when they go back on the former norms, there’s only one way to actually get people to examine whether they could do those things or not, and that’s through the writ of habeas corpus. The writ of habeas corpus, as powerful as it is—and it is—has become more and more difficult to use thanks to layers of  legal doctrines lately.

One of them is what’s called the immediate custodian rule. That is, you can only file a habeas in the district court where they are actually being detained. When I referenced earlier how people didn’t know where they were going, how quickly they were getting transferred, that has become one of the controversies between litigants, the court, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I had this situation where a client of mine was detained one morning, and I filed habeas the next day—this is before it became clear how quickly out-of-state transfers were happening. I filed habeas, and looked my client up on the detainee locator. I couldn’t find her, her family didn’t know where she was, they couldn’t call her, no one knew where she was, and no one was picking up. This was a weekend. ICE had picked her up on Saturday. I filed the habeas corpus on Sunday. Their first reply to that habeas corpus was: You filed in the wrong court. By the time you filed it, she was already in Houston. The case in question, Rumsfeld v. Padilla, said you have to file habeas within the district of confinement, which meant that I was supposed to have filed it in Houston, even though I didn’t know where she was.

The conditions of detention and the scope of what is coming is the end in itself here, because the administration wants people to self-deport. What we are really seeing here is a weaponization of the detention itself. Detention has become the objective, and the crueler the detention, the bigger the win for this administration.

One of the things that’s always been remarkable, and I use the word remarkable because I kind of get stuck on these adjectives, is that as a child growing up as a Gen Xer, there was always this idea of freedom—the American view that we are a free country. If you look at what freedom means, it seems pretty axiomatic to think, Freedom means not being put in jail. But what I think has really become true generally in our society, and now more specifically with immigration, is that we’ve gotten so used to this idea that we can be detained, that we can be imprisoned, that there are all these justifications that the government has to imprison us.

It wasn’t until, I would argue, one of the most important decisions in the 1980s, which justified denying criminal bail to people, that really led to this idea that as long as the government says you’re a danger and you’re a flight risk, you are going to have to disprove it before you can be released. Even though the criminal system has a very important idea that the burden should be on the government, and not on the person being detained, and many immigration folks are trying to push the immigration system to more resemble that burden, if you speak to most on-the-ground criminal defense attorneys, it’s just words on a piece of paper. There has been an unfortunate acceptance of the idea that it’s OK to be detained.

Look at Minnesota, where they are arresting protesters or arresting observers, then they might spend eight hours or overnight, and then be released in negative-20-degree temperatures in the middle of a park without any of their possessions or their phone. That has happened. And then the government is not even bothering to charge them because they don’t think that they actually can make a good case. It’s just another example of how we’ve accepted as a society that when people get arrested, there must be good reason to do it. That’s amazing to me. Doesn’t that completely strike at the heart of us being a free country?

The fact that they could, as has happened here, literally break down the doors to our homes and arrest us without a warrant and then haul us in, and then the only thing we’ll get after they release us after several hours is not even an apology. It shouldn’t shock me but it does. They killed two people with witnesses and video recording in Minneapolis. They won’t apologize for that. So of course they’re not going to apologize for shooting a woman five times in Chicago. They’re not going to apologize for taking people and putting them in a cell for eight hours and then releasing them with no justification. They are not apologizing for the amount of trauma that they are imposing. They believe they’re unaccountable. That’s the thing that I think we really need to try to fix.

The United States government has begun construction of a multibillion-dollar detention camp system in the newest phase of Stephen Miller’s mass deportation strategy. The Department of Homeland Security has purchased two megawarehouses to be converted into 8,000-to-10,000-bed detention centers, with reported plans to buy and convert more than a dozen other warehouses for “processing” masses of new detainees. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick discussed, with journalist Andrea Pitzer, the clear and chilling picture of what the Trump administration is building. Pitzer is the author of several books, including One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, and her most recent newsletter post is “Building the Camps: The Warehouseification of Detention and Initial Thoughts on Stopping It.” The following conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: What is being built? At what speed is it being built? At what cost is it being built? How is it that we’re at the place where the language that you use in your post, concentration camps, actually is not just apt but has become fairly obvious?

Andrea Pitzer: The U.S. already had a pretty extensive immigration deportation system. In the first Trump administration, the White House wanted to prioritize the kinds of optics that signaled that it could go after anybody at any time. That led to a sort of a Keystone Cops approach, and so the numbers of people deported were in fact lower than under Barack Obama. But the optics of things like family separations and the deliberate cruelty were really apparent. The administration learned from that first outing that it needed to do more planning and be more strategic. Now that Donald Trump has returned to office, we’re still seeing a lot of Keystone Cops stuff that the administration probably didn’t intend for people to see, but we’re also seeing a lot of deliberate cruelty on the streets that it does intend for people to see.

Meanwhile, the White House is hoovering up warehouses. Before all these warehouse purchases, there was a turn toward facilities like Camp East Montana, which is this enormous facility that was stood up just last August within Fort Bliss, near El Paso, Texas. They were literally building it out with tents as they were bringing people in. They’ve decided that it doesn’t really meet their needs, and so they are now turning to acquiring these warehouses. There are over 100 the administration in the process of working toward. It’s spent about three-quarters of a billion dollars on buying these so far.

The infrastructure of all that is extraordinary. When you look at some of the biggest concentration camp systems across the world, we are actually approaching or ahead of the numbers for those massive famous ones. The Nazis came to power in 1933 and immediately, within weeks, had opened Dachau—which, I will note, was founded on a converted factory site—so we’re echoing this history right from the beginning. It was not until about five and a half years later, with Kristallnacht, that they started doing large sweeps of German Jews into camps. In that 48-hour period, more than 30,000 Jews were sent into concentration camps. That was five years into Nazi rule.

We are at the end of the first year of this second Trump administration. And even when you look at, let’s say, 1940 to 1941, World War II had started, Germany was putting a lot more people into camps, and yet we have more people in immigrant detention today than Nazi Germany did seven years into the Third Reich, which I think is just astounding when you think about it.

Even before he was elected, Trump was talking about this mass deportation campaign, that there were up to 20 million people in the United States illegally. Historians debate how many people moved through the Soviet gulag, whether it was 18 million or 20 million people in more than two decades who went through that system. What the Trump administration is talking about are those numbers in a four-year period. If you know anything about how horrific the Soviet gulag was, you’ll recall that it transformed the country for generations that followed, and it wrecked lives.

The Soviets didn’t know in advance what they were doing, but Stephen Miller has that context. That is something key people in the administration are openly embracing. We are already seeing conditions in those camps that rival early Nazi concentration camps, with illness, disease, and reports of limited access to medical care. We’ve had a killing in Camp East Montana that has been declared a homicide. People have already died.

This is not something this administration stumbles into sideways, right? This was the plan. Last April, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons was heard to say that what he really, really wanted to do was to just run deportations like a business: “Like Amazon Prime, but with human beings,” he said. We are witnessing the construction of a system for just warehousing people systematically. How much of what we are seeing playing out right now is just the tip of the iceberg for what is imagined?

If we look at that “Amazonification,” different concentration camps evolved over time in different ways. I often use the Nazi example because it’s almost the only concentration camp system people know, even though there have been a bunch of different ones. The Nazis were the very first who took this logistical approach that we think of as Amazonification now. There was a detainee named Margarete Buber-Neumann, who wrote an amazing memoir, Under Two Dictators. She was detained in the Soviet gulag system, then later held in the Nazi concentration camp system. The Soviets handed her over to the Gestapo at the beginning of World War II, and she describes coming to the Nazi camp system and being issued clothes and utensils to eat with. It was this whole system that was very sadistic, but it was incredibly scripted and organized. Of course, that went to hell once the war started, but this warehouse-ification of people was exactly the initial Nazi goal. The extermination of people through that warehouse system became the later explicit goal.

In terms of what our government is doing, I want to make clear: This can happen in a country only when things have been deeply wrong for a number of years in a number of ways. What we’ve already seen in the U.S., with prisons, with decades of demonizing immigrants, with the already existing nature of our punitive immigration system, where detention is literally used as a deterrent and to do harm to people—all that gives Trump these initial tools that they are clearly planning to expand on in tremendous ways.

People are waking up to what’s happening on the ground, which is amazing and offers all kinds of potential for things to do. But I don’t think people understand the scope of it. If they end up with all these warehouses, what automatically follows from that is you have transit camps and you have hub camps and you have whole communities whose identities become bound up with these warehouses. This is why we see some of these small towns and cities already working to reject the Immigration and Customs Enforcement warehouses. Dachau is the name of the town. Just think, for how many places in our country is that what is going to be meant by their names going forward?

According to the plans that we see from Miller and Trump, this will be as large as—and potentially even larger than—the U.S. prison system, which is already so much larger than almost anything else in the world. It will exist almost entirely outside the realm of oversight, of accountability. Concentration camp systems are always an end run around the existing legal system in a country at a given time. This isn’t just going to be criminal detainees. We’re already seeing people with documentation disappearing in this system, people who are here lawfully. We have seen U.S. citizens that have ended up in some of these settings. The goal is never to do detention against just the targeted group. The goal with these is always political: the expansion of political power and the entrenchment of political power. By definition, that means that other people will be going into these camps over time. The objective is really expanding and locking down control over public life in America. It is the ability to silence any kind of dissent.

Americans are waking up to the reality of horrifying dispatches from Camp East Montana, located near El Paso, Texas: reports of hunger, of violence, of sexual assault, of death. Who is accountable for this?

I think everybody involved has to run the risk of accountability. The sooner we can shut down the largest wave of this as it’s growing, the smaller that number will be. And it is better not only that less harm comes to people; even on the other side of this, the fewer people who will have to be held accountable in some way, the better it is for society. So even for the perpetrators, it is better if we can shut this down, but especially for the people that would have harm done to them.

It may be hard to imagine accountability in this moment, when so many systems are collapsing, but I think of the people I talked to in Argentina who had been tortured and held. In some cases, they had been sexually assaulted, their friends killed. There was never a hard end where the military made itself accountable there. The dictatorship ended, but there was never this moment of accountability. That came years later. One woman I interviewed remembered that while she was blindfolded, she was able to peek under her blindfold and see a tile pattern on the floor. When it came time to testify, they testified to everything that they could remember. Somebody went and found that tile pattern, and they found the floor, they found the house she had been held in, and they talked to the neighbors, and the neighbors recalled hearing the screams. They were able to work their way through these unbelievably difficult investigations to bring leading military figures to justice, but also people underneath them.

You have to, first of all, for PR purposes, make everybody think they’re going to be accountable for everything going forward. Then, in the end, on the other side of this, you decide how you deal with the small potatoes. But there is going to have to be some kind of accountability. It was a serious shame from the Obama era that this was not done when he came to power in early 2009, in the face of what had happened in the war on terror. The lack of accountability at that point has enabled much of what has followed. Obama’s not personally responsible as if he had launched the war on terror himself, but he bears some of that responsibility, because without those accountability moments, this is exactly where you end up.

Reforms are good, for sure, but if you’re focused on them, the correct response to Dachau was not better training for the guards. So we can talk about better training, and we can talk about standards, but that ultimately is not going to be what addresses this. Everybody needs to face accountability.

            <h2>Google digs deep to power AI expansion with 150 MW geothermal deal</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/18/google_ormat_geothermal_datacenter_deal/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Datacenter power consumption has surged amid the AI boom, forcing builders to get creative in order to prevent their capex-heavy bit barns from running out of steam. But at least in some parts of the world, the answer to abundant clean energy may be hiding just a few thousand feet below the surface of the earth.

This week, Ormat Technologies, a company specializing in geothermal energy generation, announced an agreement with Nevada&#39;s NV Energy to supply an additional 150 megawatts to the grid to support Google&#39;s datacenter expansion in the region.

The Chocolate Factory was among the first US hyperscalers to embrace geothermal energy as a means of offsetting its datacenter carbon footprint going back to at least 2008.

In 2023, Google partner Fervo Energy brought its first &quot;enhanced geothermal plant&quot; online. The facility, also located in Nevada, uses heat generated by the Earth&#39;s crust to convert water into steam which, like in most other power plants, is converted into energy using turbines.

The challenge is getting the water deep enough to generate steam. At least in the case of the Fervo trial, this involved technologies originally developed by the oil and gas industry to bore two parallel wells to a depth of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters). The rock was then fractured to allow water to pass between the two wells where it was heated to temperatures exceeding 190 degrees Celsius.

This initial trial was quite small, generating around 3.5 megawatts. A year later, Fervo and Google expanded their collaboration, signing an agreement to supply an additional 115 megawatts of power to the grid. That&#39;s plenty for a conventional datacenter campus of a few years ago, but pales in comparison to the power required by modern AI datacenters, which are expected to exceed a gigawatt of compute capacity within the next couple years.

Ormat&#39;s agreement with NV Energy will more than double the supply of geothermal energy – if the company gets the green light from the state Public Utilities Commission later this year. Barring any delays, Ormat expects the geothermal plants to begin producing power between 2028 and 2030, and continue operating for at least 15 years after.

Google isn&#39;t the only hyperscaler investing in geothermal power. Meta has also explored the tech. In 2024, the company struck a deal with Sage Geosystems to deliver up to 150 megawatts of power harvested from the Earth.

While the tech isn&#39;t without its challenges, experts believe that it could address a sizable portion of datacenter demand going forward.

A report published by the think tank Rhodium Group estimated that geothermal power could meet up to 64 percent of expected datacenter growth by the early 2030s. However, for the tech to be economically viable, bit barn operators will have to be willing to pay a 20 percent premium over regional power sources, and hope that tax credits on geothermal power aren&#39;t cut. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/18/microsoft_copilot_data_loss_prevention/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The bot couldn&#39;t keep its prying eyes away. Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat has been summarizing emails labeled “confidential” even when data loss prevention policies were configured to prevent it.

Though there are data sensitivity labels and data loss prevention policies in place for email, Copilot has been ignoring those and talking about secret stuff in the Copilot Chat tab. It&#39;s just this sort of scenario that has led 72 percent of S&P 500 companies to cite AI as a material risk in regulatory filings.

Redmond, earlier this month, acknowledged the problem in a notice to Office admins that&#39;s tracked as CW1226324, as reposted by the UK&#39;s National Health Service support portal. Customers are said to have reported the problem on January 21, 2026.

&quot;Users&#39; email messages with a confidential label applied are being incorrectly processed by Microsoft 365 Copilot chat,&quot; the notice says. &quot;The Microsoft 365 Copilot &#39;work tab&#39; Chat is summarizing email messages even though these email messages have a sensitivity label applied and a DLP policy is configured.&quot;

Microsoft explains that sensitivity labels can be applied manually or automatically to files as a way to comply with organizational information security policies. These labels may function differently in different applications, the company says.

The software giant&#39;s documentation makes clear that these labels do not function in a consistent way.

&quot;Although content with the configured sensitivity label will be excluded from Microsoft 365 Copilot in the named Office apps, the content remains available to Microsoft 365 Copilot for other scenarios,&quot; the documentation explains. &quot;For example, in Teams, and in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat.&quot;

DLP, implemented through applications like Microsoft Purview, is supposed to provide policy support to prevent data loss.

&quot;DLP monitors and protects against oversharing in enterprise apps and on devices,&quot; Microsoft explains. &quot;It targets Microsoft 365 locations, like Exchange and SharePoint, and locations you add, like on-premises file shares, endpoint devices, and non-Microsoft cloud apps.&quot;

In theory, DLP policies should be able to affect Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Chat. But that hasn&#39;t been happening in this instance.

The root cause is said to be &quot;a code issue [that] is allowing items in the sent items and draft folders to be picked up by Copilot even though confidential labels are set in place.&quot;

Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The notice says the company is in the process of remediating the issue and is contacting affected customers to check on the effectiveness of the fix. A remediation timeline is planned at some point. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s taken about five years, but DARPA&#39;s missile-launching missile has become the government&#39;s latest experimental X-plane and is advancing toward flight testing.

Calling it a missile-carrying missile may have a nice ring to it, but the X-68A &quot;LongShot&quot; isn&#39;t strictly a missile itself. LongShot is actually a full-fledged unmanned aircraft that&#39;s air-launched like a missile from larger human-piloted aircraft with the goal of eliminating airborne threats without putting human pilots at risk.

&quot;LongShot burns down significant technical risk and presents a viable path for the military services to increase air combat reach and effectiveness from uninhabited, air-launched platforms,&quot; program manager Colonel John Casey said in DARPA&#39;s update on the state of the program. &quot;We&#39;ve completed critical milestones necessary for the integrated flight test campaign, which will validate vehicle performance and lay the foundation for efficient follow-on development.&quot;

Given that this is a highly experimental DARPA program, details about those critical milestones are scarce, with the Defense Department&#39;s research arm only saying that the craft recently completed full-scale wind tunnel tests and successful trials of its parachute recovery and weapon-release systems. Colonel Casey provided some additional details to The Register in an email, noting that the LongShot team has been &quot;diligently working&quot; on maturing systems since the program began.

&quot;We have made significant progress in the detailed design of a complex flight vehicle and actuation mechanisms to go from a captive store to a flying vehicle,&quot; Casey told us. &quot;Further, we have made steady progress on the airworthiness and safe separation artifacts to build towards flight testing.&quot;

DARPA wants LongShot to be aircraft-agnostic so that it can be integrated into fighters, bombers, or palletized for launch from larger support aircraft. For its upcoming flight tests, which DARPA said it wants to conduct &quot;as early as the end of 2026,&quot; the X-68A LongShot will be deployed from an F-15.

LongShot began under DARPA in 2021 with Phase I design contracts awarded to General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. Following a successful Preliminary Design Review in February 2022, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) was selected to continue into Phase 2 in March 2022. Back then GA-ASI said it intended to conduct flight tests of the LongShot by 2024, which clearly hasn&#39;t happened yet.

DARPA noted in 2021 that LongShot was being designed to be capable of controlled flight, and we&#39;re told the current iteration of the system is autonomous.

&quot;For the DARPA demonstration system, the X-68A flies autonomously executing mission plans and maneuvers that it is commanded to execute,&quot; Casey explained in his email. In terms of payload, Casey explained that DARPA wants LongShot to integrate &quot;at least two existing air-to-air weapons,&quot; giving it multiple opportunities to engage hostile aircraft.

Given that it&#39;s still experimental, it&#39;s not definite that the X-68A will ever make it past the trial phase, and if it does, Casey did not share when the Department of Defense could feasibly begin to field the aircraft.

&quot;As an experimental flight test demonstrator, the X-68A is intended to prove the flight controls and mechanisms function as designed,&quot; Casey explained. &quot;Follow-on development would be necessary to expand the concept from an X-plane to a combat capability.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Spanish police arrested a hacker who allegedly manipulated a hotel booking website, allowing him to pay one cent for luxury hotel stays. He also raided the mini-bars and didn&#39;t settle some of those tabs, police say.

&quot;This cyberattack was specifically designed to alter the payment validation system, and this is the first time we have detected a crime using this method,&quot; Spain&#39;s National Police told media outlets.

The man, a 20-year-old Spanish national, was arrested while staying at a Madrid hotel with a four-night reservation that carried a €4,000 ($4,716) price tag – unless you hacked the payment system, as this fraudster did.

According to the cops, he stayed at this hotel several times, costing the business more than €20,000 ($23,608) in losses.

Police began investigating the suspect earlier this month after an unnamed online booking website reported suspicious activity. The transactions appeared normal, indicating the man paid the full amount – at first.

Days later, however, when the site transferred the actual amount paid to the hotel, the payment-validation scam surfaced, indicating that the crook paid just one cent for rooms costing €1,000 ($1,179) per night.

Adding insult to injury, police said that the man also consumed mini-bar bottles and sometimes left those bills unpaid, too.

While he may be facing a free stay at a mini-bar free, unluxurious facility for his alleged crimes, we have an idea for his next big vacay, post-prison: an inflatable moon hotel.

The definitely-going-to-happen hotel, slated to open in 2032, requires a deposit of either $250,000 or $1 million. No word on whether GRU Space, the hotel&#39;s operators, have received any one cent deposits – yet. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has finally ushered in the era of MIDI 2.0 for Windows 11, more than a year after first teasing the functionality for Windows Insiders.

In addition to a raft of enhancements, Microsoft has addressed several key user pain points in this release: allowing multiple applications to use the same MIDI device and port simultaneously, and permitting users to control the names assigned to MIDI ports.

MIDI 1.0 dates back to 1983, and official support appeared with Windows 3.1, although extensions were available in earlier versions. MIDI 2.0 dates to 2020, and, according to Microsoft, key updates to the protocol specification were later made to support better discovery and fallback.

At its core, it is a communication protocol to connect electronic musical instruments and computers.

Pete Brown, principal software engineer at Microsoft, has talked about the technology for years, and a preview arrived on February 5, 2025, for Windows Insiders in the Canary Channel.

At the time of the preview, a musician pal of The Register enthused, &quot;Having inbox MIDI 1.0 and 2.0 drivers means the end of badly written OEM drivers. The new multi-client MIDI implementation ensures you&#39;re no longer locked into a single application, allowing for custom MIDI routing while still using a DAW.&quot;

The possibilities offered by MIDI 2.0 were also lauded – faster connection speeds and two-way communication were singled out for particular praise.

That said, backwards compatibility with MIDI 1.0 is critical. The old usbaudio.sys driver has been retained, and Microsoft has &quot;fixed some small bugs in it to make it even better.&quot; A newer USB MIDI 2.0 class driver, usbmidi2.sys, is also present, although the Windows behemoth noted:

&quot;By default, most MIDI 1.0 devices will continue to use the older driver, to ensure compatibility, but can be manually assigned to the new driver if/when desired.&quot;

The post by Brown and Gary Daniels marks a refreshing change for Microsoft, as it does not mention Copilot or AI at all. As such, there is unlikely to be a perky assistant helpfully asking, &quot;It looks like you&#39;re trying to make some sweet, sweet music. Do you want some help with that?&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">TP-Link is facing legal action from the state of Texas for allegedly misleading consumers with &quot;Made in Vietnam&quot; claims despite China-dominated manufacturing and supply chains, and for marketing its devices as secure despite reported firmware vulnerabilities exploited by Chinese state-sponsored actors.

The Lone Star State&#39;s Attorney General, Ken Paxton, is filing the lawsuit against California-based TP-Link Systems Inc., which was originally founded in China, accusing it of deceptively marketing its networking devices and alleging that its security practices and China-based affiliations allowed Chinese state-sponsored actors to access devices in the homes of American consumers.

It is understood that this is just the first of several lawsuits that the Office of the Attorney General intends to file this week against &quot;China-aligned companies,&quot; as part of a coordinated effort to hold China accountable under Texas law.

The lawsuit claims that TP-Link is the dominant player in the US networking and smart home market, controlling 65 percent of the American market for network devices.

It also alleges that TP-Link represents to American consumers that the devices it markets and sells within the US are manufactured in Vietnam, and that consistent with this, the devices it sells in the American market carry a &quot;Made in Vietnam&quot; sticker.

However, the Attorney General alleges that, despite these representations, TP-Link’s networking and smart home devices are manufactured and developed by Chinese subsidiaries owned and managed by the company. The petition claims the facilities in Vietnam perform only final assembly, with the vast majority of components imported from China and Vietnam-sourced parts accounting for less than one percent of the devices’ components.

The lawsuit further alleges that the Chinese government confers subsidies on TP-Link, and that the relationship runs deeper than financial support; a Chinese military company is claimed to be working to expand TP-Link&#39;s manufacturing, research, and development facilities in Vietnam.

Getting to the meat of the claims, the lawsuit says that TP-Link falsely claims its devices are secure, yet security researchers and experts have for years reported on TP-Link&#39;s &quot;numerous and dangerous&quot; firmware vulnerabilities that Chinese state-sponsored hackers have exploited to access the devices.

This would seem to be different from the allegation that TP-Link allows Chinese agents to access its network devices. What the lawsuit actually claims is that TP-Link knows its products are insecure, and that Chinese state-sponsored hackers have taken advantage of the vulnerabilities. It stops short of openly accusing TP-Link of purposely providing backdoors for hackers or refraining from fixing vulnerabilities so that they can be used this way.

However, this didn&#39;t stop The Register columnist Rupert Goodwins from insinuating just such a thing some time ago.

Federal security agencies were also concerned enough about TP-Link routers being used in cyberattacks that a complete ban on their sale was reported to be under consideration in the US at one point. This week, however, it was reported that the US may instead lift bans on some Chinese firms operating in the US, and also walk away from plans to block sales of TP-Link products.

America&#39;s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also disclosed two flaws in routers made by TP-Link last year that were actively being exploited and needed to be urgently fixed.

The Texas Attorney General also claims that TP-Link&#39;s mobile applications collect personal data from consumers while failing to obtain informed consent for this. Chinese national intelligence laws can require Chinese companies and citizens to support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work, the filing says, and it alleges that TP-Link’s Chinese affiliations could obligate it to comply with such requests.

By omitting this material fact, the company misleads US consumers and fails to obtain informed consent regarding their data, the Office of the Attorney General states.

The Office of the Attorney General is seeking a jury trial for this case, and wants an injunction to prevent TP-Link from claiming its products are &quot;Made in Vietnam,&quot; and instead acknowledge that they are made in China. It further wants the company to be forced to make clear its ties to China, and prevent it from collecting consumers&#39; data without obtaining fully informed consent.

&quot;TP-Link will face the full force of the law for putting Americans&#39; security at risk. Let this serve as a clear warning to any Chinese entity seeking to compromise our nation&#39;s security,&quot; Attorney General Paxton commented.

We asked TP-Link for its reaction to this news and will update if we get an answer. ®

If you know where to look, you can often score deals on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the newer AirPods Pro 3. And while more recent shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday delivered some of the steepest discounts we’ve seen, there are still good deals to be found on every model.

Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each set of AirPods, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the third-gen AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max.

At the end of 2024, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.

The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.

Given they’ve been out for over a year, we consistently see discounts for both iterations of the AirPods 4. During Black Friday, we saw the standard model drop to a new low of $74. However, right now, they’re only down to $99 ($30 off) at Amazon and Walmart. The AirPods 4 with ANC, meanwhile, are on sale for $139.99 (about $39 off) at Amazon and Walmart, which is well above their all-time low of $99.

The third-gen AirPods Pro add a new built-in heart rate sensor and live translation feature. They also improve upon their predecessor with enhanced noise cancellation, improved sound quality, and a fifth swappable ear tip.

At its “Awe Dropping” event in September, Apple introduced the AirPods Pro 3. In addition to improved ANC and sound, the third-gen earbuds include a built-in heart rate sensor that syncs with the iPhone Fitness app, allowing you to track your pulse and calories burned across more than 50 workout types. They’re also more comfortable and secure than their predecessor, thanks to a redesigned, angled fit and five ear tip sizes — including a new XXS option. Additionally, they carry a more robust IP57 rating and support Apple’s new live translation feature, which, in our testing, generally conveys the gist well but still can’t beat a human interpreter.

Given how recently they launched, we’ve been surprised by how frequently the AirPods Pro 3 have been discounted. Recently, we saw them drop to as low as $199, which was cheaper than they were during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. As of this update, though, they’re only available at Amazon and Walmart for $229 ($20 off).

The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the best noise-canceling headphones for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.

Toward the end of 2024, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a newer model that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. In the past, we’ve seen them drop to as low as $399, but right now they’re only on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $449 ($100 off), which is still one of their better prices to date.

            <div id="article-text">The Chinese-owned Swedish automaker is aiming to cut costs by revamping two existing models.

The Chinese-owned Swedish automaker is aiming to cut costs by revamping two existing models.

Polestar says it will release four new electric models over the next three years, including a new SUV and a revamped version of its Polestar 2 sedan.

The Swedish automaker, which is owned by China’s Geely, said it will start delivering its Polestar 5 grand tourer to customers this summer, followed by a new long-roof variant of its Polestar 4 in the fourth quarter. In early 2027, a “new successor” to the Polestar 2 will go into production. And in 2028, the company is planning to release a compact premium SUV as the Polestar 7.

The news comes after Polestar reported strong sales growth in 2025, with the automaker’s full-year sales reaching approximately 60,119 cars, a 34 percent increase over 2024. And while revenue for the first nine months of 2025 grew 49 percent to $2.17 billion, the company reported a significant net loss of $1.558 billion for the same period.

Geely has stepped up several times to back Polestar with equity investments and loan guarantees. Polestar is hoping that these lower cost updates — revamping the Polestar 4’s body, reviving the Polestar 2 — can continue to drive sales growth while reining in the company’s losses.

First on the list is the Polestar 5, which boasts 460 miles of range, an 800-volt architecture for ultra-fast charging, 884 horsepower, and 0-60mph in 3.1 seconds for the Performance trim. Polestar CEO Michael Longscheller calls the 5 “our brand halo car, bringing a new level of performance and luxury to the grand-tourer segment.” The four-door GT is expected to cost upwards of $120,000 when it’s released.

The Polestar 4, which is already sparking controversy with its lack of a rear windshield, is getting a makeover to turn it into more of an estate car, or station wagon, for European customers. “Sweden is famous for its estate cars, and its SUVs are world-class,” Longscheller says in a press release. “We are combining the space of an estate and the versatility of an SUV with the dynamic performance that is Polestar.”

Polestar stopped taking orders for the Polestar 2 last year, raising fears that it was discontinuing the EV that put the brand on the map. Now Longscheller says the company is working at “record speed” to bring the next-gen version of the 2 to market at the start of 2027.

Lastly, the Polestar 7 SUV will compete “the largest EV segment in Europe,” which is compact SUVs, Longscheller says: “We are convinced that we can offer customers a progressive performance-driven car for a very attractive price point, built in Europe.”

A new speed test tool is coming to your taskbar.

Microsoft is working on a bunch of new features for Windows 11, including a new network speed test that you can access from your taskbar. The tool is bundled in an update rolling out to Windows 11 Insiders in the Release Preview Channel, allowing you to right-click the network icon in the system tray to access a speed test option that opens in your default browser.

From there, you can check how fast your connection is over Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or cellular data. Microsoft first started testing this feature last year, and it could offer a convenient alternative to checking your connection speed by navigating to third-party websites.

There’s also a new camera settings option coming to the Settings menu, giving you the ability to control the pan and tilt for supported cameras (though Microsoft doesn’t say which devices work with the new feature). Microsoft is adding new emoji to Windows 11, too, a full-page Widget settings menu, and the ability to set .webp files as your desktop background.

You can check out the update via the Release Preview Channel. It’s rolling out now to Windows 11 versions 24H2 (Build 26100) and 25H2 (Build 26200).

            <div id="article-text">Despite the actor’s reservations, the nearly three-hour-long Kokuho has become Japan’s top-grossing live-action film.

Despite the actor’s reservations, the nearly three-hour-long Kokuho has become Japan’s top-grossing live-action film.

A three-hour-long period drama about kabuki, a centuries-old form of Japanese theater, doesn’t exactly sound like box office gold. But that’s exactly what happened with Kokuho. Director Lee Sang-il’s adaptation of the Shuichi Yoshida novel of the same name was a surprise hit last year, becoming Japan’s top-grossing live-action film domestically. But star Ken Watanabe — a veteran actor known for Hollywood movies like Inception and Detective Pikachu — initially didn’t think it was a good idea. He loved the novel, but worried that the art form wouldn’t translate well to film.

“‘Don’t do that,’” he remembers telling Sang-il when he first pitched the idea. “Kabuki is a very strict culture in Japan, and it’s hard for a normal actor to play in a kabuki play.” Despite these reservations, it was a success, and now Kokuho has the chance to reach a wider audience, releasing in theaters across the US on February 20th.

The film follows the lives of two actors. There’s Kikuo Tachibana (Ryo Yoshizawa), the orphaned son of a yakuza boss who is taken on as an apprentice by legendary kabuki actor Hanjiro (Watanabe). He’s joined by Shunsuke Ōgaki (Ryusei Yokohama), Hanjiro’s son, who has been groomed from a young age to succeed his father. Kokuho tracks their diverting careers over the course of 50 years, from 1964 to 2014, as each dedicates themselves to the demanding role known as onnagata, or male kabuki actors who play female roles. It’s a beautiful and at times devastating portrait of the lengths artists go to in search of greatness.

It’s also a film that demanded a lot of its performers. Due to the highly specific and physically difficult movements required of an onnagata, Kokuho’s two leads spent around 18 months training to get things right. Watanabe’s character spends a comparatively small amount of time performing in the film, but even still, he says he trained for around four months to learn the moves and choreography. Things were only made more challenging by the heavy wigs, elaborate costumes, and long shoots. “All difficult things connect to joy,” he says of the preparation. “It’s all part of a process of getting somewhere. So I never really felt like it was painful or extremely difficult. However, I do complain on occasion. Just sometimes.”

Watanabe’s character is a constant presence throughout the film, particularly early on. In the ’60s, he trains the budding kabuki stars (played by child actors Sōya Kurokawa and Keitatsu Koshiyama), who develop a budding rivalry, in part over his approval. “My role was to watch these two characters from being a child to becoming these great kabuki actors, so I was this watchful eye throughout their careers,” Watanabe explains. “The child actors worked really hard as well, so I got to see them grow up through the process of the film, which is a new experience for me.”

However, while he was a mentor in the film, Watanabe says that, despite his storied career, he didn’t take on a similar role off-camera. “When I was young, I always felt that acting with others was like stepping into the same ring, and that our career and level of experience doesn’t matter,” he explains. “I still approach acting the same way. I don’t take the role of a teacher or someone who guides in real life, because we’re all equals stepping up into the same ring.”

Watanabe is still unclear on just why Kokuho was such a success. Maybe it has to do in part with how detailed the production is, not just in terms of the impressive kabuki costumes and performances, but also the period-appropriate sets, which change frequently as the story jumps ahead in time. Whatever the reason, he says that a few days after the film premiered in Japan, he tracked sentiments on social media, and “realized that young people love this movie. Then maybe a month later, we couldn’t believe the success.”

Despite his initial reservations, working on Kokuho has been a rewarding experience for Watanabe. Though he didn’t previously have experience with kabuki specifically, he got his start acting on stage, and in 2015 made his Broadway debut as the lead in The King and I. And he says that because of this, shooting Kokuho was a nostalgic experience, describing the feeling as “kind of like déjà vu.” It was such a strong feeling, in fact, that seeing the movie for the first time hit him hard. “I couldn’t stop the tears seeing the final moment of this film,” he says.

If you want a Chromebook that can double as a tablet when you need it to, Acer’s Chromebook Plus Spin 514 is one of the better 2-in-1s on the market. And you can buy it with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $499 ($200 off), which is a new low price, at Best Buy until the end of today, February 18th.

Powered by the Kompanio Ultra 910 processor, the 14-inch Chromebook offers impressive performance that’s great for everyday work and play. In our testing, we found it can comfortably handle Slack, Spotify, and dozens of open Chrome tabs without slowing down. Battery life is excellent too, lasting a full workday and pushing well into the next. The 1920 x 1200 IPS touchscreen is also nice, with a snappy 120Hz refresh rate.

You also get a comfortable keyboard that’s pleasant to type on, along with a sharp 5MP webcam that’s great for video calls. If you want to use it for note-taking or sketching, the Chromebook also supports the USI 2.0 stylus, though you’ll have to buy that separately.

The main downside is the speakers, which sound muddy and muffled, so you’ll likely want to use headphones or external speakers. If you can overlook that, though, it’s a good overall Chromebook that can handle most tasks without costing a fortune.

            <div id="article-text">Musk used to call the Moon ‘a distraction.’ Now he says SpaceX is building a city there.

Musk used to call the Moon ‘a distraction.’ Now he says SpaceX is building a city there.

Maybe you’ve heard, but Elon Musk is apparently a Moon fan now. He has historically been the ultimate cheerleader for human missions to Mars, and as recently as last year, he said his aim was to go straight to the red planet and that the Moon was “a distraction.” Now, he has apparently changed his mind, announcing that SpaceX has shifted focus to building a city on the Moon.

Within the space science community, this news about the Moon has largely been met with eye rolls, primarily because so many have become jaded toward Musk’s overly ambitious plans and wildly unrealistic time scales.

“It was hard for me to take those Mars plans seriously,” said space policy expert Wendy Whitman Cobb of the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies. She has kept an eye on SpaceX’s job postings in recent years and pointed out that the company has shown no interest in hiring roles related to Mars technologies. This suggests there has long been a disconnect between the actual work that SpaceX is doing in its development of Starship versus the grandiose way that Musk has talked about future colonization plans.

“It was hard for me to take those Mars plans seriously.”

“I’m not sure SpaceX, the company, was ever focused on Mars. I think that was largely [Musk],” she said.

Even among the most ardent Mars enthusiasts, there is an acknowledgement that the technical challenges standing between humanity and a crewed Mars mission are significant. Building habitats, growing food, protecting against radiation, and other issues of infrastructure and procedure are significant obstacles that have to be overcome, not to mention challenges such as in-space refueling of rockets and launching a rocket from another planet — which comes with its own challenges related to the extremely thin carbon dioxide atmosphere and the lack of a launchpad to use as a stable base.

These are all potentially solvable issues, but they require the development and testing of new technologies, which will take years or, more likely, decades. And when you are looking for a testing ground, the Moon — a few days away from Earth, with evacuation possible in an emergency — is significantly more appealing than Mars, where astronauts would be on their own for months at a time.

This has been NASA’s approach in recent years under its Moon to Mars program. First, the logic goes, we use the Artemis program to test and practice putting astronauts on a lunar base for a period of weeks or longer, then we use that knowledge to send future explorers on longer-term missions to Mars.

“The Moon is the most natural place in the world to me, to start in terms of a long-term, sustained presence in deep space,” said astronomer Paul Byrne of Washington University in St. Louis. It would have been easier to do this building directly from the Apollo missions in the ’60s and ’70s, when institutional knowledge was still available, but it can still be done: “The best time to do it was after Apollo, but the second best time to do it is now.”

The Moon is significantly more appealing than Mars, where astronauts would be on their own for months at a time

There are also good scientific reasons to visit the Moon, such as learning about the formation of the solar system. There are even proposals to put telescopes there, taking advantage of the lack of atmosphere to allow much greater power from a smaller telescope compared to those on Earth.

But the most pressing motivations to return humans to the Moon are largely geopolitical, with China seeking to expand its human space program and stake out a presence there within the next decade and the US unwilling to be beaten to the punch.

Similarly, SpaceX’s guiding motivation may be less philosophical and more classically capitalist, as the company engages in some old-fashioned competition with its rival Blue Origin. Jeff Bezos’ company is developing its own lunar lander for NASA and could potentially leapfrog SpaceX to become a significant lunar partner for NASA.

“It’s maybe just basic business rivalry,” Whitman Cobb said. “That has been the hallmark of Blue Origin versus SpaceX for decades now.” There’s also the matter of SpaceX’s looming IPO and the need to show investors what a realistic plan for making money might involve.

Whatever the motivations of those involved, and for all the frustration with Musk’s off-the-cuff approach to announcing space policy, there is a hope that having him come around to supporting a practically achievable Moon mission is a positive step.

There’s also the matter of SpaceX’s looming IPO, and the need to show investors what a realistic plan for making money might involve

“I find it encouraging, because it is more realistic,” said Kyler Kuehn, acting director of Science at Lowell Observatory. “Even if the timescale is maybe still unrealistic.”

Even now, Musk is claiming that, following Moon missions, SpaceX will be building a city on Mars “in about 5 to 7 years,” a hilariously optimistic timeline given that Starship has not even been proven flightworthy yet. You might recall Musk previously claiming that humans would be on Mars by 2022, or 2024, or 2029.

He has also discussed making cities on Mars “self-sustaining,” an even more ambitious and unrealistic goal for the near future, as well as sci-fi ideas like terraforming Mars and building spaceports there. It’s not that these grand plans could never be realized by humanity, but they certainly won’t be happening in any of our lifetimes, and pretending that they’ll enable human life on Mars within the next few years is delusional at best and downright deceptive at worst.

After all, it’s easy to make an announcement, but much harder to grapple with the careful, incremental process of technological development — especially when there are human lives at stake. Under these conditions, experts aren’t surprised when space project timelines continually slip.

“When you go from marketing to the actual engineering, this is always what was going to happen,” said Kuehn.

And, he points out, there is value in being upfront about the scale of the challenges ahead: “If people understood that these problems are hard and it’s going to take decades — they might not like to hear it, but they would get a better idea of how this really works, and in some ways, that can be inspirational. It’s a multi-generation problem: I am not going to get to go to Mars, but maybe my daughter will.”

However, as the gulf between the tech bro marketing speak and the slow, expensive, careful reality of space exploration widens, “there’s a risk that the public will get jaded by this, at the time when NASA and other space agencies need the public to get behind them,” said Byrne.

As the face of space exploration to much of the public, Musk’s words still carry weight and therefore responsibility: “There comes a point where the public is either going to lose interest or just start to think that this is a scam and it’s not ever going to work.”

            <h2>Google DeepMind wants to know if chatbots are just virtue signaling</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/18/1133299/google-deepmind-wants-to-know-if-chatbots-are-just-virtue-signaling/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google DeepMind is calling for the moral behavior of large language models—such as what they do when called on to act as companions, therapists, medical advisors, and so on—to be scrutinized with the same kind of rigor as their ability to code or do math.

As LLMs improve, people are asking them to play more and more sensitive roles in their lives. Agents are starting to take actions on people’s behalf. LLMs may be able to influence human decision-making. And yet nobody knows how trustworthy this technology really is at such tasks.

With coding and math, you have clear-cut, correct answers that you can check, William Isaac, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, told me when I met him and Julia Haas, a fellow research scientist at the firm, for an exclusive preview of their work, which is published in Nature today. That’s not the case for moral questions, which typically have a range of acceptable answers: “Morality is an important capability but hard to evaluate,” says Isaac.

“In the moral domain, there’s no right and wrong,” adds Haas. “But it’s not by any means a free-for-all. There are better answers and there are worse answers.”

The researchers have identified several key challenges and suggested ways to address them. But it is more a wish list than a set of ready-made solutions. “They do a nice job of bringing together different perspectives,” says Vera Demberg, who studies LLMs at Saarland University in Germany.

A number of studies have shown that LLMs can show remarkable moral competence. One study published last year found that people in the US scored ethical advice from OpenAI’s GPT-4o as being more moral, trustworthy, thoughtful, and correct than advice given by the (human) writer of “The Ethicist,” a popular New York Times advice column.

The problem is that it is hard to unpick whether such behaviors are a performance—mimicking a memorized response, say—or evidence that there is in fact some kind of moral reasoning taking place inside the model. In other words, is it virtue or virtue signaling?

This question matters because multiple studies also show just how untrustworthy LLMs can be. For a start, models can be too eager to please. They have been found to flip their answer to a moral question and say the exact opposite when a person disagrees or pushes back on their first response. Worse, the answers an LLM gives to a question can change in response to how it is presented or formatted. For example, researchers have found that models quizzed about political values can give different—sometimes opposite—answers depending on whether the questions offer multiple-choice answers or instruct the model to respond in its own words.

In an even more striking case, Demberg and her colleagues presented several LLMs, including versions of Meta’s Llama 3 and Mistral, with a series of moral dilemmas and asked them to pick which of two options was the better outcome. The researchers found that the models often reversed their choice when the labels for those two options were changed from “Case 1” and “Case 2” to “(A)” and “(B).”

They also showed that models changed their answers in response to other tiny formatting tweaks, including swapping the order of the options and ending the question with a colon instead of a question mark.

In short, the appearance of moral behavior in LLMs should not be taken at face value. Models must be probed to see how robust that moral behavior really is. “For people to trust the answers, you need to know how you got there,” says Haas.

What Haas, Isaac, and their colleagues at Google DeepMind propose is a new line of research to develop more rigorous techniques for evaluating moral competence in LLMs. This would include tests designed to push models to change their responses to moral questions. If a model flipped its moral position, it would show that it hadn’t engaged in robust moral reasoning.

Another type of test would present models with variations of common moral problems to check whether they produce a rote response or one that’s more nuanced and relevant to the actual problem that was posed. For example, asking a model to talk through the moral implications of a complex scenario in which a man donates sperm to his son so that his son can have a child of his own might produce concerns about the social impact of allowing a man to be both biological father and biological grandfather to a child. But it should not produce concerns about incest, even though the scenario has superficial parallels with that taboo.

Haas also says that getting models to provide a trace of the steps they took to produce an answer would give some insight into whether that answer was a fluke or grounded in actual evidence. Techniques such as chain-of-thought monitoring, in which researchers listen in on a kind of internal monologue that some LLMs produce as they work, could help here too.

Another approach researchers could use to determine why a model gave a particular answer is mechanistic interpretability, which can provide small glimpses inside a model as it carries out a task. Neither chain-of-thought monitoring nor mechanistic interpretability provides perfect snapshots of a model’s workings. But the Google DeepMind team believes that combining such techniques with a wide range of rigorous tests will go a long way to figuring out exactly how far to trust LLMs with certain critical or sensitive tasks.

And yet there’s a wider problem too. Models from major companies such as Google DeepMind are used across the world by people with different values and belief systems. The answer to a simple question like “Should I order pork chops?” should differ depending on whether or not the person asking is vegetarian or Jewish, for example.

There’s no solution to this challenge, Haas and Isaac admit. But they think that models may need to be designed either to produce a range of acceptable answers, aiming to please everyone, or to have a kind of switch that turns different moral codes on and off depending on the user.

“It’s a complex world out there,” says Haas. “We will probably need some combination of those things, because even if you’re taking just one population, there’s going to be a range of views represented.”

“It’s a fascinating paper,” says Danica Dillion at Ohio State University, who studies how large language models handle different belief systems and was not involved in the work. “Pluralism in AI is really important, and it’s one of the biggest limitations of LLMs and moral reasoning right now,” she says. “Even though they were trained on a ginormous amount of data, that data still leans heavily Western. When you probe LLMs, they do a lot better at representing Westerners’ morality than non-Westerners’.”

But it is not yet clear how we can build models that are guaranteed to have moral competence across global cultures, says Demberg. “There are these two independent questions. One is: How should it work? And, secondly, how can it technically be achieved? And I think that both of those questions are pretty open at the moment.”

For Isaac, that makes morality a new frontier for LLMs. “I think this is equally as fascinating as math and code in terms of what it means for AI progress,” he says. “You know, advancing moral competency could also mean that we’re going to see better AI systems overall that actually align with society.”

Welcome to the dark side of crypto’s permissionless dream

Jean-Paul Thorbjornsen, an Australian man in his mid-30s, with a rural Catholic upbringing, is a founder of THORChain, a blockchain through which users can swap one cryptocurrency for another and earn fees from making those swaps.THORChain is permissionless, so anyone can use it without getting prior approval from a centralized authority. As a decentralized network, the blockchain is built and run by operators located across the globe. During its early days, Thorbjornsen himself hid behind the pseudonym “leena” and used an AI-generated female image as his avatar. But around March 2024, he revealed his true identity as the mind behind the blockchain. More or less.

If there is a central question around THORChain, it is this: Exactly who is responsible for its operations? It matters because in January last year, its users lost more than $200 million worth of their cryptocurrency in US dollars after THORChain transactions and accounts were frozen by a singular admin override, which users believed was not supposed to be possible given the decentralized structure.Thorbjornsen insists THORChain is helping realize bitcoin’s original purpose of enabling anyone to transact freely outside the reach of purportedly corrupt governments. Yet the network’s problems suggest that an alternative financial system might not be much better. Read the full story.

To be human is, fundamentally, to be a forecaster. Occasionally a pretty good one. Trying to see the future, whether through the lens of past experience or the logic of cause and effect, has helped us hunt, avoid being hunted, plant crops, forge social bonds, and in general survive in a world that does not prioritize our survival.

Today, we are awash in a sea of predictions so vast and unrelenting that most of us barely even register them. People’s desire for reliable forecasting is understandable. Still, nobody signed up for an omnipresent, algorithmic oracle mediating every aspect of their life. A trio of new books tries to make sense of our future-­focused world—how we got here, and what this change means. Each has its own prescriptions for navigating this new reality, but they all agree on one thing: Predictions are ultimately about power and control. Read the full story.

Hydrogen trains could revolutionize how Americans get aroundLike a mirage speeding across the dusty desert outside Pueblo, Colorado, the first hydrogen-fuel-cell passenger train in the United States is getting warmed up on its test track. It will soon be shipped to Southern California, where it is slated to carry riders on San Bernardino County’s Arrow commuter rail service before the end of the year.The best way to decarbonize railroads is the subject of growing debate among regulators, industry, and activists. The debate is partly technological, revolving around whether hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, or overhead electric wires offer the best performance for different railroad situations. But it’s also political: a question of the extent to which decarbonization can, or should, usher in a broader transformation of rail transportation.In the insular world of railroading, this hydrogen-powered train is a Rorschach test.

Trying to see the future, whether through the lens of past experience or the logic of cause and effect, has helped us hunt, avoid being hunted, plant crops, forge social bonds, and in general survive in a world that does not prioritize our survival. Indeed, as the tools of divination have changed over the centuries, from tea leaves to data sets, our conviction that the future can be known (and therefore controlled) has only grown stronger.

Today, we are awash in a sea of predictions so vast and unrelenting that most of us barely even register them. As I write this sentence, algorithms on some remote server are busy trying to guess my next word based on those I have already typed. If you’re reading this online, a separate set of algorithms has likely already served you an ad deemed to be one you are most likely to click. (To the die-hards reading this story on paper, congratulations! You have escaped the algorithms … for now.)

If the thought of a ubiquitous, mostly invisible predictive layer secretly grafted onto your life by a bunch of profit-hungry corporations makes you uneasy … well, same here.

So how did all this happen? People’s desire for reliable forecasting is understandable. Still, nobody signed up for an omnipresent, algorithmic oracle mediating every aspect of their life. A trio of new books tries to make sense of our future-­focused world—how we got here, and what this change means. Each has its own prescriptions for navigating this new reality, but they all agree on one thing: Predictions are ultimately about power and control.

In The Means of Prediction: How AI Really Works (and Who Benefits), the Oxford economist Maximilian Kasy explains how most predictions in our lives are based on the statistical analysis of patterns in large, labeled data sets—what’s known in AI circles as supervised learning. Once “trained” on such data sets, algorithms for supervised learning can be presented with all kinds of new information and then deliver their best guess as to some specific future outcome. Will you violate your parole, pay off your mortgage, get promoted if hired, perform well on your college exams, be in your home when it gets bombed? More and more, our lives are shaped (and, yes, occasionally shortened) by a machine’s answer to these questions.

If the thought of a ubiquitous, mostly invisible predictive layer secretly grafted onto your life by a bunch of profit-hungry corporations makes you uneasy … well, same here. This arrangement is leading to a crueler, blander, more instrumentalized world, one where life’s possibilities are foreclosed, age-old prejudices are entrenched, and everyone’s brain seems to be actively turning into goo. It’s an outcome, according to Kasy, that was entirely predictable.

AI adherents might frame those consequences as “unintended,” or mere problems of optimization and alignment. Kasy, on the other hand, argues that they represent the system working as intended. “If an algorithm selecting what you see on social media promotes outrage, thereby maximizing engagement and ad clicks,” he writes, “that’s because promoting outrage is good for profits from ad sales.” The same holds true for an algorithm that nixes job candidates “who are likely to have family-care responsibilities outside the workplace,” and the ones that “screen out people who are likely to develop chronic health problems or disabilities.” What’s good for a company’s bottom line may not be good for your job-hunting prospects or life expectancy.

Where Kasy differs from other critics is that he doesn’t think working to create less biased, more equitable algorithms will fix any of this. Trying to rebalance the scales can’t change the fact that predictive algorithms rely on past data that’s often racist, sexist, and flawed in countless other ways. And, he says, the incentives for profit will always trump attempts to eliminate harm. The only way to counter this is with broad democratic control over what Kasy calls “the means of prediction”: data, computational infrastructure, technical expertise, and energy.

A little more than half of The Means of Prediction is devoted to explaining how this might be accomplished—through mechanisms including “data trusts” (collective public bodies that make decisions about how to process and use data on behalf of their contributors) and corporate taxing schemes that try to account for the social harm AI inflicts. There’s a lot of economist talk along the way, about how “agents of change” might help achieve “value alignment” in order to “maximize social welfare.” Reasonable, I guess, though a skeptic might point out that Kasy’s rigorous, systematic approach to building new public-serving institutions comes at a time when public trust in institutions has never been lower. Also, there’s the brain goo problem.

To his credit, Kasy is a realist here. He doesn’t presume that any of these proposals will be easy to implement. Or that it will happen overnight, or even in the near future. The troubling question at the end his book is: Do we have that kind of time?

Reading Kasy’s blueprint for seizing control of the means of prediction raises another pressing question. How on earth did we reach a point where machine-mediated prediction is more or less inescapable? Capitalism, might be Marx’s pithy response. Fine, as far as it goes, but that doesn’t explain why the same kinds of algorithms that currently model climate change are for some reason also deciding whether you get a new kidney or I get a car loan.

If you ask Benjamin Recht, author of The Irrational Decision: How We Gave Computers the Power to Choose for Us, he’d likely tell you our current predicament has a lot to do with the idea and ideology of decision theory—or what economists call rational choice theory. Recht, a polymathic professor in UC Berkeley’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, prefers the term “mathematical rationality” to describe the narrow, statistical conception that stoked the desire to build computers, informed how they would eventually work, and influenced the kinds of problems they would be good at solving.

This belief system goes all the way back to the Enlightenment, but in Recht’s telling, it truly took hold at the tail end of World War II. Nothing focuses the mind on risk and quick decision-making like war, and the mathematical models that proved especially useful in the fight against the Axis powers convinced a select group of scientists and statisticians that they might also be a logical basis for designing the first computers. Thus was born the idea of a computer as an ideal rational agent, a machine capable of making optimal decisions by quantifying uncertainty and maximizing utility.

Intuition, experience, and judgment gave way, says Recht, to optimization, game theory, and statistical prediction. “The core algorithms developed in this period drive the automated decisions of our modern world, whether it be in managing supply chains, scheduling flight times, or placing advertisements on your social media feeds,” he writes. In this optimization-­driven reality, “every life decision is posed as if it were a round at an imaginary casino, and every argument can be reduced to costs and benefits, means and ends.”

Today, mathematical rationality (wearing its human skin) is best represented by the likes of the pollster Nate Silver, the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, and an assortment of Silicon Valley oligarchs, says Recht. These are people who fundamentally believe the world would be a better place if more of us adopted their analytic mindset and learned to weigh costs and benefits, estimate risks, and plan optimally. In other words, these are people who believe we should all make decisions like computers.

How might we demonstrate that (unquantifiable) human intuition, morality, and judgment are better ways of addressing some of the world’s most important and vexing problems?

It’s a ridiculous idea for multiple reasons, he says. To name just one, it’s not as if humans couldn’t make evidence-based decisions before automation. “Advances in clean water, antibiotics, and public health brought life expectancy from under 40 in the 1850s to 70 by 1950,” Recht writes. “From the late 1800s to the early 1900s, we had world-changing scientific breakthroughs in physics, including new theories of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and relativity.” We also managed to build cars and airplanes without a formal system of rationality and somehow came up with societal innovations like modern democracy without optimal decision theory.

So how might we convince the Pinkers and Silvers of the world that most decisions we face in life are not in fact grist for the unrelenting mill of mathematical rationality? Moreover, how might we demonstrate that (unquantifiable) human intuition, morality, and judgment might be better ways of addressing some of the world’s most important and vexing problems?

One might start by reminding the rationalists that any prediction, computational or otherwise, is really just a wish—but one with a powerful tendency to self-fulfill. This idea animates Carissa Véliz’s wonderfully wide-ranging polemic Prophecy: Prediction, Power, and the Fight for the Future, from Ancient Oracles to AI.

A philosopher at the University of Oxford, Véliz sees a prediction as “a magnet that bends reality toward itself.” She writes, “When the force of the magnet is strong enough, the prediction becomes the cause of its becoming true.”

Take Gordon Moore. While he doesn’t come up in Prophecy, he does figure somewhat prominently in Recht’s history of mathematical rationality. A cofounder of the tech giant Intel, Moore is famous for his 1965 prediction that the density of transistors in integrated circuits would double every two years. “Moore’s Law” turned out to be true, and remains true today, although it does seem to be running out of steam thanks to the physical size limits of the silicon atom.

One story you can tell yourself about Moore’s Law is that Gordon was just a prescient guy. His now-classic 1965 opinion piece “Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits,” for Electronics magazine, simply extrapolated what computing trends might mean for the future of the semiconductor industry.

Another story—the one I’m guessing Véliz might tell—is that Moore put an informed prediction out into the world, and an entire industry had a collective interest in making it come true. As Recht makes clear, there were and remain obvious financial incentives for companies to make faster and smaller computer chips. And while the industry has likely spent billions of dollars trying to keep Moore’s Law alive, it’s undoubtedly profited even more from it. Moore’s Law was a helluva strong magnet.

Predictions don’t just have a habit of making themselves come true, says Véliz. They can also distract us from the challenges of the here and now. When an AI boomer promises that artificial general intelligence will be the last problem humanity needs to solve, it not only shapes how we think about AI’s role in our lives; it also shifts our attention away from the very real and very pressing problems of the present day—problems that in many cases AI is causing.

In this sense, the questions around predictions (Who’s making them? Who has the right to make them?) are also fundamentally about power. It’s no accident, Véliz says, that the societies that rely most heavily on prediction are also the ones that tend toward oppression and authoritarianism. Predictions are “veiled prescriptive assertions—they tell us how to act,” she writes. “They are what philosophers call speech acts. When we believe a prediction and act in accordance with it, it’s akin to obeying an order.”

As much as tech companies would like us to believe otherwise, technology is not destiny. Humans make it and choose how to use it … or not use it. Maybe the most appropriate (and human) thing we can do in the face of all the uninvited daily predictions in our lives is to simply defy them.

Upper-middle-class homes give way to vineyards, and Thorbjornsen points out our landing spot outside a winery. People visiting for lunch walk outside. “They’re going to ask for a shot now,” he says, used to the attention drawn by his luxury helicopter, emblazoned with the tail letters “BTC” for bitcoin (the price tag of $5 million in Australian dollars—$3.5 million in US dollars today—was perhaps reasonable for someone who claims a previous crypto project made more than AU$400 million, although he also says those funds were tied up in the company).

Thorbjornsen is a founder of THORChain, a blockchain through which users can swap one cryptocurrency for another and earn fees from making those swaps. THORChain is permissionless, so anyone can use it without getting prior approval from a centralized authority. As a decentralized network, the blockchain is built and run by operators located across the globe, most of whom use pseudonyms.

During its early days, Thorbjornsen himself hid behind the pseudonym “leena” and used an AI-generated female image as his avatar. But around March 2024, he revealed that he, an Australian man in his mid-30s, with a rural Catholic upbringing, was the mind behind the blockchain. More or less.

If there is a central question around THORChain, it is this: Exactly who is responsible for its operations? Blockchains as decentralized as THORChain are supposed to offer systems that operate outside the centralized leadership of corruptible governments and financial institutions. If a few people have outsize sway over this decentralized network—one of a handful that operate at such a large scale—it’s one more blemish on the legacy of bitcoin’s promise, which has already been tarnished by capitalistic political frenzy.

Who’s responsible for THORChain matters because in January last year, its users lost more than $200 million worth of their cryptocurrency in US dollars after THORChain transactions and accounts were frozen by a singular admin override, which users believed was not supposed to be possible given the decentralized structure. When the freeze was lifted, some users raced to pull their money out. The following month, a team of North Korean hackers known as the Lazarus Group used THORChain to move roughly $1.2 billion of stolen ethereum taken in the infamous hack of the Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit.

Thorbjornsen explains away THORChain’s inability to stop the movement of stolen funds, or prevent a bank run, as a function of its decentralized and permissionless nature. The lack of executive powers means that anyone can use the network for any reason, and arguably there’s no one to hold accountable when even the worst goes down.

But when the worst did go down, nearly everyone in the THORChain community, and those paying attention to it in channels like X, pointed their fingers at Thorbjornsen. A lawsuit filed by the THORChain creditors who lost millions in January 2025 names him. A former FBI analyst and North Korea specialist, reflecting on the potential repercussions for helping move stolen funds, told me he wouldn’t want to be in Thorbjornsen’s shoes.

THORChain was designed to make decisions based on votes by node operators, where two-thirds majority rules.

That’s why I traveled to Australia—to see if I could get a handle on where he sees himself and his role in relation to the network he says he founded.

According to Thorbjornsen, he should not be held responsible for either event. THORChain was designed to make decisions based on votes by node operators—people with the computer power, and crypto stake, to run a cluster of servers that process the network’s transactions. In those votes, a two-thirds majority rules.

Then there’s the permissionless part. Anyone can use THORChain to make swaps, which is why it’s been a popular way for widely sanctioned entities such as the government of North Korea to move stolen money. This principle goes back to the cypherpunk roots of bitcoin, a currency that operates outside of nation-states’ rules. THORChain is designed to avoid geopolitical entanglements; that’s what its users like about it.

But there are distinct financial motivations for moving crypto, stolen or not: Node operators earn fees from the funds running through the network. In theory, this incentivizes them to act in the network’s best interests—and, arguably, Thorbjornsen’s interests too, as many assume his wealth is tied to the network’s profits. (Thorbjornsen says it is not, and that it comes instead from “many sources,” including “buying bitcoin back in 2013.”)

Now recent events have raised critical questions, not just about Thorbjornsen’s outsize role in THORChain’s operations, but also about the blockchain’s underlying nature.

If THORChain is decentralized, how was a single operator able to freeze its funds a month before the Bybit hack? Could someone have unilaterally decided to stop the stolen Bybit funds from coming through the network, and chosen not to?

Thorbjornsen insists THORChain is helping realize bitcoin’s original purpose of enabling anyone to transact freely outside the reach of purportedly corrupt governments. Yet the network’s problems suggest that an alternative financial system might not be much better.

On February 21, 2025, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou got an alarming call from the company’s chief financial officer. About $1.5 billion US of the exchange’s ethereum token, ETH, had been stolen.

The FBI attributed the theft to the Lazarus Group. Typically, criminals will want to convert ETH to bitcoin, which is much easier to convert in turn to cash. Knowing this, the FBI issued a public service announcement on February 26 to “exchanges, bridges … and other virtual asset service providers,” encouraging them to block transactions from accounts related to the hack.

Someone posted that announcement in THORChain’s private, invite-only developer channel on Discord, a chat app used widely by software engineers and gamers. While other crypto exchanges and bridges (which facilitate transactions across different blockchains) heeded the warning, THORChain’s node operators, developers, and invested insiders debated about whether or not to close the trading gates, a decision requiring a majority vote.

“Civil war is a very strong term, but there was a strong rift in the community,” says Boone Wheeler, a US-based crypto enthusiast. In 2021, Wheeler purchased some rune, THORChain’s Norse-mythology-themed native token, and he has been paid to write articles about the network to help advertise it. The rift formed “between people who wanted to stay permissionless,” he says, “and others who wanted to blacklist the funds.”

Wheeler, who says he doesn’t run a node or code for THORChain, fell on the side of remaining permissionless. However, others spoke up for blocking the transfers. THORChain, they argued, wasn’t decentralized enough to keep those running the network safe from law enforcement—especially when those operators were identifiable by their IP addresses, some based in the US.

“We are not the morality police,” someone with the username @Swing_Pop wrote on February 27 in the developer Discord.

THORChain’s design includes up to 120 nodes whose operators manage transactions on the network through a voting process. Anyone with hosting hardware can become an operator by funding nodes with rune as collateral, which provides the network with liquidity. Nodes can respond to a transaction by validating it or doing nothing. While individual transactions can’t be blocked, trading can be halted by a two-thirds majority vote.

Nodes are also penalized for not participating in voting, which the system labels as “bad behavior.” Every 2.5 days, THORChain automatically “churns” nodes out to ensure that no one node gains too much control. The nodes that chose not to validate transactions from the Bybit hack were automatically “churned” out of the system. Thorbjornsen says about 20 or 30 nodes were booted from the network in this way. (Node operators can run multiple nodes, and 120 are rarely running simultaneously; at the time of writing, 55 unique IDs operated 103 nodes.)

By February 27, some node operators were prepared to leave the network altogether. “It’s personally getting beyond my risk tolerance,” wrote @Runetard in the dev Discord. “Sorry to those of the community that feel otherwise. There are a bunch of us holding all the risk and some are getting ready to walk away.”

Even so, the financial incentive for the network operators who remained was significant. As one member of the dev Discord put it earlier that day, $3 million had been “extracted as commission” from the theft by those operating THORChain. “This is wrong!” they wrote.

Thorbjornsen weighed in on this back-and-forth, during which nodes paused and unpaused the network. He now says there was a right and wrong way for node operators to have behaved. “The correct way of doing things,” he says, was for node operators who opposed processing stolen funds to “go offline and … get [themselves] kicked out” rather than try to police who could use THORChain. He also says that while operators could discuss stopping transactions, “there was simply no design in the code that allowed [them] to do that.” However, a since-deleted post from his personal X account on March 3, 2025, stated: “I pushed for all my nodes to unhalt trading [keep trading]. Threatened to yank bond if they didn’t comply. Every single one.” (Thorbjornsen says his social media team ran this account in 2025.)

In an Australian 7 News Spotlight documentary last June, Thorbjornsen estimated that THORChain earned between $5 million and $10 million from the heist.

When asked in that same documentary if he received any of those fees, he replied, “Not directly.” When we spoke, I asked him to elaborate. He said he’s “not a recipient” of any funds THORChain sets aside for developers or marketers, nor does he operate any nodes. He was merely speaking generally, he told me: “All crypto holders profit indirectly off economic activity on any chain.”

Most important to Thorbjornsen was that, despite “huge pressure to shut the protocol down and stop servicing these swaps,” THORChain chugged along. He also notes that the hackers’ tactics, moving fast and splitting funds across multiple addresses, made it difficult to identify “bad swaps.”

Blockchain experts like Nick Carlsen, a former FBI analyst at the blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs, don’t buy this assessment. Other services similar to THORChain were identifying and rejecting these transactions. Had THORChain done the same, Carlsen adds, the stolen funds could have been contained on the Ethereum network, which “would have basically denied North Korea the ability to kick off this laundering process.”

And while THORChain touts its decentralization, in “practical applications” like the Lazarus Group’s theft, “most de-fi [decentralized finance] protocols are centralized,” says Daren Firestone, an attorney who represents crypto industry whistleblowers, citing a 2023 US Treasury Department risk assessment on illicit finance.

With centralization comes culpability, and in these cases, Firestone adds, that comes down to “who profits from [the protocol], so who creates it? But most importantly, who controls it?” Is there someone who can “hit an emergency off switch? … Direct nodes?”

Many answer these questions with Thorbjornsen’s name. “Everyone likes to pass the blame,” he says, even though he wasn’t alone in building THORChain. “​​In the end, it all comes back to me anyway.”

According to Thorbjornsen, his story goes like this.

The third of 10 homeschooled children in a “traditional” Catholic household in rural Australia, he spent his days learning math, reading, writing, and studying the Bible. As he got older, he was also responsible for instructing his younger siblings. Wednesday was his day to move the solar panels that powered their home. His parents “installed” a mango and citrus orchard, more to keep nine boys busy than to reap the produce, he says.

“We lived close to a local airfield,” Thorbjornsen says, “and I was always mesmerized by these planes.” He joined the Australian air force and studied engineering, but he says the military left him feeling like “a square peg in a round hole.” He adds that doing things his own way got him frequently “pulled aside” by superiors.

“That’s when I started looking elsewhere,” he says, and in 2013, he found bitcoin. It appealed because it existed “outside the system.”

During the 2017 crypto bull run, Thorbjornsen raised AU$12 million in an initial coin offering for CanYa, a decentralized marketplace he cofounded. CanYa ultimately “died” in 2018, and Thorbjornsen pivoted to a “decentralized liquidity” project that would become THORChain.

He worked with a couple of different developer teams, and then, in 2019, he clicked with an American developer, Chad Barraford, at a hackathon in Germany. Barraford (who declined to be interviewed for this story) was an early public face of THORChain.

Around this time, Thorbjornsen says, “a couple of us helped manage the payroll and early investment funds.” In a 2020 interview, Kai Ansaari, identified as a THORChain “project lead,” wrote, “We’re all contributors … There’s no real ‘lead,’ ‘CEO,’ ‘founder,’ etc.”

In interviews conducted since he came out from behind the “leena” account in 2024, Thorbjornsen has positioned himself as a key lead. He now says his plan had always been to hand over the account, along with command powers and control of THORChain social media accounts, once the blockchain had matured enough to realize its promise of decentralization.

In 2021, he says, he started this process, first by ceasing to use his own rune to back node operators who didn’t have enough to supply their own funding (this can be a way to influence node votes without operating a node yourself). That year, the protocol suffered multiple hacks that resulted in millions of dollars in losses. Nine Realms, a US-incorporated coding company, was brought on to take over THORChain’s development. Thorbjornsen says he passed “leena” over to “other community members” and “left crypto” in 2021, selling “a bunch of bitcoin” and buying the helicopter.

Despite this crypto departure, he came back onto the scene with gusto in 2024 when he revealed himself as the operator of the “leena” account. “​​For many years, I stayed private because I didn’t want the attention,” he says now.

By early 2024 Thorbjornsen considered the network to be sufficiently decentralized and began advertising it publicly. He started regularly posting videos on his TikTok and YouTube channels (“Two sick videos every week,” in the words of one caption) that showed him piloting his helicopter wearing shirts that read “Thor.”

By November 2024, Thorbjornsen, who describes himself as “a bit flamboyant,” was calling himself THORChain’s CEO (“chief energy officer”) and the “master of the memes” in a video from Binance Blockchain Week, an industry conference in Dubai. You need “strong memetic energy,” he says in the video, “to create the community, to create the cult.” Cults imply centralized leadership, and since outing himself as “leena,” Thorbjornsen has publicly appeared to helm the project, with one interviewer deeming him the “THORChain Satoshi” (an allusion to the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin).

One consequence of going public as a face of the protocol: He’s received death threats. “I stirred it up. Do I regret it? Who knows?” he said when we met in Australia. “It’s caused a lot of chaos.”

But, he added, “this is the bed that I’ve laid.” When we spoke again, months later, he backtracked, saying he “got sucked into” defending THORChain in 2024 and 2025 because he was involved from 2018 to 2021 and has “a perspective on how the protocol operates.”

Ryan Treat, a retired US Army veteran, woke up one morning in January 2025 to some disturbing activity on X. “My heart sank,” he says. THORFi, the THORChain program he’d used to earn interest on the bitcoin he’d planned to save for his retirement, had frozen all accounts—but that didn’t make sense.

THORFi featured a lending and saving program said to give users “complete control” and self-custody of their crypto, meaning they could withdraw it at any time.

Treat was no crypto amateur. He bought his first bitcoin at around “$5 apiece,” he says, and had always kept it off centralized exchanges that would maintain custody of his wallets. He liked THORChain because it claimed to be decentralized and permissionless. “I got into bitcoin because I wanted to have government-less money,” he says.

We were told it was decentralized. Then you wake up one morning and read this guy had an admin mimir.

Many who’d used THORFi lending and saving programs felt similarly. Users I interviewed differentiated THORChain from centralized lending platforms like BlockFi and Celsius, both of which offered extraordinarily high yields before filing for bankruptcy in 2022. “I viewed THORChain as a decentralized system where it was safer,” says Halsey Richartz, a Florida-based THORFi creditor, with “vanilla, 1% passive yield.” Indeed, users I spoke with hadn’t felt the need to monitor their THORFi deposits. “Only your key can be used to withdraw your funds,” the product’s marketing materials insisted. “Savers can withdraw their position to native assets at any time.”

So on January 9, when the “leena” account announced that an admin key had been used to pause withdrawals, it took THORFi users by surprise—and seemed to contradict the marketing messaging around decentralization. “We were told that it was decentralized, and you wake up one morning and read an article that says ‘This guy, JP, had an admin mimir,’” says Treat, referring to Thorbjornsen, “and I’m like, ‘What the fuck is an admin mimir?’”

The admin mimir was one of “a bunch of hard-coded admin keys built into the base code of the system,” says Jonathan Reiter, CEO of the blockchain intelligence company ChainArgos. Those with access to the keys had the ability to make executive decisions on the blockchain—a function many THORChain users didn’t realize could supersede the more democratic decisions made by node votes. These keys had been in THORChain’s code for years and “let you control just about anything,” Reiter adds, including the decision to pause the network during the hacks in 2021 that resulted in a loss of more than $16 million in assets.

Thorbjornsen says that one key was given to Nine Realms, while another was “shared around the original team.” He told me at least three people had them, adding, “I can neither confirm nor deny having access to that mimir key, because there’s no on-chain registry of the keys.”

Regardless of who had access, Thorbjornsen maintains that the admin mimir mechanism was “widely known within the community, and heavily used throughout THORChain’s history” and that any action taken using the keys “could be largely overruled by the nodes.” Indeed, nodes voted to open withdrawals back up shortly after the admin key was used to pause them. By then, those burned by THORFi argue, the damage had already been done. The executive pause to withdrawals, for some, signaled that something was amiss with THORFi. This led to a bank run after the pause was lifted, until the nodes voted to freeze withdrawals permanently (which Thorbjornsen had suggested in a since-deleted post on X), separating users from crypto worth around $200 million in US dollars on January 23. THORFi users were then offered a token called TCY (THORChain Yield), which they could claim with the idea that, when its price rose to $1, they would be made whole. (The price, as of writing, sits at $0.16.)

Who used the key? Thorbjornsen maintains he didn’t do it, but he claims he knows who did and won’t say. He says he’d handed over the “leena” account and doesn’t “have access to any of the core components of the system,” nor has he for “at least three years.” He implies that whoever controlled “leena” at the time used the admin key to pause network withdrawals.

A video released by Nine Realms on February 20, 2025, names Thorbjornsen as the activator of the key, stating, “JP ended up pausing lenders and savers, preventing withdrawals so that we can work out … [a] payback plan on them.” Thorbjornsen told me the video was “not factual.”

Multiple blockchain analysts told me it would be extremely difficult to determine who used the admin mimir key. A month after it was used to pause the network, THORChain said the key had been “removed from the network.” At least you can’t find the words “admin mimir” in THORChain’s base code; I’ve looked.

After the debacle of the THORFi withdrawal freeze, Richartz says, he tried to file reports with the Miami-Dade Police Department, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and Interpol. When we spoke in November, he still hadn’t been able to file with the city of Miami. They told him to try small claims court.

“I was like, no, you don’t understand … a post office box in Switzerland is the company address,” he says. “It underscored to me how little law enforcement even knows about these crimes.”

As for the Bybit hack, at least one government has retaliated against those who facilitate blockchain projects. Last April German authorities shut down eXch, an exchange suspected of using THORChain to process funds Lazarus stole from Bybit, says Julia Gottesman, cofounder and head of investigations at the cybersecurity group zeroShadow. Australia, she adds, where Thorbjornsen was based, has been “slow to try to engage with the crypto community, or any regulations.”

In response to requests for comment, Australia’s Department of Home Affairs wrote that at the end of March 2026, the country’s regulatory powers will expand to include “exchanges between the same type of cryptocurrency and transfers between different types.” They did not comment on specific investigations.

Crypto and finance experts disagree about whether THORChain engaged in money laundering, defined by the UN as “the processing of criminal proceeds to disguise their illegal origin.” But some think it fits the definition.

Shlomit Wagman, a Harvard fellow and former head of Israel’s anti-money-laundering agency and its delegation to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), thinks the Bybit activity was money laundering because THORChain helped the hackers “transfer the funds in an unsupervised manner, completely outside of the scope of regulated or supervised activity.”

And by helping with conversions, Carlsen says, THORChain enabled bad actors to turn stolen crypto into usable currency. “People like [Thorbjornsen] have a personal degree of culpability in sustaining the North Korean government,” he says. Thorbjornsen counters that THORChain is “open-source infrastructure.”

Meanwhile, just days after the hack, Bybit issued a 10% bounty on any funds recovered. As of mid-January this year, between $100 million and $500 million worth of those funds in US dollars remain unaccounted for, according to Gottesman of zeroShadow, which was hired by Bybit to recover funds following the hack.

For Thorbjornsen, it’s just another day at the casino. That’s the comparison he made during his regrettable 7 News Spotlight interview about the Bybit heist, and he repeated it when we met. “You go to a casino, you play a few games, you expect to lose,” he told me. “When you do actually go to zero, don’t cry.”

Thorbjornsen, it should be noted, has lost at the casino himself.

In September, he says, he got a Telegram message from a friend, inviting him to a Zoom meeting. He accepted and participated in a call with people who had “American voices.”

Ultimately, Thorbjornsen describes himself as a guy who’s had a bad year, fending off “threat vectors” left and right.

After the meeting, Thorbjornsen learned that his friend’s Telegram had been hacked. Whoever was responsible had used the Zoom link to remotely install software on Thorbjornsen’s computer, which “got access to everything”—his email, his crypto wallets, a bitcoin-based retirement fund. It cost him at least $1.2 million. The blockchain sleuth known as ZachXBT traced the funds and attributed the hack to North Korea.

Ultimately, Thorbjornsen describes himself as a guy who’s had a bad year. He says he had to liquidate his crypto assets because he’s dealing with the fallout of a recent divorce. He also feels he is fending off “threat vectors” left and right. More than once, he asked if I was a private investigator masquerading as a journalist.

Still, his many contradictions don’t inspire confidence. He doesn’t have any more crypto assets, he says. However, the crypto wallet he shared with me so I could pay him back for lunch showed that it contained assets worth more than $143,000 in US dollars. He now says it wasn’t his wallet. He says he doesn’t control THORChain’s social media, but he’d also told me that he runs the @THORChain X account (later backtracking and saying the account is “delegated” to him for trickier questions).

He insists that he does not care about money. He says that in the robot future, the AI-powered hive mind will become our benevolent overlord, rendering money obsolete, so why give it much thought? Yet as we flew back from the vineyard, he pointed out his new house from the helicopter. It resembles a compound. He says he lives there with his new wife.

Multiple people I spoke with about Thorbjornsen before I met him warned me he wasn’t trustworthy, and he’s undeniably made fishy statements. For instance, the presence of a North Korean flag in a row of decals on the tail of his helicopter suggested an affinity with the country for which THORChain has processed so much crypto. Thorbjornsen insists he had requested the flag of Australia’s Norfolk Island, calling the mix-up “a complete coincidence.” The flags were gone by the time of our flight, apparently removed during a recent repair.

“Money is a meme,” he says. “Money does not exist.” Meme or not, it’s had real repercussions for those who have interacted with THORChain, and those who wound up losing have been looking for someone to blame.

When I spoke with Thorbjornsen again in January, he appeared increasingly concerned that he is that someone. He’s spending more time in Singapore, he told me. Singapore happens to have historically denied extraditions to the US for money-laundering prosecutions.

The curious case of the disappearing Lamborghinis

Across the world, unsuspecting people are unwittingly becoming caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft.Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination before using a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.The nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere

Antimicrobial resistance is a major problem. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050.

Bioengineer and computational biologist César de la Fuente has a plan. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments—and his quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. Read the full story.

In 2023, about 47,000 heat-related deaths are believed to have occurred in Europe. Researchers estimate that climate change could add an extra 2.3 million European heat deaths this century. That’s heightened the stakes for solving the mystery of just what happens to bodies in extreme conditions.While we broadly know how people thermoregulate, the science of keeping warm or cool is mottled with blind spots. Researchers around the world are revising rules about when extremes veer from uncomfortable to deadly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Sam Zahr first saw the gray Rolls-Royce Dawn convertible with orange interior and orange roof, he knew he’d found a perfect addition to his fleet. “It was very appealing to our clientele,” he told me. As the director of operations at Dream Luxury Rental, he outfits customers in the Detroit area looking to ride in style to a wedding, a graduation, or any other event with high-end vehicles—Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis, Bentleys, Mercedes G-Wagons, and more.

But before he could rent out the Rolls, Zahr needed to get the car to Detroit from Miami, where he bought it from a used-car dealer.

His team posted the convertible on Central Dispatch, an online marketplace that’s popular among car dealers, manufacturers, and owners who want to arrange vehicle shipments. It’s not too complicated, at least in theory: A typical listing includes the type of vehicle, zip codes of the origin and destination, dates for pickup and delivery, and the fee. Anyone with a Central Dispatch account can see the job, and an individual carrier or transport broker who wants it can call the number on the listing.

Zahr’s team got a call from a transport company that wanted the job. They agreed on the price and scheduled pickup for January 17, 2025. Zahr watched from a few feet away as the car was loaded into an enclosed trailer. He expected the vehicle to arrive in Detroit just a few days later—by January 21.

Zahr called a contact at the transport company to ask what happened.

“He’s like, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Zahr told me his contact angrily told him they mostly ship Coca-Cola products, not luxury cars. “He was yelling and screaming about it,” Zahr said.

Over the years, people have broken into his business to steal cars, or they’ve rented them out and never come back. But until this day, he’d never had a car simply disappear during shipping. He’d expected no trouble this time around, especially since he’d used Central Dispatch—“a legit platform that everyone uses to transport cars,” he said.

“That’s the scary part about it, you know?”

Zahr had unwittingly been caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft. Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination and then use a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school chop shop techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration.

These vehicles can be retitled and resold in the US or loaded into a shipping container and sent to an overseas buyer. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless,” says Steven Yariv, the CEO of Dealers Choice Auto Transport of West Palm Beach, Florida, one of the country’s largest luxury-vehicle transport brokers.

Individual cases have received media coverage thanks to the high value of the stolen cars and the fact that some belong to professional athletes and other celebrities. In late 2024, a Lamborghini Huracán belonging to Colorado Rockies third baseman Kris Bryant went missing en route to his home in Las Vegas; R&B singer Ray J told TMZ the same year that two Mercedes Maybachs never arrived in New York as planned; and last fall, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal had a $180,000 custom Range Rover stolen when the transport company hired to move the vehicle was hacked. “They’re saying they think it’s probably in Dubai by now, to be honest,” an employee of the company that customized the SUV told Shaq in a YouTube video.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless.”

But the nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

It’s challenging to quantify the scale of this type of crime, since there isn’t a single entity or association that tracks it. Still, these law enforcement officials and brokers, as well as the country’s biggest online car-transport marketplaces, acknowledge that fraud and theft are on the rise.

When I spoke with him in August, Yariv estimated that around 8,000 exotic and high-end cars had been stolen since the spring of 2024, resulting in over $1 billion in losses. “You’re talking 30 cars a day [on] average is gone,” he said.

Multiple state and local law enforcement officials told MIT Technology Review that the number is plausible. (The FBI did not respond to a request for an interview.)

“It doesn’t surprise me,” said J.D. Decker, chief of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles’ police division and chair of the fraud subcommittee for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. “It’s a huge business.”

Data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), a nonprofit that works with law enforcement and the insurance industry to investigate insurance fraud and related crimes, provides further evidence of this crime wave. NICB tracks both car theft and cargo theft, a broad category that refers to goods, money, or baggage that is stolen while part of a commercial shipment; the category also covers cases in which a vehicle is stolen via a diverted transport truck or a purloined car is loaded into a shipping container. NICB’s statistics about car theft show that it has declined following an increase during the pandemic—but over the same period cargo theft has dramatically increased, to an estimated $35 billion annually. The group projected in June that it was expected to rise 22% in 2025.

NICB doesn’t break out data for vehicles as opposed to other types of stolen cargo. But Bill Woolf, a regional director for the organization, said an antifraud initiative at the Port of Baltimore experienced a 200% increase from 2023 to 2024 in the number of stolen vehicles recovered. He said the jump could be due to the increased effort to identify stolen cars moving through the port, but he noted that earlier the day we spoke, agents had recovered two high-end stolen vehicles bound for overseas.

“One day, one container—a million dollars,” he said.

Many other vehicles are never recovered—perhaps a result of the speed with which they’re shipped off or sold. Travis Payne, an exotic-car dealer in Atlanta, told me that transport thieves often have buyers lined up before they take a car: “When they steal them, they have a plan.”

In 2024, Payne spent months trying to locate a Rolls-Royce he’d purchased after it was stolen via transport fraud. It eventually turned up in the Instagram feed of a Mexican pop star, he says. He never got the car back.

The criminals are “gonna keep doing it,” he says, “because they make a couple phone calls, make a couple email accounts, and they get a $400,000 car for free. I mean, it makes them God, you know?”

The explosion of vehicle transport fraud follows a pattern that has played out across the economy over the past roughly two decades: A business that once ran on phones, faxes, and personal relationships shifted to online marketplaces that increased efficiency and brought down costs—but the reduction in human-to-human interaction introduced security vulnerabilities that allowed organized and often international fraudsters to enter the industry.

In the case of vehicle transport, the marketplaces are online “load boards” where car owners, dealerships, and manufacturers post about vehicles that need to be shipped from one location to another. Central Dispatch claims to be the largest vehicle load board and says on its website that thousands of vehicles are posted on its platform each day. It’s part of Cox Automotive, an industry juggernaut that owns major vehicle auctions, Autotrader, Kelley Blue Book, and other businesses that work with auto dealers, lenders, and buyers.

The system worked pretty well until roughly two years ago, when organized fraud rings began compromising broker and carrier accounts and exploiting loopholes in government licensing to steal loads with surprising ease and alarming frequency.

A theft can start with a phishing email that appears to come from a legitimate load board. The recipient, a broker or carrier, clicks a link in the message, which appears to go to the real site—but logging in sends the victim’s username and password to a criminal. The crook logs in as the victim, changes the account’s email and phone number to reroute all communications, and begins claiming loads of high-end vehicles. Cox Automotive declined an interview request but said in a statement that the “load board system still works well” and that “fraud impacts a very small portion” of listings.

“Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

Criminals also gain access to online marketplaces by exploiting a lax regulatory environment. While a valid US Department of Transportation registration is required to access online marketplaces, it’s not hard for bad actors to register sham transport companies and obtain a USDOT number from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the agency that regulates commercial motor vehicles. In other cases, criminals compromise the FMCSA accounts of legitimate companies and change their phone numbers and email addresses in order to impersonate them and steal loads. (USDOT did not respond to a request for comment.)

As Bek Abdullayev, the founder of Super Dispatch, one of Central Dispatch’s biggest competitors, explained in an episode of the podcast Auto Transport Co-Pilot, “FMCSA [is] authorizing people that are fraudulent companies—people that are not who they say they are.” He added that people can “game the system and … obtain paperwork that makes [them] look like a legitimate company.” For example, vehicle carrier insurance can be obtained quickly—if temporarily—by submitting an online application with fraudulent payment credentials.

The bottom line is that crooks have found myriad ways to present themselves as genuine and permitted vehicle transport brokers and carriers. Once hired to move a vehicle, they often repost the car on a load board using a different fraudulent or compromised account. While this kind of subcontracting, known as “double-­brokering,” is sometimes used by companies to save money, it can also be used by criminals to hire an unwitting accomplice to deliver the stolen car to their desired location. “They’re booking cars and then they’re just reposting them and dispatching them out to different routes,” says Yariv, the West Palm Beach transport broker.

“A lot of this is cartel operated,” says Decker, of the Nevada DMV, who also serves on a vehicle fraud committee for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “There’s so much money in it that it rivals selling drugs.”

Even though this problem is becoming increasingly well known, fraudsters continue to steal, largely with impunity. Brokers, auto industry insiders, and law enforcement told MIT Technology Review that load boards and the USDOT have been too slow to catch and ban bad actors. (In its statement, Cox Automotive said it has been “dedicated to continually enhancing our processes, technology, and education efforts across the industry to fight fraud.”)

Jake MacDonald, who leads Super Dispatch’s fraud monitoring and investigation efforts, put it bluntly on the podcast with Abdullayev: the reason that fraud is “jumping so much” is that “the industry is slowly moving over to a more technologically advanced position, but it’s so slow that fraud is actually [out-]innovating the industry.”

As it turns out, the person Zahr’s team hired on Central Dispatch didn’t really work for the transport company.

After securing the job, the fraudster reposted the orange-and-gray Rolls convertible to a load board. And instead of saying that the car needed to go from Miami to the real destination of Detroit, the new job listed an end point of Hallandale Beach, Florida, just 20 or so miles away. It was a classic case of malicious double-­brokering: the crooks claimed a load and then reposted it in order to find a new, unsuspecting driver to deliver the car into their possession.

On January 17 of last year, the legitimate driver showed up in a Dodge Ram and loaded the Rolls into an enclosed trailer as Zahr watched.

“The guy came in and looked very professional, and we took a video of him loading the car, taking pictures of everything,” Zahr told me. He never thought to double-­check where the driver was headed or which company he worked for.

Not long after a panicked Zahr spoke with his contact at the transport company he thought he was working with, he reported the car as stolen to the Miami police. Detective Ryan Chin was assigned to the case. It fit with a pattern of high-end auto theft that he and his colleagues had recently been tracking.

“Over the past few weeks, detectives have been made aware of a new method on the rise for vehicles being stolen by utilizing Central Dispatch,” Chin wrote in records obtained by MIT Technology Review. “Specific brokers are re-routing the truck drivers upon them picking up vehicles posted for transport and routing them to other locations provided by the broker.”

Chin used Zahr’s photos and video to identify the truck and driver who’d taken the Rolls. By the time police found him, on January 31, the driver had already dropped off Zahr’s Rolls in Hallandale Beach. He’d also picked up and delivered a black Lamborghini Urus and a White Audi R8 for the same client. Each car had been stolen via double-brokering transport fraud, according to court records.

The police department declined to comment or to make Chin available for an interview. But a source with knowledge of the case said the driver was “super cooperative.” (The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, and the driver does not appear to have been identified in court records.)

The driver told police that he had another load to pick up at a dealership in Naples, Florida, later that same day—a second Lamborghini Urus, this one orange. Police later discovered it was supposed to be shipped to California. But the carrier had been hired to bring the car, which retails for about $250,000, to a mall in nearby Aventura. He told police that he suspected it was going to be delivered to the same person who had booked him for the earlier Rolls, Audi, and Lamborghini deliveries, since “the voice sounds consistent with who [the driver] dealt with prior on the phone.” This drop-off was slated for 4 p.m. at the Waterways Shoppes mall in Aventura.

That was when Chin and a fellow detective, Orlando Rodriguez, decided to set up a sting.

The officers and colleagues across three law enforcement agencies quickly positioned themselves in the Waterways parking lot ahead of the scheduled delivery of the Urus. They watched as, pretty much right on schedule that afternoon, the cooperative driver of the Dodge Ram rolled to a stop in the palm-tree-lined lot, which was surrounded by a kosher supermarket, Japanese and Middle Eastern restaurants, and a physiotherapy clinic.

The driver went inside the trailer and emerged in the orange Lamborghini. He parked it and waited near the vehicle.

Roughly 30 minutes later, a green Rolls-Royce Cullinan (price: $400,000 and up) arrived with two men and a teenager inside. They got out, opened the trunk, and sat on the tailgate of the vehicle as one man counted cash.

“They’re doing countersurveillance, looking around,” the source told me later. “It’s a little out of the ordinary, you know. They kept being fixated [on] where the truck was parked.”

The transport driver and the three males who arrived in the Rolls-Royce did not interact. But soon enough, another luxury vehicle, a Bentley Continental GT, which last year retailed for about $250,000 and up, pulled in. The Bentley driver got out, took the cash from one of the men sitting on the back of the Rolls, and walked over to the transport driver. He handed him $700 and took the keys to the Lamborghini.

That’s when more than a dozen officers swooped in.

“They had nowhere to go,” the source told me. “We surrounded them.”

The two men in the Rolls were later identified as Arman Gevorgyan and Hrant Nazarian, and the man in the Bentley as Yuriy Korotovskyy. The three were arrested and charged with dealing in stolen property, grand theft over $100,000, and organized fraud. (The teenager who arrived in the Rolls was Gevorgyan’s son. He was detained and released, according to Richard Cooper, Gevorgyan’s attorney.)

As investigators dug into the case, the evidence suggested that this was part of the criminal pattern they’d been following. “I think it’s organized,” the source told me.

It’s something that transport industry insiders have talked about for a while, according to Fred Mills, the owner of Florida-based Advantage Auto Transport, a company that specializes in transporting high-end vehicles. He said there’s even a slang term to describe people engaged in transport fraud: the flip-flop mafia.

It has multiple meanings. One is that the people who show up to transport or accept a vehicle “are out there wearing, you know, flip-flops and slides,” Mills says.

The second refers to how fraudsters “flip” from one carrier registration to another as they try to stay ahead of regulators and complaints.

In addition to needing a USDOT number, carriers working across states need an interstate operating authority (commonly known as an MC number) from the USDOT. Both IDs are typically printed on the driver and passenger doors. But the rise of ­double-brokering—and of fly-by-night and fraudulent carriers—means that drivers increasingly just tape IDs to their door.

Mills says fraudsters will use a USDOT number for 10 or 11 months, racking up violations, and then tape up a new one. “They just wash, rinse, and repeat,” he says.

Decker from the Nevada DMV says a lot of high-end vehicles are stolen because dealerships and individual customers don’t properly check the paperwork or identity of the person who shows up to transport them.

“‘Flip-flop mafia’ is an apt nickname because it’s surprisingly easy to get a car on a truck and convince somebody that they’re a legitimate transport operation when they’re not,” he says.

Roughly a month after it disappeared, Zahr’s Rolls-Royce was recovered by the Miami Beach Police. Video footage obtained by a local TV station showed the gray car with its distinctive orange top being towed into a police garage.

Among the items confiscated from the men in Florida were $10,796 in cash and a GPS jammer. Law enforcement sources say jammers have become a core piece of technology for modern car thieves—necessary to disable the location tracking provided by GPS navigation systems in most cars. “Once they get the vehicles, they usually park them somewhere [and] put a signal jammer in there or cut out the GPS,” the Florida source told me. This buys them time to swap and reprogram the vehicle identification number (VIN), wipe car computers, and reprogram fobs to remove traces of the car’s provenance.

No two VINs are the same, and each is assigned to a specific vehicle by the manufacturer. Where they’re placed inside a vehicle varies by make and model. The NICB’s Woolf says cars also have confidential VINs located in places—including their electronic components—that are supposed to be known only to law enforcement and his organization. But criminals have figured out how to find and change them.

“It’s making it more and more difficult for us to identify vehicles as stolen,” Woolf says. “Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

All this doesn’t even take very much time. “If you know what you’re doing, and you steal the car at one o’clock today, you can have it completely done at two o’clock today,” says Woolf. A vehicle can be rerouted, reprogrammed, re-VINed, and sometimes even retitled before an owner files a police report.

That appears to have been the plan in the case of the stolen light-gray 2023 Lamborghini Huracán owned by the Rockies’ Kris Bryant.

On September 29, 2024, a carrier hired via a load board arrived at Bryant’s home in Cherry Hills, Colorado, to pick up the car. It was supposed to be transported to Bryant’s Las Vegas residence within a few days. It never showed up there—but it was in fact in Vegas.

Using Flock traffic cameras, which capture license plate information in areas across the country, Detective Justin Smith of the Cherry Hills Village Police Department tracked the truck and trailer that had picked up the Lambo to Nevada, and he alerted local police.

On October 7, a Las Vegas officer spotted a car matching the Lamborghini’s description and pulled it over. The driver said the Huracán had been brought to his auto shop by a man whom the police were able to identify as Dat Viet Tieu. They arrested Tieu later that same day. In an interview with police, he identified himself as a car broker. He said he was going to resell the Lamborghini and that he had no idea that the car was stolen, according to the arrest report.

Police searched a Jeep Wrangler that Tieu had parked nearby and discovered it had been stolen—and had been re-VINed, retitled, and registered to his wife. Inside the car, police discovered “multiple fraudulent VIN stickers, key fobs to other high-end stolen vehicles, and fictitious placards,” their report said.

One of the fake VINs matched the make and model of Bryant’s Lamborghini. (Representatives for Bryant and the Rockies did not respond to a request for comment.)

Tieu was released on bail. But after he returned to LVPD headquarters two days later, on October 9, to reclaim his personal property, officers secretly placed him under surveillance with the hope that he’d lead them to one of the other stolen cars matching the key fobs they’d found in the Jeep.

It didn’t take long for them to get lucky. A few hours after leaving the police station, Tieu drove to Harry Reid International Airport, where he picked up an unidentified man. They drove to the Caesars Palace parking garage and pulled in near a GMC Sierra. Over the next three hours, the man worked on a laptop inside and outside the vehicle, according to a police report. At one point, he and Tieu connected jumper cables from Tieu’s rented Toyota Camry to the Sierra.

“At 2323 hours, the white male adult enters the GMC Sierra, and the vehicle’s ignition starts. It was readily apparent the [two men] had successfully re-programmed a key fob to the GMC Sierra,” the report said.

An officer watched as the man gave two key fobs to Tieu, who handed the man an unknown amount of cash. Still, the police let the men leave the garage.

The police kept Tieu and his wife under surveillance for more than a week. Then, on October 18, fearing the couple was about to leave town, officers entered Nora’s Italian Restaurant just off the Vegas Strip and took them into custody.

“Obviously, we meet again,” a detective told Tieu.

Police later searched the VIN on the Sierra from the Caesars lot and found that it had been reported stolen in Tremonton, Utah, roughly two weeks earlier. They eventually returned both the Sierra and Kris Bryant’s Lamborghini to their owners.

Tieu pleaded guilty to two felony counts of possession of a stolen vehicle and one count of defacing, altering, substituting, or removing a VIN. In October, he was sentenced to up to one year of probation; if it’s completed successfully, the plea agreement says, the counts of possession of a stolen vehicle will be dismissed. His attorneys, David Z. Chesnoff and Richard A. Schonfeld, said in a statement that they were “pleased” with the court’s decision, “in light of [Tieu’s] acceptance of responsibility.”

Many vehicles stolen via transport fraud are never recovered. Experts say the best way to stop this criminal cycle would be to disrupt it before it starts.

That would require significant changes to the way that load boards operate. Bryant’s Lamborghini, Zahr’s and Payne’s Rolls-Royces, and the orange Lamborghini Urus in Florida were all posted for transport on Central Dispatch. Both brokers and shippers argue that the company hasn’t taken enough responsibility for what they characterize as weak oversight.

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company … they have no liability in the whole transaction process. So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

“You’re Cox Automotive—you’re the biggest car company in the world for dealers—and you’re not doing better screenings when you sign people up?” says Payne. (The spokesperson for Cox Automotive said that it has “a robust verification process for all clients … who sign up.”)

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company, or the clients’ insurance, [which means] that they have no liability in the whole transaction process,” says Mills. “So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

Over the last year, Central Dispatch has made changes to further secure its platform. It introduced two-factor authentication for user accounts and started enabling shippers to use its app to track loads in real time, among other measures. It also kicked off an awareness campaign that includes online educational content and media appearances to communicate that the company takes its responsibilities seriously.

“We’ve removed over 500 accounts already in 2025, and we’ll continue to take any of that aggressive action where it’s needed,” said Lainey Sibble, Central Dispatch’s head of business, in a sponsored episode of the Auto Remarketing Podcast. “We also recognize this is not going to happen in a silo. Everyone has a role to play here, and it’s really going to take us all working together in partnership to combat this issue.”

Mills says Central Dispatch got faster at shutting down fraudulent accounts toward the end of last year. But it’s going to take time to fix the industry, he adds: “I compare it to a 15-year opioid addiction. It’s going to take a while to detox the system.”

Yariv, the broker in West Palm Beach, says he has stopped using Central Dispatch and other load boards altogether. “One person has access here, and that’s me. I don’t even log in,” he told me. His team has gone back to working the phones, as evidenced by the din of voices in the background as we spoke.

“[The fraud is] everywhere. It’s constant,” he said. “The only way it goes away is the dispatch boards have to be shut down—and that’ll never happen.”

It also remains to be seen what kind of accountability there will be for the alleged thieves in Florida. Korotovskyy and Nazarian pleaded not guilty; as of press time, their trials were scheduled to begin in May. (Korotovskyy’s lawyer, Bruce Prober, said in a statement that the case “is an ongoing matter” and his client is “presumed innocent,” while Nazarian’s attorney, Yale Sanford, said in a statement, “As the investigation continues, Mr. Nazarian firmly asserts his innocence.” A spokesperson with Florida’s Office of the State Attorney emailed a statement: “The circumstances related to these arrests are still a matter of investigation and prosecution. It would be inappropriate to be commenting further.”)

In contrast, Gevorgyan, the third man arrested in the Florida sting, pleaded guilty to four charges.

Yet he maintains his innocence, according to Cooper, his lawyer: “He was pleading [guilty] to get out and go home.” Cooper describes his client as a wealthy Armenian national who runs a jewelry business back home, adding that he was deported to Armenia in September.

Cooper says his client’s “sweetheart” plea deal doesn’t require him to testify or otherwise supply information against his alleged co-conspirators—or to reveal details about how all these luxury cars were mysteriously disappearing across South Florida. Cooper also says prosecutors may have a difficult time convicting the other two men, arguing that police acted prematurely by arresting the trio without first seeing what, if anything, they intended to do with the Lamborghini.

“All they ever had,” Cooper says, “was three schmucks sitting outside of the Lamborghini.”

            <div id="article-text">If you tuned in to China’s 2026 CCTV Spring Festival Gala looking for traditional lion dances and nostalgic tunes, you may have done a double-take when what greeted you was a squad of humanoid robots performing kung fu, synchronized moves, and comedy sketches with more precision than most of us manage during family reunions.

It was not just spectacle; it was industrial policy with flair

This year’s gala, which is China’s equivalent of the Super Bowl meets cultural heritage broadcast, featured everything from high-speed martial arts sequences to choreographed routines done by humanoid robots from leading local makers like Unitree Robotics, Galbot, MagicLab and Noetix.

Watching them flip, strike poses, and dance isn’t just futuristic entertainment; it’s a deliberate signal about where Chinese tech wants to sit at the global table.

Just last year, robot appearances were charming but clunky: think awkward “dances” that needed human help to keep upright.

Instead, this year, they executed complex actions; backflips, martial arts inspired routines, even comedic timing that was surprisingly sharp for machines. C

lips of the robots went viral almost immediately, flooding social platforms and dominating international tech feeds.

Chinese state media and commentators have leaned into the moment as proof of rapid progress in humanoid robotics, placing it squarely within China’s “AI+manufacturing” industrial ambitions.

While some viewers showered praise on the displays, others grumbled that the new lineup made the gala feel more like CES Lite than a cosy celebration of culture, and yes, robots “stealing the Year of the Horse thunder” is now a real complaint.

The optics are unmistakable. China’s robotics sector, already responsible for a lion’s share of worldwide humanoid robot production, is eager to tell a simple story: we don’t just build hardware in factories, we animate it with AI brainsthat can perform with finesse.

Whether it’s a crowd-pleasing kung fu sequence or a scripted comedy routine, these robots have become ambassadors of technological prowess on very prime cultural real estate.

But let’s not overstate their practical chops just yet. Despite impressive stage routines, robotics experts point out that most current humanoids are still best at pre-programmed movements and lack true autonomous adaptability in unpredictable environments.

In other words, they’re amazing performers on cue, not yet ready to be your personal caregiver or industrial line worker without a lot more training and development.

Still, the spectacle accomplishes something important: it thrusts humanoid robots into the public imagination while signalling to investors, startups and rival nations that robot development is now prime time tech theatre, not just a research lab curiosity.

Whether you see this as a fun blend of culture and innovation or a high-stakes display of national tech strategy, China’s robotics presence at the gala is now part of a broader conversation about where AI embodied in hardware might go next.

It’s less about whether robots will “replace us” and more about how they’re being introduced into narratives that billions of people watch together, shaping perceptions and expectations about the future.

China’s robots danced their way into billions of screens this Lunar New Year, and they did it with style, precision, and a well-timed cultural wink.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Paris-based venture firm that has quietly shaped the quantum technology scenery is now making a much louder statement about Europe’s role in the future of computing, materials science, and sensing.

Quantonation Ventures has today announced the successful close of its second flagship fund at €220 million, more than double the size of its first vehicle and a clear signal that institutional capital is flowing into technologies grounded in physics, not just software.

Quantonation is not your typical venture capital firm. From its inception, it set out to invest in startups building real hardware and disruptive physics-based platforms, including quantum computing, sensing, communications, advanced materials, and what the industry calls “deep physics.”

The new Quantonation II fund attracted big names in institutional capital alongside strategic technology investors. Backers include the European Investment Fund, French public investor Bpifrance, Spanish construction and infrastructure group Grupo ACS, Denmark’s Novo Holdings, Japanese tech giant Toshiba, and Singapore-linked Vertex Holdings among others.

This mix of public and private capital reflects broader confidence in the potential of physics-based technologies to move beyond the research lab and into tangible commercial impact.

Where early quantum investing often centered on proof-of-concept breakthroughs, Quantonation’s strategy now emphasizes industrialization, scale, and products that customers, not just scientists, can use.

Quantonation’s expanded fund will target roughly 25 companies, writing larger checks and backing startups through earlier stages and scaling phases alike.

The portfolio already spans quantum computing hardware, advanced materials, sensing systems, and even components aimed at preparing infrastructure for widespread quantum deployment. Investments so far include:

This spread illustrates both a depth and a breadth of conviction: rather than betting on a single application, the fund’s investors are backing an ecosystem of physics-driven companies that could redefine multiple industries.

Despite this progress, Europe still trails the U.S. and China in private investment scale for quantum technologies, where large funding pools have helped local startups rapidly expand and commercialize.

The quantum revolution often gets discussed in terms of qubits and breakthrough physics. But investors and industry leaders increasingly see the future as one where quantum systems must integrate into real infrastructure, real supply chains, and real commercial stacks.

With €220 million under management, Quantonation is now one of the largest dedicated funds in its niche, a distinction that positions Europe more firmly in the global competition over next-generation computing and sensing.

What was once a cluster of scattered bets on niche technology now looks like a coherent wave of strategic investment. Europe isn’t just funding quantum anymore; it’s building a commercial ecosystem that might one day compete at scale with global rivals.

            <h2>Mistral AI buys cloud startup Koyeb</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When European tech observers talk about AI ambition, the narrative often splits neatly in two: models and infrastructure. On one side are the clever bits of code that can write, reason, and generate text or images.

On the other is the gritty reality of making those bits run reliably, at scale, and in production. Today, Mistral AI made a move that bridges that divide.

The Paris-based AI upstart confirmed its first acquisition by agreeing to buy Koyeb, another French venture focused on serverless cloud infrastructure for AI workloads. The deal, terms were not disclosed, marks a clear signal: Mistral wants to own not just cutting-edge AI models, but also the infrastructure that delivers them to developers and enterprises.

Mistral has built momentum over the past two years with large language models that have put it in close competition with U.S. players. But for all the excitement around models, real-world adoption hinges on how those models are deployed and scaled.

Koyeb’s technology is built for exactly that: a serverless platform that lets developers run AI apps without managing the underlying infrastructure.

Think of it as giving Mistral not only the engine but also the transmission, the parts that take raw computational power and make it usable on demand. That’s a critical piece when companies want to ship AI solutions without hiring a team of DevOps experts.

This acquisition dovetails with a wider strategy playing out in Europe: build an AI stack that doesn’t depend on U.S. hyperscalers.

Mistral recently announced a €1.2 billion investment in data centers in Sweden and has been vocal about offering a homegrown alternative to cloud services from AWS, Microsoft, and Google.

By folding Koyeb’s team and platform into what they call Mistral Compute, the company is laying claim to a more complex AI offering – from model training to deployment and inference. In other words, it’s less about selling APIs and more about owning the full AI experience.

Koyeb’s roots are in serverless computing, scalable, managed infrastructure that lets developers forget about servers and focus on code. Its platform supports AI tasks across CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators, with features like autoscaling and isolated environments for complex applications.

The founders and all 13 team members are joining Mistral’s engineering ranks, where they’ll shift focus toward embedding their technology into the Mistral Compute platform. For existing users of Koyeb’s services, the transition is designed to be smooth, with the platform continuing to operate as usual while integrating deeper over time.

In a market still heavily dominated by U.S. cloud providers, owning more of the AI value chain is both a business move and a geopolitical statement. This deal isn’t just about snapping up a smaller startup; it’s about signalling a shift in how European AI companies conceive of competition and capability.

One of the early questions about the future of AI wasn’t whether Europe could produce models that compete with those from Silicon Valley, it was whether it could build the platforms and systems those models truly depend on. With the Koyeb acquisition, Mistral is making a direct answer to that question.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital has long avoided ‘hard’ sectors such as government, defence, energy, manufacturing, and hardware, viewing them as uninvestable because startups have limited scope to challenge incumbents. Instead, investors have prioritised fast-moving and lightly regulated software markets with lower barriers to entry.

End users in these hard industries have paid the price, as a lack of innovation funding has left them stuck with incumbent providers that continue to deliver clunky, unintuitive solutions that are difficult to migrate from.

However, that perception is now shifting. Investors are responding to new market dynamics within complex industries and the evolving methods startups are using to outperform incumbents.

Government technology spending more than doubled between 2021 and 2025, while defence technology more than doubled in 2025 alone, and we see similar trends in robotics, industrial technology, and healthcare.  This signals a clear change in investor mindset as AI-first approaches are changing adoption cycles.

Historically, those sectors had been viewed as incompatible with venture capital norms: slow procurement cycles, strict regulation, heavy operational and capital requirements, as well as deep integration into physical systems.

For example, on a global level, public procurement can take years, constrained by budgeting cycles, legislation and accountability frameworks. Energy projects must comply with regulatory regimes and national permitting structures, and infrastructure and hardware deployments require extensive certification and long engineering cycles.

Government and public-sector buyers also tend to prioritise reliability, compliance, track record, and legacy relationships over speed, meaning major contracts often go to incumbents rather than startups. Similar dynamics exist in construction, mining, logistics, and manufacturing, all sectors that are still dominated by legacy vendors, complex supply chains, and thin operational margins.

That view is now changing. Capital is increasingly flowing into sectors once seen as too bureaucratic or operationally complex. Beyond those headline sectors, construction tech, industrial automation, logistics software, healthcare, and public-sector tooling are attracting record levels of early-stage and growth capital.

The key question is: what is driving this shift in investor thinking?

The shift in investor priorities is partly driven by macro and geopolitical pressures. Supply-chain disruption, energyinsecurity and infrastructure fragility have elevated industrial resilience to a national priority. Governments are investing heavily in grid modernisation, logistics networks, and critical infrastructure, while public institutions face mounting pressure to digitise procurement, compliance, and workflow systems.

What were once considered slow, bureaucratic markets are now seen as structurally supported by policy and long-term demand.

AI is the driving force and is reshaping traditionally hard industries. By lowering the cost of building sophisticated software and enabling immediate performance gains with shorter adoption cycles, AI allows startups to compete with incumbents in sectors such as construction, mining, manufacturing, logistics, and public services from day one.

As software becomes easier to replicate, defensibility is shifting toward operational depth, substantial UI/UX improvements, speed to market, and more seamless integration into complex real-world systems.

Finally, saturation in horizontal SaaS has pushed investors to look elsewhere for differentiated returns. Crowded softwarecategories offer diminishing breakout potential and are often threatened by OpenAI and Anthropic’s fast pace of innovation, whereas regulated and infrastructure-heavy sectors provide less competition, stronger pricing power, higher switching costs, and gigantic TAMs.

SAP with a $200B cap is just an example, but the same goes for Caterpillar, Siemens, Big Utilities, Big Pharma, and many others.

Regulation, once viewed as a deterrent, is increasingly understood as a moat. Startups that successfully navigate procurement frameworks, compliance regimes, and industry standards build advantages that are difficult for new entrants to replicate and cannot be vibe-coded.

Legacy players, while trying to adopt new AI tooling as quickly as they can, still struggle to adapt their workflows and scale innovation as quickly as younger companies can. Their dominance has relied on the high cost of switching away from their solutions, but as attention and investment shift toward hard sectors, incumbents can no longer rely solely on their brand reputation.

Even industry leaders like Salesforce are relying more on acquisitions to keep up, showing how new technology and easier alternatives are lowering switching costs and making it harder for established companies to hold onto customers.

Startups are also increasingly being built by innovative industry specialists, who aren’t confined by the same limitations as legacy players. Many startup founders in defence, energy, healthcare, and government procurement come directly from these industries or have unique insights into their inner weaknesses.

The next wave of disruption will hit legacy companies hard, as startups prove they can innovate with the speed, flexibilityand focus that incumbents often lack. In sectors long protected by regulation or procurement friction, younger companiesare demonstrating that modern software, AI, and new business models can unlock performance improvements that established players struggle to match. Investor playbooks are already evolving, and that shift will likely accelerate in the year ahead.

At the same time, the total addressable market ceiling has been lifted. By moving beyond narrow software categories and into the physical economy, startups are targeting markets measured not in billions, but in trillions. As a result, we should expect more $100 billion companies to be built in this cycle. It’s no longer just about building better software.

It’s about rebuilding foundational sectors of the global economy.

            <h2>The European Parliament pulls back AI from its own devices</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/the-european-parliament-pulls-back-ai-from-its-own-devices">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Parliament has taken a rare and telling step: it has disabled built-in artificial intelligence features on work devices used by lawmakers and staff, citing unresolved concerns about data security, privacy, and the opaque nature of cloud-based AI processing.

The decision, communicated to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in an internal memo this week, reflects a deepening unease at the heart of European institutions about how AI systems handle sensitive data.

The Parliament’s IT department concluded that it could not guarantee the safety of certain AI-driven functions, notably writing assistants, text summarization tools, virtual assistants, and web page summary features, because they rely on cloud-based processing that sends data off the device.

In a workplace where draft legislation, confidential correspondence, and internal deliberations circulate daily, even momentary exposure of sensitive information is viewed as unacceptable.

For now, the measures apply only to these native, built-in AI features on Parliament-issued tablets and smartphones, not to everyday apps like email or calendars. The institution has declined to specify which operating systems or device manufacturers are affected, citing the “sensitive nature” of cybersecurity matters.

The internal memo did more than announce a software rollback. It advised lawmakers to review AI settings on their personal phones and tablets, warning them against exposing work emails, documents, or internal information to AI tools that “scan or analyze content,” and urging caution with third-party AI applications that seek broad access to data.

This guidance implicitly acknowledges a larger truth: for many elected officials and staff, the boundary between official and personal devices is porous. The Parliament’s approach underscores that risks are not confined to issued hardware but extend into the consumer technology choices of its own members.

The move is the latest in a series of precautionary steps by EU institutions. In 2023 the Parliament banned the use of TikTok on staff devices over similar data concerns, and ongoing debates have questioned the use of foreign-developed productivity software. Some lawmakers have even suggested moving away from Microsoft products in favor of European alternatives, part of a broader push for digital sovereignty.

That push is not abstract. The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act, the world’s first comprehensive regulatory framework on AI, has been in force since 2024 and imposes obligations on AI providers and users alike, categorizing systems by risk and demanding transparency, traceability, and human oversight.

Yet the Parliament’s latest action reveals a paradox: while Europe seeks to regulate and shape AI at scale, it is simultaneously wary of the very tools it aims to master. Stopping short of a full ban on AI use, the institution is essentially saying that in certain contexts, the technology is too unpredictable to trust, especially when critical information could leak outside secure boundaries.

The Parliament’s decision may seem narrowly targeted, but it carries broader implications. It signals that even for progressive regulators who have championed innovation alongside rights protections, the practical limits of AI integration are now a central concern. Cybersecurity teams within government institutions are not merely technologists; they are custodians of trust in an era when data is both an asset and a vulnerability.

For businesses and citizens watching Europe’s regulatory trajectory, this episode is instructive. It suggests that the EU’s approach to AI will not only be legal and ethical but deeply pragmatic. Regulations may promote responsible innovation, but European institutions are prepared to pull back when security and control are at stake.

As AI capabilities continue to evolve and become embedded in devices worldwide, the Parliament’s cautionary step highlights a core tension of the digital age: balancing the potential of AI with its unseen and unquantified risks.

Whether other governments follow suit, or whether this stance influences corporate and product strategy, remains to be seen. In the meantime, the message from Brussels is unmistakable: when it comes to AI and sensitive data, trust but verify is no longer enough.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When FOMO ( fear of missing out) first entered popular language, it was about teenagers scrolling through friends’ social feeds and worrying they weren’t having as much fun. But today, that word has taken on a different meaning in the era of artificial intelligence.

The fear now isn’t about beach photos or party snapshots. It’s about being left behind in a technological revolution that promises dramatic changes in work, creativity, and competition. It’s about the feeling that your own intelligence is not enough anymore, and you can’t compete with the artificial one.

You might call it AI FOMO, the worry, for individuals and companies alike, that others are moving ahead with AI while you stand still. And this feeling is real enough that researchers are trying to understand it scientifically.

They’ve developed tools to measure how much people fear falling behind in AI skills or access. A recent study showing how this fear plays out found that more than one in nine adults report elevated levels of anxiety about not keeping up with AI, especially younger people and women. Importantly, those with better AI literacy reported less fear, suggesting that understanding the technology reduces anxiety.

This isn’t abstract psychological jargon. It is a psychological undercurrent that feels entirely modern: tied to the ubiquity of AI in press, policy, and venture capital. The sense that everyone must adopt intelligent technology or risk irrelevance. But like most anxieties, its influence extends far beyond individual nervousness.

I think we reached the point where AI FOMO is shaping business decisions, corporate strategy, and even public policy.

The ripples from AI FOMO extend far beyond individual stress. They reach into boardrooms and strategic plans where companies, whether big or small, are deciding how hard to pursue AI.

A survey by intelligent automation company ABBYY found that around 60-70 % of technology leaders report fear of missing out as a major reason their organisation is investing in AI. Many worry that if they don’t adopt AI now, competitors will seize an advantage. And together with the leaders’ fear, some decisions are coming that may affect the employees.

I will give credit. That fear can feel logical. After all, AI promises efficiency, insight, and new capabilities, even for thought less capable.

But when fear becomes the main reason for action, it warps strategy. Rather than asking “What problem are we solving with AI?”, decision-makers ask “Can we afford not to use AI?” This change from thoughtful problem-solving to panic-driven adoption creates an illusion of purpose where there may be none.

And the results can be underwhelming. Recent business surveys show that many companies are still struggling to see real returns from their AI investments. Some executives report that less than half of their AI projects deliver measurable impact, or struggle to even quantify it. That’s a sign that widespread adoption does not automatically translate into value, especially when the impetus to buy in comes from anxiety rather than strategy.

AI FOMO isn’t just a corporate phenomenon. It affects workers too. Research focused on attitudes in the workplace shows that employees who believe AI will reduce their autonomy or make their skills obsolete tend to experience fear of missing out on AI adoption alongside heightened job anxiety. This connects with broader concerns about technology and wellbeing at work: many people worry that AI might replace tasks or change job expectations without clarity.

That fear can influence behaviour, too. Anecdotal reports, such as research showing a significant share of workers using AI tools secretly to keep up with perceived expectations, reflect this sense of needing to keep pace, even in silence. It’s not just about skills; it’s about identity, worth, and belonging in a professional world that is moving so fast.

The result is a kind of feedback loop. Investment without strategy, momentum without direction. In the pursuit of not falling behind, many risk falling into the very inefficiency they hoped to avoid.

To navigate this moment with equanimity requires resisting the gravitational pull of fear. This is not a rejection of AI’s transformative potential. A large majority of business leaders still view AI as an opportunity, even as concerns about risk and readiness grow.

But recognising AI FOMO as a real force, not just a catchphrase, allows companies, governments, and individuals to ask better questions:

The answer, ultimately, is not to replace fear with oblivious optimism, but to replace reflexive action with intentional adoption.

In the end, AI FOMO tells us something deeper about ourselves than any quarterly earnings report or headline about the next breakthrough. It reveals how closely we have tied our hopes, and our anxieties, to a technology that is, for many of us, still only partly understood.

We see AI everywhere: pitched as productivity’s savior one moment, feared as a job-eating force the next. Across workplaces and dinner-table conversations alike, even on dating apps, the underlying emotion often isn’t excitement or dread alone, but something that feels curiously familiar and deeply human: the fear of falling behind, of being outpaced by peers, competitors, or even young strangers we’ve never met.

This feeling is more than a distraction or a fancy word. It is linked to genuine stress, anxiety, and reduced well-being for some, and it shapes behaviour in subtle but far-reaching ways. People tweak their resumes, accept rushed technology rollouts, or hunch over training modules long into the night; not because they are certain of the value, but because they fear the alternative.

This moment, then, feels like more than a fad. It is a crossroads between reaction and reflection. We can choose to let fear drive our choices, or we can treat that fear as a signal to slow down, learn, and make room for real understanding.

If I’ve learned anything in the years since AI leapt into the popular imagination, it’s this: technology changes fastest when we pair curiosity with clarity, and adapts most successfully when we meet it with empathy rather than anxiety.

So as the next wave of models arrives, as companies wordsmith their AI strategies, and as employees juggle training modules alongside tools and dashboards, here’s one gentle reminder worth holding onto: technology doesn’t define us. Our reactions to it do. We are the ones who imagine, experiment, hesitate, question, and decide.
