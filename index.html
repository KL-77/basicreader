            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/epa-makes-it-harder-for-states-tribes-to-block-pipelines/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration on Tuesday proposed a new rule aimed at speeding up and streamlining the permitting process for large energy and infrastructure projects, including oil and gas pipelines and facilities tied to artificial intelligence.

The rule, which does not require action by Congress, includes a suite of procedural changes to section 401 of the Clean Water Act—a law enacted in the 1970s that is the primary federal statute governing water pollution in the United States.

For decades, section 401 has granted states and tribes the authority to approve, impose conditions on, or reject, federal permits for projects that they determine will pollute or damage local waterways.

Now, the Trump administration aims to scale back that authority in order to expedite projects and “unleash energy dominance,” said Jess Kramer, EPA assistant administrator for water, in a press briefing. “This proposed rule is the next step in ensuring that states and tribes only utilize section 401 for its statutory purpose to protect water quality and not as a weapon to shut down projects.”

To date, Kramer said, section 401 has allowed major energy projects to stall unnecessarily, calling the current system “fundamentally flawed.” Implementation problems, she said, have led to lengthy certification timelines that are “bad for business.”

The new rule lays out a series of procedural changes that agency officials say are designed to make the permitting process more predictable and efficient. It would create a standardized list of items companies must submit before a state or tribe can begin reviewing a project. “When finalized, the proposed rule will increase transparency, efficiency and predictability for certifying authorities and the regulated community,” Kramer said. It would also prohibit regulators from asking applicants to withdraw and resubmit requests in order to extend deadlines and would reinforce a firm one-year limit for making decisions.

But in addition to making the process more streamlined, it is also restricting states and tribes, said Jon Devine, director of freshwater ecosystems at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“This is an effort to curtail the role of state and tribal water pollution control officials in looking at the impacts of federally permitted projects,” Devine said.

Under the proposal, states and authorized tribes would be limited to reviewing only the direct water-quality impacts of a project’s discharges into federally protected waters and would no longer be able to consider broader water-quality effects caused by the project as a whole, said Nancy Stoner, a senior attorney at the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a Chicago-based nonprofit that defends environmental and public health in the Midwest.

That shift could weaken oversight of projects such as dams, she said, noting that water released from a dam may meet quality standards while the structure itself blocks fish migration and disrupts river flows—impacts the Supreme Court has previously ruled that states may consider when making certification decisions.

Stoner also warned the proposal would further limit state authority to waters still covered by the Clean Water Act, a shrinking category after the Supreme Court’s 2023 Sackett decision and later efforts by EPA and the Army Corps to narrow which waterways qualify for federal protection.

As a result, states could lose the ability to use Section 401 to protect many smaller streams, wetlands, and headwaters within their borders, leaving state regulators powerless to block, or place conditions on, federally permitted projects that could damage those waters, even if they are vital to local drinking water supplies, fisheries, recreation, or flood control.

Kramer, from the EPA, said the proposed rule is intended to curb what the agency views as misuse of Section 401 by some states to block projects for reasons unrelated to water quality.

Kramer said the changes would ensure that section 401 “is not weaponized by states to shut down projects for political purposes, as opposed to protecting water quality.”

State officials, particularly in Democrat-led states, have relied on Section 401 in recent years to deny or place conditions on permits for major projects they say would have harmed local waterways.

In 2017, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and the state’s Department of Ecology relied on Section 401 to reject a critical water-quality certification for a proposed coal export terminal in Longview. State officials concluded the project would cause significant environmental harm that could not be mitigated. Courts later upheld the decision, and the ruling ultimately brought the project to an end.

In 2020, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo used section 401 to deny a permit for a natural gas pipeline proposed to bring fuel from Pennsylvania into the state, citing concerns that its construction would cause significant harm to water quality.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has since approved a permit for the same pipeline project Cuomo denied.

Last summer, EPA hosted two public webinars to solicit input on proposed changes to the law.

At least 14 of the speakers who joined these sessions pointed to the Clean Water Act’s long track record of improving water quality and said section 401 has been essential for protecting rivers and aquatic ecosystems from pollution, according to an EPA summary of the discussions.

The summary states: “Many of these speakers expressed concern that a new rule would weaken State and Tribal authority, arguing that such changes could undermine public health, environmental protection, and local economies.”

Soon, the agency plans to open a 30-day public comment period. After its review, Kramer said the agency would work toward issuing a final rule this spring.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Like any industry that’s led by designers, the automotive world is subject to trends and fashions. Often, these are things the rest of us complain about. Wheels that used to be 16 inches are now 20s, because the extra size makes the vehicle they’re fitted to look smaller, particularly if it’s an SUV with a slab of electric vehicle battery to conceal. Front seat passengers now find themselves with their own infotainment screen, often with some kind of active filter tech to prevent the driver from being distracted by whatever it is they’re doing. And of course le buzz du jour, AI, is being crammed in here, there, and everywhere.

But the thing about fashion and trends is that they don’t remain in style for ever. For a few years, it was hard to drive a new car that didn’t use piano black trim all over the interior. The shiny black plastic surfaces hide infotainment screens well when the display is not turned on, but they scratch and show every speck of dust and lint and every smudge and fingerprint. And that’s true for the cheap econobox to the plush luxobarge. The industry finally cottoned on to this, and “black gloss has had its time—we can do without it,” Kia designer Jochen Paesen told me a few years ago.

Many of those design trends may have been annoying, but the switch away from buttons isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s affecting safety. And increasingly, safety regulators are pushing back. A couple of years ago, we learned that the Euro New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) organization that crash tests cars for European consumers decided that from 2026, it would start deducting points for basic controls that weren’t separate, physical controls that the driver can easily operate without taking their eyes off the road. And now ANCAP, which provides similar crash testing for Australia and New Zealand, has done the same.

It’s helpful to know that the lack of physical buttons isn’t just a trend pushed by designers—the bean counters like it, too. It’s quicker—and therefore cheaper—during assembly to just fit a capacitive touch module that controls multiple settings or switches than it is to have individual buttons, each connected to a wiring loom. Which is why we’re seeing the controls for heating and cooling the interior, the headlights, seat heaters, and more move from knobs and dials and sliders and buttons to touch panels. Sometimes they’re standalone, sometimes they’re embedded along the bezels of the infotainment touchscreen. Sometimes they’re even their own touchscreen.

And they’re more distracting to use than physical buttons.

Like Euro NCAP, ANCAP is not requiring all functions to be physical buttons, lest all our cars look like the flight deck of a Boeing 747-400, or perhaps a first-generation Porsche Panamera. That won’t go nearly far enough for some, but it is at least a move in the right direction.

“From 2026, we’re asking car makers to either offer physical buttons for important driver controls like the horn, indicators, hazard lights, windscreen wipers and headlights, or dedicate a fixed portion of the cabin display screen to these primary driving functions,” it wrote in its guidance of what’s changed for 2026. Similarly, Europe is requiring turn signals, hazard lights, windshield wipers, the horn, and any SOS features like the EU’s eCall function.

Encouragingly, it looks like automakers are starting to take this to heart and are designing newer models accordingly. Porsche was an early ditcher of buttons after having previously used many, many of them (like the aforementioned Panamera), but as we found in our preview of the next Cayenne, real buttons are back on the menu.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last year, we drove BMW’s new iX3. It’s the first of a series of electric BMWs to use a newly developed platform, known as the “Neue Klasse.” Later this year, we’ll see the first fully electric version of the 3 Series when the i3 sedan debuts. And next year, BMW enthusiasts will finally find out what the brand’s M division—which infuses motorsport into the vehicles like few others—can do with an EV.

There have been M-tuned EVs before now, more powerful variants of the i4, iX, and i7. And each time we’ve driven them, BMW has been at pains to point out that these weren’t true M cars, not like the M3 or M5. Honestly, they weren’t better than the cheaper, less powerful versions, something that won’t be allowed for next year’s performance EV, which might be called something like the iM3, assuming the naming convention remains logic-based.

“The next generation of models are set to establish a new benchmark in the high-performance vehicle segment,” says Franciscus van Meel, managing director of BMW M GmbH. “With the latest generation of Neue Klasse technology, we are taking the BMW M driving experience to a new level and will inspire our customers with outstanding, racetrack-ready driving dynamics for everyday use.”

Technology is the key to distinguishing the M EV from its more sedate siblings. The Neue Klasse platform hews to the software-defined vehicle trend, where a handful of powerful computers each control a wide array of functions, rather than dozens or hundreds of discrete electronic control units in black boxes each doing a single job. One computer handles infotainment, and another deals with automated driving and active safety systems. A third handles the relatively mundane but no less important job of climate control, plus the seats and doors and windows.

However, the important one here is called the Heart of Joy, which runs M-specific software, called BMW M Dynamic Performance Control. This offers an order of magnitude faster response in terms of the car’s electronic dynamic control compared to current M models, which is put to good use controlling the four electric motors that will propel the electric M.

BMW M has made M-specific front and rear drive units, each with a motor for each wheel arranged in parallel, with a gearbox on each side. On top of each drive unit are the power electronics that control it all. BMW was a little cagey with details when it briefed us on the electric M powertrain in Spain last November and wouldn’t elaborate on what kind of electric motor it’s using in the M drive units, but we suspect they’re permanent synchronous motors.

There’s also an M-specific high-voltage battery. Expect at least 100 kWh; the stock pack has 108.7 kWh net, but the cylindrical cells have been optimized for power delivery, and there’s new two-sided cooling and even a different cell layout within the pack. The cells look the same, according to Philip Guerrero, project lead for high-voltage batteries at BMW, but they have lower internal resistance and increased power density, despite using the same cell chemistry.

A performance EV with lightning-fast but precise control of each wheel does indeed sound tantalizing, and BMW told us it’s aiming at a new benchmark in driving dynamics on track as well as on the road. And it’s taking a page out of Hyundai’s book with the addition of a simulated gearshift mode. As we’ve seen in the Ioniq 5 N, using steering wheel paddles to alter the pedal mapping for lift-off regenerative braking and the throttle goes a long way to adding some engagement to a performance EV by replicating a transmission, especially if you implement it in a way that even lets you bounce off a “rev limiter” for more fidelity. For the people who think that sounds like no fun, take heart in the fact that as always, you can just choose not to turn that function on.

As we’ve noted in the past, the Neue Klasse is BMW’s most sustainable platform ever, and that, too, carries through to the M Neue Klasse. Instead of carbon fiber, it’s switching to a natural fiber alternative called Bcomp that emits 40 percent less carbon dioxide during the production process, while still offering a great strength-to-weight ratio.</div>

            <h2>The RAM shortage’s silver lining: Less talk about “AI PCs”</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/the-ram-shortages-silver-lining-less-talk-about-ai-pcs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">RAM prices have soared, which is bad news for people interested in buying, building, or upgrading a computer this year, but it’s likely good news for people exasperated by talk of so-called AI PCs.

As Ars Technica has reported, the growing demands of data centers, fueled by the AI boom, have led to a shortage of RAM and flash memory chips, driving prices to skyrocket.

In an announcement today, Ben Yeh, principal analyst at technology research firm Omdia, said that in 2025, “mainstream PC memory and storage costs rose by 40 percent to 70 percent, resulting in cost increases being passed through to customers.”

Overall, global PC shipments increased in 2025, according to Omdia, (which pegged growth at 9.2 percent compared to 2024), and IDC, (which today reported 9.6 percent growth), but analysts expect PC sales to be more tumultuous in 2026.

“The year ahead is shaping up to be extremely volatile,” Jean Philippe Bouchard, research VP with IDC’s worldwide mobile device trackers, said in a statement.

Both analyst firms expect PC makers to manage the RAM shortage by raising prices and by releasing computers with lower memory specs. IDC expects price hikes of 15 to 20 percent and for PC RAM specs to “be lowered on average to preserve memory inventory on hand,” Bouchard said. Omdia’s Yeh expects “leaner mid to low-tier configurations to protect margins.”

“These RAM shortages will last beyond just 2026, and the cost-conscious part of the market is the one that will be most impacted,” Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for worldwide mobile device trackers at IDC, told Ars via email.

IDC expects vendors to “prioritize midrange and premium systems to offset higher component costs, especially memory.”

The increased costs have implications for the concept of “AI PCs,” a term OEMs have used consistently over the last two years as they sought to leverage the growth of generative AI chatbots to drive computer sales.

Shoppers, however, have been either too reluctant or too savvy to buy into manufacturer-made AI PC hype.

“PC OEMs had trouble selling the on-device AI message even before the memory shortages,” Ubrani said.

IT buyers will likely also consider local AI capabilities a lower priority if OEMs lower RAM specs to address the component shortage.

“General interest in AI PCs has been wavering for a while, since cloud-based options are widely available and the use cases for on-device AI have been limited. This indifference (between on-device and cloud-based) from a demand perspective might work in favor of PC OEMs, as they don’t need to provide large amounts of RAM,” Ubrani said.

With RAM pricing stability possibly not arriving until 2027, per Ubrani, it may be a while until RAM is readily available enough for it to make sense for PC companies to put as much emphasis on AI PCs, which generally require at least 16GB of memory, as they have in the past two years.

We’ve already seen a shift from AI PCs from Dell. In 2025, it discontinued its XPS brand of consumer laptops and desktops, partially due to the belief that “the AI PC market is quickly evolving,” Kevin Terwilliger, VP and GM of commercial, consumer, and gaming PCs at Dell, told media outlets at the time.

“Everyone from IT decision makers to professionals and everyday users are looking at on-device AI to help drive productivity and creativity,” he said.

At CES 2026, however, Dell resurrected the XPS brand and reframed its laptop marketing around build, battery life, and display quality. Terwilliger also sang a different tune.

“… what we’ve learned over the course of this year, especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI,” Terwilliger said at a press briefing ahead of the show. “In fact, I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”

Microsoft also seems aware of the shortcomings of AI PCs. In December, The Information reported that CEO Satya Nadella had sent an email to engineering heads expressing disappointment with the consumer version of Copilot. He reportedly wrote that tools for connecting Copilot with Outlook and Gmail “for [the] most part don’t really work” and are “not smart.” The publication also reported that Nadella delegated some of his responsibilities to spend more time on Copilot. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report.

With that in mind, it stands to reason that we’re far from hearing the last about AI PCs. Currently, there are still plenty of stakeholders pushing AI PCs in 2026. But as we all await the end of the RAM shortage, it seems that at least some brands will attempt to build AI PCs with a significant and relevant purpose and scale back on trying to get people to buy a computer that can handle AI.

The idea of AI PCs isn’t inherently a bad thing. But in recent years, it felt like technology companies were exploiting generative AI to convince people and companies to buy more or more powerful devices, even if they didn’t need them or local AI processing.

Now, with a RAM crunch and lack of customer demand, there’s hope for AI PC marketing spiel to relent somewhat and for PC companies to try harder to prove that AI PCs are a solution to a problem, not a solution searching for a problem.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/never-before-seen-linux-malware-is-far-more-advanced-than-typical/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers have discovered a never-before-seen framework that infects Linux machines with a wide assortment of modules that are notable for the range of advanced capabilities they provide to attackers.

The framework, referred to as VoidLink by its source code, features more than 30 modules that can be used to customize capabilities to meet attackers’ needs for each infected machine. These modules can provide additional stealth and specific tools for reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement inside a compromised network. The components can be easily added or removed as objectives change over the course of a campaign.

VoidLink can target machines within popular cloud services by detecting if an infected machine is hosted inside AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba, and Tencent, and there are indications that developers plan to add detections for Huawei, DigitalOcean, and Vultr in future releases. To detect which cloud service hosts the machine, VoidLink examines metadata using the respective vendor’s API.

Similar frameworks targeting Windows servers have flourished for years. They are less common on Linux machines. The feature set is unusually broad and is “far more advanced than typical Linux malware,” said researchers from Checkpoint, the security firm that discovered VoidLink. Its creation may indicate that the attacker’s focus is increasingly expanding to include Linux systems, cloud infrastructure, and application deployment environments, as organizations increasingly move workloads to these environments.

“VoidLink is a comprehensive ecosystem designed to maintain long-term, stealthy access to compromised Linux systems, particularly those running on public cloud platforms and in containerized environments,” the researchers said in a separate post. “Its design reflects a level of planning and investment typically associated with professional threat actors rather than opportunistic attackers, raising the stakes for defenders who may never realize their infrastructure has been quietly taken over.”

The VoidLink interface is localized for Chinese-affiliated operators, an indication that it likely originates from a Chinese-affiliated development environment. Symbols and comments within the source code suggest that VoidLink remains under development. Another sign the framework is not yet completed: Checkpoint found no signs it has infected any machines in the wild. Company researchers discovered it last month in a series of clusters of Linux malware available through VirusTotal.

Included in the batch of binaries was a two-stage loader. The final implant includes core modules embedded that can be augmented by plugins that are downloaded and installed at runtime. The capabilities of the 37 modules discovered so far include:

With no indication that VoidLink is actively targeting machines, there’s no immediate action required by defenders, although they can obtain indicators of compromise from the Checkpoint blog post. VoidLink still indicates defenders should apply vigilance when working with Linux machines.</div>

            <h2>Lawsuit: DHS wants “unlimited subpoena authority” to unmask ICE critics</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-user-fights-dhs-for-the-right-to-post-ice-sightings-anonymously/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is fighting to unmask the owner of Facebook and Instagram accounts of a community watch group monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Pennsylvania.

Defending the right to post about ICE sightings anonymously is a Meta account holder for MontCo Community Watch, John Doe.

Doe has alleged that when the DHS sent a “summons” to Meta asking for subscriber information, it infringed on core First Amendment-protected activity, i.e., the right to publish content critical of government agencies and officials without fear of government retaliation. He also accused DHS of ignoring federal rules and seeking to vastly expand its authority to subpoena information to unmask ICE’s biggest critics online.

“I believe that my anonymity is the only thing standing between me and unfair and unjust persecution by the government of the United States,” Doe said in his complaint.

In response, DHS alleged that the community watch group that posted “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things,” was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties.” Claiming that the subpoena had nothing to do with silencing government critics, they argued that a statute regulating imports and exports empowered DHS to investigate the group’s alleged threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder” ICE agents.

DHS claims that Meta must comply with the subpoena because the government needs to investigate a “serious” threat “to the safety of its agents and the performance of their duties.”

On Wednesday, a US district judge will hear arguments to decide if Doe is right or if DHS can broadly unmask critics online by claiming it’s investigating supposed threats to ICE agents. With more power, DHS officials have confirmed they plan to criminally prosecute critics posting ICE videos online, Doe alleged in a lawsuit filed last October.

DHS alleged that the community watch group posting “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things,” was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties.” Claiming that the subpoena had nothing to do with silencing government critics, they argued that DHS is authorized to investigate the group and that compelling interest supersedes Doe’s First Amendment rights.

According to Doe’s most recent court filing, DHS is pushing a broad reading of a statute that empowers DHS to subpoena information about the “importation/exportation of merchandise&quot;—like records to determine duties owed or information to unmask a drug smuggler or child sex trafficker. DHS claims the statute isn’t just about imports and exports but also authorizes DHS to seize information about anyone they can tie to an investigation of potential crimes that violate US customs laws.

However, it seems to make no sense, Doe argued, that Congress would “silently embed unlimited subpoena authority in a provision keyed to the importation of goods.” Doe hopes the US district judge will agree that DHS’s summons was unconstitutional.

“The subscriber information for social media accounts publishing speech critical of ICE that DHS seeks is completely unrelated to the importation/exportation of merchandise; the records are outside the scope of DHS’s summons power,” Doe alleged.

And even if the court agrees on DHS’s reading of the statute, DHS has not established that unmasking the owner of the community watch accounts would be relevant to any legitimate criminal investigation, Doe alleged.

To convince the court that the case was really about chilling speech, Doe attached every post made on the group’s Facebook and Instagram feeds. None show threats or arguably implicit threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder any federal official,” as DHS claimed. Instead, the users shared “information and resources about immigrant rights, due process rights, fundraising, and vigils,” Doe said.

Ariel Shapell, an attorney representing Doe at the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, told Ars that “if you go and look at the content on the Facebook and Instagram profiles at issue here, it’s pretty innocuous.”

DHS claimed to have received information about the group supposedly “stalking and gathering of intelligence on federal agents involved in ICE operations.” However, Doe argued that “unsurprisingly, neither DHS nor its declarant cites any post even allegedly constituting any such threat. To the contrary, all posts on these social media accounts constitute speech addressing important public issues fully protected under the First Amendment,” Doe argued.

“Reporting on, or even livestreaming, publicly occurring immigration operations is fully protected First Amendment activity,” Doe argued. “DHS does not, and cannot, show how such conduct constitutes an assault, kidnapping, or murder of a federal law enforcement officer, or a threat to do any of those things.”

Doe’s motion to quash the subpoena arrives at a time when recent YouGov polling suggests that Americans have reached a tipping point in ending support for ICE. YouGov’s poll found more people disapprove of how ICE is handling its job than approve, following the aftermath of nationwide anti-ICE protests over Renee Good’s killing. ICE critics have used footage of tragic events—like Good’s death and eight other ICE shootings since September—to support calls to remove ICE from embattled communities and abolish ICE.

As sharing ICE footage has swayed public debate, DHS has seemingly sought to subpoena Meta and possibly other platforms for subscriber information.

In October, Meta refused to provide names of users associated with Doe’s accounts—as well as “postal code, country, all email address(es) on file, date of account creation, registered telephone numbers, IP address at account signup, and logs showing IP address and date stamps for account accesses&quot;—without further information from DHS. Meta then gave Doe the opportunity to move to quash the subpoena to stop the company from sharing information.

That request came about a week after DHS requested similar information from Meta about six Instagram community watch groups that shared information about ICE activity in Los Angeles and other locations. DHS withdrew those requests after account holders defended First Amendment rights and filed motions to quash the subpoena, Doe’s court filing said.

It’s unclear why DHS withdrew those subpoenas but maintained Doe’s. DHS has alleged that the government’s compelling interest in Doe’s identity outweighs First Amendment rights to post anonymously online. The agency also claimed it has met its burden to unmask Doe as “someone who is allegedly involved in threatening ICE agents and impeding the performance of their duties,” which supposedly “touches DHS’s investigation into threats to ICE agents and impediments to the performance of their duties.”

Whether Doe will prevail is hard to say, but Politico reported that DHS’s “defense will rest on whether DHS’s argument that posting videos and images of ICE officers and warnings about arrests is considered criminal activity.” It may weaken DHS’s case that Border Patrol Tactical Commander Greg Bovino recently circulated a “legal refresher” for agents in the field, reminding them that protestors are allowed to take photos and videos of “an officer or operation in public,” independent journalist Ken Klippenstein reported.

Shapell told Ars that there seems to be “a lot of distance” between the content posted on Doe’s accounts and relevant evidence that could be used in DHS’s alleged investigation into criminal activity. And meanwhile, “there are just very clear First Amendment rights here to associate with other people anonymously online and to discuss political opinions online anonymously,” Shapell said, which the judge may strongly uphold as core protected activity as threats of government retaliation mount.

“These summonses chill people’s desire to communicate about these sorts of incredibly important developments on the Internet, even anonymously, when there’s a threat that they could be unmasked and investigated for this really core First Amendment protected activity,” Shapell said.

A win could reassure Meta users that they can continue posting about ICE online without fear of retaliation should Meta be pressed to share their information.

Ars could not immediately reach DHS for comment. Meta declined to comment, only linking Ars to an FAQ to help users understand how the platform processes government requests.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Color us shocked: pretty much everyone hates that Elon Musk’s Grok has been digitally undressing photos of adults and children.

At least that’s the case in the UK, providing the closest thing we’ve currently got to a gauge of the public sentiment on the issue. In a new survey conducted by YouGov amid the latest controversy surrounding the xAI chatbot, a staggering 97 percent of respondents said that AI tools shouldn’t be allowed to generate sexually explicit content of children, and 96 percent said they shouldn’t be able to generate “undressed” images of minors only wearing clothing like underwear, either. Sanity may not prevail on X, but it does at least appear to still have a firm grip in real life.

The overwhelming consensus goes to show just how much of a nerve xAI and Grok struck over the past week and half as the bot allowed users to easily generate nudes or sexually charged images of people, many of them minors, whose photos were shared on X, Musk’s social media platform where Grok operates. The trend spiraled out of control so quickly that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated the bot was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute.

Outrage quickly spread against the appalling practice among the public and regulators, and some countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, moved to ban access to X outright. Prime minister Keir Starmer has hinted that the UK could follow suit. The saga also put pressure on Google and Apple for continuing to host X on their app stores, despite it violating the rules.

Yet xAI has not made an official statement regarding the Grok generations, which some experts say could be illegal — despite facing the public for some of Grok’s previous controversies, such as when it began styling itself as “MechaHitler” during a racist posting spree. Musk, meanwhile, simply joked that the whole affair was “way funnier” than the trends started by other AI chatbots.

Overall, the YouGov poll shows that the British public continues to despise Musk’s platform, with 65 percent holding a negative view of X, and only 12 percent holding a positive one.

Additionally, 87 percent believe AIs like Grok shouldn’t be allowed to generate “undressed” images of real adults in racy outfits like underwear, lingerie, or bikinis.

            <h2>Indie Developer Deleting Entire Game From Steam Due to Shame From Having Used AI</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/indie-developer-deleting-entire-game-ai">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An indie game developer experienced a moment of profound moral clarity, and is now deleting his partially-AI-made game from the digital storefront Steam.

The game, dubbed “Hardest,” is a free-to-play “rock-paper-scissors” roguelike card game released last July to mixed-to-negative reviews (of which there are barely thirty total.) Some users called it “soulless” and disparaged it for using AI art.

Now the developer, Eero “Rakuel” Laine, appears to agree with those haters. On January 10, Laine posted a surprise update to the Hardest page announcing that he would be deleting the game by the end of January, sounding penitent for his mortal sin of indulging in an AI shortcut.

“I made this game during the summer in [a] couple months and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free,” he explained. “But I have realized [that] AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment.”

“Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason the get more investment for their AI companies, that benefit no one, but rather suck resources from the economy from hard working people,” he added.

Laine clarified that he didn’t vibe-code the whole game, and actually programmed “everything myself,” so he’s ready to make a new game in the future with real, human-made assets. But his current game, he says, “is a disgrace to all game makers and players.”

“The girl I’ve been dating for a month made me realize this,” he added, in yet another wild twist.

The use of generative AI has been a hot button issue in art and entertainment, and game development has been no exception. In recent months, the debate over how it should be used in the industry, if at all, has been reignited over its role in the creation of several high profile titles.

When the fantasy RPG sensation Claire Obscur: Expedition 33 racked up a historical number of accolades at last year’s The Game Awards, including game of the year, concerned observers noted the fact that the creators had openly admitted to using AI assets during its development, though no AI is said to have made it into the final product. Then the Indie Game Awards announced that it was rescinding its GOTY award given to Expedition 33 because of its AI usage, blowing the debate wide open.

Adding to the swirling discourse, after dropping a trailer for its upcoming title Divinity at the Game Awards ceremony, the CEO of the Baldur’s Gate 3 maker Larian boasted that the studio would be using AI to “explore ideas” and “develop concept art.” The message seemed to be that AI in game development was here to stay, and would not be an obstacle to games having both critical and commercial success, as further evidenced by the popularity of new fan-favorite Arc Raiders, an multiplayer extraction shooter that uses AI to generate the voices of both player characters and NPCs. Perhaps the entire industry is overdue for an epiphany like Laine’s.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At this point, tech corporations have made it no secret that their end goal is to replace all jobs with AI — thus cementing themselves as indispensable to the world economy. But what happens if we actually get to that point?

Either they don’t have a clue, or they don’t want to say.

Speaking at a press conference last month, Geoffrey Hinton — a pioneer in the field of neural networks, the bedrock of modern AI — remarked that “it’s clear that a lot of jobs are going to disappear: it’s not clear that it’s going to create a lot of jobs to replace that.”

Often lauded as a “godfather of AI,” Hinton has gone on the record many times to warn about the social cost of AI solutionism in an economic system driven by profit. “This isn’t AI’s problem,” he continued last month. “This is our political system’s problem. If you get a massive increase in productivity, how does that wealth get shared around?”

It’s a critically important question as AI spending becomes integral to the US economy, yet one which tech corporations and the moguls heading them have been at a loss to answer.

SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, for example, has waxed poetic about a future in which AI and robotics could make us all rich. Currently the world’s wealthiest person himself, Musk has spent some time over the last few weeks bleating about “universal high income,” a take on universal basic income where every out-of-work peon would live comfortably off the prosperity of private corporations, like his beleaguered AI venture, xAI.

Of course, as The New Yorker‘s John Cassidy observes, such material abundance for displaced workers won’t be possible unless Musk and his fellow billionaires agree to share their largesse. (As Martin Luther King Jr wrote from Birmingham Jail, “it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.”)

OpenAI’s Sam Altman has echoed Musk’s ideas, saying he hopes AI can bring about what he calls “universal extreme wealth,” in which everyone basically has ownership stakes in every AI company.

Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind and CEO of Microsoft AI, has called AI a “fundamentally labor-replacing tool,” which is evidently worth the mass economic turmoil, because “in 15 or 20 years’ time, we will be producing new scientific, cultural knowledge at almost zero marginal cost.”

Overall, it’s hard to see this scenario coming to pass. Currently, Goldman Sachs only predicts a 7 percent increase in global GDP over the next ten years due to AI, while the Penn Wharton Budget Model foresees a 3.7 percent boost to GDP by 2075.

Any AI-driven bump in GDP would undoubtedly be a boost — but far from the one needed to avoid widespread poverty and anguish without major concessions from the billionaire class. But hey, if they’re serious about it, there’s never been a better time for them to put their money where their mouth is.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On December 6, NASA’s MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft, which has been studying the Red Planet’s upper atmosphere for over a decade, mysteriously went offline.

The spacecraft was expected to send telemetry back to Earth, signals that were never picked up by NASA’s Deep Space Network, a global system of massive radio antennas making up an interplanetary communications network.

Less than a week later, NASA issued a new update, admitting that MAVEN appeared to be “rotating in an unexpected manner when it emerged from behind Mars.” Then, on December 23, the agency issued its last update, promising that it’s “continuing efforts to recontact” its lost spacecraft.

But weeks later, things aren’t looking much better. As SpaceNews senior writer Jeff Foust pointed out, NASA planetary science division director Louise Prockter conceded during a Tuesday meeting that the agency is “very unlikely” to recover the MAVEN orbiter.

Not all hope is lost. Mars’ solar conjunction, a weeks-long period when Mars and Earth are on opposite sides of the Sun, will end on January 16, which will give NASA a new opportunity to reestablish contact.

In its latest December 23 update, NASA explained that the MAVEN team was attempting to “create a timeline of possible events and identify the likely root cause of the issue” by analyzing “tracking data fragments recovered from a December 6 radio science campaign.”

NASA also leveraged the Mastcam instrument attached to its Curiosity rover to attempt to take a picture of MAVEN, but failed to detect the missing spacecraft.

It’s a sad state of affairs, but fortunately there are three other spacecraft that can still relay communications between Mars missions and the Earth. A next-generation orbiter, dubbed Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, was also recently revived in president Donald Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” act — though it remains unclear when it will launch.

For now, all we can hope is that NASA’s renewed efforts to make contact with MAVEN will prove successful once it emerges from behind Mars once again. But given Prockter’s latest comments, the situation isn’t looking promising.

            <div id="article-text">The future is here, and it’s bouncing all over the back alleys of China.

Numerous clips of autonomous delivery vans ripping around cities have swirled on Chinese social media in recent days, showcasing the new technology’s capabilities — as well as its many, many shortcomings.

One video which went viral on the Pinterest-like app Xiaohongshu shows a Neolix X3 unit bouncing aggressively as it barrels down a potholed gravel path. The X3 sports two massive lithium batteries on the bottom of its chassis, a configuration which clearly isn’t helping the vehicle’s suspension as it rattles down the block.

“The roads are still from the Qing Dynasty, but the cars are from the next century,” one user wrote under the original post.

Other examples abound, like one of the smaller Neolix X3s freaking out over a road littered with corn cobs, or the stubborn ZTO express delivery van which got itself stuck after driving through wet cement.

In one clip from September, a Shenzhen woman tried in vain to stop a robovan from running over her prized vegetables, which she had been drying out on the side of the road.

The sheer number of clips are indicative of the massive rollout of self-driving vans throughout China.

Neolix, for example, says it’s deployed over 10,000 robovans across 300 cities as of October, according to The Robot Report. In Qingdao alone, there are already more than 1,200 self-driving cargo vans, which have racked over 31 million miles and thousands of deliveries since they’ve been in operation.

Though Neolix isn’t the only robovan company operating throughout the People’s Republic, it’s certainly the biggest. It was the first to obtain an autonomous delivery license in 2021, enabling it to start accumulating miles on select public roads.

Other companies, like Rino.ai, are following in Neolix’s footsteps, with over 2,000 self-driving vans on the road in over 170 cities.

While the clips are unquestionably entertaining, the robovans are clearly presenting a safety hazard on the roads — and likely a glimpse of things to come for the rest of the world.

            <h2>Union Representing NASA Workers Says Space Agency’s New Administrator Is a Straight-Up Liar</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/nasa-union-isaacman">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During the government shutdown in November, the Trump administration suddenly accelerated its plans to shutter over a dozen buildings and around 100 laboratories at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).

The decision angered Democratic lawmakers, who accused them of going ahead with the “consolidation” effort without even consulting them.

In a November 10 letter addressed to Sean Duffy, who served as NASA’s interim administrator at the time, representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) noted that her staff had received “disturbing reports that NASA is directing the imminent closure of laboratories and facilities hosting mission-critical capabilities” at the GSFC.

Of particular concern is the campus’ main library, which was unceremoniously shut down last month, as the New York Times reported on December 31. NASA officials tried to downplay these concerns seemingly to no avail — as former and current staffers, advisors, and union representatives continue to watch in horror as the GSFC closures go on.

NASA insiders cried foul following the library’s closure, warning that critical and still-undigitized materials could be thrown out in what they said were reckless efforts by the Trump administration.

NASA’s new administrator, Jared Isaacman, who was confirmed by the Senate on December 17, was angered by the NYT‘s framing, accusing the newspaper of not fully reflecting the “context NASA shared.” He argued that “at no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials.”

That’s despite later admitting that “some materials with no historical or technical value may not be retained” following a “deliberate review” over a period of 60 days.

NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens chimed in as well, describing the moves at Goddard as a “consolidation, not a closure.”

Isaacman’s comments have seemingly done little to reassure rattled NASA staffers. In a January 7 response spotted by Astronomy, Matt Biggs, the president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) — a union that represents thousands of NASA scientists and engineers — accused Isaacman of making “patently false” statements.

“The rapid and haphazard shutdown of the library at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, reported on by The New York Times, decimated this valuable collection housed at NASA’s largest research library,” Biggs wrote.

The labor union boss also took issue with Isaacman’s argument that the consolidation efforts were part of the 2022 Goddard Master Plan, which dates back to the Biden administration.

“This was not part of some ‘long-planned facilities consolidation’ as Isaacman claims,” Biggs wrote. “The Goddard Master Plan, written in 2022, does not call for the library’s closure. Building 21, which houses the library, was scheduled for renovation, not elimination.”

Futurism has reached out to NASA for clarification. The agency failed to reply to a previous request for comment regarding details of the 2022 Master Plan.

Biggs also accused Isaacman of misleadingly stating on X that “NASA researchers will continue to have access to the scientific information and resources they need to do their work.”

“That’s simply not true,” he wrote. “Much of the material that was available in the library in Greenbelt, Maryland, is copyrighted or unique out-of-print material that cannot or has not been digitized and will no longer be available to researchers.”

It’s a precarious moment, as NASA’s future continues to be debated in Congress. If it were up to the White House, the historic agency would face the largest budget cuts in its 67-year history. Lawmakers, however, have since passed a counteroffer that would leave the agency’s science budget largely unaffected for the fiscal year of 2026 — which technically started in October, as the chaos has dragged on.

It’s a major test of Isaacman’s leadership after taking control of an agency in crisis last month. Insiders remain highly skeptical of the Trump administration’s approach. They say NASA should be opening doors, not closing them, especially as the United States looks to return astronauts to the Moon in the coming years.

“Where is the consolidation?” Biggs wrote. “The material is not being consolidated with other holdings; it is simply being lost to Goddard and to the broader research community, much of it is being sent to storage or to the dumpster.”

“NASA’s scientists and engineers shouldn’t have to be dumpster divers to do their work,” he added. “We expect better from NASA and its managers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Skild AI, which makes foundation models for robots, seems to have more than tripled its valuation in just seven months.

The startup has raised a $1.4 billion Series C round that values it at more than $14 billion, Bloomberg reported. The round was led by SoftBank, and Nvidia, Macquarie Group, 1789 Capital and others also invested.

Skild AI last raised a funding at a $4.5 billion valuation this prior summer, Bloomberg reported. The company hasn’t disclosed the exact value of that round — it was rumored to be around $500 million — but Skild AI CEO Deepak Pathak told Bloomberg that the company has now raised more than $2 billion to date.

TechCrunch has reached out to Skild AI for more information on its fundraising history, and we’ll update this piece when we hear more.

Founded in 2023, Skild AI builds general-purpose robotic software and foundation models that can be retrofitted to a variety of different robots and tasks without requiring a ton of additional training. The hope is that these models can also learn from watching humans perform tasks.

There has been a big push recently into this type of learn-as-you-go robotic software alongside the rising hype around humanoids.

One of the biggest hurdles in robot adoption for both personal and industrial use cases is the sheer amount of training required for robots to learn each and every new task. Being able to learn and adapt as they go would clear the path for more robotic adoption.

Field AI is another startup looking to build easily-adapted robotic software. 1X, the maker of humanoid Neo, just released a world model in pursuit of the same goal.

            <h2>Gemini’s new beta feature provides proactive responses based on your photos, emails, and more</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/geminis-new-beta-feature-provides-proactive-responses-based-on-your-photos-emails-and-more/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google announced on Wednesday that it’s launching a new beta feature in the Gemini app that allows the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.

Although Gemini could already retrieve information from these apps, it can now reason across your data to provide proactive results, such as connecting a thread in your emails to a video you watched. Google says this means Gemini understands context without being told where to look.

The tech giant notes that this beta experience, called Personal Intelligence, is off by default, as users have the option to choose if and when they want to connect their Google apps to Gemini. Of course, not everyone wants AI looking at their photos and YouTube history. If you do decide to connect your apps, Gemini will only use Personal Intelligence when it determines that doing so will be helpful, Google says.

“Personal Intelligence has two core strengths: reasoning across complex sources and retrieving specific details from, say, an email or photo to answer your question,” wrote Josh Woodward, VP, Gemini app, Google Labs, and AI Studio, in a blog post. “It often combines these, working across text, photos and video to provide uniquely tailored answers.”

Woodward shared an example of when he was standing in line at a tire shop and didn’t remember his car’s tire size. While most AI chatbots can determine a car’s tire size, Woodward says Gemini can go further by offering personalized responses. In his case, Gemini suggested all-weather tires after identifying family road trip photos in Google Photos. Woodward also said he forgot his license plate number, but Gemini was able to pull the number from a picture in Photos.

“I’ve also been getting excellent tips for books, shows, clothes and travel,” Woodward wrote. “Just this week, it’s been exceptional for planning our upcoming spring break. By analyzing our family’s interests and past trips in Gmail and Photos, it skipped the tourist traps. Instead, it suggested an overnight train journey and specific board games we could play along the way.”

Google says it has guardrails for sensitive topics, as Gemini will avoid making proactive assumptions about sensitive data like health. However, the tech giant also notes that Gemini will discuss this data if you ask it to.

Additionally, Gemini doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library. Instead, it trains on specific prompts in Gemini and the model’s responses. In the examples above, the photos of the road trip, the license plate picture in Photos, and the emails in Gmail are not directly used to train the model. They are only referenced to generate a response, Google says.

Personal Intelligence is rolling out to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. Google plans to expand the feature to more countries and Gemini’s free tier.

Google provided a list of example prompts to try, including “Help me plan my weekend in [city i.e. New York] based on things I like to do,” “Recommend some documentaries based on what I’ve been curious about,” or “Based on my delivery and grocery receipts in Gmail, Search history, and YouTube watch history, recommend 5 YouTube channels that match my cooking style or meal prep vibe.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cybercriminals are increasingly using AI in their attacks. At the same time, cyber defenders are also turning to the technology to fight back. Depthfirst, a security startup positioning itself at the forefront of this AI-powered defense, announced Wednesday that it had raised $40 million in a Series A round.

Founded in October 2024, the company raised the round from Accel Partners, which led the investment, with participation from SV Angel, Mantis VC, and Alt Capital.

Depthfirst offers a platform called General Security Intelligence, an AI-native suite that helps companies scan and analyze their codebases and workflows for signs of trouble. The company says that the platform also allows companies to protect themselves from credential exposures and to monitor threats to their open-source and third-party components.

The company plans to use the new capital to hire additional staff for applied research and engineering, as well as product and sales.

“We’ve entered an era where software is written faster than it can be secured,” said Qasim Mithani, the company’s co-founder and CEO, as part of the announcement. Mithani, who previously worked for Databricks and Amazon, added that automation has changed how bad actors execute their attacks. “AI has already changed how attackers work. Defense has to evolve just as fundamentally.”

The company’s leadership comes with backgrounds in both AI and security. One of Depthfirst’s other co-founders, Daniele Perito, previously served as director of security and risk engineering at Square, which is part of Jack Dorsey’s Block. Its CTO (and another co-founder), Andrea Michi, was previously an engineer at Google DeepMind.

Just as AI can be used for legitimate purposes, it can also be used by cybercriminals to automate a whole range of malicious processes—from writing malware to social engineering attacks to scanning for vulnerabilities to exploit. Last November, Anthropic claimed that it had thwarted the first “AI orchestrated cyber espionage campaign.”

Depthfirst says it can help protect companies from many of these “AI-driven exploits,” and that it has already developed partnerships with a number of prominent companies, including AngelList, Lovable, and Moveworks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past year, security researchers have been urging the global shipping industry to shore up their cyber defenses after a spate of cargo thefts were linked to hackers. The researchers say they have seen elaborate hacks targeting logistics companies to hijack and redirect large amounts of their customers’ products into the hands of criminals, in what has become an alarming collusion between hackers and real-life organized crime gangs.

A delivery truck of stolen vapes here, a suspected lobster heist there.

One little-known and critical U.S. shipping tech company has spent the last few months patching its own systems following the discovery of a raft of simple vulnerabilities, which inadvertently left the doors to its shipping platform wide open to anyone on the internet.

The company is Bluspark Global, a New York-based firm whose shipping and supply chain platform, Bluvoyix, allows hundreds of big companies to transport their products and track their cargo as it travels across the globe. While Bluspark may not be a household name, the company helps to power a large slice of worldwide freight shipments, including retail giants, grocery stores, furniture makers, and more. The company’s software is also used by several other companies affiliated with Bluspark.

Bluspark told TechCrunch this week that its security issues are now resolved. The company fixed five flaws in its platform, including the use of plaintext passwords by employees and customers, and the ability to remotely access and interact with Bluvoyix’s shipping software. The flaws exposed access to all of the customer’s data, including their shipment records, dating back decades.

But for security researcher Eaton Zveare, who uncovered the vulnerabilities in Bluspark’s systems back in October, alerting the company to the security flaws took longer than the discovery of the bugs themselves — since Bluspark had no discernable way to contact it.

In a now-published blog post, Zveare said he submitted details of the five flaws in Bluspark’s platform to the Maritime Hacking Village, a non-profit that works to secure maritime space and, as with this case, helps researchers to notify companies working in the maritime industry of active security flaws.

Weeks later and following multiple emails, voicemails, and LinkedIn messages, the company had not responded to Zveare. All the while, the flaws could still be exploited by anyone on the internet.

As a last resort, Zveare contacted TechCrunch in an effort to get the issues flagged.

TechCrunch sent emails to Bluspark CEO Ken O’Brien and the company’s senior leadership alerting them to a security lapse, but did not receive a response. TechCrunch later emailed a Bluspark customer, a U.S. publicly traded retail company, to alert them of the upstream security lapse, but we also did not hear back.

On the third time TechCrunch emailed Bluspark’s CEO, we included a partial copy of his password to demonstrate the seriousness of the security lapse.

A couple of hours later, TechCrunch received a response — from a law firm representing Bluspark.

In his blog post, Zveare explained he initially discovered the vulnerabilities after visiting the website of a Bluspark customer.

Zveare wrote that the customer’s website had a contact form that allowed prospective customers to make inquiries. By viewing the web page source code with his browser’s built-in tools, Zveare noticed the form would send the customer’s message through Bluspark’s servers via its API. (An API allows two or more connected systems to communicate with each other over the internet; in this case, a website contact form and the Bluspark customer’s inbox.)

Since the email-sending code was embedded in the webpage itself, this meant it was possible for anyone to modify the code and abuse this form to send malicious emails, such as phishing lures, originating from a real Bluspark customer.

Zveare pasted the API’s web address into his browser, which loaded a page containing the API’s auto-generated documentation. This web page was a master list of all the actions that can be performed with the company’s API, such as requesting a list of users who have access to Bluspark’s platforms, as well as creating new user accounts.

The API documentation page also had a feature allowing anyone the ability to “test” the API by submitting commands to retrieve data from Bluspark’s servers as a logged-in user.

Zveare found that the API, despite the page claiming that it required authentication to use, did not need a password or any credentials to return sensitive information from Bluspark’s servers.

Using only the list of API commands, Zveare was able to retrieve reams of user account records of employees and customers who use Bluspark’s platform, entirely unauthenticated. This included usernames and passwords, which were visible in plaintext and not encrypted — including an account associated with the platform’s administrator.

With the admin’s username and password in hand, an attacker could have logged into this account and run amok. As a good-faith security researcher, Zveare could not use the credentials, as using someone else’s password without their permission is unlawful.

Since the API documentation listed a command that allowed anyone to create a new user with administrator access, Zveare went ahead and did just that, and got unrestricted access to its Bluvoyix supply chain platform. Zveare said the administrator’s level of access allowed the viewing of customer data as far back as 2007.

Zveare found that once logged in with this newly created user, each API request was wrapped in a user-specific token, which was meant to ensure the user was in fact allowed to access a portal page each time they clicked on a link. But the token was not necessary to complete the command, allowing Zveare to send requests without the token altogether, further confirming that the API was unauthenticated.

After establishing contact with Bluspark’s law firm, Zveare gave TechCrunch permission to share a copy of his vulnerability report with its representatives.

Days later, the law firm said Bluspark had remediated most of the flaws and was working to retain a third-party company for an independent assessment.

Zveare’s efforts to disclose the bugs highlight a common problem in the cybersecurity world. Companies oftentimes do not provide a way, such as a publicly listed email address, to alert them about security vulnerabilities. As such, this can make it challenging for security researchers to publicly reveal security flaws that remain active, out of concerns that disclosing details could put users’ data at risk.

Ming Lee, an attorney representing Bluspark, told TechCrunch on Tuesday the company is “confident in the steps taken to mitigate potential risk arising from the researcher’s findings,” but would not comment on specifics of the vulnerabilities or their fixes; say which third-party assessment company it retained, if any; or comment on its specific security practices.

When asked by TechCrunch, Bluspark would not say if it was able to ascertain if any of its customer shipments had been manipulated by someone maliciously exploiting the bugs. Lee said there was “no indication of customer impact or malicious activity attributable to the issues identified by the researcher.” Bluspark would not say what evidence it had to reach that conclusion.

Lee said Bluspark was planning to introduce a disclosure program, allowing outside security researchers to report bugs and flaws to the company, but that its discussions were still underway.

Bluspark CEO Ken O’Brien did not provide comment for this article.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/youtube-now-has-a-way-for-parents-to-block-kids-from-watching-shorts/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube and other social media platforms are ramping up their parental controls as the online safety of minors continues to be a hot topic internationally.

The Google-owned platform announced on Wednesday that it’s implementing additional parental controls, particularly around the amount of time their children and teens spend watching YouTube Shorts.

Parents will now be able to set a timer for how much time children’s connected accounts can spend watching Shorts — YouTube’s equivalent of TikToks or Instagram Reels — helping to limit the potential to waste time with mindless scrolling.

Parents can even block accounts from watching Shorts altogether — either permanently, or temporarily, like if a kid is supposed to be using YouTube to study for a test by watching educational content.

YouTube will also allow parents to set custom Bedtime and Take a Break reminders, which encourage users to stop watching videos. These features are also available for adults, who can opt to set their own limits and reminders.

For parents who also use YouTube, it can be challenging to move back and forth between an adult’s account and kid’s account — unless if you want your algorithm to be forever usurped by Bluey. In the coming weeks, YouTube says it will update the sign-up experience within the app to make it easier for parents and kids to toggle between their accounts with just a few taps… of course, that requires the parent or child to actually remember to make the switch.

These features build upon YouTube’s existing parental controls for teens, which include the ability to supervise a teen’s channel activity if they’re making content. This has become industry standard, as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook have similar controls.

Last year, YouTube also unveiled age-estimation technology to predict if an account belongs to a teen so that it can provide a more age-appropriate experience.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla is removing the option to pay a one-time fee for its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assistance software, CEO Elon Musk announced Wednesday. Going forward, the only way to access the feature will be through a monthly subscription.

The change represents a major break from how Tesla has sold access to the advanced driver assistance suite over the years. It’s also a decision that could have an impact on Tesla’s bottom line, Musk’s ability to unlock the full value of his $1 trillion pay package, and the company’s ever-swirling legal troubles. And it comes as many other global automakers are making progress on their own advanced driver assistance systems in hopes of competing with Tesla.

Tesla has sold access to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software suite — which still does not make a car completely autonomous, and requires human supervision — at various price points over the years. The upfront price peaked at $15,000 in 2022, though more recently the company has been charging customers $8,000.

Tesla started offering access to the software via a $199-per-month subscription in 2021, and it dropped that price to just $99-per-month in 2024. Musk often encouraged customers to pay the upfront price, though, as he claimed the cost of FSD would increase dramatically as Tesla added to its capabilities.

But on Wednesday, Musk wrote in a post on X that Tesla will stop selling FSD outright starting on February 14. He didn’t say whether Tesla plans to change the pricing structure for the subscription.

Musk also did not offer an explanation for the change, but there are a few possible reasons. Musk and other Tesla executives have spoken publicly about how the adoption rate is lower than they had hoped. In October 2025, chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said only 12% of all Tesla customers have paid for FSD. Shifting to a subscription-only model with a lower upfront cost could help boost those numbers, especially during a first quarter that is expected to be rough for Tesla.

Boosting subscriptions would also get Musk closer to fulfilling one of the key “product goals” required for him to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. The company has tasked him with, among other things, reaching “10 million active FSD subscriptions” (measured daily over a three-month period) before late 2035.

Moving to a subscription-only model could also be a legal hedge.

For a decade, Musk and Tesla promoted the idea that customers were buying cars that had all the hardware required to become autonomous vehicles, and that all the company needed to do was improve the software. But that was not true: Tesla has had to make a number of upgrades inside its vehicles in the years since, and Musk himself has said that a huge portion of existing owners (those with so-called “Hardware 3” vehicles) would likely need new hardware in their cars.

FSD was sold under this same promise. Customers who bought the software outright would eventually get a software update that would make their cars full autonomous. Tesla has still not fulfilled that promise.

Tesla currently faces all kinds of legal trouble related to these unmet promises. In December, a judge ruled that the company engaged in deceptive marketing around FSD (and its less-capable system, Autopilot) and ordered the California DMV (which brought the case) to suspend Tesla’s manufacturing and dealer licenses in the state for 30 days.

The DMV stayed the order and gave Tesla at least 60 days to comply by changing the names of those products, or ship software that delivers on the promise.

Tesla also faces a range of class action lawsuits over the claims it made about the future autonomous capabilities of its vehicles. By removing the option to buy FSD outright, the company could be capping any potential liabilities in those lawsuits should they proceed to trial.

Tesla’s FSD is still regarded as the most capable driver-assistance software on the market in the U.S. But the company’s success hasn’t stopped competitors from trying to develop their own systems. Rivian recently detailed its own efforts to release FSD-like driver assistance software, starting with a major geographic expansion to its hands-free driving feature. Ford and General Motors have their own hands-free systems. And the many rival automakers Tesla competes with in China have been developing their own solutions, with some even offering their driver assistance features as a standard option.

            <h2>China Isn’t Leaving Latin America</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/china-latin-america-venezuela-beijing/685603/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In early December, as U.S. forces prepared for a possible attack on Venezuela, a Chinese navy ship sailed near the American armada gathered in the Caribbean. The CNS Silk Road Ark, a massive vessel in China’s South Sea Fleet, didn’t pose much of a threat to the U.S. warships. But its appearance in the waters near Venezuela presented exactly the kind of split screen Beijing wanted the nations of Latin America to see.

On one side were the Americans, their ships loaded with missiles and aircraft that had already killed dozens of alleged drug smugglers in strikes on small boats. The U.S. arsenal would soon be used to storm Venezuela’s capital and capture its president, Nicolás Maduro. On the other was a floating military hospital on a mission to provide free medical care to thousands of people in the region and, along the way, to burnish China’s image as a better partner than the United States.

Cultivating that image has long been central to Xi Jinping’s strategy in Latin America, and the U.S. raid on Caracas may have made that job easier by allowing him to contrast Chinese investments with American intimidation. Since Xi took power, in 2013, China has dished out an impressive slate of business deals, aid packages, loans, and infrastructure projects across the Western Hemisphere. But the U.S. now wants to unravel that network of relationships, starting with Venezuela.

“We will deny non-Hemispheric competitors the ability to position forces or other threatening capabilities, or to own or control strategically vital assets, in our Hemisphere,” the U.S. declared in its new National Security Strategy in early December.

The problem with that plan is that China’s influence campaign across the region has been methodical, well financed, and persistent. Whereas Donald Trump wants to achieve quick victories through tariffs, missiles, and commando raids, China has positioned itself as the obstinate alternative—a predictable overlord that can enrich local elites in exchange for their fealty to Beijing.

China is already the largest trading partner of Brazil, Peru, and Chile. After China made investments in Panama, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic, all three countries agreed to cut their diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rogue province. Last spring, Xi unveiled a three-year plan to improve cooperation with 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, offering a line of credit to them worth $9 billion.

Even the National Security Strategy concedes that, in the Western Hemisphere, “some foreign influence will be hard to reverse.”

Apart from its soft-power flexes, China has become a leading arms supplier to the region while establishing footholds for its military, such as the Espacio Lejano Space Station, an advanced radar system China operates in the Patagonian desert under a 50-year lease from the government of Argentina.

In its most pointed response to the National Security Strategy, the Chinese military conducted a series of war games last month to simulate a clash in Latin America. The exercises were not unusual; military planners run all kinds of simulations all the time. What stood out about these drills was the way they were publicized on state-run media for the world to see.

Evan Ellis, a professor at the U.S. Army War College, had never known China to demonstrate its presence in the region so overtly in the 25 years he has spent studying it. The report aired on an affiliate of China Central Television and featured maps of the Western Hemisphere, with dots marking the places where the Chinese own or control “dual use” facilities, such as ports and other infrastructure projects, which could serve as bridgeheads for China’s military in the event of a war.

The maps illustrated just how difficult it would be for the U.S. to evict the Chinese from the region. “I think the message was designed to be subtle, low-key,” Ellis wrote me in an email when I asked how he interprets the Chinese war games. Despite the American push to dominate Latin America, “China diplomatically, but confidently, is continuing its engagement there. And if it has interests in challenging the US there in time of war, it will do so.”

Among the clearest statements of China’s intent in the Western Hemisphere came in the fall of 2024, when Xi traveled to Peru to inaugurate the Chancay Port, the largest deepwater facility on the western coast of South America. Controlled and operated by a state-run Chinese firm, the project promised to reinforce the region’s dependence on trade with China by halving the time it takes Chinese container ships to reach the shores of Latin America and the Caribbean.

“We are now an interdependent community with common interests and a shared future,” Xi told a summit in Lima that November, less than two weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential race. In an apparent reference to the trade war Trump promised, Xi added that “the world is in a new period of turbulence and transformation,” one in which “unbridled unilateralism” threatens to reverse the process of integration that China and its partners had been pursuing for decades. “The grave challenge for us is like sailing up a river,” he said. “We either forge ahead or drift downstream.”

Xi has tried to make that choice as easy as possible for governments across Latin America and the Caribbean. Chinese firms have invested more than $200 billion there since the turn of the century, according to a study conducted in 2024. The Chinese Communist Party often demands political loyalty in return for its largesse, especially in insisting that potential  partners break off relations with Taiwan.

The port in Chancay, financed with a loan from Chinese banks worth nearly $1 billion, raised particular alarm among U.S. military planners. While it was under construction, in 2024, General Laura Richardson, the head of the U.S. Southern Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the facility could provide China’s military with “multi-domain access” in the event of a war. Through such projects, Richardson added, China “is playing the ‘long game’ with its development of dual-use sites and facilities throughout the region.”

With the strike on Venezuela, Trump sought to warn the Chinese away from that strategy. He has bragged that no other military could move with such strength, speed, and precision as the U.S. demonstrated in Caracas—and that America’s display of military power would deter China and others from crossing the United States, according to people close to him. But squeezing China out of Latin America will take far more than a single show of force, no matter how impressive.

At another congressional hearing on the subject last spring, Ellis cataloged the dizzying range of projects that have cemented China’s position. These include dozens of so-called Confucius Institutes, where the recruitment of students to study in China has been flagged by the FBI as a potential tool of Chinese propaganda. It also includes “luxurious paid trips to China for thousands of journalists, academics, political party elites, and even judges, military personnel and police officers,” Ellis testified.

The list reminded me of the tools the U.S. used during the Cold War in many regions of the world. These methods were expensive, laborious, and, over the long term, incredibly effective. They used various means of American influence, including espionage, diplomacy, education and the arts, to win the grand contest for international supremacy against the Soviet Union.

Although it took a few decades, the United States eventually succeeded, not only in causing its rival to collapse but in securing the preeminence of American finance, culture, and technology around the world. The defining paradox of Trump’s confrontation with China is that, since returning to the White House a year ago, he has worked to dismantle many of the same institutions the U.S. used to advance its cause in the 20th century.

He has shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development, moved to defund Voice of America, imposed new visa restrictions on foreign students and academics, and withdrawn from multilateral agreements and organizations. Last week, the White House recalled more than two dozen U.S. ambassadors in the biggest purge of the diplomatic ranks in the history of the foreign service.

China, by contrast, has spent decades replicating the Cold War strategies of American soft power and turning them against the United States. In his campaign to counter these efforts, Trump has reached for hard power, and it might work, at least in the short term. In Venezuela, the Chinese will now need Trump’s blessing to continue their purchases of oil, and they stand little chance of recovering the balance of their loans to Caracas, estimated at about $10 billion.

The countries most reliant on trade with the U.S., such as Mexico, have mostly fallen in line behind Trump’s push to dominate the region. Though she condemned the operation to seize Maduro and bring him to New York for trial, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum also imposed steep tariffs on a long list of Chinese goods last year.

But the methods Trump has used to win compliance with his vision for Latin America have also created opportunities for China, whose response to the capture of Maduro betrays a confidence that should worry the White House. Beijing has pledged to continue courting allies in the region, investing in infrastructure and serving as a counterweight to U.S. influence. The National Security Strategy acknowledges: “The choice all countries should face is whether they want to live in an American-led world of sovereign countries and free economies or in a parallel one in which they are influenced by countries on the other side of the world.”

That may not be such an obvious choice for the countries forced to make it. Trump’s plan to dominate the Western Hemisphere has not made the countries in this region feel any freer or more sovereign. His attempt to win their loyalty against China relies on coercion and force rather than more traditional American appeals to the values of liberty and self-determination. Some governments will feel compelled to play along. Others will weigh their options and find China to be the more reliable partner.

Would China use its military to defend its investments in the Western Hemisphere? Probably not. The People’s Liberation Army does not have the means to win a major war so far from its shores. Xi will instead continue to paint himself as the more responsible force in regional affairs. In that sense, the contest Trump started with China in Latin America will pit hard power against soft power, and Beijing has wagered that, in the long run, it will wield more influence by sending hospital ships, not gunboats, to project its power around the world. The history of the Cold War suggests China might be right.

            <h2>A Different Type of ‘Muscle Memory’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Before Adam Sharples became a molecular physiologist studying muscle memory, he played professional rugby. Over his years as an athlete, he noticed that he and his teammates seemed to return to form after the offseason, or even from an injury, faster than expected. Rebuilding muscle mass and strength came easy: It was as if their muscles remembered what to do.

In 2018, Sharples and his research lab, now at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo, were the first to show that exercise could change how our muscle-building genes work over the long term. The genes themselves don’t change, but repeated periods of exertion turns certain genes on, spurring cells to build muscle mass more quickly than before. These epigenetic changes have a lasting effect: Your muscles remember these periods of strength and respond favorably in the future.

Intuitively, this makes sense. Past exercise primes your muscles to respond more robustly to more exercise. Over the past few years, Sharples’s lab has found that muscles have additional molecular mechanisms for remembering exercise; he and other scientists have been building on this research, too, confirming epigenetic muscle memory in young and aged human muscle, after different modes of training, as well as in mice. Now 40 years old, Sharples is still thinking about how our muscles remember but has lately been investigating the inverse trajectory: Do muscles have a similar memory for weakness?

The answer appears to be yes. “Our new data shows that muscle does not just remember growth—it also remembers wasting,” Sharples told me, of a study published in preprint on bioRxiv and currently in peer review for Advanced Science. “The more encounters you have with injury and illness, the more susceptible your muscle is to further atrophy. And, well—that’s what aging is, isn’t it?”

The Norwegian government’s research council has been funding Sharples’s research and has a vested interest in the lab’s discoveries. In the next decade, Norway is expected to become a “super-aged society,” in which more than one in five people are age 65 or older. Japan and Germany have already crossed this threshold, and the United States is expected to reach it by 2030. Age-related muscle weakness is a major factor in falling risk; falling is a leading cause worldwide of injury and death in people 65 and older. Better understanding how muscles remember and react to their weakest moments is a crucial step toward knowing what to do about it.

As part of the new study, Sharples’s team studied repeated periods of atrophy in young human muscle, using a knee brace and crutches to immobilize participants’ legs for two weeks at a time. This level of disuse, Sharples said, is comparable to real-world situations in which muscle rapidly loses size and function—limb immobilization after fractures or other injuries, periods of hospitalization or bed rest, reduced weight-bearing during recovery. A couple of years ago, I went to observe this research for my book On Muscle; one study participant, an avid skier and cyclist, told me he was shocked by how significantly the muscles in his leg deteriorated after just a couple of weeks of immobilization. The team also ran a concurrent study in aged rat muscle, in collaboration with Liverpool John Moores University; in both studies, repeated periods of disuse led to epigenetic changes—shifts in the way genes were expressed.

These changes affected the core functions of muscle cells, hampering the genes in mitochondria—the powerhouses of the cell, which generate the energy required to contract and relax muscle fibers. Letting muscles weaken suppressed genes involved in mitochondrial function and energy production in particular, including genes that are essential for muscle endurance and recovery. The researchers also found that a key marker of mitochondrial abundance dropped more drastically after repeated atrophy than after the first episode, indicating that repeated disuse makes muscle more vulnerable. In other words, the evidence suggests that every time you fall down the hole, it becomes more difficult to climb back out.

Similar changes occurred in both the young human muscle and the aged rat muscle. But the young muscle could adapt and recover. After repeated atrophy, it showed a less exaggerated gene-expression response than the aged muscle did. “There seems to be some resilience and protection with young muscle the second time around,” Sharples said. He likened this to an immune-system response: Young muscle responds better to atrophy the second time because it has encountered it before and knows how to bounce back. By contrast, aged muscle becomes more sensitive after repeated atrophy, showing a worsened response with the second episode.

How long our muscles hold on to any of these memories is still up for debate. “Because of our study periods, we do know with some certainty that epigenetic memories can last at least three to four months, and that protein changes can also be retained,” Sharples said. “How long after that is difficult to say. But we know from our studies of cancer patients that epigenetic changes in muscle were retained even 10 years out from cancer survival.”

This was startling to hear. If an adverse health event is dramatic enough, like cancer, our muscles can carry the effects of that for a decade or more. More typically, though, inactivity, aging, and repeated episodes of disuse may gradually shift the system toward a state in which weakness becomes more entrenched and recovery slower.

Understanding what drives muscle to remember being in stress situations—either beneficial, like exercise, or damaging, like illness—could help us better judge what to do about this, says Kevin Murach, an associate professor at the University of Arkansas who studies aging and skeletal muscle and who was not involved in the new study. Knowing the mechanisms that drive beneficial changes at the molecular level could help develop drugs with similar effects. On the other end of the spectrum, if illness and immobilization have long-term negative effects, Murach told me, the next question to answer is: “Can we use exercise to offset that?”

Both Murach and Sharples said the data are getting only more robust that strength training, paired with endurance or high-intensity interval training, is the best therapy to protect against age-related loss of muscle and function. “Perhaps the key takeaway is that at any point along this continuum, new exercise or loading stimuli can still shift the balance back towards growth and health,” Sharples said. “I don’t think there is a point at which muscle can’t respond at all—it simply becomes less efficient when repeatedly weakened or when older.”

Identifying genes associated with muscle growth, as well as pharmaceutical targets, could mean that drugs or gene therapy may eventually be able to assist with boosting muscle response for people who cannot exercise. Murach and Sharples cautioned, though, that stimulating muscle-cell growth can have unintended consequences, in part because growth pathways are common across cell types—including cancer cells.

What the new work does show is that our muscle mass is not a blank slate. “What we’re finding suggests that our muscles may carry a history of both strength and weakness,” Sharples said. It’s shaped by factors including age, baseline muscle health, previous atrophy events, and previous exercise training. “And that history shapes how our muscles respond in the future.” I came away from our conversation thinking about the battle between positive muscle memory for strength and negative muscle memory for atrophy as a kind of tug-of-war: The two are constantly in tension, but the more experiences you have of one or the other, the more it pulls you into its embrace.</div>

            <h2>He Was Homeschooled for Years, and Fell So Far Behind</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2026/01/homeschooled-book-regulations/685589/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the early 1990s, when Stefan Merrill Block was in fourth grade, he began complaining to his mom about his new school, with its pointless rules and mean teachers. He, his parents, and his brother had recently moved to the Dallas suburb of Plano from Indianapolis, and Block, a perceptive and sensitive child, could tell that his mother was unhappy in their new home, too. Together, they made a “lovely picnic” of their anger, as he describes it in his new memoir, Homeschooled. His mother pulled him out of the classroom and into a life of shapeless days, setting Block on a strange, yearslong journey as her only pupil, only friend, and at times, it seems, only hope.

Block’s memoir is timely; homeschooling has grown rapidly in recent years. Although people regarded Block as an oddity in his youth—“The boy should be in school!” his visiting grandma exclaimed at one point—now more than 3 percent of school-age kids in the United States, or about 2 million children, are homeschooled.

Under his mother’s warped version of homeschooling, Block was largely left to pursue his own “interests,” which included reading novels, drawing comics, and watching Oprah. In Block’s telling, his father, a busy psychologist, mostly turned a blind eye to these aimless afternoons. As days of unstructured exploration stretched out before him, Block writes, he realized that “the longer I stay here, the further I will fall behind, and the harder it will be ever to go back.”

Read: Educated is a brutal, one-of-a-kind memoir

He was right to be concerned. When Block finally returned to school for ninth grade, he earned grades in the C to F range. He recalls thinking that “the Civil War was thus named because, despite all the bloodshed, Americans exhibited remarkably good etiquette.” It took him cutting down to four or five hours of sleep a night and going, as he puts it, “sporadically psychotic” to catch up on his studies.

Block’s experience sounds extreme and readers of the book may wonder how this was allowed to happen to him. In the years that Block was homeschooled, why was he never assessed, or even checked on? The answer is that homeschooling was wildly under-regulated when Block was a boy—a situation that has not changed much since then. About half of states, Texas among them, do not require homeschoolers to be evaluated, and not all states require an intervention if a student is found to be failing, according to Jonah Stewart, the director of programs at the Coalition for Responsible Home Education (CRHE), which advocates for stricter homeschooling regulations. In some of the states with testing mandates, parents can circumvent the rule by registering with an “umbrella school,” many of which offer real support for homeschoolers, and others of which exist largely as shells to help parents evade requirements. Or students can take their exams at home—which raises the question of how reliable the scores are. Only two states, New York and Pennsylvania, require the homeschooler to take a test with a qualified proctor, Stewart told me. Tess Ulrey, CRHE’s executive director, told me, “For a lot of homeschooled students, the first time they’re going to take a standardized test is maybe the SAT, the ACT.”

Because not every homeschool student takes reliable tests, knowing how well they are doing academically is difficult. Some research, much of it conducted by homeschooling advocates, has found that homeschool students tend to perform well. But other homeschooling researchers have argued that these studies mask substantial variation in the quality of homeschooling because they don’t rely on representative samples.

And some research provides cause for concern: One series of large surveys found that homeschoolers earned worse SAT scores and ended up in lower-paying jobs than traditionally schooled kids. When controlling for demographics, one study found that homeschoolers were two to three times more likely to be behind their expected grade level than their traditionally schooled peers. A 2020 review of many studies found that homeschoolers generally excel in reading but lag in math, perhaps because, as some researchers theorize, homeschooling families tend to emphasize reading over math. For the student population at large, the average SAT math score is also lower than the average reading score, though only slightly.

Beyond the academic considerations, under-regulated homeschooling can also make some kids vulnerable to abuse. Though most homeschool parents are responsible and well-intentioned, some child-abuse experts say that a small percentage mistreat their children. Multiple stories of children who were abused in supposed homeschooling environments have surfaced in recent years. (Some of the parents have pleaded not guilty.) A 2014 paper examining the cases of 28 severely abused children from various states found that eight of the 17 school-age victims had been withdrawn from traditional school for homeschooling. A report from Connecticut found that from 2013 to 2016, 36 percent of families in the state who began homeschooling had been the subject of at least one prior abuse or neglect report. Nationally, the CRHE has documented nearly 200 deaths of homeschooled kids from abuse or neglect since 2000. Although traditionally schooled kids are also abused and neglected, they at least regularly see adults outside their immediate family, which opens up the possibility of their reaching out for help. With homeschoolers, however, a lack of contact between families and the authorities can cause abuse to go unnoticed: About a dozen states do not require parents to notify the state that they are homeschooling their children, according to Stewart.

Robert Kunzman, an education professor at Indiana University Bloomington who has studied homeschooling, recommends three regulatory reforms that he believes would limit much of the abuse and educational neglect within homeschooling while preserving parents’ rights to educate their own children: Parents should notify the state that they are homeschooling, adults convicted of child abuse should not be allowed to homeschool, and homeschooled children should take an annual basic-skills test.

The Home School Legal Defense Association, a prominent pro-homeschooling advocacy group, opposes these ideas. The group’s president, Jim Mason, told me that “parents who homeschool are fully subject to the same criminal, child-protection, and neglect laws as every other parent.” He pointed to a study in the Journal of School Choice, co-authored by a researcher whose organization has received support from homeschooling groups, that found “a lack of evidence for disproportionately associating homeschooling with child abuse and neglect.”

The association and other groups like it have significant political power and tend to rally to defeat state bills that would require inspections or other forms of oversight. Even high-profile reports of abused homeschooled children rarely result in stronger regulations. In 2018, after news broke that the California couple David and Louise Turpin had imprisoned and tortured their 13 “homeschooled” children for decades, California Assemblymember Jose Medina introduced legislation that would have directed the fire marshal to inspect all homeschools in the state. After an outcry from hundreds of homeschool parents, the bill died in committee. The story is much the same in Texas: The Texas Home School Coalition employs lobbyists it calls “watchmen,” after a Bible verse that says, “I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night.” With the coalition’s backing, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed three new bills supporting homeschool rights just this past summer.

As for Block: Despite his challenging childhood, he has built an impressive life for himself. He graduated from a top-tier college and now has a family, has written several books, and co-owns a skating rink. Still, in his author’s note, Block writes that although he does not oppose homeschooling in general, he does think that “the lack of proper homeschooling oversight has become a crisis.”

In a time of school shootings, classroom bullying, culture wars over curricula, and faltering test scores, the impulse of some parents to take over their child’s education is understandable. But as Block’s story illustrates, allowing parents to isolate their kids at home with little accountability can be incredibly harmful. If homeschool parents are so certain that they are giving their kids a good education in a safe environment, they could reasonably be expected to show it.

            <h2>MAGA Thinks Maduro Will Prove Trump Won in 2020</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/maduro-venezuela-conspiracy-theory/685599/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the days after American commandos raided Nicolás Maduro’s compound and whisked him out of Venezuela, Mike Lindell wasn’t ruminating about the dramatic military operation or oil prices—he was reviving a long-dead conspiracy theory.

Lindell, better known as the “MyPillow guy,” was celebrating because, in his telling, a possible witness to the theory that Venezuela conspired with election-equipment companies to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump was now in U.S. custody. “I’m hoping now that Maduro will actually come clean and tell us everything about the machines and how they steal the elections,” Lindell, who has long espoused election falsehoods, told me the day after the Venezuelan dictator’s arraignment.

The supposition boils down to this: Venezuela plotted with election-equipment and -technology companies to engineer Trump’s defeat in 2020. There is no credible evidence to support this. But with Maduro in U.S. custody months before the midterms and the Trump administration investigating the 2020 election, an idea that had been disproved by facts and debunked in lawsuits has been revived, with a newsy twist: Now Maduro will prove from a New York jail that Trump defeated Joe Biden.

Since Maduro’s capture, Trump has shared a raft of discredited election-fraud claims on his Truth Social site, including one tied to a company central to the Venezuela conspiracy. A top Justice Department official helped harden the narrative: Ed Martin, the United States pardon attorney (who also directs the Justice Department’s Weaponization Working Group, which pursues retribution against Trump’s perceived political enemies), promoted the idea that Maduro could offer crucial information to substantiate the stolen-election theory once and for all. Martin reposted on X a claim that Maduro could try “to plead to lesser charges by proffering evidence that the 2020 election was stolen,” adding “!”

The right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, an extremely online Trump-administration ally, claimed that Maduro “is in possession” of evidence against election-equipment companies. “Maduro might be Trump’s final revenge for the election theft of 2020,” Johnson told his audience. “If he begins to sing like a canary—which he will; they always do—then who will he give up?” Johnson added: “This is why they took him alive.”

The conspiracy theory traces back to the days after the 2020 election. Trump allies, including his lawyers at the time Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, claimed that Trump had been denied a win because two voting-equipment companies, Dominion Voting Systems (which was sold last year and is operating under the name Liberty Vote) and Smartmatic, had flipped votes for Biden. The systems and software, Powell said at the time, were “created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Chávez to make sure he never lost an election.”

Powell and Giuliani settled lawsuits with Dominion over election falsehoods. (The settlement details are confidential.) Smartmatic has reached legal settlements with right-leaning media outlets over false statements about the company. One of them, Newsmax, wrote on its website last year that “it has no evidence that Smartmatic machines or software altered the votes in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.” It continued: “Smartmatic is a U.S. company not owned by the Venezuelan government, or any foreign official or entity.”

Smartmatic also won a defamation case last year against Lindell. That hasn’t stopped him from reviving claims of a stolen election after Maduro’s apprehension. Lindell told me last week that he had turned “a book” that he compiled about the 2020 election (Lindell also told me he’s “sure” it includes versions of the theory that Venezuela helped steal it) over to federal officials. He would not say who, specifically, but said he hoped that the Justice Department and other federal authorities were investigating. Lindell predicted that he, Powell (who could not be reached for comment), and many others would be vindicated. “I’m hoping now that Maduro will actually come clean,” he told me, “and tell all about the machines and how they steal the elections.”

The Venezuelan-voting-machine conspiracy theory has returned as the Trump administration is using the government to investigate a valid election whose outcome the president didn’t like. (Trump apparently harbors regrets for not doing more to overturn the results, telling The New York Times that “I should have” had the National Guard seize voting machines in 2020.) The Guardian reported in November that federal investigators were interviewing people who were claiming that Venezuela had helped rob Trump of a win. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said during a Cabinet meeting last April that investigators had “evidence of how these electronic voting systems have been vulnerable to hackers for a very long time.” At an August Cabinet meeting, Trump asked Gabbard if she had found information tied to “how corrupt the 2020 election was. When will that all come out?” Gabbard responded that she would brief Trump once she had all of the information, adding, “We are finding documents literally tucked away in the back of safes and random offices.”

The administration has also been attempting to access local voting equipment. A Department of Homeland Security official, with the help of a political operative, unsuccessfully sought access last year to vote-counting machines in Colorado, but county clerks rebuffed the requests to examine the tightly controlled equipment. Two GOP clerks in Missouri also rejected requests from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to examine their machines. And Kurt Olsen, a lawyer who challenged Trump’s 2020 loss in court, was tapped last fall to probe that election as a special government employee, The Wall Street Journal reported. Olsen has told people he wants, among other things, to examine equipment used during the 2020 election, according to the Journal. (Olsen didn’t respond to the Journal’s request for comment or one I left with him.)

The White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told me that Trump wants to ensure the U.S. has safe and secure elections and that he has long said Maduro “was an illegitimate, narco-terrorist.” In response to Trump’s election-related executive order last March (titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections”), she said the Department of Homeland Security is preparing a report on the cybersecurity of election systems and “will deliver that report shortly.&quot; (The Department of Justice, Liberty Vote, and Smartmatic did not return my requests for comment.)

Election administrators around the country who have been abused and harassed for the past six years are keeping a wary eye on the resurgence of the conspiracy theories. In Colorado, a county-clerks association is drafting an FAQ to help election officials navigate questions they may get from constituents about voting machines and Venezuela. In Arizona, election officials are worried enough to ensure that a cybersecurity analyst is monitoring the online chatter. If it escalates, officials could push back publicly against the falsehoods. In Utah, Salt Lake County Clerk Lannie Chapman told me she’s tracking the misinformation and is prepared to weigh in, if needed: “It’s a full-time job trying to explain this, let alone successfully administering elections.”

Every time those in power amplify inaccurate information about elections, election clerks and experts tell me, they risk deepening doubt in the democratic process. Even without getting states to change the ways that people vote, experts worry that a selective release of findings or evidence tied to the Venezuela claims could be used by the Trump administration to justify some sort of government action.

“It’s almost like an RFP for conspiracy theories,” Alexandra Chandler, a former Department of Defense intelligence analyst who now works as the director of the nonprofit Protect Democracy’s election team, told me.

Under the Constitution, states are responsible for running elections. But Trump has used the power of the federal government to rejuvenate debunked claims and set the stage for another battle over the validity of future elections if he dislikes the results. He’s staffed his administration with people who have sown doubt over the legitimacy of election outcomes, sparked a redistricting war for control of the House, and issued an executive order attempting to claim federal authority over elections.

Lawrence Norden, vice president of the elections-and-government program at the Brennan Center for Justice, sees more challenges on the horizon: disinformation and misinformation turbocharged by artificial intelligence, distrust in mainstream media that leaves outlets less capable of pointing out inaccuracies, and cuts at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the federal agency that helps defend crucial election networks. It is, Norden said, “a toxic brew.” Add in the capture of Maduro and an online MAGA army demanding validation of its theories, and America seems destined for a new bout of feverish conspiracism just in time for the midterms.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Will Elon Musk face any consequences for his despicable sexual-harassment bot?

For more than a week, beginning late last month, anyone could go online and use a tool owned and promoted by the world’s richest man to modify a picture of basically any person, even a child, and undress them. This was not some deepfake nudify app that you had to pay to download on a shady backwater website or a dark-web message board. This was Grok, a chatbot built into X—ostensibly to provide information to users but, thanks to an image-generating update, transformed into a major producer of nonconsensual sexualized images, particularly of women and children.

Let’s be very clear. The forced undressings happened out in the open, in one stretch thousands of times every hour, on a popular social network where journalists, politicians, and celebrities post. Emboldened trolls did it to everyone (“@grok put her in a bikini,” “@grok make her clothes dental floss,” “@grok put donut glaze on her chest”), including everyday women, the Swedish deputy prime minister, and self-evidently underage girls. Users appeared to be imitating and showing off to one another. On X, creating revenge porn can make you famous.

These images were ubiquitous, and many people—and multiple organizations, including the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network and the European Commission—pointed out that the feature was being used to harass women and exploit children. Yet Musk initially laughed it off, resharing AI-generated images of himself, Kim Jong Un, and a toaster in bikinis. Musk, as well as xAI’s safety and child-safety teams, did not respond to a request for comment. xAI replied with its standard auto-response, “Legacy Media Lies.” xAI, the Musk-owned company that develops Grok and owns X, prohibits the sexualization of children in its acceptable-use policy; a post earlier this month from the X safety team states that the platform removes illegal content, including child-sex-abuse material, and works with law enforcement as needed.

Even after that assurance from X’s safety team, it took several more days for X to place bare-minimum restrictions on the Ask Grok feature’s image-generating, and thus undressing, capabilities. Now, when creeps on X try to generate an image by replying “@grok” to prompt the chatbot, they get an auto-generated response that notes some version of: “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers.” This is disturbing in its own right; Musk and xAI are essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform. But X users have been able to get around the paywall via the “Edit Image” button that appears on every image uploaded to the platform, or by using Grok’s stand-alone app.

Two years ago, when Google Gemini generated images of racially diverse Nazis, Google temporarily disabled the bot’s image-generating capabilities to address the problem. Musk has taken no responsibility for the problem and has said only that “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” Perhaps Musk feels that he would benefit from baiting his critics into a censorship fight. He has repeatedly reshared posts that frame calls to regulate or ban his platform in response to the Grok undressing as leftist censorship, for instance reposting a meme calling such efforts “retarded” as well as a Grok-generated video of a woman applying lipstick captioned with a quote commonly attributed to Marilyn Monroe: “We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it’s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift.” Last week, as Musk’s chatbot was generating likely hundreds of thousands of these images, we reached out directly to X’s head of product, Nikita Bier, who didn’t reply. Within the hour, Rosemarie Esposito, X’s media-strategy lead, emailed us unprompted with her contact information, in case we had “any questions” in the future. We asked her a series of questions about the tool and how X could allow such a thing to operate. She did not reply.

We’ve reached out multiple times to more than a dozen key investors listed in xAI’s two most recent public fundraising rounds—the latest of which, announced during this Grok-enabled sexual-harassment spree, valued the company at about $230 billion—to ask if they endorsed the use of X and Grok to generate and distribute nonconsensual sexualized images. These investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Management & Research Company, the Saudi firm Kingdom Holding Company, and the state-owned investment firms of Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. We asked whether they would continue partnering with xAI absent the company changing its products and, if yes, why they felt justified in continuing to invest in a company that has enabled the public sexual harassment of women and exploitation of children on the internet. BlackRock, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and Baron Capital declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley initially told us that she could find no documentation that the company is a major investor in xAI. After we sent a public announcement from xAI that lists Morgan Stanley as a key investor in its Series C fundraising round, the spokesperson did not answer our questions. The other companies did not respond.

We also reached out to several companies that provide the infrastructure for X and Grok—in other words, that allow these products to exist on the internet: Google and Apple, which offer both X and Grok on their app stores; Microsoft and Oracle, which run Grok on their cloud services; and Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which sell xAI the computer chips needed to train and run Grok. We asked if they endorsed the use of these products to create nonconsensual sexual images of women and children, and whether they would take steps to prevent this from continuing. None responded except for Microsoft, which told us that it does not provide cloud services, chips, or hosting services for xAI other than offering the Grok language model—without image generation—on its enterprise platform, Microsoft Foundry.

As all of this unfolded, xAI made several major announcements: new Grok products for businesses; upgraded video-generating capabilities; that enormous fundraising round. Yesterday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited SpaceX’s headquarters in Texas and joined Musk for a press conference in which Hegseth said, “I want to thank you, Elon, and your incredible team” for bringing Grok to the military. (Later this year, Grok will join Google Gemini on a new Pentagon platform called GenAI.mil that the Defense Department says will offer advanced AI tools to military and civilian personnel.) We asked the DOD if it endorsed xAI’s sexualized material or if it would reconsider its partnership with the company in response. In a statement, a Pentagon official told us only that the department’s policy on the use of AI “fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations” and that “any unlawful activity” by its personnel “will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.”

Government bodies in the United Kingdom, India, and the European Union have said that they will investigate X, while Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Grok, but Musk appears to be unfazed by these efforts—and also seems to be receiving help in brushing them off. Sarah B. Rogers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, has said that, should the U.K. ban X, America “has a full range of tools that we can use to facilitate uncensored internet access in authoritarian, closed societies.”

At the moment, Musk seems to be not only getting away with this but also reveling in it. Although governments appear to be furious at Musk, they also seem impotent. Senator Ted Cruz, a co-sponsor of the TAKE IT DOWN Act—which establishes criminal penalties for the sharing of nonconsensual intimate images, real or AI-generated, on social media—wrote on X last Wednesday that the Grok-generated images “are unacceptable and a clear violation of” the law but that he was “encouraged that X has announced that they’re taking these violations seriously.” Throughout that same day, Grok continued to comply with user requests to undress people. Yesterday, Cruz posted on X a photo of himself with his arm around Musk and the caption “Always great seeing this guy 🚀.”

And it’s already beginning to feel as if the scandal—the world’s richest man enabling the widespread harassment of women and children—is waning, crowded out by a new year of relentless news cycles. But this is a line-in-the-sand moment for the internet. Grok’s ability to undress minors is not, as Musk might have you think, an exercise in free-speech maximalism. It is, however, a speech issue: By turning sexual harassment and revenge porn into a meme with viral distribution, the platform is allowing its worst, most vindictive users to silence and intimidate anyone they desire. The retaliation on X has been obvious—women who’ve stood up in opposition to the tool have been met with anonymous trolls asking Grok to put them in a bikini.

Social platforms have long leaned on the argument that they aren’t subject to the same defamation laws as publishers and media companies. But this latest debacle, Musk’s reaction, and the silence from so many of X’s investors and peer companies were all active choices—and symptoms of a broader crisis of impunity that’s begun to seep into American culture. They were the result of politicians, despots, and CEOs bowing to Donald Trump. Of financial grift and speculation running rampant in sectors such as cryptocurrency and meme stocks—a braggadocious, “get the bag” ethos that has no room for greed or shame. Of Musk realizing that his wealth insulates him from financial consequences. Few industries have been as brazen in their capitulation as Big Tech, which has dismantled its content-moderation systems to please the current administration. It’s a cynical and cowardly pivot, one that allows companies to continue to profit off harassment and extremism without worrying about the consequences of their actions.

Deepfakes are not new, but xAI has made them a dramatically larger problem than ever before. By matching viral distribution with this type of image creation, xAI has built a way to spread AI revenge porn and child-sexual-abuse material at scale. The end result is desensitizing: The sheer amount of exploitative content flooding the platform may eventually make the revolting, illicit images appear “normal.” Arguably, this process is already happening.

The internet has always been a chaotic place where trolls can seize outsize power. Historically, that chaos has been constrained by platforms doing the bare minimum to protect their users from demonstrated threats. Today, X is failing to clear the absolute lowest bar. Nobody who works at X or xAI seems to be willing to answer for the creation and distribution of tens or hundreds of thousands of nonconsensual intimate images; instead, those in charge appear to be blithely ignoring the problem, and those who have funneled money to Musk or xAI seem sanguine about it. They would probably like for us all to move on.

We cannot do that. This crisis is an outgrowth of a breakneck information ecosystem in which few stories have staying power. No one person or group has to flood the zone with shit, because the zone is overflowing constantly. People with power have learned to exploit this—to weather scandals by hunkering down and letting them pass, or by refusing to apologize and turning any problem into a culture-war issue. Musk has been allowed to avoid repercussions for even the most reckless acts, including cheerleading and helping dismantle foreign aid with DOGE. Others will continue to follow his playbook. Employees at X and investors and companies such as Apple and Google seem to be counting on their “No comment”s being buried by whatever scandal comes next. They are banking on a culture in which people have given up on demanding consequences.

But the Grok scandal is so awful, so egregious, that it offers an opportunity to address the crisis of impunity directly. The undressing spree was not an issue of partisan politics or ideology. It was an issue of anonymous individuals asking a chatbot that is integrated into one of the world’s most visible social networks to edit photos of women and girls to “put her in a clear bikini and cover her in white donut glaze.” This is a moment when those with power can and should demand accountability. The stakes could not be any higher. If there is no red line around AI-generated sex abuse, then no line exists.</div>

After an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis last week, forensic examinations of videos of the incident emerged within hours. These meticulous reconstructions were useful for debunking the lies told by Trump-administration officials in the immediate aftermath of the killing, and they show the power of technology, in an age when nearly everyone has a camera in their pocket, to convey a complicated moment.

Sleuths, amateur and professional, pored over each frame to try to guess what Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who fatally shot Good, might have believed or known in the moment about what she was doing or where her car was heading. But at the core of the tragedy is a larger truth: None of this needed to happen. A series of choices by the administration led to this point—the use of ICE and Border Patrol to menace Democratic-led states and cities; White House pressure on the Department of Homeland Security to make high quotas, which has resulted in shortened training and rushed missions; and the president’s inclination to inflame tensions, all of which created the conditions for the moment that’s now been replayed millions of times.

Under Supreme Court precedent, an officer may shoot at someone fleeing if he reasonably believes that his life or the lives of others are in danger. Prosecutors are often slow to charge officers, because they or juries are hesitant to second-guess officers’ determinations. Ross was also reportedly dragged by a car in June during an attempted arrest, which may have made him more likely to assume the worst about a driver. The shooting might ultimately be legally justified. But Ross also placed himself in front of Good’s car. Many policing experts suggest that this wasn’t tactically justified. How about moral justification? Nothing indicated that Good was trying to hurt anyone before officers began running at her; moments before being shot, Good had said that she wasn’t mad at Ross. In the videos, after Ross fires, a man is heard saying, “Fucking bitch.” With the information we have, a moral defense for the killing is nowhere to be found.

There was no need for the huge deployment of federal agents—including a reported 1,500 deportation officers—to Minnesota in the first place. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem dispatched ICE agents to the Minneapolis area after the White House, inspired by MAGA media, grabbed onto a sprawling fraud investigation involving Somali immigrants and government aid. By all accounts, this is a real scandal, not a partisan invention; charges were first brought by Joe Biden’s Justice Department. But the scandal also presented an opportunity for political grandstanding (especially because Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was on the ticket against Donald Trump and J. D. Vance in the previous election). The president is using the fraud case as an opportunity to demonize immigrants. “THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!” he posted this morning on Truth Social, referring to immigration enforcement in Minnesota. Although DHS does conduct investigations, less obvious is why tactical experts such as Ross were needed on the scene.

Before and after Good’s death, the Trump DHS has sought opportunities to escalate. When citizens called attention to ICE’s presence by making noise and spreading word via social media, DHS falsely claimed that those people were violent rioters. After Good’s death, DHS surged more officers to the area, alleging that the fraud situation merited more agents; officers are now conducting traffic stops and door-to-door operations. But Good’s killing has no obvious connection to fraud, and it does not suggest any elevated threat to officers. Instead, the presence of more officers elevates the threat to civilians, as a Wall Street Journal investigation into ICE traffic stops demonstrates.

Pressure from the White House to meet deportation quotas has meant that ICE agents at best are working hastily and at worst feel unshackled to act with brutality, aware that they are unlikely to face discipline. (Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned today, including the leader of the Somali-fraud investigation, because of the Justice Department’s direction to investigate Good’s widow but not Ross.) This, too, increases the likelihood for mistakes and abuses of power.

The Minnesota actions are, of course, only the latest in a string of similar Trump-administration actions targeting cities that vote Democratic: Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Portland, Oregon; Memphis; Charlotte, North Carolina; New Orleans. The administration has used DHS personnel, the National Guard, and, in L.A., Marines. Trump and his aides have argued that these raids are essential for controlling crime and illegal immigration, but sometimes enforcement seems incidental to performative brutality. In one midnight raid at a Chicago building, for example, the federal government flew a Black Hawk helicopter and turned people out of bed with flash-bang grenades, yet ProPublica found that not a single one of the people arrested was charged with a crime afterward.

Trump ended National Guard deployments in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland late last year, bowing to repeated federal-court rulings, in lawsuits brought by cities and states, that establish that he had exceeded his powers. The first two weeks of January suggest that the administration will simply use DHS to serve the same function of punishing and intimidating cities and states that diverge from Trump politically. Minnesota and Illinois officials sued to block some immigration enforcement yesterday, but because immigration enforcement is a standard federal power, these suits may face longer odds.

Even unfettered, however, the White House is unlikely to achieve its goals of deporting all unauthorized immigrants—in part because they are based on wild overestimates of how many people are in the United States illegally. But Trump and the top aide Stephen Miller’s obsession with the issue means more incidents like Renee Good’s killing. A one-off tragedy is horrifying. What’s worse is when policy choices make it likely to happen again.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

To be an enrolled member of a tribe is almost entirely contingent on “blood quantum”—the percentage of one’s lineage that can be traced to tribal ancestors.

I don’t qualify for enrollment in my tribe. To be enrolled in the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, you need a quantum of one-quarter Minnesota Chippewa Tribe blood, as well as one parent who is an enrolled member. (Chippewa is a French corruption of the original Ojibwe.) Even though my mother grew up on Leech Lake and devoted her life to the tribe, first as a nurse and then as a lawyer and tribal-court judge, her official blood quantum is only one-quarter. Her grandmother was recorded as half Ojibwe, even though she was full, and her father was on the rolls as a quarter when he was really half. I should be enrolled. The fact that I should be but am not turned the idea of Native blood into an obsession for me, at least for a while, because it was a measure of my Indianness that I couldn’t change.

New tidbits continue to emerge from The New York Times’ lengthy interview with Trump, and one in particular caught my eye. In my December cover story about how Trump and his allies could seek to subvert the midterm elections, I reported on the danger of the executive branch attempting to seize ballot boxes. This isn’t just catastrophizing: Some Trump allies proposed such a plan after the 2020 election, but it was rejected. In the Times interview, the reporter David Sanger asked Trump about that. “Well, I should have,” Trump replied. Americans should be prepared for him to try again when he has a chance.

            <div id="article-text">AI told the fuzz BS, the fuzz swallowed it and didn&#39;t double-check it.

... but also a load of antisemites too. The upper echelons of the WMP were only too happy to wheel out some specious reason to ban isreali fans in order to placate extremist muslims living in that area.

The Verge wrote a story title that the police are &quot;blaming&quot; Microsoft Copilot, but I don&#39;t see anything to support that in the article.  I would say the police are &quot;admitting&quot; that, prior to contrary statements, they used Copilot and failed to verify its output.

Why waste taxpayer money on manual fabrication, when a machine can do it much more cheaply? Your crooked cops belong on the dustbin of history, alongside all the buggy whips.

BTW, wait until you see the next Robocop movie! People liked his use of firepower in the first 3 movies, but his real talent will be in filling out dozens of plausible-sounding arrest reports per second.

Why deny using AI when our management tell us we have to either use it for everything or become obsolete? Everyone should admit to using LLMs. They told us to. Here&#39;s the result. We get the wrong information and can&#39;t tell the difference sometimes.

same old story; law enforcement gets frothed up and overreacts. at least folks weren’t locked up or murdered at their hand. and who’s going to be held accountable? who’s going to step down or at the very least be banned from something they love? nope. none of that will happen. and worse, they’ll just do it again because why not?

No, Copilot correctly figured out a reasonably-believable completion of its auto-completion prompt. This is a success story.

That some people thought Copilot was stating a fact, is evidence in favor of Copilot having done exactly the right thing -- but also shows that those people don&#39;t know what LLMs do and what they are for.

The big question is: why are the police putting the output of these super-cool toys into intelligence reports? Intelligence reports should be based on real things, not interpolations of whatever random internet text some LLM happened to be trained on.

In other words: cops, you&#39;re holding it wrong. You shouldn&#39;t be having Copilot write or modify your reports, unless you&#39;re writing those reports for the novel, video game, etc that you&#39;re releasing once you retire from the police force. That is how to use this tech.

The story says that the AI hallucinated a game involving Israel.  But the question isn&#39;t about the game nor that nobody fact-checked it but rather why it was such a big deal.  What were they worried about?

Yes, this is a great idea.  Then the company could work with Mastercard and Visa to set up a standard payment protocol so that anyone using a cars from one of those issuers can pay at any retail location that supports the protocol.  Maybe they could even call that protocol &quot;EMV&quot;, with the &quot;E&quot; representing Europe.

Why hasn&#39;t anyone thought of this before?

Maybe it&#39;s time for Europe to establish their own payment networkThere are 27 countries in the EU, most of them have their own banking systems and some have their own currencies.  I believe there have been several attempts at establishing trans-EU payment systems, a new one went online recently - it covers a few countries and they are trying to add more.  Most of my financial &quot;dealings&quot; are within one of two countries - only rarely between the two - and I have bank accounts in both.

We have plenty. The mistake you make is thinking we use credit cards. Right at this moment Wero is being rolled out, which is a debit-card payment system that has much lower overhead (no middle man), and no extortion interest rates (as it is a direct relation with your bank).The only reason I ever use credit cards is to deal with legacy American companies that still live in the past.You can keep your visa.

What do you think the &quot;E&quot; stands for in EMV? It&#39;s not electronic. It refers to Europay.... alongside MasterCard and Visa.

But not accepting cash is a form of class discrimination in the end - it means you don&#39;t do business with the unbanked, which means you already exclude a certain class of people.

(Plus, there are many reasons to stick with cash - if you&#39;re broke, for example, and have a hard time sticking with budgets - tracking your budget with cash is often far easier. If you have $100 to spend on things, it&#39;s easy to have a running tally of how much you spent and how much you have left. And spending money is a lot harder with cash than it is tapping a card).

Of course, I&#39;d wish cash-free businesses would be required to put up a sign outside the door so you know when going on. I&#39;ve been caught out a few times wanting to try a new place only for them to say they don&#39;t accept cash. Could&#39;ve saved ourselves time and effort and saved wasted resources making me food I&#39;d end up not buying.

But not accepting cash is a form of class discrimination in the end - it means you don&#39;t do business with the unbanked, which means you already exclude a certain class of people.Question for Europeans:  Is this true?  Are there really any &quot;unbanked&quot; in Europe?  My understanding is that all jobs and all government assistance flows through bank deposits, so the only way to be unbanked is to not have any income at all.  But my knowledge may definitely be incomplete, and may be specific to the countries I know best.

That would be the better idea, but that doesn&#39;t solve the &quot;in case of power failure&quot; / or even war.

I&#39;m firmly opposed to a requirement to use cash. Let me pay with digital payments. Let me require customers to use digital payments. If a power outage happens, I&#39;ll accept physical cash, but only at that time.

The only places that should be required to accept physical cash are stores selling groceries and medicine. Even then, require the bills to be put through a counterfeit detection process to be accepted. Tr

Tips aren&#39;t income.They are a voluntary gift from the client to the servant.

At least in Germany there are Court Rules emphasizing that, and tips are not taxed in Germany. There are exceptions if the total amount of tips gets absurd high ...

Most other countries: people do not give tips.

One ruling for example:  https://www.bundesfinanzhof.de... [bundesfinanzhof.de]

Your card idea would solve the problem of how to send the kid to the store for a gallon of milk when they can&#39;t legally have a credit or debit card.

You can give your kid a secured credit card already though which only carries as much cash as you assign to it.

Visa prepaid card? Outside of the digital display it hits all those marks?

Having encountered enough failures in electronic payment systems. I make sure I always have enough cash for the important things.

I also have a jar for cash designated for the times I go out for a beer and a bite with mates. That way I can never overspend.

The problem is that in most chain stores even if you pay by cash they still have to put it through the point of sale system. If there&#39;s no power there&#39;s no sale. Cash in most western countries is really only likely to work in small shops and street stalls in a power outage.

Resilience worries also drove the decision after Spaniards facing nationwide power cuts last spring found themselves unable to buy food.That makes excellent sense.I spend a lot of time in Germany and cash-only businesses are far more frequent that ones which ban cash altogether, the only &quot;ban cash&quot; places I know are in a food court in a shopping centre in Frankfurt and one Chinese restaurant.  Germany as a whole has pretty much rejected moving away from cash.The UK is not as extreme as Sweden but they have gone a long way down that road.

The UK is not as extreme as Sweden but they have gone a long way down that road.

It varies. London is leading the charge. I was surprised on a day trip to Ramsgate (which is really not very far) to encounter cash only businesses.

This is fine, but I think what is really needed to put all of the forms of payment on an equal competitive footing is to require merchants to itemize transaction fees on the receipt, and not to include them in the list price.

This includes a transaction fee for cash, BTW, because accepting cash is surprisingly expensive.  Between &quot;shrinkage&quot; (theft), errors, the labor cost of counting, managing, storing and depositing cash, the cost of purchasing fresh cash from banks, the reduced checkout throughput and the increased difficulty/cost of self-checkout systems that can accept it, cash is far from free.  In practice, it costs about 1-2% of the transaction, which makes it more expensive than debit cards, or other low-fee electronic payment systems. The costs of accepting cash increase as the cash transaction volume declines, too, because much of the cost is fixed overhead. These are the reasons that so many merchants are just refusing cash entirely.

But there are legitimate reasons for people to prefer cash, too, especially privacy.  So the best solution is to make the costs visible to consumers and let them choose whether they prioritize convenience, theft/fraud minimization, cost, or privacy.

Merging Europay and MasterCard should&#39;ve been stopped back in 1993, but I guess no one could foresee the current political climate.

At least Thales is European, they make most of the cards.

Maybe digital euro will be rolled out too, but a lot of EU parliament are a bunch of pussies and listen to American bankers and thin-foil-hat crazies, so it probably won&#39;t happen any time soon.

There are things that I don&#39;t think should be illegal, but in many countries, including mine, they are. Generally I&#39;m referring to some classes of intoxicants. Cocaine, MDMA, psilocybin... I think it&#39;s ridiculous. Yes, these things have negative impacts on society, but so do lots of perfectly legal things. When buying these things one must generally use cash.

But even beyond simple consumerism, I think that testing the borders of legality is a stage of growth. Smoking weed in countries where it is illegal is

I just had this great idea for a fabulous new technology! I&#39;m calling it CASH. Here are some of its features:
        Transactions are unhackable. No need to worry about who stole your credit card info every time a retailer suffers a security breach.
        Transactions not stored in any bank&#39;s database forever, to be sold to unknown third parties at any time in the future, for any purpose.
        No middleman taking a percentage of every transaction, cleverly hidden from the consumer, generating a 2% drain on the economy.
        Does not rely on any network or other technology - works even when the internet goes down.
        Always know exactly how much money you have and how much you are spending, and never be in debt.
        Fast as pulling a bill out of your wallet. Never wait for an overloaded network.
        And, obviously, cash is private and anonymous. Your transactions are nobody&#39;s business but yours and your counterparty&#39;s.

I&#39;m looking for seed funding for this idea. Please send me cash.

Even if you manage to snatch it, it is the typical journalism drivel that starts with some bullshit about how there are candles lit in Sweden in winter, but does not have a single link to any of the rulings it refers to.

In particular there is no link to the ruling or vote that apparently has happened in December. I do not doubt it happened, but as an European, I am very interested in the details.

This is the kind of slop that made journalism superfluous.

There&#39;s less robbery if society is more cashless. Robbery of both persons and stores, especially armed robbery.

Sure, but &quot;pure fusion&quot; bombs are pretty much science fiction at this point.  Igniting fusion in LiDu requires a tremendous amount of energy and not an insubstantial flux of neutrons.  You&#39;re not getting either of those things in a profile suitable for military deployment without a fission primary.  It might be a small (maybe even less than a kiloton) primary but you&#39;re not getting the Plutonium or Uranium (or maybe Neptunium in some cases) out of there any time soon.

Absolutist moral frameworks can be so....unexpectedly flexible.... sometimes, can&#39;t they?

First you&#39;re all &quot;We live in a post-conflict world, why should we have to spend anything on defense when there are so many other things?

So the EU quietly rewrote the rulebook so it can pour nearly a trillion dollars into defence without admitting it’s abandoning its own ethical framework?

A link to it in TFA or the one it points to would have been nice given how often its mentioned.

Linux malware is relatively rare, because getting into Linus systems is much harder than the laughably easy ways to get into Windows systems. Hence this much later development. But while LLMs are generally incapable, generating malware and running automated attacks on, let&#39;s say, &quot;low intermediate level&quot; with so-so success rates is something they can do and it can be automated. And that dramatically reduced the effort for attacking Linux systems in a non-targeted fashion. There will be enough incompetent Li

That should be &quot;make that now worthwhile&quot;. My apologies.

is it really laughably easy? a properly managed windows server is laughably easy to get into? please describe

or as usual are we conflating the millions of windows desktops systems under the control of normies versus the millions of linux servers under the control of actual admins?

[Citation Needed].  Windows systems are usually compromised due to layer 8 issues.  One can put a Windows server on the same public subnet as a Linux box, and it will be 50/50 which gets pwned first, assuming sane configurations.

Linux has gotten a pass because it tends to be used for servers.  Once Joe Sixpack is using Linux for a desktop, things will change.  Same shit happened when Windows took the mantle over Solaris for a workstation OS... back then, we mocked Solaris for being insecure.

Linux malware is relatively rare, because getting into Linus systems is much harder than the laughably easy ways to get into Windows systems.

Is it, really? How many projects do you know that installation is of the form &quot;curl ... | sudo bash&quot; ? Because that&#39;s a large number of projects and Linux users blindly execute commands like that all the time.

It&#39;s only been post-pandemic where the Windows equivalent of Windows-R-Ctrl-V have really taken hold (or variations involving using PowerShell).

It voids your manufacturers warranty in only 48 states.

Yeah, I keep saying I&#39;m done with slashdot. But for the &quot;editors&quot; to continue allowing garbage like this with straight-up lying headlines... I&#39;m finally done. I deal with enough brainwashed anti-open-source mouth breathers at work. Why do I keep coming back to it here on a so-called tech news website that can&#39;t even get basic facts straight?

Good thing HN has a pretty good signal-to-noise ratio. See you all there!

i kept looking for initial deployment but i guess it is done via gaining control or access through unpatched or some other vulnerability. Initially because they kept saying cloud, i assumed some one was packaging containers and making them available for use, pre-infected. it could just be relying on idoits just provisioning new resources without doing updates or patches you know because cloud.

Looks like I was wrong. As these are essentially a variant of high-temperature (for radiation cooling) RTGs (maybe with criticality added?), not steam-engines, they are much simpler than regular reactors. Still apparently takes a long time to make them work.

Yes. At about 2kW and using Plutonium. Very expensive, very little power.

not 2kw 470 or so at launch now they are about 40watts.

2.4KW thermal power. 470W electrical power.

No, not an RTG but a proper fission reactor as it says in the first line.Tiny at 40kW, but orders or magnitude more power than a passive RTG, or SRG (Stirling Radioisotope Generator)The FSP may use a Stirling engine, or instead a Closed Brayton Cycle, but powered by a fission reactor, not a radioisotope lump.

Unlike the earlier Kilopower design, FSP will use Low-Enriched Uranium.

Some of the designs in the SNAP program were absolutely fission reactors. You don&#39;t get 1 megawatt of electricity out of a radio-thermal design.

In particular snap 10a was a fission reactor we actually launched into space.

Read the pdf. This current program is a complete retread of SNAP.

Read the pdf. This current program is a complete retread of SNAP.The current program is vastly more sophisticated than SNAP was. The only reactor flown by SNAP was about 600 watts, and failed after two months in orbit. The proof of concept prototype for the current program is the KRUSTY reactor, successfully demonstrated at kilowatt levels, and smaller and more reliable than the SNAP-10.

No, those are not fission reactors. The SNAP (&quot;Space Nuclear Auxiliary Power&quot;) program developed both nuclear fission reactors and also radioisotope sources.

We do pretty much have free reign but so does everyone else and that&#39;s the sticking point...I think.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2026 is going to be a chance to answer a pretty strange question: What if one of the most powerful and theoretically coveted jobs in the world was actually one that very few wanted to keep?

The job is that of a senator or a member of Congress. NPR is tracking the number of lawmakers who have decided to throw in the towel this year. It’s a record: By last count, we’ve got 11 senators headed for the exit and 47 House members doing the same. Some are running for a different office. Others have gotten sick. Still others, like Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene, have just decided to leave without even finishing out their terms.

Political scientist David Faris has been tracking all this too.

“There’s a sense that you can’t achieve anything in the American Congress right now,” Faris says. “It’s too broken. You have standard retirements compounded by a greater sense of the institution’s dysfunction and weakness vis-à-vis the executive branch.”

The congressional chaos is an opportunity for Democrats that will come mainly in November, when all 435 members of the House and a third of the Senate face their constituents in the 2026 midterms.

One of the things that’s helpful if you’re trying to predict what’s going to happen in these midterms is that we’ve been here before. Meaning: We’ve had a congressional election like this one, in 2018, two years after President Donald Trump was first sworn into office. Back then, Democrats gained 40 seats in the House—enough to retake the lower chamber of Congress. Members like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar were sent to Washington. According to Faris, the conditions leading up to that election were in some ways less favorable to Democrats than they are now.

Things are looking up for the party’s chances of retaking the House, and the Senate is in play in a way it wasn’t a year ago. But, he cautions, it’s all taking place against this backdrop of “very deep and persistent abnormality.”

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Faris about the case for a blue wave, and how to manage expectations for the midterms. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Polling is an interesting and important part of your case for why a blue wave is imaginable in 2026. You look at Democrats’ own internal polling for the past decade or so and see how it matches up with how the election actually went. And you say there’s been a shift. Can you explain that?

David Faris: Sure. In the off-year elections in 2025, which seem like 7,000 years ago but were actually two months ago, Democrats overperformed the public polling across the board in a way that they have never done in the Trump era. [These included the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, Zohran Mamdani in New York, and smaller local contests.] These are races where we didn’t have good public polling but where Democrats clearly blew out the expectations in a pretty significant way.

Even in 2017, when Democrats won these same gubernatorial elections and we were all feeling good in roughly the same way, the candidate in Virginia did beat his polling, but the candidate in New Jersey did not. And you didn’t have a blowout victory in, say, the Virginia House of Delegates in the way that you did in 2025.

So the results just weren’t as definitive.

In 2017 they were pretty much across-the-board good. But what’s different is that Democrats beat their polling here, so there’s some evidence that if the electorate is composed roughly the same way in 2025 and 2026, it might actually be underestimating Democrats.

Right before the holiday break, there were a couple of prominent stories that have been on my mind, and I wanted to talk to you about them. One was in Politico, and the other was in New York magazine. They basically made opposite cases about this whole blue-wave notion. The Politico article looked at the prospects for Democrats to take the House and be competitive in the Senate, and it asserted that those prospects are a far cry from 2018 because a gerrymandered map is a tighter map for Democrats. They could get a lot of votes, but those votes are going to be diluted and it’s possible they won’t translate to seats—or at least not enough seats for what they call a comfortable majority. What do you make of this argument?

I don’t care how comfortable the victory is. It’s like if you’re running for a flight and you just slip in right as the door is closing at the gate, and they’re like, “We’re going to stick you in the back by the toilets.” I don’t care.

A five-seat majority is a five-seat majority. The reality is, if we have the gavel, we can do things that we wouldn’t otherwise be able to do. Politico is not wrong about the obstacles to a truly historic wave happening here. I will note that if you go back to the past few cycles, these predictive analyses about what size margin the parties need to do X, Y, and Z have been very wrong. For example, there was a Brennan Center analysis in 2018 that said something like, “Democrats could win the national popular vote by 7 or 8 points and still not retake the House.” And that turned out not to be true.

One thing Republicans are really worried about right now actually does relate to the results in the Virginia House of Delegates. The way that Democrats were able to flip 13 seats in that chamber was by flipping a bunch of Trumpy districts. If Democrats could win double-digit Trump districts—in places where the president won by 10 points or more—and be competitive in those districts, then none of these gerrymanders are safe.

I mentioned that there were two articles. The other, in New York magazine, basically makes your case: The Democrats don’t need to do much to retake the House. They need to win a handful of seats. What I took away was that even if the party does well this cycle, it may still feel tight in Congress, and so the question becomes: How comfortable with acting aggressively in a tight environment are Democrats? Because, historically, they have not been comfortable in that situation, acting aggressively, right?

I think that this is a bigger problem in 2029 than in 2027. Say we have a new Democratic president with, like, a 10-seat majority in the House and a one-seat minority in the Senate. That’s when I would be worried about this narrative of “Wow, we didn’t do as well as we had hoped” or “This isn’t really that big of a repudiation of Trump, and maybe we better move to the center.” For taking one or both chambers of Congress as the opposition party, I’m not sure that those dynamics are as important for the next couple of years.

Can we look at the math here? If this blue wave is going to happen, Democrats need to flip three seats to claim a majority in the House, and four seats to win control of the Senate. That doesn’t seem like a lot when I say it out loud, but it can be, and I know that in the Senate it’s harder than in the House. Can you explain that a little bit?

The Senate is tricky because it is elected in three classes. Every two years, a third of the Senate is up for reelection.

And sometimes there are more Republican seats, and sometimes there are more Democratic seats, right?

Yes. So it’s an artifact of the map and the partisanship of the states at any given time, how good or bad your Senate map is for you. In 2018, when Republicans gained seats in the U.S. Senate, even in a Democratic-wave year, that was a famously horrific map for Democrats.

It’s not as horrific as 2018, but it’s not great. There’s Maine, where Susan Collins is like a zombie who keeps surviving election after election after election in a pretty blue-leaning state. In 2020 she beat her polls by, like, 9 points to hold that seat. I mean, it was unbelievable.

But it’s where Democrats are focusing. It seems as if there’s some navigability here. Where else are they focusing? Thom Tillis is retiring in North Carolina. Does that seem like a place Democrats are eyeing?

Yeah—every cycle we’re within 2 points of winning North Carolina, and every cycle we lose it by 2 points. But North Carolina was very close in 2024. And Democrats are playing defense in a bunch of Trump-voting states. Michigan and Georgia are probably the most important ones. Those are going to be tough races. And in Minnesota, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith is retiring. If we lose any of those seats, we’re not taking the U.S. Senate. The optimistic case is that we hold those seats.

And then we get some kind of fantasy wish-cast Barbie Dream House candidates.

Yes, and this is the same position we were in in 2024, when we had to hold all the tough races, then we had to get a win in a couple of places where we haven’t won in a long time. And there was a brief moment in the summer of 2024 when it looked as if that might be possible. And then things ended up turning out very badly, including Bob Casey losing his seat in Pennsylvania. It complicates the math for Democrats in the Senate for the next six years, right? That was one of the worst outcomes of the night, in my mind, aside from, of course, that we elected a fascist who’s destroying the country.

Is there anything I’m leaving out here that we need to consider?

I do think that all the pieces of the optimism case tied together—like the big shift among Latino voters—will come into play in a really serious way. And young people. They did not drift right in the same way that the popular imagination says they did. But to the extent that they did, they flipped way back to 2018 levels of support for Democrats.

Gen Z men have never been as far right as people say they are. They’re still far more liberal than their elder counterparts. It’s just that what’s happening is that the young men who are on the right are, like, psychotic. The young men who vote Republican tend to be part of this shitposting internet culture—but the numbers aren’t there for them. Gen Z is still a far more liberal generation than Gen X–ers or boomers. But the people who are on the right are significantly more to the right than we would maybe like them to be.

This conversation feels less like “Get ready for a blue wave” and more “Get ready to feel the pain in some way.” Whether you’re a Democrat, Republican, whatever, pain is coming.

Our whole politics is painful right now. I sometimes feel embarrassed to walk into my political science classrooms. The students that I’m talking to, this is their whole conscious adult life. College freshmen right now were 8 years old when Trump walked down the escalator. And so their whole conscious experience of politics as a sentient, quasi-adult human is this nightmare politics that never ends. People don’t necessarily want to study politics under those conditions, and I can’t blame them.

In April 2010, a state-of-the-art offshore oil rig operated by BP exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. The blast killed 11 and ignited a fireball so large it could be seen from 40 miles away. For nearly three months, Americans watched as BP (formerly British Petroleum) tried desperately to cap the Macondo well 5,000 feet below the surface. More than 134 million gallons of oil blackened the Gulf from Florida to Texas.

The Deepwater Horizon spill remains one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. More than 15 years later, coastal communities in the Gulf are still recovering from the devastation of their economies and ecosystems. But the passage of time naturally dulls the horror for people farther away.

BP and the Trump administration appear to be counting on that. As the world fixates on Venezuela’s oil reserves, industry and regulators are quietly paving the way for reckless projects much closer to U.S. shores.

Indeed, the company responsible for Deepwater Horizon is trying to open its next chapter in the Gulf: a massive new hub for offshore drilling that could give it access to 10 billion barrels of crude oil. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is currently reviewing BP’s proposal for Kaskida, among the first of several planned ultra-deep-water oil projects. Although BOEM sent back BP’s initial proposal in August, the company has since resubmitted what the agency has characterized as minor modifications. BOEM now has until March to issue its decision.

The proposal itself is riddled with red flags, demonstrating that BP has not learned from the worst oil spill in U.S. history. It utterly fails to prove that the project could operate safely under the high temperatures and pressures of ultra-deep-water drilling. Instead, it seems the London-based company is hoping that Donald Trump’s obsession with fossil fuels will push it over the finish line.

I helped document the lessons of the Deepwater Horizon disaster as the lead investigator for the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill commission. President Barack Obama convened our bipartisan group of science, policy, and industry experts a month after the Macondo blowout began—and a good two months before the industry was able to cap it. As millions of gallons of oil were pumping daily into waters owned by the American public, the president gave us a simple but important job: Figure out what happened so that the oil industry, the federal government, and Gulf communities could ensure it would never happen again.

We wrote an entire book to document our technical findings, but it’s easy to sum up our broader observations: In the decades leading up to the disaster, oil companies had been undertaking riskier and riskier projects even as government safety standards grew increasingly outdated. Industry executives were trusting themselves to the point of willful ignorance. Ambition and shareholder pressure created a culture of complacency in which oil and gas executives convinced themselves that they could do no wrong, despite incidents that should have warned them otherwise.

Executives at BP and every other oil company all told me they never thought that something like the Deepwater blowout could happen. With billions of dollars at stake, they just couldn’t overcome the temptation to drink their own Kool-Aid.

Protecting people, private property, and our public lands from this kind of industry complacency is supposed to be the job of expert, nonpartisan regulators. But in the years leading up to Deepwater Horizon, fossil-friendly politicians of both parties had steadily starved regulatory agencies of resources, authority, and independence.

Scientists and engineers who were supposed to supervise the industry got captured by it instead. They knew that risks were increasing as the wells were getting deeper and more dangerous, but they trusted the oil companies’ assurances. Our report found that by the time of the Deepwater Horizon calamity, federal regulators had been routinely rubber-stamping new ventures into deep water.

The underwater volcano of oil from the Macondo well blew apart BP’s complacency—for a time. The company was forced to reckon with the reality that no one knew how to stop a blowout from a well as big and as deep as Macondo. BP’s drilling proposal for the well should have provided a viable plan for a worst-case scenario, but it didn’t. And overwhelmed and underresourced regulators didn’t respond to that gigantic red flag.

We had a major opportunity to learn from Deepwater Horizon. But other industry players distanced themselves from BP rather than internalize the lessons. When I talked to them, they appeared to be in denial. While I wasn’t entirely shocked when BP executives told me that they never thought a blowout like Macondo could happen on one of their projects, I was stunned when other industry execs insisted that it would not have happened on any of their projects.

None of them recognized that their company’s hubris was just one instance of an industrywide culture of complacency.

The public should expect our government to address this complacency through expert oversight. But 15 years on, and despite the dedicated advocacy of the bipartisan Deepwater Horizon commission and others, Congress has done nothing to address the budgetary and structural problems that plague the agencies tasked with providing it. Congress hasn’t touched the liability limits that enable the industry to gamble with public health. The Department of the Interior did issue modest improvements to drilling regulations in 2016, but it rolled them back during the first Trump administration in what the American Petroleum Institute hailed as a “modernization” effort.

The second Trump administration has been even friendlier to industry. Executive orders have reversed a number of Biden-era offshore restrictions to fast-track permitting and weaken technical requirements (e.g., adjusting various technical constraints to allow drilling under higher pressures and enable more output). The Elon Musk–led DOGE project also shuttered regional offices and fired regulators.

The administration’s quest to accelerate drilling with inadequate regulations and fewer regulators is a recipe for disaster that leaves the industry largely to its own devices. And judging by its half-baked proposals, BP has either forgotten the lessons of what it termed a “catastrophe” or decided that catastrophe is an acceptable risk. After all, the company’s shareholders can still count on the American taxpayer and the communities of the Gulf to bear most of the costs of a spill, just as they did last time.

The proposed Kaskida project is even riskier than Macondo was. It is over 1,000 feet deeper, and drilling overall is becoming more challenging as ever-stronger storms rip across a heating Gulf with ever-increasing regularity. Yet BP’s proposal reveals that the company is not meaningfully better prepared to cap a deep-water well than it was 15 years ago. It took 87 days to cap Deepwater Horizon; according to the BP proposal, it would take 90 to 100 days to stop a spill from Kaskida.

Members of Congress have found even that dismal figure optimistic, concluding that the company underestimates the magnitude of a worst-case scenario at Kaskida by using a questionable methodology. In a scathing letter to BOEM in August, lawmakers urged Acting Director Matthew Giacona to reject the project. They correctly noted that BP’s proposal “fails to meet basic regulatory standards,” including neglecting to show that the company possesses the necessary equipment to contain a high-pressure spill. Under the law, the fact that BP hasn’t met current regulatory standards should be sufficient to deny the application.

Yet it seems that federal agencies have gone from merely failing to regulate the oil industry to actively advocating for it. The first Trump administration saw oil companies as its “partners.” The second Trump administration treats them as its “customers.”

Fossil-fuel giants have, of course, exploited the White House’s “customer service” stance to demand accelerated approval of new oil and gas pipelines and export terminals. They’re scrambling to secure long-term leases to some of the more than 1 billion acres of our public waters that the administration is offering up for drilling. They aim to lock in lengthy property rights and economic advantages that will insulate them from the reality of the inevitable clean-energy transition. That includes a new era of ultra-deep and high-risk drilling in the Gulf.

Kaskida is very much part of this pattern. And it’s just the beginning: BP has already submitted an additional production proposal for another ultra-deep-water project called Tiber, and companies like Chevron and Beacon Offshore Energy have proposed a slew of multibillion-dollar ultra-deep-water projects in the Gulf.

Even as the administration is bending over backward to green-light risky offshore oil projects, it is doing all it can to stop renewable-energy projects that create jobs and deliver gigawatts with far less pollution and climate impact. If BP were proposing to build wind towers instead of drill wells at Kaskida, it wouldn’t have a chance.

The Trump administration and BP are trying to carry on as if nothing has changed since Deepwater Horizon. In some ways, they’re right. The regulations still are not strong enough, the companies aren’t any wiser, and there’s even more oil money in politics.

But some things have changed. Renewable energy has become cheaper and increasingly more reliable than fossil energy, and it is getting more so every day. At the same time, the risks of fossil-fuel extraction are a lot less hypothetical. Every American adult can summon up searing images from the Deepwater Horizon spill.

We know that the oil industry has not operated in good faith, that our regulators aren’t protecting us, and that the American public, particularly Gulf communities, will bear the costs of the next disaster. If we witness another Deepwater Horizon, no one will be in a position to plead ignorance.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s campaign to punish Sen. Mark Kelly—a retired Navy captain—for urging members of the armed forces to disobey unlawful orders, is even more outlandish, and legally baseless, than it seems at first glance.

This past November, in a 90-second video addressed to service members, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers who had served in the military or in intelligence agencies stated that the Constitution was under threat from abroad and here at home, and that “our laws are clear—you can refuse illegal orders. … You must refuse illegal orders.”

The video failed to mention President Donald Trump’s name or any of his policies, but in the wake of military actions and threats he was making at the time, especially toward Venezuela, the message was clear.

In response, Trump denounced the video as “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS … punishable by DEATH!” He added, a bit later, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!”

Hegseth characteristically chimed in with his own denunciations and, last week, issued a formal letter of censure, which could lead to a demotion of Kelly’s rank, reducing his benefits. Kelly could even be recalled to active duty, then court-martialed, an act that would remove his military status entirely and even land the senator in prison.

On Monday, Kelly filed a lawsuit against Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, the Department of Defense, and the Department of the Navy, claiming that they were trying to deny his constitutional rights and requesting a federal judge to block them from carrying out their threats.

Kelly’s case seems to be a slam dunk. Even if the judge allows Hegseth and Phelan to pursue their censure, it is extremely unlikely—though I hesitate to say impossible, because nothing is impossible with this administration—that the senator’s persecutors will succeed.

First, and most obviously, the notion that Kelly and his colleagues committed sedition, treason, or any sort of crime with their video is preposterous. They were not encouraging service members to defy specific orders—only reminding them that they are obligated not to follow unlawful orders. In this, the lawmakers were merely reciting the clear language of military law.

Second, even if this were seditious (or even if Kelly had made some truly treasonous remark), retired officers cannot be demoted for things they say or do after they retire. “The statutes on this are absolutely clear,” Eugene Fidell, a senior scholar specializing in military law at Yale Law School, told me on Tuesday. (Retired officers can be demoted for things they had said or done on active duty, but no one is even pretending that Kelly’s record as a Navy pilot was anything but salutary.)

Third, retired officers can be court-martialed for sedition. If found guilty, they could be stripped of all military rank or even imprisoned. However, a court-martial would require a trial in a military court, with the prosecutors presenting evidence of criminality. Even Hegseth must realize that the more hard-line military court would likely dismiss a case based on a video in which Kelly recites a fundamental plank of military law.

Could Hegseth just go ahead and sign an order demoting Kelly and docking his retirement pay? Actually, no. According to Fidell, the secretary of defense has the authority to demote only flag officers—that is, generals and admirals. Kelly’s rank of captain, the highest of the U.S. Navy’s senior officers, is one notch below rear admiral, the lowest-ranking flag officer.

However, Phelan, the secretary of the Navy, could sign such an order. If he did, Fidell told me, Kelly could sue him in federal claims court—and very likely succeed at getting his pay restored and making the Pentagon’s civilian leaders look appallingly petty. The consequences could be deeply demoralizing, within the Pentagon and at U.S. military bases (not that this possibility has deterred Hegseth from his antics so far).

Kelly sees what’s really going on here. In a statement released while filing his lawsuit, Kelly said that Hegseth’s “unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: If you speak out and say something that the president or secretary of defense doesn’t like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted.” He added, “That’s not the way things work in the United States of America, and I won’t stand for it.”

Actually, this does seem to be the way things work in the United States of America now. I know of a few officers who are hesitant to speak out against Trump or his policies precisely because they fear retribution—and lack the access to resources, high profile, and legal protections that Kelly enjoys as a member of Congress. There is also a disposition among many officers, bred in them from their days as cadets, to steer clear of political activity, even if it’s meant to protest the politicization of the military.

Still, there are rumblings of change. Kelly’s suit is one. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s video pushback against the Trump Justice Department’s criminal investigation is another. The votes of a few (remarkably few, but still a few) Republican lawmakers—voicing new dissent against Trump’s war-making powers in Venezuela, his imperial threats against Greenland, and even his desire to kill Obamacare—may be more wavelets in a turning tide.

Meanwhile, the crusade against Captain Kelly seems doomed to a proper flameout.

It was the most unlikely response to the widely expected overturning of Roe v. Wade. In the summer of 2021, a small group of about 12 individuals, including some health care workers, elected officials, and local community activists, in the deep-red state of Wyoming—which didn’t have a single abortion clinic at the time—began planning to open a new clinic in the college town of Casper. This was at the same time that most abortion clinics in red states, seeing the writing on the wall, had begun planning to close or move to a more hospitable location. But not in Wyoming.

And this long-shot gamble paid off. Wellspring Health Access, which provides abortions as well as other services including family planning, general gynecology, and gender affirming care, opened its doors in spring 2023, almost a year after the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Since then, the clinic has faced unending legal challenges from the state. However, at each turn, the clinic has prevailed, culminating in a big win before the Wyoming Supreme Court last week. This ruling, which may have significance for abortion rights beyond Wyoming, struck down the state’s general abortion ban as well as a specific ban on mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion.

How did this implausible turn of events come to pass? Beyond the determination of the community group in Casper, two main factors explain the ultimate success of this venture: Wyoming’s unique libertarian constitution and the savvy and determination of a woman named Julie Burkhart. In a wonderful instance of karma, the famously libertarian citizens of Wyoming, enraged by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, aka “Obamacare,” in 2010, amended their constitution, stipulating that individuals have the right to make their own health care decisions. This amendment became the heart of the legal strategy used by the would-be clinic’s lawyers, and this argument ultimately prevailed.

But there needed to be someone to use that constitutional provision, and that’s where Julie Burkhart came in. Julie is a longtime, well-known figure in abortion-providing circles. She is not a clinician, but rather an abortion access strategist and a skillful clinic operator who has a track record of opening abortion facilities in hostile and underserved areas. It was this reputation that led the Casper group to invite her to work with them even when Roe was about to be overturned.

Julie’s involvement with abortion care began in 2001, when she began work with Dr. George Tiller, the Kansas doctor who was assassinated in 2009 in his church by an anti-abortion fanatic. Tiller’s mentorship was deeply influential for Julie, and she has worked in the abortion field since his death. She purchased his Wichita clinic from his widow and reestablished abortion there, a city that had been left without such care after Tiller’s death. She also went on to open a clinic in Oklahoma, as well as several other places.

As part of a book project on how people in various sectors of the abortion-providing community were preparing for and then responding to the Dobbs, we interviewed Julie three times over the course of 2022. These interviews took place at the very beginning of that year, immediately after the decision was announced in June, and finally at the end of 2022.

Our first interview with Julie, in January 2022, took place while she and her Casper allies were already actively planning how to move forward with an abortion clinic. A lucky break occurred, she told us, when a wealthy donor purchased a facility from a medical practice that had closed and donated it to the group. This purchase was especially fortuitous as the facility was in an area already zoned to permit a medical clinic.

Finding a contractor to upgrade the clinic for abortion services was a challenge, though. Abortion providers have long faced difficulties finding people willing to work with them. Even if the individual workers involved are not opposed to abortion, they often have realistic fears of being targeted by anti-abortion forces and being subjected to boycotts. Julie did manage to convince a local contractor to do the necessary work, vaguely telling him the clinic was for a “women’s health center.” The contractor did eventually learn the intended purpose of the facility, but continued to do the work, and tellingly, did not post a sign on the site giving the name of his company, as is normally done.

Julie’s fervent hope was to open the clinic about a month before Dobbs was expected to be announced, on the theory that since the clinic would offer a range of services, it could not be shut down, even if providing abortions was no longer legal in the state. As she put it, “So if something does happen in Wyoming, we will have that presence. We will have community ties. We will have standing if we have to go to court.”

But this hope of a pre-Dobbs opening was dashed in May 2022 when Julie awoke to a phone call informing her that the nearly finished clinic had been firebombed. Upon going to the clinic, she learned that most of the building would need to be gutted and rebuilt. The arsonist was eventually caught, but this set the clinic’s opening back by almost a year.

The summer of 2022 got even worse weeks later with the announcement of the Dobbs decision. When we spoke to her shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, Julie was predictably devastated. “I was so angry, so hurt,” she said. Julie spent the day after the decision listening to music at very high volume—including old feminist anthems from the 1970s. But neither the firebombing, the Dobbs decision, nor the Wyoming Legislature’s vote to ban abortion, if the Supreme Court allowed it to do so, broke her and caused her to retreat. As she said to us with more passion in her voice than in previous conversations, “I want to tell you, in Wyoming, we are going to litigate; we are going to fight this thing to the end.”

Finding legal representation proved yet another challenge. Several national legal groups who represented abortion clinics, while very supportive of the idea of a new clinic in Wyoming, were reluctant to get involved, feeling that the aspiration was unrealistic and that their limited resources in the face of a hostile U.S. Supreme Court were better spent elsewhere. But Julie and her comrades finally located local lawyers willing to represent them. Together, they promptly seized the above-mentioned constitutional amendment as their core legal argument.

This strategy quickly paid off. Several lower court victories allowed the clinic to open in 2023, when it began serving not only people in Wyoming but also those from surrounding states which have banned abortion. Julie has since told us there has been both community support and opposition to the clinic. Tellingly in this era of anti-trans sentiment, in some instances, the hostility is as much about the clinic’s provision of gender-affirming care as about abortion.

With the resounding victory from the Wyoming Supreme Court last week, Julie was celebratory when we emailed with her. However, nothing is “over” when it comes to abortion conflicts, especially in a place like Wyoming. In response to the decision, the state’s governor has called for a ballot measure in the 2026 election to amend the state constitution to ban abortion. These kinds of measures since Dobbs have mostly supported the pro-choice position, even in red states. It is unclear how the vote would go in Wyoming, if indeed it is on the ballot. If the measure is before the voters, it is clear that Julie and the Casper community will be actively helping to defeat it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The French data protection regulator, CNIL, today issued a collective €42 million ($48.9 million) fine to two French telecom companies for GDPR violations stemming from a data breach.

Free and Free Mobile are two separate businesses, respectively overseeing fixed-line and mobile services, owned by Iliad Group. The fines relate to an October 2024 breach that led to the data of more than 24 million individuals being compromised, including financial information such as IBANs.

In its judgment, CNIL noted that the attack began on September 28, 2024, and the companies were made aware of the intrusion on October 21 via a message from the attacker responsible. Free ousted the attacker from its systems the following day.

The attackers gained access to Free&#39;s network via the company VPN before connecting to Free Mobile&#39;s subscriber management tool, MOBO. Even though the attacker only gained access to Free Mobile&#39;s application, MOBO, at the time, allowed users to search for the data belonging to customers of both Free and Free Mobile, including their IBANs, provided they were subscribers of services.

A post-mortem of the attack revealed that the attacker began exfiltrating customer records on October 6, 2024, including those related to the total 24,633,469 fixed and mobile contracts. This was broken down into 19,460,891 Free Mobile contacts and 5,172,577 Free contracts.

At the time of the attack, Free Mobile had around 15.5 million subscribers, while Free had approximately 7.6 million. The companies were fined €27 million ($31.4 million) and €15 million ($17.4 million), respectively, based on Iliad&#39;s €10 billion turnover and €367 million profit posted in 2024.

The regulator said that the companies contravened GDPR in three ways: by failing to properly secure personal data, failing to adequately communicate the breach to those affected, and failing to comply with data retention laws.

Announcing the fine, CNIL said: &quot;The restricted panel found that on the day of the data breach, the companies had not implemented certain basic security measures that could have made the attack more difficult.

&quot;In particular, it noted that the authentication procedure for connecting to the VPN of Free Mobile and to that of Free – used especially for remote work by the company&#39;s employees – was not sufficiently robust.

&quot;Furthermore, the measures deployed by Free Mobile and Free to detect abnormal behavior on their information systems were ineffective.&quot;

The nature of the data that was stolen came into consideration when deciding the fine, as did the companies&#39; data retention policies.

CNIL noted that both Free and Free Mobile lacked the necessary capabilities to sort former subscribers&#39; data in a way that retained only the necessary information for accounting purposes.

They also lacked an adequate data-deletion mechanism at the time of the attack, and when it came to notifying their users about the attack, the initial email lacked key details users needed for a comprehensive understanding of its consequences. ®

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has quietly maintained support for an OS that&#39;s nearly 18 years old, but its time has finally passed - the Windows Vista-powered Windows Server 2008 took its last breath this week.

January 13 marked another milestone for legacy systems, as support for the software - codenamed Longhorn Server - expired for customers that bought Microsoft Premium Assurance (PA).

Extended support ended for Windows Server 2008 on January 14, 2020. It was possible to keep the lights on until January 10, 2023, via Extended Security Updates. A fourth year came courtesy of Azure, which took the code to January 9, 2024, but that was it for anyone without PA.

The long-defunct plan was a paid add-on to Software Assurance that kept security updates flowing for 6 years. It was eventually phased out in favor of Extended Security Updates to ease the transition between software versions. However, Microsoft said, &quot;We will honor the terms of Premium Assurance for customers who already purchased it.&quot;

The final patch means an end of support for the Windows Vista codebase, which was released to manufacturing in 2006 and made generally available in 2007. The Vista-derived Windows Server 2008 was released in 2008.

The extinction event was logged on social media, with one person noting the lengthy time in which updates for the Vista codebase kept flowing: &quot;It&#39;s so strange to think that updates for Vista existed for a longer time than updates for XP did, considering the... &#39;small,&#39; difference between their reception and usage.&quot;

In another corner of the Microsoft universe, the US vendor called time on some modems in Windows 10 this week.

The January 13, 2026, Windows 10 patches (for which many users will need Extended Security Updates to access) marked the end of the road for several models, as the company announced that the agrsm64.sys, agrsm.sys, smserl64.sys, and smserial.sys modem drivers were being removed.

&quot;Modem hardware dependent on these specific drivers will no longer work in Windows,&quot; Microsoft said.

This doesn&#39;t mean all modems, but the removal of the likes of agrsm.sys means that hardware using the legacy Agere modem chipset won&#39;t function. The driver family has been noted as a vulnerability, and given its legacy nature, removal makes more sense than hoping for a patch. ®

            <h2>'Imagination the limit': DeadLock ransomware gang using smart contracts to hide their work</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/deadlock_ransomware_smart_contracts/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers at Group-IB say the DeadLock ransomware operation is using blockchain-based anti-detection methods to evade defenders&#39; attempts to analyze their tradecraft.

First spotted in July 2025, the DeadLock group has attacked a wide range of organizations while almost managing to stay under the radar.

It abandons the usual double extortion approach in which cybercrooks steal data, encrypt systems, and threaten to post it online for all to see if the victim refuses to pay a ransom.

For starters, it does not have a data leak site (DLS) where it could publicize attacks. In cases where victims refuse to pay, it cannot lean on reputational damage to push for a fee. Instead, researchers say the group threatens to sell the data on the underground market, a tactic experts have previously said could just be hot air.

But for the researchers at Group-IB, the old-school encryption-only model is not the most notable aspect of the DeadLock operation. Its use of Polygon smart contracts to obscure its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure is an unusual move that&#39;s slowly gaining popularity.

Once a victim&#39;s systems are encrypted, DeadLock drops an HTML file that acts as a wrapper for the decentralized messenger Session. This file replaces an instruction for the victim to download Session to communicate with DeadLock.

By using blockchain-based smart contracts to store the group&#39;s proxy server URL - the one victims connect to before communicating with the criminals - it allows DeadLock to rotate this address frequently, making it difficult for defenders to permanently block its infrastructure.

&quot;This exploit of smart contracts to deliver proxy addresses is an interesting method where attackers can literally apply infinite variants of this technique; imagination is the limit,&quot; said Xabier Eizaguirre, threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, in a write-up shared with The Register.

Eizaguirre also noted that analysts recently observed North Korean state-sponsored attackers using similar techniques.

In October, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) reported North Korean attackers had been using methods it dubbed &quot;EtherHiding&quot; since February 2025.

Attacks involved hiding malware inside smart contracts – an evolution in tradecraft that GTIG threat hunters said represented a new kind of bulletproof hosting.

DeadLock&#39;s use of smart contracts to conceal its infrastructure is what researchers know most about the group at present.

Details such as how it typically gains access to victim networks are not yet known, Group-IB said, although earlier reports from Cisco Talos linked the group to using bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) techniques and exploiting vulnerabilities to kill EDR processes.

The Register asked Group-IB for more information, including about why researchers don&#39;t know much more about how it carries out attacks. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI-driven datacenter construction frenzy shows no signs of slowing, but neither do concerns that the whole edifice could collapse under the weight of its own hype and mounting investment demands.

Moody&#39;s 2026 Outlook report on the global datacenter market, seen by The Register, forecasts business as usual, with demand for server farm capacity continuing to rise in support of AI, cloud computing, and internet services.

The financial services biz estimates at least $3 trillion in investment is required to keep pace with the projected level of capacity expansion between now and the end of the decade. This covers the cost of buildings, the IT infrastructure, and the power required to keep the lights on.

However, the report flags worries over power grid constraints and construction bottlenecks, warning that demonstrating actual revenue generation will become &quot;increasingly important in the AI ecosystem&quot; to silence growing chatter about an &quot;AI bubble.&quot;

Question marks over sustainability are hardly new. McKinsey & Company warned in May 2025 that huge sums are being invested in AI on demand forecasts amounting to little more than educated guesswork.

MIT researchers claimed 95 percent of enterprise organizations had seen no return from their AI efforts so far, and Moody&#39;s itself says circular deals involving companies like OpenAI and Microsoft are spooking investors.

Capital spending by six hyperscalers in the US – Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Oracle, Meta, and CoreWeave – approached $400 billion in 2025 and is on track to hit $500 billion in 2026, then $600 billion in 2027. A chart in Moody&#39;s report shows total global investment peaking in 2029, before declining in 2030.

New datacenter development faces growing headwinds, primarily access to power in most markets, with utilities and power generators hard pressed to meet unexpected electricity demand surges.

Moody&#39;s also notes that local opposition to new builds has increased in some markets, often due to public concerns about their consumption of electricity and water, plus the impact on utility bills.

However, regions with &quot;supportive laws&quot; will continue to attract development, with some governments tweaking regulatory frameworks to encourage AI datacenters. The UK announced &quot;AI Growth Zones&quot; with streamlined planning processes last year.

As the risks mount, developers are coming under growing pressure from clients to shorten construction schedules so that hyperscale tenants can add new capacity as soon as possible.

But this collides with issues including high demand for skilled labor, building materials, and essential equipment, driving up construction costs.

Some tenants are now willing to shoulder delivery risks they previously avoided, including exempting power and utilities availability from completion requirements, the report claims.

On those circular deals, Moody&#39;s notes that OpenAI has signed sizeable contracts for gigawatts of new datacenter capacity and other assets while attempting to grow its revenue base.

Most financing for these assets relies on long-term leases with hyperscalers like Microsoft or Oracle, but &quot;OpenAI&#39;s growing presence in the AI ecosystem poses a growing credit risk depending on its success,&quot; the report states.

OpenAI suffered a net loss of $11.5 billion or more during the quarter to September 30, 2025, as The Register reported. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The latest Firefox is here with some handy changes – most of which differ depending on what OS and type of CPU you run it on.

We suspect that the most visible feature in Firefox 147 is improved Picture-in-Picture video playback. Now it can be triggered automatically when a tab is sent into the background.

PIP video appeared some years ago in Firefox 71 on Windows and Firefox 72 on Linux and macOS. The Reg FOSS desk just turns it off as we are not big fans of internet video, and videos that follow you as you move away from the page hosting them are the absolute last thing we want. Still, some folks will like this – including Daniele Ferla, who developed and contributed the code.

The other thing we suspect will benefit everyone on all platforms, at least occasionally, is that the Tabs page of the Settings screen has been reorganized, and now the various preferences that you can adjust there are categorized as Opening, Interaction, and Closing.

Firefox 147&#39;s most visible change: the Tabs Settings have been split into categories

For Mac types with Apple Silicon ARM64 processors, this release has improved support for the cross-platform WebGPU standard, which first appeared six months ago in Firefox 141. WebGPU, which originated at Apple about nine years ago, lets apps running inside a web page – technically, inside an HTML5 <canvas></canvas> element – use hardware-accelerated 3D via backends such as Vulkan, Metal, or Direct3D, and it&#39;s intended as a replacement for the older WebGL standard.

PC folks aren&#39;t neglected either. Users with AMD GPUs now get zero-copy hardware-assisted video playback, bringing Firefox&#39;s AMD GPU support up to par with that for Intel and Nvidia GPUs. On Linux, Firefox now supports the XDG Base Directory Specification. Among other bug fixes, including sharper image rendering for those using Mutter on GNOME, there are multiple security fixes too.

Support for Google&#39;s Safe Browsing standard now covers version 5 of the spec, including the new Local List mode. If you have Firefox&#39;s Enhanced Tracking Protection set to Strict, this now restricts local device access as well as the public internet – although this is being rolled out gradually, so don&#39;t panic if you don&#39;t see it yet.

Back in August, we reported that some users were reporting their Firefox browser was scoffing CPU power, and we told you how to disable the new AI features in the most thorough way: go to the hidden settings screen by entering a URL of about:config and search for browser.ml. We turned off absolutely all the options we could find, and that seemed to silence the automatic plagiarism machine. We&#39;ve seen reports of people finding these settings mysteriously getting re-enabled when they update Firefox. It hasn&#39;t happened to us, but you might want to check anyway.

As usual, there is also a detailed doc describing what&#39;s new for developers. Mozilla publishes full system requirements, but nothing looks different there: you need Windows 10 or macOS 10.15, or of course more recent versions, and a fairly recent Linux.

A new version of Thunderbird will be along to match soon, although as we write, we&#39;re not being offered an update yet – but the release notes are already available. We don&#39;t see any exciting changes here – in fact, only two things are listed under &quot;What&#39;s new&quot; – a Show Full Path option and optional folder-name localization. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two hospitals in Belgium have cancelled surgeries and transferred critical patients to other facilities after shutting down servers following a cyberattack.

AZ Monica, which operates hospitals in Antwerp and Deurne, confirmed the issues on Tuesday.

It said seven patients receiving critical care had to be transferred to different nearby hospitals with help from the Red Cross so they could continue receiving the necessary treatement. All other patients continue to be treated at the affected sites.

Its emergency department was operating at reduced capacity as of Tuesday, the day of the organization&#39;s last official update. According to De Tijd, 70 surgeries were cancelled on the day.

The local news outlet also reported that disruption was expected to continue into Wednesday, January 14, although nothing official has been publicly communicated by the hospital network.

The Register contacted AZ Monica for additional information.

In its Tuesday update, the organization stated that the Mobile Urgency Group (MUG) and Paraprofessional Intervention Team (PIT) services are temporarily unavailable.

MUGs are comprised of clinicians and nurses who travel to the scene of an incident to provide medical care, while PITs provide emergency care en route to a hospital.

&quot;AZ Monica&#39;s focus remains on the safety and continuity of care for our patients,&quot; it said.

&quot;AZ Monica continues to closely monitor the situation and will communicate further updates as soon as more clarity becomes available.&quot;

In a separate advice sheet, the healthcare organization told patients to expect longer-than-usual registration times when visiting the affected hospitals, although the visitation of patients already admitted is unaffected.

Those seeking urgent medical attention were instructed to first consult with their general practitioner, out-of-hours clinic, or other emergency service where available, since AZ Monica&#39;s emergency departments are operating at low capacity. No patients are currently being transported there by ambulance. ®

The strategy game arrives on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac on February 5th.

Sid Meier’s Civilization VII is headed to the Apple Arcade on February 5th, allowing you to play the strategy game across your iPhone, iPad, or Mac through the company’s $6.99 / month subscription. The game has the same premise as the original PC title, where you’re tasked with expanding your empire as historic leaders from across the globe.

But the Apple Arcade version offers touch controls, along with mouse and controller support on macOS and iOS, according to its App Store listing. There are some limitations, though, as Civilization VII Arcade Edition won’t support multiplayer at launch, and also won’t receive any of the downloadable content you’d get on PC and other platforms. You can also only choose large and huge map sizes on devices with more than 8GB of RAM.

Along with the addition of Civilization VII, Apple Arcade is adding Retrocade to its library, which offers access to classic titles like Asteroids, Bubble Bobble, Centipede, and Galaga on the Apple Vision Pro, iPhone, and iPad. You’ll also find the rhythm game Felicity’s Door and the puzzle game I Love Hue Too+ on the Apple Arcade on February 5th as well.

Parents will also be able to manually create and adjust child and teen accounts on YouTube.﻿

Parents can now manually set a time limit on their kids’ YouTube Shorts feed, ranging from fifteen minutes to two hours (with an option for zero minutes coming soon). The update, announced on Wednesday, takes the Shorts time limit feature YouTube introduced in October and adapts it for under-18 accounts. Kids and teens can’t change or disable the time limit setting on their end.

Similarly, parents can set custom “Bedtime” and “Take a break” reminders for their kids’ accounts, which are also available as optional features for adult users. The new features are rolling out after YouTube began a push to identify and restrict minors’ accounts last year using AI age estimation based on users’ YouTube activity and the age of their account.

YouTube is also making it easier for parents to make sure their kids are in the right account category. An update to the YouTube sign-up page rolling out in the coming weeks will allow parents to manually set their child or teen’s age category when creating a new account and adjust the content their account is allowed to access.

The broader range of parental controls mirrors similar moves on other social media platforms, aiming to lock down minors’ accounts. Meta introduced restrictions on Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger last year, including a “PG-13” content filter, and TikTok has had a similar under-18 time limit since 2023.

﻿With Personal Intelligence, Gemini can give you more personalized answers to your questions, though it requires you to opt in.

Google’s Gemini AI is getting what could prove to be a very big upgrade: To help answers from Gemini be more personalized, the company is going to let you connect the chatbot to Gmail, Google Photos, Search, and your YouTube history to provide what Google is calling “Personal Intelligence.”

This isn’t the first time Google has introduced some form of personalization with its AI chatbot; in September 2023, when Gemini was still called Bard, Google announced a way for it to connect to Google’s apps and services to be able to retrieve information based on what’s stored in your account. Gemini can also already recall past conversations. But the big change with Personal Intelligence is that it can reason across the information from your Google account, meaning it’s able to pull details from things like an email or a photo without requiring you to specifically ask to pull from the apps you might want the information from. It’s also powered by Google’s Gemini 3 AI models.

Here’s an example that Google’s Josh Woodward, VP of the Gemini app, Google Labs, and AI Studio, shared in a blog post about how Personal Intelligence can work. Google also put together a similar example in a video that I’ve embedded below:

For example, we needed new tires for our 2019 Honda minivan two weeks ago. Standing in line at the shop, I realized I didn’t know the tire size. I asked Gemini. These days any chatbot can find these tire specs, but Gemini went further. It suggested different options: one for daily driving and another for all-weather conditions, referencing our family road trips to Oklahoma found in Google Photos. It then neatly pulled ratings and prices for each. As I got to the counter, I needed our license plate. Instead of searching for it or losing my spot in line to walk back to the parking lot, I asked Gemini. It pulled the seven-digit number from a picture in Photos and also helped me identify the van’s specific trim by searching Gmail. Just like that, we were set.

Woodward warns that while Google has tested Personal Intelligence “extensively” to “minimize mistakes,” users might run into “inaccurate responses or ‘over-personalization,’ where the model makes connections between unrelated topics.” It might also have problems with “timing or nuance, particularly regarding relationship changes, like divorces, or your various interests.” Google is working on fixing these issues.

Personal Intelligence is an opt-in feature, and if you turn it on, you get to decide which apps to connect to Gemini. Woodward says Google has “guardrails” for “sensitive topics,” and adds that Gemini “aims to avoid making proactive assumptions about sensitive data like your health, though it will discuss this data with you if you ask.” Woodward also notes that Gemini “doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library,” though Gemini does train on “limited info” such as “specific prompts in Gemini and the model’s responses.”

Google is launching Personal Intelligence first as a beta, and only in the US, to “eligible” Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers and only for personal Google accounts, Woodward says. In the future, the company plans to bring Personal Intelligence to more countries and Gemini’s free tier. It will come to AI Mode in Search “soon.”

The company also prohibits the use of uploaded content for training AI models.

Bandcamp has built its entire brand around serving artists. And, with the artist furor over AI growing every day, it’s no surprise that the company has decided to take a stand against it. In a Reddit post, Bandcamp announced that AI-generated content would not be permitted on the platform and would be subject to removal.

The guidelines leave little room for interpretation. In the post, the company says that “Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted on Bandcamp.” It also prohibits using AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles, similar to a rule implemented by Spotify in September. The support team also encourages people to use the site’s reporting tool to flag any music that “appears to be made entirely or with heavy reliance on generative AI.”

In the thread, Bandcamp support also pointed people to the company’s Acceptable Use and Moderation policy page, which includes an explicit ban on scraping content or using audio uploaded to Bandcamp for training AI. It says that users agree, “Not to train any machine learning or AI model using content on our site or otherwise ingest any data or content from Bandcamp’s platform into a machine learning or AI model.”

Other platforms, such as Spotify and Deezer, have taken a much more conservative approach to combating AI-generated content, focusing primarily on imitation or relying on labels rather than bans. iHeartRadio pledged never to play AI-generated music or use AI DJs in late November. But Bandcamp is the first major music platform to outright ban AI-generated content.

This is small, simple and — most importantly — fun enough to sell me on drones.

I’m not a drone guy. In fact, I’ve always been a bit nervous to play around with them too much. They’re big, fragile, and expensive, which is a dangerous combination for someone with my hand-eye coordination. But I’ve always sort of wanted one, mostly because I’ve been jealous of the mid-air photos and videos I’ve seen other people pull off.

DJI has been trying to make the smaller, simpler, cheaper drone to win over people like me for a while. It nearly got there with the $199 Neo, but that was held back by basic obstacle avoidance and odd omissions like no portrait video recording. The fold-down Flip benefits from more advanced features, but at $439 is too expensive for first-timers like me, and rival HoverAir’s X1 isn’t much cheaper at $349.

The Neo 2 solves those problems. At £209 / €245 (around $280 — though there are no realistic hopes of a US launch now that DJI has been banned from the country) it’s pricier than the Neo, but still undercuts other rivals, and benefits from camera upgrades and improved, though by no means perfect, obstacle detection. It’s small and light enough to fly almost anywhere without worrying too much about complex regulations, can capture great footage and photos without the need for any controller at all, and has the manual control and FPV flight options needed to double as both toy and flying camera.

Sure, it has its limits. More powerful drones might have better cameras, faster speeds, or longer battery life, and there’s a place for all of that. But that’s not where I am right now, and if you’re not either, then the Neo 2 is probably all you need. It’s an affordable, low-risk way to figure out that flying a drone is pretty damn fun.

Small and light enough to fly anywhereEasy automatic optionsGood enough camera quality

Imperfect obstacle avoidanceShort battery lifeSlow top speed limits tracking faster action

The first thing I did was throw the Neo 2 in my backpack and head out for a run, leaving the controller at home and my phone in my pocket. Let’s call this the “drones for dummies” use case, and it’s fittingly at about my level.

At 151g, or 160g with the optional extra transceiver attached, the Neo 2 is a little heavier than the first Neo, but still light enough to carry around pretty easily. Plus, it’s well below the 250g line that serves as the cutoff for more onerous restrictions and regulations in many countries.

It takes a couple of button presses to turn the Neo 2 on, and from there the on-device controls are simple: two buttons on the side cycle through the drone’s default automatic flight options, while a long press lets you adjust parameters like the drone’s height, distance, or filming angle. Then you hold the drone flat in your hand, tap the dedicated start button, and it’s off.

The Follow mode is the one likely to get the most use, and it does a great job. You get plenty of control over the Neo 2’s positioning, distance, and angle, and while the top speed of 12m/s (about 26mph) is slow compared to larger drones, it’s fast enough to comfortably keep up on a run — though may lag behind on faster bike rides.

Obstacle detection is the other reason it may lose you, and you will have to keep an ear out for any telltale changes in the whine of the propellers. I made a point of walking and running amongst trees, and while the Neo 2 could confidently reroute around the trunks in its path, it did occasionally get caught up in low-hanging branches, spindly and hard to spot without any winter foliage. The first time this happened it clattered about a bit, got itself free, and quickly corrected course to find me again; the second time it couldn’t escape and simply shut its propellers down, stranded in the tree, leaving me to pluck it out of the branches. I was able to break the tracking by hiding behind an especially large tree trunk, at which point the Neo 2 hovered in place, unable to find me, but if you’re not actively trying to trick the drone it does a good job keeping you in its sights.

Thankfully, the Neo 2 is tough enough to survive a little rough and tumble, despite the lightweight build. It ships with removable propeller guards attached, and despite a couple of crashes and collisions during my testing there’s not even a scratch or scuff on the body so far. There’s no waterproofing — so you’ll want to keep this out of the rain — but beyond that I haven’t felt the need to be overly precious with it, chucking it loose in my gym bag and trusting it to survive just fine. I’m just a little nervous about the transceiver antennae, included in the Neo 2’s more expensive bundles, and wish it didn’t require four screws to detach for safekeeping, but so far their little bit of flex seems to have kept them safe.

Beyond Follow, the other automatic options are more focused on quick photos and videos. There’s the Dronie, where it flies backwards and upwards as it films for a few seconds; Rocket, where it films while shooting up and back down; or Circle, which you can probably figure out. There are more options besides, and you can use the DJI Fly app to customize which are available directly from the drone shortcuts.

Video quality benefits from modest improvements on the original Neo. The camera uses the same half-inch-type sensor size and 4K resolution, improved by a wider f/2.2 aperture and a jump from 30fps to 60fps when filming in 4K, or 100fps for slow-mo. It also moves to a higher 2.7K resolution at 60fps for vertical video, having previously been limited to 1080p.

The Neo 2 isn’t really going to compete with larger or more expensive drones when it comes to the camera, and it especially struggles with highlights, whether that be direct bright light or over-exposing my (admittedly pale) skin. But that’s hardly the point — this is about as small as your phone, as easy to use, and shoots video at comparable quality, and it does all that while hovering in the air, following you about the place, which your phone probably doesn’t.

You can even control the drone directly without reaching for your phone, thanks to built-in gesture controls. They’re simple enough — telling the drone to raise, lower, back away, or land in your palm — but I did actually find myself using them, which wasn’t what I expected from the outset. There are basic voice controls too, though since you need your phone in-hand to pick up your audio, you might as well just use the touchscreen controls.

For those, you can control the drone directly from the DJI Fly app, or using a remote like DJI’s RC-N3, which is included alongside two spare batteries in DJI’s £349 / €405 (around $470) Fly More Combo, almost doubling the price of the drone alone. You can choose between the regular flight mode, a slower Cine option, or faster Sport mode, and can also decide how you want the Neo 2 to handle obstacles: stop in front of them, automatically fly around them, or just turn off obstacle detection altogether and take matters into your own hands.

There’s FPV support too, though DJI didn’t send me the goggles and motion controller included in its £509 / €589 (about $680) Fly Motion Combo to test that out for myself — but my colleague Sean Hollister wasn’t sold on the included Goggles N3 when he tested them alongside the first Neo a year ago.

Given its size, I worried the Neo 2 would feel slight when piloting it about, but it feels surprisingly nippy, and the 2-axis stabilization acquits itself well. On a blustery London day the drone did have to fly at quite a noticeable slant to stay steady in the wind, but steady it was, only getting blown about as it slowed down to land, prompting me to grab it out of the air just to be safe. In regular flight the footage comes out remarkably steady even when the drone itself was teetering at an angle, though more complicated effects can suffer — a dolly zoom in the same conditions came out jerkily nauseating.

I tried to head off a few other potential threats so you won’t have to. Fly it out of range (I hit issues around 120m/400ft using the phone as a remote, though range will be longer using the transceiver and a proper RC) and the video gets choppy before a big error message pops up, prompting the drone to automatically attempt to fly back to where it took off from.

You’ll want to be careful where you take off from too, as it might affect the Neo 2’s ability to safely return to that spot for landings. Take off from under a tree and the drone might return to that spot in a high arc, something I spotted was happening just in time to hit cancel before the drone tried to descend through the branches at the very top, far out of reach of a rescue. Perhaps I was overcautious, and the Neo 2’s omnidirectional obstacle avoidance would have reacted in time, but after already fishing it out of the lower branches of a tree once, I didn’t fancy taking the risk of it getting stuck 30ft up.

Then there’s battery life. The Neo 2 can fly for 15-20 minutes on a full charge, though for safety it’ll try to initiate an emergency landing before the battery percentage hits single digits, meaning the practical runtime will be at the lower end of that spread. If that doesn’t sound like much, you’ll probably want to buy a couple spare batteries, which are included alongside the remote control in DJI’s Fly More Combo.

The drone doesn’t need — and in fact, can’t use — an SD card for storage. Instead it includes 49GB of storage space, more than double the 22GB of its predecessor. The 15 minutes or so of 4K test footage I’ve recorded so far, plus a few photos, have used up just 6GB of that, meaning you can probably expect to shoot a couple hours’ worth before needing to transfer files elsewhere.

The biggest downside to the whole experience is probably the DJI Fly app you manage the drone through. It’s a little awkward to use, at least on Android. It insists on landscape mode when you open it, but huffily tells you to switch to portrait whenever you enter the flight controls, video editor, or safe flight zone map. The interface is cluttered, clunky, and difficult to navigate, and offers no help at all on basic tasks like connecting to the RC controller.

It’s even annoying to get hold of: Android users will have to download this directly from the DJI website, since it isn’t in the Google Play Store, and while iPhone owners can find it in the App Store for now, I’m not sure that will last once the US ban kicks in.

More advanced drone owners are likely to bristle at the Neo 2’s limits, but as a compact, fly-anywhere option that almost anyone can operate, it excels. Am I a drone guy now? I’m not about to drop a grand on a high-end FPV model, but the Neo 2 made me realize I don’t need to — for now, this is all the drone I need.

            <div id="article-text">A few years after launch, New Horizons is getting a major boost.

A few years after launch, New Horizons is getting a major boost.

Animal Crossing, like Kirby, has come back when it seems like the world needs it most.

In 2020, Animal Crossing: New Horizons released on the Nintendo Switch. The game instantly became a smash hit, providing a much-needed place to safely gather with friends amidst the global shutdown of the covid-19 pandemic. In the almost six years since, Nintendo has sporadically kept up with the game, adding seasonal items and content, including the Happy Home Paradise DLC and the massive 2.0 content update that Nintendo claimed, at the time, would be the game’s last. But the arrival of the Switch 2 heralds a new update for the game that has fans itching for more opportunities to play with friends, create their dream homes, or return to cozy island life. For some, the series has been a constant part of their lives. “My entire internet experience as a child was just the Animal Crossing forums,” Soleil tells The Verge.

Soleil is a cozy game YouTube creator and diehard Animal Crossing fan who has been playing the series since its early days on the GameCube. “When I started playing, my neighbor, who I had a crush on, was playing,” she tells The Verge. She has all the games in the series, including Japanese versions that she can only play with the help of Google Translate, and has clocked over 4,000 hours in New Horizons specifically. “It just became more and more of a cute escape,” she said.

With this third update known as “3.0”, Soleil is hoping for things that make the game as robust as its predecessors. Though Soleil says New Horizons is the best game of the bunch, she always felt like it was released unfinished. “Over the years, [Nintendo] introduced patches which have improved gameplay quite a bit, but it still misses some of the mark of what Animal Crossing, up until now, has been,” she said. The new update is two-fold and may bring the game more in line with her initial expectations.

On January 15th, Nintendo will launch a paid Switch 2 update that offers exclusive features like mouse controls and 12-player online co-op. The 3.0 update, which launched a bit early, is free for both Switch and Switch 2 players offering several quality of life enhancements and new features. Players will finally be able to create multiple items at once, the new Slumber Islands offer yet another place to show off player decoration skills, and, perhaps most importantly, there’s now strafing. (Hell yeah!)

But one of the things Soleil is really looking for improvement on is the villagers.ons According to Soleil and others, New Horizon villagers are more passive than their counterparts from previous games. “One of the most common complaints over the years among casual and hardcore players is that the villagers are just kind of lifeless,” she said. New Horizons’ 2.0 update addressed some of those issues, bringing villagers closer to the prickly, opinionated residents from earlier games. “I hope that in 3.0 that they’ve tweaked [that] some more,” Soleil said. Better, ruder villagers aren’t her only wish. “I’m really hoping that they add more dialogue [...] more shop upgrades, and the ability to redesign our buildings like we could in New Leaf.“

But beyond wishes and wants, it’s the little things in 3.0 that excite Soleil the most. “The fairy in a bottle item. Oh my gosh, I literally screamed,” she said. “I loved the Majora’s Mask item in every game, I’m very excited that it’s back.”

Fernando, another YouTube gaming creator, is also excited by the prospect of The Legend of Zelda themed items in Animal Crossing. Like Soleil, Fernando has been playing the game since the GameCube era, but says that “I really developed a huge appreciation for [the game] like everybody else during the pandemic.” For Fernando, Animal Crossing brought him to his own new horizons. “I grew up playing mostly shooter games, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, that sort of stuff,” he said. “Animal Crossing brought me over to another side of gaming that I wasn’t very familiar with, and I found out how much I really like this type of game.”

Though he has over 500 hours in the game, he didn’t keep up with it over the years. The DLC, Happy Home Paradise, wasn’t for him and after sporadic check-ins he fell off the game entirely until the 3.0 announcement trailer. “The thing that’s really bringing me back is the collaborations with Zelda,” he said.

But it’s another kind of collaboration that’s wooing Fernando back as, before the 3.0 update, New Horizons did not allow players to decorate in multiplayer mode. “That’s the thing that I am most excited about,” he said. “Being able to decorate with my wife, and go through our ideal house is going to be just a lot of fun.”

Since it’s his favorite game series, Fernando plans to Zelda-ify both his island and his house. In addition to adding Zelda-themed items, in 3.0 scanning either the Tulin or Mineru Amiibo from Tears of the Kingdom will allow them to visit your island or even move in. Fernando said he plans to add Tulin to his village but is mildly disappointed that Nintendo didn’t go for the more obvious Zelda-themed villager. “It’s a huge missed opportunity not adding a villager based on Epona.”

Like Soleil, Fernando felt New Horizons’ villagers were blander than their predecessors. But similarly he has nevertheless grown attached to them. That attachment is causing both Fernando and Soleil issues as 3.0 forces them to confront the biggest decision an Animal Crossing player can make: what to do about their island. With all the fancy new decoration items, AC’s robust community of custom pattern makers, and the sheer wealth of customization options available, it can be tempting to start over from scratch. But with that reset, everything goes away — including the villagers that have come to call a player’s island home.

“Clay, specifically, he’s like an OG and I love him,” Fernando said. “So I don’t want to see him go.” Soleil is no less fond of her own villagers, but has taken a different perspective. “On this island, I’m a god, I can do whatever I want at any time,” she said. “I can just get them back.”

For both players, Animal Crossing has been an escape over the years, especially during the pandemic and with 3.0’s release imminent, it seems poised to offer gentle distraction in a time of crisis again. “It’s comfort food for me,” Fernando said. “Especially with everything happening in [the US] specifically.”

For Soleil though, Animal Crossing is something she reaches for in personal times of stress. “With personal crises, I’m more willing to delve into Animal Crossing,” she said. “But when it comes to things that are harming my community, my friends, I’m much more willing to ignore video games for that.”

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Next-gen nuclear is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. If you want to learn more about why it made the list, sign up to receive The Spark, our weekly newsletter all about energy and climate change, tomorrow. You can also check out the rest of the technologies on the list here.

People hate them in Virginia, which leads the nation in their construction. They hate them in Nevada, where they slurp up the state’s precious water. They hate them in Michigan, and Arizona, and South Dakota. They hate them all around the world, it’s true. But they really hate them in Georgia. Read our story about why they’re provoking so much fury.

Africa is still early in the process of adopting AI technologies. But researchers say the continent is uniquely hospitable to it for several reasons, including a relatively young and increasingly well-educated population, a rapidly growing ecosystem of AI startups, and lots of potential consumers.

However, ambitious efforts to develop AI tools that answer the needs of Africans face numerous hurdles. Taken together, researchers worry, they could hold Africa’s AI sector back and hamper its efforts to pave its own pathway in the global AI race. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Massive structures, with thousands of specialized computer chips running in parallel to perform the complex calculations required by advanced AI models. A single facility can cover millions of square feet, built with millions of pounds of steel, aluminum, and concrete; feature hundreds of miles of wiring, connecting some hundreds of thousands of high-end GPU chips, and chewing through hundreds of megawatt-hours of electricity. These facilities run so hot from all that computing power that their cooling systems are triumphs of engineering complexity in themselves. But the star of the show are those chips with their advanced processors. A single chip in these vast arrays can cost upwards of $30,000. Racked together and working in concert, they process hundreds of thousands of tokens—the basic building blocks of an AI model—per second. Ooooomph.

Given the incredible amounts of capital that the world’s biggest companies have been pouring into building data centers you can make the case (and many people have) that their construction is single-handedly propping up the US stock market and the economy.

So important are they to our way of life that none other than the President of the United States himself, on his very first full day in office, stood side by side with the CEO of OpenAI to announce a $500 billion private investment in data center construction.

Truly, the hyperscale datacenter is a marvel of our age. A masterstroke of engineering across multiple disciplines. They are nothing short of a technological wonder.

People hate them in Virginia, which leads the nation in their construction. They hate them in Nevada, where they slurp up the state’s precious water. They hate them in Michigan, and Arizona, and South Dakota, where the good citizens of Sioux Falls hurled obscenities at their city councilmembers following a vote to permit a data center on the city’s northeastern side. They hate them all around the world, it’s true. But they really hate them in Georgia.

So, let’s go to Georgia. The purplest of purple states. A state with both woke liberal cities and MAGA magnified suburbs and rural areas. The state of Stacey Abrams and Newt Gingrich. If there is one thing just about everyone there seemingly agrees on, it’s that they’ve had it with data centers.

Last year, the state’s Public Service Commission election became unexpectedly tight, and wound up delivering a stunning upset to incumbent Republican commissioners. Although there were likely shades of national politics at play (voters favored Democrats in an election cycle where many things went that party’s way), the central issue was skyrocketing power bills. And that power bill inflation was oft-attributed to a data center building boom rivaled only by Virginia’s.

This boom did not come out of the blue. At one point, Georgia wanted data centers. Or at least, its political leadership did. In 2018 the state’s General Assembly passed legislation that provided data centers with tax breaks for their computer systems and cooling infrastructure, more tax breaks for job creation, and even more tax breaks for property taxes. And then… boom!

But things have not played out the way the Assembly and other elected officials may have expected.

Journey with me now to Bolingbroke, Georgia. Not far outside of Atlanta, in Monroe County (population 27,954), county commissioners were considering rezoning 900 acres of land to make room for a new data center near the town of Bolingbroke (population 492). Data centers have been popping up all across the state, but especially in areas close to Atlanta. Public opinion is, often enough, irrelevant. In nearby Twiggs County, despite strong and organized opposition, officials decided to allow a 300-acre data center to move forward. But at a packed meeting to discuss the Bolingbroke plans, some 900 people showed up to voice near unanimous opposition to the proposed data center, according to Macon, Georgia’s The Telegraph. Seeing which way the wind had blown, the Monroe county commission shot it down in August last year.

The would-be developers of the proposed site had claimed it would bring in millions of dollars for the county. That it would be hidden from view. That it would “uphold the highest environmental standards.” That it would bring jobs and prosperity. Yet still, people came gunning for it.

Why!? Data centers have been around for years. So why does everyone hate them all of the sudden?

What is it about these engineering marvels that will allow us to build AI that will cure all diseases, bring unprecedented prosperity, and even cheat death (if you believe what the AI sellers are selling) that so infuriates their prospective neighbors?

There are some obvious reasons. First is just the speed and scale of their construction, which has had effects on power grids. No one likes to see their power bills go up. The rate hikes that so incensed Georgians come as monthly reminders that the eyesore in your backyard profits California billionaires at your expense, on your grid. In Wyoming, for example, a planned Meta data center will require more electricity than every household in the state, combined. To meet demand for power-hungry data centers, utilities are adding capacity to the grid. But although that added capacity may benefit tech companies, the cost is shared by local consumers.

Similarly, there are environmental concerns. To meet their electricity needs, data centers often turn to dirty forms of energy. xAI, for example, famously threw a bunch of polluting methane-powered generators at its data center in Memphis. While nuclear energy is oft-bandied about as a greener solution, traditional plants can take a decade or more to build; even new and more nimble reactors will take years to come online. In addition, data centers often require massive amounts of water. But the amount can vary widely depending on the facility, and is often shrouded in secrecy. (A number of states are attempting to require facilities to disclose water usage.)

A different type of environmental consequence of data centers is that they are noisy. A low, constant, machine hum. Not just sometimes, but always. 24 hours a day. 365 days a year. “A highway that never stops.”

And as to the jobs they bring to communities. Well, I have some bad news there too. Once construction ends, they tend to employ very few people, especially for such resource-intensive facilities.

These are all logical reasons to oppose data centers. But I suspect there is an additional, emotional one. And it echoes one we’ve heard before.

More than a decade ago, the large tech firms of Silicon Valley began operating buses to ferry workers to their campuses from San Francisco and other Bay Area cities. Like data centers, these buses used shared resources such as public roads without, people felt, paying their fair share. Protests erupted. But while the protests were certainly about shared resource use, they were also about something much bigger.

Tech companies, big and small, were transforming San Francisco. The early 2010s were a time of rapid gentrification in the city. And what’s more, the tech industry itself was transforming society. Smartphones were newly ubiquitous. The way we interacted with the world was fundamentally changing, and people were, for the most part, powerless to do anything about it. You couldn’t stop Google.

You could stand in front of it and block its path. You could yell at the people getting on it. You could yell at your elected officials and tell them to do something. And in San Francisco, people did. The buses were eventually regulated.

The data center pushback has a similar vibe. AI, we are told, is transforming society. It is suddenly everywhere. Even if you opt not to use ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini, generative AI is  increasingly built into just about every app and service you likely use. People are worried AI will harvest jobs in the coming years. Or even kill us all. And for what? So far, the returns have certainly not lived up to the hype.

You can’t stop Google. But maybe, just maybe, you can stop a Google data center.

Then again, maybe not. The tech buses in San Francisco, though regulated, remain commonplace. And the city is more gentrified than ever. Meanwhile, in Monroe County, life goes on. In October, Google confirmed it had purchased 950 acres of land just off the interstate. It plans to build a data center there.

Sodium-ion batteries are making their way into cars—and the grid

For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. Enter: sodium-ion batteries.

They work much like lithium-ion ones: they store and release energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. Read why it’s poised to become more important to our energy future.

Sodium-ion batteries are one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Take a look at what else made the list.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese companies showcased everything from AI gadgets to household appliances to robots, and the overall mood among them was upbeat. Here’s why.This story was first featured in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter giving you the inside story of what’s going on in AI. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Monday.

At some point this month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial.

The volunteers—who are covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

However, some experts warn the trial is too small, and likely won’t reveal anything useful. Read the full story.

By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. And their output encapsulates how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI. Read the full story.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch.

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <h2>AI is old news. Generative AI is the future.</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.
