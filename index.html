            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has filed a lawsuit to protect its search results, targeting a firm called SerpApi that has turned Google’s 10 blue links into a business. According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google’s terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google’s decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data.

SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world’s largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google’s SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can’t summarize web links if it can’t find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi’s second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity for grabbing its data from Google results.

Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it’s not just doing this to protect itself—it’s also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google’s blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi “violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content.”

It’s worth noting that Google has a partnership with Reddit that pipes data directly into Gemini. As a result, you’ll often see Reddit pages cited in the chatbot’s outputs. As Google points out, it abides by “industry-standard crawling protocols” to collect the data that appears on its SERPs, but those sites didn’t agree to let SerpApi scrape their data from Google. So while you could reasonably argue that Google’s lawsuit helps protect the rights of web publishers, it also explicitly protects Google’s business interests.

The kind of data scraping that SerpApi uses is not new—Google has simply put up with it until now. However, the company claims that SerpApi’s deceptive behavior, like spoofing user agents and hammering sites with armies of bots, has increased significantly over the past year. That may have something to do with the ever-growing hunger for search data in the AI era.

Google is coming out of its antitrust cases relatively unscathed so far, which affects the availability of its data. It has avoided the harshest remedies, like the government’s demand that Google offer search data to competitors. That might have turned businesses like SerpApi legit, but with that no longer an option, Google may feel emboldened to unleash the lawyers.

While Google paints this as a benevolent action, it stands to benefit by stopping SERP scrapers. However, this may make some of Google’s competitors happy, too. Since the search giant doesn’t offer an official API for search (and the courts declined to force the issue), SERP scraping provides a way for companies to get Google’s search data on the down-low. This reduces demand for the handful of other web indexes that do have APIs, including Brave and Bing. Without illicit search APIs, chatbots may have to lean on official data sources.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.

Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.

In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.

“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”

Economo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.

To test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.

Microtomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”

To solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.

The first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.

The team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.

Ants that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.

“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”

The researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.

In a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.

“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.

The study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.

Before looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.

            <h2>Switch 2 pub backs off Game Key Cards after leaking lower-cost cartridge options</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/cheaper-lower-capacity-switch-2-cartridges-could-mean-fewer-game-key-cards/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Switch 2’s data-free, download-enabling Game Key Cards have proved controversial with players who worry about long-term ownership and access issues to their purchases. But they’ve remained popular with publishers that want to save production costs on a boxed Switch 2 game release, since Game Key Cards don’t include any of the expensive flash memory found on a standard Switch 2 cartridge.

Now, though, at least one publisher has publicly suggested that Nintendo is offering cheaper Switch 2 cartridge options with smaller storage capacities, lowering production costs in a way that could make full cartridge releases more viable for many games on the console.

Earlier this week, R-Type Dimensions III publisher Inin Games explained to customers that it couldn’t switch from Game Key Cards to a “full physical cartridge” for the retail version of the Switch 2 game without “significantly rais[ing] manufacturing costs.” Those additional costs would “force us to increase the retail price by at least €15 [about $20],” Inin Games wrote at the time.

In an update posted to social media earlier today, though, the publisher said that “there is no better timing: two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge [storage capacity] sizes for Nintendo Switch 2. This allows us to recalculate production in a way that wasn’t possible before.”

As such, Inin said it has decided to replace the Game Key Cards that were going to be in the game’s retail box with full physical cartridges. That change will result in the game’s asking price going up by €10 (about $13) “due to still higher production costs,” Inin explained. Still, that’s still less than the “at least €15” Inin was speculatively quoting for the same change just days ago. And Inin said early pre-order customers for R-Type Dimensions III won’t have to pay the increased price, essentially getting the full cartridge at no additional cost.

Inin Games later updated its official blog to remove any reference to the “new smaller cartridge sizes” it previously said Nintendo had “announced.” The publisher also backtracked in a social media update, clarifying that “there has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities.”

But Inin can’t exactly unring the bell at this point, even if Nintendo wants to publicly disavow the change. Inin’s initial announcement also aligned with earlier rumors that Nintendo would be rolling out 16GB and 32GB Switch 2 game cartridges as an option alongside the 64GB cartridges that have been the only ones available thus far.

The information Inin shared suggests that those smaller cartridge options could cost a publisher $5 to $10 less than they would have paid for the older, higher-capacity cartridges. That might not sound like much in the grand scheme of things, but it might be just enough to make a full physical release economically palatable for Switch 2 publishers that can fit their game in a smaller memory footprint. That should be welcome news for gamers who are tired of seeing that “Game Key Card” notice on the front of their Switch 2 retail packaging.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Now that the Department of Justice is releasing hundreds of thousands of long-awaited records from its investigation into deceased sex trafficker and billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein, the public finally has a chance to see the full extent of his damning web of connections in the highest echelons of power for themselves.

After finally going live on Friday, the Justice Department portal that allows you to search the “full Epstein library” appears to be either broken, or at least not fully up to speed, because entering obviously relevant search terms are turning up zilch.

Enter “Trump,” for example, and there will be “no results found.” Search “Epstein,” and still nada. The issue was flagged by Ben Collins of The Onion notoriety, and other users took notice.

In all, it’s not a good look for the Trump administration, which has — surprise — underdelivered on the president’s promise to expose Epstein’s dealings. A first batch of Epstein files released shortly after he took office offered little that the public didn’t already know. It ignited an uproar in July, when the DoJ said it wouldn’t release anymore files to the public, before backtracking in the face of overwhelmingly negative public reception.

This waffling on the Epstein issue may or may not have something to do with the fact that Trump seems to have had pretty close ties to Epstein. Trump has repeatedly played down his past friendship with the deceased billionaire, though his name has come up repeatedly in a batch of Epstein’s emails released by the House Oversight Committee last month. The committee also released a photo of what appears to be a signed letter Trump wrote to Epstein for his 50th birthday, featuring a crude sketch of a woman’s torso and a memorable sendoff hoping that “may every day be another wonderful secret.”

It’s worth mentioning at this point that not all of the documents have been released yet, in spite of a hard deadline set by Congress for Friday. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that some materials were being withheld and cited ongoing investigations, per the New York Times, and that more that would be released over the coming weeks. We’ll have to wait, then, until either more documents are released or the DOJ website starts working, to see if there’s anything meaningfully new.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Throughout the United States, data centers are popping up like weeds, devouring water and electricity to fuel the unprecedented demand for AI training and inference. At the same time, water levels in the Great Lakes are lower than they’ve been in years — sparking ardent opposition in the area that could be a sign of things to come far beyond.

New reporting by The Guardian on data centers’ effects on the Great Lakes — the largest freshwater reserves in the world — spotlights concerns that new data center buildouts are leading to lower-than-average water levels throughout the region.

As companies look for areas to plant their immense AI data centers, the small towns dotting the Great Lakes region have made for appetizing targets. In Perkins Township, Ohio, for example, area farmer Tom Hermes tells The Guardian he was alarmed when Texas-based firm Aligned Data Centers began construction on a new compound nearby. A four-building campus at 200,000 square feet in size, the new facility is going up right next to the land Hermes uses for farming.

“We have city water here. That’s going to reduce the pressure if they are sucking all the water,” he told the publication. “They’re not good, I know that.”

It’s worth pointing out that there are still a lot of questions about exactly how much water AI data centers are using. A recent Wired piece, canvassing experts on the issue of data center water usage, found that it’s a muddy issue with many variables.

“In the near term, it’s not a concern and it’s not a nationwide crisis,” advised Cornell environmental studies professor Fengqi You. “But it depends on location. In locations that have existing water stress, building these AI data centers is gonna be a big problem.”

Indeed, not many are up in arms about the high water demand for, say, the type of industrial agriculture that Hermes is engaged in. According to The Guardian, he raises 130 head of cattle, along with corn, wheat, grass, and soybeans on a 1,200 acre plot — one of the most water-hungry ventures imaginable.

Still, many feel that data centers pose a risk to nearby water tables, and researchers are still fleshing out the actual relationship. It also doesn’t help that the rise of AI infrastructure is coinciding with other environmental crises: in the Great Lakes region, for instance, Lake Erie just recorded its second month in a row of water levels well below the long-term average. Compared to 2019, water levels across the five lakes are down anywhere from two to four feet.

And regardless of its absolute impact, AI’s water use has become an emotional flashpoint in the public’s opposition to the tech. In Port Washington, Wisconsin, for example, community members erupted in protest against a new data center during a recent city council meeting. Three were arrested for disorderly conduct against the facility, which local activist group Clean Wisconsin says will use “much more water than tech companies claim” as a result of electricity generation.

“If non-renewable energy sources are used to meet those needs, its off-site water use would be at least 54 million gallons a day,” the group claimed in a November analysis. “For comparison, that’s the water use of about 970,000 Wisconsin residents.” The caveat here is that without government-mandated transparency, it’s hard to know exactly where that energy is coming from, and how much water is used as a result.

Other towns like Hobart, Indiana and Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin face similar predicaments. In Michigan’s lower peninsula, tech giants have begun work on 16 data center projects in 2025 alone.

Meanwhile, the water level of the Great Lakes is receding fast. “We’re about 12 inches below the long-term average for the lake,” Watershed Center Grand Traverse Bay waterkeeper Heather Smith told Up North Live in late November, referring to Lake Michigan. “We are lower than last month and certainly lower than we were last year.”

            <h2>TikTok Accounts Are Using AI Slop to Sell Seeds to Plants That Don’t Exist</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/tiktok-ai-slop-seeds-plants-dont-exist">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are thousands of varieties of hosta — a leafy decorative plant that you’ve probably seen adorning outdoor spaces — being cultivated around the world, in a luxurious spread of colors, sizes, and textures. The hardy and easy-to-care-for plants thrive in the shade and can grow enormous leaves, making them a perfect project for amateur gardeners.

Yet despite the glorious natural biodiversity that already exists in the species, scammers on TikTok are using AI-generated slop videos to sell dubious seeds for hosta varieties that don’t exist.

A quick search for “hosta seeds” reveals countless videos of unnaturally colored hostas, from a fictitious variety featuring enormous, purple leaves, to “God’s rainbow,” a made-up plant that grows garish, rainbow-colored foliage, described as “so magical, your neighbors will think it isn’t real,” according to a robotic-sounding AI voiceover.

“It’s called midnight blue heart,” a voiceover says in a separate video. “A rare black and blue hosta that looks like it came from another planet.”

“It’s magical, it’s hardy, and only a few dollars,” the voice continues. “Tap the link below to order and bring the midnight blue heart home.”

The obvious hallmarks of half-baked AI are impossible to ignore, from water streams from garden hoses that flow straight through the foliage or miss the plant entirely to seeds that magically float by themselves while held in a hand. Many of the videos even claim their miraculous hostas can thrive even in snowy conditions, which is a nonsense prospect: hostas may be perennial, but aren’t very frost-tolerant and sustain damage from freezing temperatures.

The bizarre trend is part of a much larger deluge of AI slop drowning out human-authored content across social media platforms.

Author Bree Bridges noticed her TikTok feed becoming overwhelmed by the videos.

“TikTok has started giving me AI-generated garden content with videos of people supposedly growing plants that quite clearly look like they came from the ‘Avatar’ planet,” Bridges wrote in a post on Bluesky.

“And also they’re watering them indoors sometimes while watering the carpet and they grow in three days,” she added.

Experts have already warned that hosta lovers should stay far away from seeds that purport to grow into fantastical plants. Ads that New York-based NBC-affiliate WHEC showed to Bill Hegeman, co-president of the Genesee Valley Hosta Society, immediately raised red flags.

“Stop!” the TikTok account behind the outdoor living store Touch of Eco exclaimed in a recent clip. “If you see these colorful hosta seeds on TikTok, never buy them. These are fake, AI-generated.”

Even before the advent of generative AI, fake seeds were already a widespread scam on the internet. As YouTuber Atomic Shrimp explored in a video last year, seeds for made-up flowers like “cat face flowers” that inexplicably feature the faces of felines are being sold for considerable amounts of money.

On eBay, for instance, 50 seeds for a “cute cat face orchid” are being sold for $6.68. Poorly photoshopped or possibly AI-generated images show the faces of cats perched in the middle of fantastical plants.

During his investigation, Atomic Shrimp noticed that dodgy seed vendors were all using similar “cookie-cutter sites,” which are “probably very easy, cheap, and quick to deploy from a template.” The sites are also likely “acting as a front end for seedy, pun intended, drop shipping operations where the fulfilment, assuming there is such, is coming from the same sellers that list the same dodgy scam seeds for sale on Wish, AliExpress, Amazon, eBay, and other marketplaces.”

But instead of selling preposterously photoshopped seeds for “rainbow tomatoes,” scammers are using new tactics in a new age defined by AI slop.

One account on TikTok is even recycling the concept of a “cute cat orchid” by animating the images and turning them into a whole video.

Another video shows an adult cat’s face literally blinking its eyes as its disembodied head is reincarnated in the shape of a demonic orchid.

“How have 107 people bought this?” one TikTok account wrote in the comments.

“I can’t believe people actually fell for this,” another added.

            <h2>Sequoia partner spreads debunked Brown shooting theory, testing new leadership</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/sequoia-partner-spreads-debunked-brown-shooting-theory-testing-new-leadership/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire is once again drawing unwanted attention to the prominent venture firm after falsely accusing a Palestinian student of being behind the December 13 Brown University mass shooting and the subsequent murder of an MIT professor.

In since-deleted posts on X, Maguire speculated that “it seems very likely” the student was the perpetrator, pointing to Brown “actively scrubbing his online presence.” In reality, authorities identified the shooter as Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national who was later found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility. Brown officials said they removed the student’s digital footprint as a protective measure against dangerous speculation.

Fast Company republished two of Maguire’s deleted posts on Friday (he has previously left inflammatory content online and did not delete comments he made proposing that the MIT professor was targeted for being Jewish). The incident follows months of controversial posts targeting Muslims and pro-Palestine activists, including calling New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani an “Islamist” in July. That post led to a swift online backlash, with nearly 1,200 founders and tech industry professionals signing an open letter urging Sequoia to take action. An open letter later surfaced supporting Maguire.

The newest episode raises questions about whether Sequoia’s new leadership — managing partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady, who took over last month — can or will rein in Maguire’s social media activity. Chief operating officer Sumaiya Balbale left the firm in August over Sequoia’s inaction on Maguire’s anti-Muslim comments, according to earlier reporting by the Financial Times. Former managing partner Roelof Botha, who stepped down in November, defended Maguire’s behavior during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt in October, calling Sequoia a believer in its partners’ right to “free speech.”

“Internally, we celebrate diversity of opinions, and we need ‘spiky’ people inside Sequoia,” Botha said, referring to Maguire. He offered that Maguire had a “specific profile” that appeals to certain founders. Maguire has led investments in numerous defense tech and AI startups, and reportedly has deep connections with Elon Musk’s companies, managing Sequoia’s investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI.

However, Botha acknowledged trade-offs to Maguire’s outspokenness. “Does it come with trade-offs? Yes, it does,” he said.

Lin and Grady have not publicly addressed Maguire’s conduct since taking over leadership.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for Maguire’s firing, telling Fast Company that his accusations are “deeply irresponsible and incredibly dangerous.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Resolve AI, a startup developing an autonomous site reliability engineer (SRE), a tool that automatically maintains software systems, has raised a Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to three people familiar with the deal.

The headline valuation for the fresh round is $1 billion, sources said. However, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at a $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder — likely a larger percentage of the round — at a lower price. This novel investment approach has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say.

The startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million, two of the people said. The size of the funding round couldn’t be learned.

Resolve AI and Lightspeed didn’t respond to our request for comment.

Founded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. The duo’s partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that was acquired by Splunk in 2019.

While human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time.

The automation addresses a growing challenge for companies. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues.

Last October, Resolve AI raised a $35 million seed round led by Greylock with participation from World Labs founder Fei-Fei Li and Google DeepMind scientist Jeff Dean.

Resolve AI competes with Traversal, an AI SRE startup that raised a $48 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Sequoia.

            <div id="article-text">Rocket Lab has won an $816 million contract — its largest to date — with the U.S. Space Development Agency as the company continues to diversify beyond its “rocket company” label.

The company said Friday that its subsidiary, Rocket Lab USA, was awarded a prime contract by the Space Development Agency (SDA) to design and manufacture 18 satellites. The satellites will be equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors for the agency’s Tracking Layer Tranche 3 program.

This contract is separate from an existing $515 million award to deliver satellites for the SDA’s Transport Layer-Beta Tranche 2 program. That program aims to provide a satellite communications network in low Earth orbit that sends encrypted, low-latency data to the military.

Together, Rocket Lab has SDA contracts valued at more than $1.3 billion.

Rocket Lab has expanded into defense and has more recently said it would bid for multibillion-dollar Department of Defense initiatives like Golden Dome.

            <div id="article-text">Updated at 12:40 a.m. on December 20, 2025

Late on the Friday afternoon before Christmas, and just hours before a deadline mandated by Congress, the Department of Justice released part of the trove of documents known, colloquially, as the Epstein files. The contents, most of which I’ve reviewed, are, at different times, unnerving, enraging, banal, even absurd (in the case of a photo of Jeffrey Epstein posing with a giant Winnie the Pooh mascot). More than anything, they are ████, which is to say, unknown, as many of the files are heavily redacted.

The majority of this tranche of files consists of thousands of documents containing more than 3,000 of photos of Epstein’s homes, in New York City and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, filled with art and photographs of nude and half-clothed women. One photograph in the files appears to be a framed mirror selfie of Epstein and Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist. There are photos of Epstein’s jet-setting lifestyle, a number of which depict either Epstein or his associate Ghislaine Maxwell with former President Bill Clinton. (Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison term for sex trafficking.) The photos appear to show Clinton reclining in a hot tub with a person whose face is redacted, at a table with the actor Kevin Spacey, with his arm around Michael Jackson, sitting at a table with the Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, and on what appears to be an airplane with a woman sitting in his lap (her face is redacted).

Representatives for Spacey, Jagger, and the Jackson estate did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement on X this evening, a spokesperson for Clinton said, “There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first.”

A couple images of President Trump appear to be in the files—one shows what appears to be his face among a series of photos on a desk, posing next to unidentified women. The files also include a legal complaint that alleges a verbal interaction between Trump, Epstein, and a 14-year-old girl. (In response to a request for comment, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson did not address questions about Trump’s appearances, and instead said that the Trump Administration is “the most transparent in history” and “has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.”)

Many of the images inside the files show Epstein and Maxwell having fun in exotic locations—private planes, helicopters, beach-side villas, yachts, unidentified mansions. Many of the unredacted image files are banal or not explicit. But a number of the redacted ones are, or at least are unnerving: scantily clad women in various poses, with much of their nude bodies and faces blurred out; a framed image of an unidentifiable person in pajamas on their knees in front of a photographer; entire scanned sheets of redacted image thumbnails labeled St. Trop/Clinton Morocco. Nude ████.

Much of what’s released in this batch of photos adds to what previously released emails and victim testimony have alleged—that Jeffrey Epstein lived opulently and kept company with presidents, and that his lascivious nature around young women was essentially an open secret among people who knew him. Out of the gate, the files seem to contain only a few genuine revelations, including a complaint about child sexual-abuse material dated from 1996, which alleges that Epstein stole photos of two girls and threatened the photographer. According to Maria Farmer, an employee of Epstein who filed the report, the FBI did not contact her for a decade.

The files do contain numerous sordid bits of evidence: a handwritten phone-call or voice mail summary from November 8, 2004, that reads, “I have a Female for him”; an Amazon receipt from 2005 for three books, including one titled Slavecraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude—Principles, Skills and Tools. Even the redactions reveal the scale of Epstein’s actions—a list of “masseuses” is completely redacted but contains 254 entries.

Despite the gigabytes of information, this phase of the Epstein files seems unlikely to put the Epstein conspiracy theorizing to bed. Likely, it will do the opposite—fuel speculation that plenty is missing or has been obscured. In a press release related to the release of the files, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote that the administration was “following through on President Trump’s commitment to transparency and lifting the veil on the disgusting actions of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.” But the extent of the redactions seem to undermine at least part of Bondi’s statement. While there is every reason to protect the privacy of Epstein’s victims, many bystanders in the file photographs have their faces obscured by large black squares. (This afternoon, Fox News reported that “the same redaction standards were applied to politically exposed individuals and government officials” as to victims; Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox that the Justice Department is “not redacting the names of any politicians’” and that &quot;there are no redactions of famous people.”)

There is also the matter of what the DOJ chose to release. Bill Clinton, for instance, is one of Trump’s political enemies. Trump, who reportedly knew and spent time in social circles with Epstein for years, and whose name appeared in previously released Epstein material from the House Oversight Committee, hardly shows up. In his statement, Clinton’s spokesperson, Angel Ureña, accused the administration of playing politics, claiming the timing of the file release was “about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever.”

It is difficult to know if the information in this phase of the files is simply the first in a series that will implicate people across the political spectrum or if this was the tranche that was easiest for DOJ lawyers to redact and clear for release. What is clear is that the administration, which dragged its feet releasing the files—Bondi first indicated the files were “on her desk” in February, nearly a year ago—has lost the benefit of the doubt. As my colleague Sarah Fitzpatrick reports, in the lead-up to the release of the files, Bondi and the Justice Department have kept Epstein’s victims in the dark about the release and, today, canceled a meeting between Bondi and victims at the last minute. (The victims were told Bondi had a medical appointment.)

On X, the White House is using information from the files to score political points. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reposted the photo that appears to show Clinton in the hot tub, with the caption: “Oh my!” As reported by Politico, Chad Gilmartin, a DOJ spokesperson, posted from his personal X account: “I wonder why the Biden DOJ refused to release the files…” (The post has since been deleted.)

So far, the conclusion from the immediate release of the files is that it has satisfied very few people. For Epstein’s victims—for whom this is not a conspiracy theory or bit of online drama—the files, and their redactions, bring little added transparency or accountability. For those looking for more evidence of Donald Trump’s personal relationship with Epstein or information about current administration officials, the files contain very little to go on. Aside from the taunting from the White House, the reaction on the right has been mostly quiet. Online, some (mostly anonymous) Trump voters or self-proclaimed patriots appear frustrated by the redactions in the current release.

In July, when the pressure truly began to mount to release the files, I wrote that the Epstein case was, in many ways, the perfect conspiracy theory because it mixes documented crimes with the tantalizing promise of uncovering some larger, elusive network of evil. What we know about Epstein—his celebrity and elite friends and associates who cozied up to him long after he became a sex offender, his proudly creepy public behavior, the wealth and power—makes what we don’t know seem that much more plausible and awful. It suggests that the QAnon-style fantasies of cabals of elite child trafficking ought not to be so far-fetched.

In recent months though, the Epstein files have evolved into something more akin to a cultural and political pain sponge. Every new disclosure only fans the flames, either feeding the public’s righteous anger over elite impunity or stoking suspicion that the public is being misled or not told the whole truth. The partial, obscured release of these files has been billed by the Trump administration as an act of bold transparency. But what it actually reveals is how, in an environment of broken trust, in an age where conspiracy theorizing has become the lingua franca of American politics, no amount of information may ever be universally satisfactory. The little black redaction squares that blanket the documents are ostensibly there to protect. But for many who’ve waited for this disclosure, they may also represent hope that on the other side of the square there might be justice, truth, and accountability. As long as those little black squares are there, that hope will be misguided.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Jeffrey Epstein’s victims began the day believing they might finally get something they’d been requesting for years: a direct conversation with the nation’s top law-enforcement official before the Justice Department made public a full trove of long-buried documents and photos. The release of the Epstein files, as the department’s hundreds of thousands of investigative materials have come to be known, might finally provide clarity on what the government knew about Epstein’s sex-trafficking scheme and when it knew it. The victims sat by their phones waiting anxiously—but also, they told me, with a bit of hope.

Just over 24 hours earlier, on the eve of the deadline for the files’ release, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche had placed a call to a group that supports survivors of Epstein’s abuse, according to multiple people briefed on the outreach. On the call, the officials previewed what would and wouldn’t be in the disclosure: photographs, yes; videos, no. Victims’ names would be redacted. At one point, according to a person familiar with the conversation, the officials suggested that if video exists, it may still be in the possession of the Epstein estate—an assertion that raised alarms among survivors who have long believed that recordings were used as leverage and blackmail.

This morning, the Justice Department indicated via email to the group that Bondi would try to speak with survivors and expressed support for them, according to people familiar with the correspondence. But soon after, they were told that the attorney general would not be available after all, due to a medical appointment. One DOJ official familiar with Bondi’s schedule told me the attorney general “was at Walter Reed today for a prescheduled routine appointment,” and emphasized that “no call was missed” because “that meeting was never scheduled.”

Meanwhile, Blanche appeared on Fox News and announced that the administration wouldn’t be hitting its deadline from Congress. Some files would be released, but many would not—at least not yet. Survivors were left with familiar feelings of disappointment and disillusionment, as well as unresolved questions: Why did the Trump administration change course last month on its promise to release all of the Epstein files if it wasn’t going to actually follow through? What was the government holding back—and why?

Sharlene Rochard first met Epstein in New York in the mid-1990s, when she was still a teenager. She told me that she has taken additional security precautions in and around her home in recent days, not knowing what would be released or whether she would be mentioned. She and other victims had asked the DOJ for advance notice and preparation for what was coming, she said, so that they didn’t find out what was in the files on television or social media. But she didn’t get that.

“I feel really disappointed,” Rochard said. “America is getting a look tonight into how we have all felt for years.”

The failure to schedule a call with victims was only one piece of a broader, frantic rush inside Donald Trump’s Justice Department as it approached the final hours of its congressionally mandated deadline. The Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed by Trump on November 19, requires the attorney general to make public, within 30 days, “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” in the DOJ’s possession that relate to Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The cache was believed to include flight logs, internal DOJ communications, and even records concerning the “destruction, deletion, alteration, misplacement, or concealment” of Epstein-related evidence.

The law tries to preempt a possible work-around by the DOJ. It explicitly bars the department from withholding, delaying, or redacting records because of “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity,” even for “any government official [or] public figure.”

Members of Congress and staff for the House Oversight Committee told me that they were alarmed by the DOJ’s silence in the days and hours before the release. Staff for Senator Jeff Merkley and Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie had repeatedly sought guidance from DOJ officials on what would be released and how the department was preparing. The lawmakers never got a response.

Victims said Bondi’s failure to talk with them prior to one of the most significant releases to date made them feel that those most harmed by Epstein’s crimes were just an afterthought. Marijke Chartouni was among the victims who had been hoping to talk with the attorney general before the files were made public. “Today marks a long-awaited moment for many of us,” Chartouni told me. “This is about truth, accountability, and confronting law-enforcement failure.”

When she learned of Bondi’s medical appointment, Chartouni said she was disappointed: “I wish her a speedy recovery. The timing is unfortunate and will only add to the arsenal of conspiracy theories.”

Khanna, a California Democrat, said that he and members of his staff had been in contact with victims last night, describing hopeful text messages and relief that there were efforts to pull together a meeting, even at the last minute. But Bondi’s failure to follow through with a meeting, he said, “shows her total callousness to the survivors’ trauma. She just doesn’t get it.”

A spokesperson for the Justice Department told me in a statement that, “within 24 hours of requesting a meeting, the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General responded and made time to speak to this group for Epstein survivors. Who this group decided to put on that call is not up to the AG and the DAG. The DOJ will not be disclosing the private details of the call out of respect for survivors.”

The brother of Virginia Roberts Giuffre—one of the most prominent Epstein survivors, who died by suicide in April—described the day as “huge” but heavy with dread. Sky Roberts tried to distract himself with Christmas shopping while he waited for the files to be released. His voice broke when describing his family’s pain during their first Christmas without his sister. He told me that he worried about what he called “smoke and mirrors”—a partial release dressed up as transparency. He said his sister had been very clear in her conversations with law enforcement about names of alleged co-conspirators and participants. He believed that the DOJ has in its possession evidence that “brings everything together.”

He said he hoped his sister’s decades-long efforts to hold accountable men who she and others alleged had participated in or enabled the sex-trafficking scheme would matter. “If those names aren’t coming out, then the whole exercise is just a cover-up,” he said.

When Blanche appeared on Fox News this morning, he confirmed that the DOJ would be releasing some of what it had. But it would not meet the deadline for making public all of the files, Blanche acknowledged, citing the need to protect victims’ identities and make the appropriate redactions in all documents. That, he said, could take more weeks of work by Justice Department lawyers.

Late this afternoon, the DOJ began posting on its website what it calls the first batches of records. It was a convenient moment: near the end of a Friday as Washington, D.C., emptied out for the holidays, and neither the House nor the Senate was in session. The files that were released appear to be a combination of some new material from prior investigations of Epstein, combined with documents and photographs that were already in the public domain. Some whole pages were redacted.

There were multiple new photographs of former President Bill Clinton, including an undated image that appears to be taken on a private plane with a blond woman sitting on his lap, her face redacted. The DOJ’s public-affairs department seemed intent on highlighting Clinton’s inclusion–-one post on X read, in part, “Do you not see Clinton’s face??”

Clinton has long denied any wrongdoing, and in a statement, his spokesperson emphasized that the former president was among those who “knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light.”

“The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” the statement said. “This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever.”

In a series of posts on X this evening, Representative Massie, a Kentucky Republican, said that the day’s release “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law” that Trump signed last month. When I talked with him late this evening, he told me, with reference to the Justice Department, “I can’t believe how badly they botched this.”

Roberts said he and his family were still working their way through the many thousands of pages of files. He described the experience as “surreal” and said that he felt a mix of appreciation and pride for his sister and other victims’ efforts over decades to get the attention of federal law enforcement. He and others I spoke with said they felt vindicated that included in the files released today appeared to be Maria Farmer’s report to law enforcement, which had never been seen before. It is dated September 1996, and it describes Epstein’s alleged possession of photographs of underage girls. “Epstein is now threatening [redacted] that if she tells anyone about the photos he will burn her house down.”

Information that Roberts said he had expected to be in the files didn’t appear to be there—such as the names of other prominent men who are believed to have been involved. “I feel like we’re still getting the same runaround we were getting before,” he told me, “where they’re kind of slow-rolling it and keeping what they want to keep from us.”

Khanna told me that he was discussing next steps with Massie and others on the oversight committee, which may include contempt of Congress or articles of impeachment for Bondi and Blanche.

“We’re exploring all options—including impeachment,” Khanna said. “They’re delusional if they think this is going to go away.”

            <h2>The United States of Donald Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-20</strong></p>

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

When President Donald Trump visited George Washington’s Mount Vernon in 2018, he reportedly showed little interest in the estate or in the first president. But Trump did have a critique of his predecessor. “If he was smart, he would’ve put his name on it,” he reportedly said. “You’ve got to put your name on stuff, or no one remembers you.”

The advice might seem “truly bizarre,” as Mount Vernon’s CEO described the visit to others, but Trump practices what he preaches. Yesterday, the Trump White House announced that the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts—which is chaired by Donald J. Trump, who was appointed to that role by Donald J. Trump, who also filled the board with fellow Trump appointees—would rename the venue the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. This was, the Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt opined, a tribute to “the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year” at the center, “not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction but also financially, and its reputation.”

This is a challenging claim from a factual standpoint. As The Washington Post found, ticket sales at the Kennedy Center have tanked since Trump’s hostile takeover of the institution in February. Patrons booed Trump and Vice President J. D. Vance at concerts this year. Events there have taken on an uncanny sheen of decay and mediocrity, my colleague Alexandra Petri reported after attending the Kennedy Center Honors last week.

The announcement is also challenging from a statutory perspective. The Kennedy Center’s name was bestowed by a law passed by Congress and can’t be changed by the board on its own. Tim Shriver, John F. Kennedy’s nephew, wrote on X, “Would they rename the Lincoln memorial? The Jefferson?”

Who’s to stop Trump, though? Workers began changing the signage this morning, and Congress seems unlikely to act; anyway, even if the name isn’t formally changed, nothing will prevent the president from calling it what he wants. Consider the Department of Defense, which the administration insists on calling the Department of War, despite the former name being established by law. Or more apropos, take the U.S. Institute of Peace, which was also established and named by Congress but which recently got a (rather premature) rebrand, with the facade now reading Donald J. Trump United States Institute of Peace. The gesture here is blunt. The president placing his own name before the nation’s is redolent of dictators in isolated countries—North Korea’s Kim family and Turkmenistan’s Saparmurat Niyazov, who even renamed January after himself—and long-ago absolute monarchs such as Louis XIV, who is said to have declared, “L’état, c’est moi.”

In line with his view of himself not merely as an elected representative but as father of the nation (or perhaps “daddy” of the nation?), Trump has put his name and image in places large and small. His scowling visage is next to George Washington’s portrait on National Parks passes; for good measure, citizens can now enter parks for free on Trump’s birthday, which happens to be Flag Day, but no longer on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. A new pay-for-play visa for the very rich is called the Trump Gold Card. The Treasury has proposed 250th-anniversary $1 coins with Trump’s face on them, a serious deviation from precedent. (The law bars printing money with images of living people on it but does not apply to minting coins.) Does anyone have any doubt what name he’ll put on his boondoggle ballroom at the White House?

This tendency is not new. Throughout his career, Trump has plastered his name on whatever he can, including many buildings, a hideous pair of sneakers, a bottle-water brand, a short-lived airline, a short-lived magazine, and a short-lived steak line. (At a 2016 primary-victory party, Trump displayed steaks bought at a local butcher but claimed that they were Trump Steaks.) The apotheosis came late in his real-estate career, when Trump had mostly stopped developing properties but continued to license his name to other builders. (Some Trump-branded buildings have removed his name in recent years, as his scandals and growing unpopularity have made it a liability.)

The difference is that those things belonged to Trump. The assets of the United States of America do not—they belong to the people. His change to the facade of the U.S. Institute of Peace is just graffiti. Putting his name on the Kennedy Center and parks passes are acts of vandalism of public property, in the most original sense of the word.

Many things in this country are named for former presidents, of course. The performing-arts center was established not by John F. Kennedy but as a memorial to him after his assassination. Trump, by contrast, is rechristening things for himself and then pretending it’s an honor rather than an ego trip. He asks not what he can do for his country, but what his country can name for him.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The Color of the Year Is an Exercise in Absurdity

Earlier this month, many attractive people filled a room in Lower Manhattan. They drank elaborate cocktails and gazed upon Instagram-y art installations and left with a gift bag that contained, among other things, earbuds studded with Swarovski crystals. The vibe was high-end, sophisticated, arty. The guest of honor was a color.

Pantone throws a party like this one annually, in conjunction with the announcement of its “Color of the Year.” For 2026, it’s “Cloud Dancer,” which, the company notes in a press release, “serves as a symbol of calming influence in a frenetic society rediscovering the value of measured consideration and quiet reflection.” The color, the release continues, also helps peel “away layers of outmoded thinking,” “making room for innovation,” and, of course, reminds us that “true strength lies not just in doing, but also in being.” (It’s white.)

Watch. Avatar is no longer trying to get anyone on board. But for the franchise’s devotees, Avatar: Fire and Ash (out now in theaters) is another thrilling installment, David Sims writes.

Explore. The most beloved Christmas specials are (almost) all terrible, Tom Nichols argued in 2021.

For many years, I kept a bottle of Trump Ice water on my desk. My first job in journalism after graduation was interning on the real-estate desk at The Wall Street Journal, where I talked with Trump for the first time. (He engaged in some fairly transparent puffery.) A veteran reporter, preparing to ship out to another assignment, jokingly gave me the bottle as a memento. I eventually got rid of it when I realized that it appeared to be leaching water even though the lid was sealed. Perhaps that was foreshadowing of the Trump administration’s approach to clean water.

The end of the article says that if Google wins their lawsuit then serp data will be harder to obtain.

What is serp data and what would we want it for?

Itâ(TM)s in its name. SERP = Search Engine Results Page. Theyâ(TM)re scrapes of Google SERPs. This is fallout from the Reddit license where Reddit decided to collect rent from Google and others for scraping their content. Apparently Reddit and Google decided to put Google only visible stuff on their pages (which is explicitly illegal under Googleâ(TM)s TOS, and has resulted in index banning) and then served up this secret content via SerpAPI.

&quot;A juxtaposition of what, on the surface, appears to be the case with what is actually the case&quot;, as the Wikipedia tells us.

google, which built its empire on bypassing security protections to scrape data, which it then showed to the users, is angry that someone shrewder is using the same approach - despite the many cases in court where the same google argued the exactly opposite point.

I&#39;ve wondered how they hadn&#39;t been sued before.

What if engineers were freed from working for &quot;be evil&quot; finance guys so they could develop software they wanted to use and share it because they got a generous, inflation-proofed basic income?

Honestly, this sounds like textbook monopoly behavior.

AWS just launched an European sovereign cloud region in Germany: https://aws.eu/ [aws.eu]

Your data isn&#39;t really &quot;safe&quot; with any of the large cloud providers.  If &quot;the man&quot; wants your data, they&#39;ll get it.

Yes. But Airbus will be ensuring &quot;the man&quot; is the European one.

Couldn&#39;t they run the EU data centers in some independent LLC HQ&#39;ed somewhere in Europe?

You would that they could structure this somehow so it would be independent of the US regulatory framework.

That is not what matters. What matters is whether there is a system administration possibility from the US. And there will be. Nothing except running this as a genuine European company will do and AWS/Microsoft/Google cannot really do that, since all respective R&D would also need to be European for this to actually work.

Obviously. This is a move away from US companies. Geolocation of clouds does not matter. What laws and coercions the provider is subject to is what matters.

This is the playbook again and again and fucking again. Step 1 - the US is a reliable resource that the world depends on. Step 2 - the US government decides that it would rather bend the rules for its benefit. Whether it means stealing money from Venezuela&#39;s government and give it to some random guy living in Miami, or whether it means forcing US companies operating cloud facilities overseas to make their subsidiaries comply with US demands to turn over data. Step 3 - the rest of the world decides that this

Is it asking too fucking much for the US to look into the future 5-10 years and NOT do stupid ass selfish shit that will be ultimately meaningless anyway?Is it too much to ask of the billionaire class of trumpistan, which runs the country, to look beyond the current deal that&#39;s on the table and NOT do stupid ass selfish shit that will be ultimately meaningless anyway?What do you think?

Is it asking too fucking much for the US to look into the future 5-10 years and NOT do stupid ass selfish shit that will be ultimately meaningless anyway?

Is it too much to ask of the billionaire class of trumpistan, which runs the country, to look beyond the current deal that&#39;s on the table and NOT do stupid ass selfish shit that will be ultimately meaningless anyway?

The problem is: if war ensues tomorrow (which it likely will), and US and EU end up on not-quite-the-same-side (which the POTUS pretty much made clear could be the case, as the US is not on anybody&#39;s side bit its own)... could then the US side take influence on the &quot;Euripean AWS&quot; Airbus cloud hosting?

See? That&#39;s why it&#39;s not sovereign even if they move AWS to EU.

In an effort to improve commercial planes, an U.S. cloud provider could be made to share their &quot;backups&quot; with a certain U.S. plane manufacturer (which has fallen on harder times times lately, regarding production quality and public perception), by the current U.S. administration.

At least, that is what AirBus is probably thinking, giving the tone in the quotes from the summary.

It&#39;s a matter of trust, and the trust relationship between the US and EU, as well as the UK, is breaking fast.

Worse, all of US cloud vendors have shown a lack of safety, outages, missteps, and uptime in 2025. As these entities are largely immune from prosecution in the US, it&#39;s better to have someone close at hand, whose neck you can wring with actual authority.

I&#39;m an American, and I don&#39;t trust these jokers, either. Big does not make better. The bleeding edge requires bandages, especially with AI infections becoming prominent.

At this point having an economic relationship with the territory of trumpistan is a larger risk than the risk of &quot;suffering high tariffs&quot; from the tariff king. Have you seen the &quot;AI&quot; bubble size? It is the largest and the fastest that we&#39;ve seen, dwarfing the 2007-08 bubble with even less to show for in terms of returns.

What do you think will happen if your country isn&#39;t well-isolated from it when it bursts in a few months?

Better fly Airbus and be tariffed than suffer a crash in a Boeing plane.

At least one good thing coming out of the Trump presidency: Europe finally waking up in this regard.

You really think this is a &quot;Oh shit, Trump!&quot; reaction?

These concerns have been swirling about for decades.  Why do you think Europe have been implementing so many laws about digital sovereignty and data rights over the past decade or so.

It used to be that recruiters/companies would get their hands on a list of Stanford CS 106B students and start offering them jobs (part time, summer, or even full time). Note: That class is laughably basic. I&#39;m talking like &quot;what&#39;s a linked list?&quot; type questions on the final exam.

I&#39;m talking like &quot;what&#39;s a linked list?&quot; type questions on the final exam.Some years ago, my boss, who had a PhD in EE from Stanford, told me that he didn&#39;t have a high opinion of undergrad CS students at Stanford.  The grad students were top notch, but he thought less of the undergrads.  In a way, it makes sense.  The undergrads at Stanford are smart, but they earned their way there based on high school work.  The grad students competed at the university level.

I worked in various positions in two FAANG companies for the last decade.We used to have &quot;intern season&quot; where we would compete to bring the best students in for internships and hopefully call dibs on the brightest. This is no longer happening, and the change was so sudden it left many nothing short of shell-shocked. C-suites all in a sudden think they can do without any workers, no matter the level. Headcount increases are systematically denied, vacancies are not backfilled. People are burning out like cinder and leaving in droves. Hell, my own manager resigned two days ago. I&#39;m also interviewing to leave this hellhole.

And all of this because some rich moron interacted with a chatbot smarter than them.

One thing doesn&#39;t really exclude the other. They&#39;re still investing billions in AI (I develop power delivery control systems for datacenters, and I&#39;m going nuts), that would be a very expensive smoke and mirrors.

Previously companies making bullshit products had to bid hard to acquire developers to write their stuff.  Now they are saving on the developers by sending that money to AI companies ... but it&#39;s still bullshit products.  We&#39;re due for another economic downturn to take the tide out and see who isn&#39;t wearing trunks, as Warren Buffett once put it, so that the developers left over can aggregate into fewer companies that are trying to do actual things.

&quot;some students are lowering their standards and joining companies they wouldn&#39;t have considered before.&quot;yeah, I also remember this moment when I graduated 30+ years ago. I came out of college with a list in my head of about three famous companies that I wanted to work for. Thing is, 99.99% of people don&#39;t work for those companies. Leaving college is a hard reality check for sure.

Of course, I didn&#39;t work in software - since we&#39;re talking about Stanford grads and software engineering, there has been a 25 year

Right now, which is absolutely too early to tell, the top 3 candidates in the poll were Newsom, AOC and Buttigieg.  Way to go Republicans it would be sweet justice if any of those end up President, you earned it.

A Wisconsin jury found state court Judge Hannah Dugan guilty of obstructing federal immigration enforcement on Thursday, delivering a victory to the Trump administration’s crusade against anyone—even judicial officers—who attempt to impede its mass deportation campaign. Dugan, a Milwaukee County Circuit Judge, helped a noncitizen evade ICE agents at the state courthouse by instructing him to exit the courtroom through a specific door. Agents apprehended him anyway, and prosecutors promptly charged Dugan with obstruction, a felony punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the jury’s verdict, and the dissonance of a legal regime in which the president can break the law with impunity while a judge faces prison for impeding an immigration arrest inside her own courtroom. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Judge Dugan allegedly pointed an undocumented immigrant to a side door in her courtroom to evade ICE agents. And now she has been found guilty of a felony offense. This verdict is so depressing in so many ways. Can we count them?

Mark Joseph Stern: We are living in a world in which the Supreme Court has granted sweeping criminal immunity to presidents—specifically, to Donald Trump—for actions that they take that fall anywhere within the “outer perimeter” of their “official responsibilities.” SCOTUS simply made that rule up in Trump v. United States. Yet there is a real doctrine of judicial immunity that has deep roots in American law. It provides an absolute shield against prosecution of judges for all actions taken in their official capacity. That has long been understood to include how judges direct activities within their courtrooms. Now, remember what Dugan allegedly did: She directed a criminal defendant in her courtroom to leave through a certain door so ICE would not arrest him, thereby preventing her from continuing to adjudicate his case. The Trump administration argued that Dugan should not receive judicial immunity for this act. And U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman agreed, paving the way for Thursday’s guilty verdict.

The idea that a judge can’t claim judicial immunity for the act of telling someone to leave through a certain door in her courtroom strikes me as absurd. Set aside professional penalties. How in the world can a judge face criminal prosecution for this conduct after Trump v. United States? The Supreme Court has now granted the president absolute immunity for ordering a sham investigation into a free and fair election in order to nullify valid votes and overturn the results. But Dugan can be prosecuted for this? I just can’t square those things.

I’m not saying that what Dugan did was unquestionably right or good. I am saying that when a judge in her robes, in her own courtroom, tells someone who is going to appear at her hearing to leave through a particular door, she is surely acting within the outer perimeter of her official duties. Certainly much more so than Trump was acting within the outer perimeter of his official duties when he attempted to secure himself another term by overturning the results of an election.

I think you’re making a subtle argument and it’s worth landing on it really squarely. It’s one thing to confer maximalist, seemingly boundless authority on the executive branch and on the president that, by definition, circumscribes the judicial role. But to aggressively chip away, cut away, minimize, and cabin the powers of the judiciary at the same time? That’s really salt in the wound, and a threat to an independent judiciary.

Let’s be clear: This is an effort to chill the conduct of judges, especially state court judges, who believe they should decide the case before them without worrying that ICE agents are going to ambush plaintiffs or defendants or witnesses and thwart their effort to carry out justice. That is what happened here. That is what is happening in many states around the country. Some, like New York, have tried to block ICE agents from going into state courthouses. This was Judge Dugan doing much the same thing; trying to contend with the fact that ICE was about to arrest someone who was due to appear before her.

I think the verdict shows a real failure of the jury to understand how vindictive and partisan this prosecution was, and to see the deeper issues lurking here. It’s awful that the U.S. attorney brought this case in the first place. I think the prosecutors who worked on this case should be ashamed of themselves. I guess my one consolation is that Judge Adelman is known to be a very lenient sentencer. If Dugan’s conviction is upheld on appeal, I think it’s unlikely that he’ll give her any term of confinement behind bars. She has no criminal record and there are no other factors that would call for a higher sentence. Adelman might impose house arrest, but probation seems more likely.

When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. convened a panel on Monday to discuss “chronic Lyme,” many leading researchers of the disease were genuinely excited. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services promised to allocate more resources to understanding the disease. There was hope, among experts, that this would mean an important new chapter for Lyme research.

But there’s a problem: Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist with seemingly little understanding of how modern science works. It didn’t emerge in Monday’s roundtable, but Kennedy, for example, once claimed Lyme disease was developed by the U.S. military as a bioweapon in the ’70s. He still maintains that the medical community has “gaslit” the public over Lyme and even asserted, without evidence, that during the Biden years, there were top officials within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who, due to political motivations, were “saying Lyme disease did not exist.”

This is not an ideal mindset to bring to any medical topic, but it’s particularly troubling for Lyme, given that it is already one of the most controversial diseases.

Active Lyme disease, identified in the 1970s, is not a particularly mysterious illness. The tick bite that transfers the bacteria typically causes an easily identifiable bullseye rash; once spotted, symptoms, which can include fever, headaches, stiffness, and fatigue, can be resolved with a round of antibiotics. The treatment of active Lyme is fairly straightforward. But the aftermath of active Lyme remains a deeply unsettled area of science. A subset of Lyme patients go on to complain of arthritis-like joint pain, fatigue, and neurological issues for years afterward. For a smaller population, the symptoms become debilitating. Some patients grow desperate and even suicidal.

Until recently, many mainstream medical professionals disputed the idea of “chronic Lyme” altogether, insisting that Lyme was done once it was treated with antibiotics. Any complaints the patients had afterward, they argued, likely resulted from other conditions or from psychiatric disorders, which can indeed cause severe physical symptoms. But patients don’t like being told something is all in their head, particularly when their lives are falling apart over a maddeningly persistent illness. As a result, a “Lyme community” began to form of patients who felt forced to become their own champions and validate one another’s suffering. Many looked for answers outside conventional medicine.

The rush of pseudoscientists, grifters, wellness influencers, and celebrity advocates into the space only made the chronic Lyme debate more fraught. Even the term “chronic Lyme” was, and is, highly charged: In medical literature, doctors call it Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, in part to clarify that they are not referring to a continuous, chronic infection with the bacteria but only to a constellation of symptoms that develop and linger after confirmed bouts of Lyme disease. The people this term doesn’t include are those—often self-diagnosed laypeople or the patients of anti-scientific practitioners—who believe that they have insidious Lyme infections missed by blood tests and persistent beyond any normal antibiotic treatment. (The research does not show any evidence for a chronic Lyme infection, experts said.) These patients never developed the rash or had any other concrete evidence of Lyme infection. These are the cases that caused many in the mainstream medical community to dismiss “chronic Lyme” as nonsense.

But mainstream scientists weren’t entirely ignoring the possibility of both undetectable and chronic Lyme, as much as Kennedy may insist otherwise. Many researchers agreed there was a need for better testing and that it was possible that real Lyme sufferers were going undiagnosed. And even in the earliest Lyme studies, experts said, the National Institutes of Health had attempted to suss out longer-term damage. The problem, said Dr. Brian Fallon, the director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, was that most Lyme research dealt primarily with “well-defined” patients—those with telltale rashes and active infection that showed on blood tests—in order to have clean, careful studies. Those patients were those with the easiest cases, with easy diagnostics and prompt treatment. The potentially messier cases, without rashes, or with long periods of infection without treatment, were not taken into account. The pace of the research moved relatively slowly, given that Lyme was never such an urgent problem. It is not deadly or contagious like Ebola or AIDS. For many patients, it’s more like a temporary inconvenience.

But two things changed. First, climate change has made Lyme an increasingly visible and pressing issue. As the tick population explodes across North America, Lyme has become a virtually inescapable threat in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. Second, a global pandemic struck. In its aftermath, research institutions turned their resources to questions about COVID’s long-term effects. As they did, they began to bring those same questions to other infectious diseases that might result in chronic conditions.

“It shouldn’t come as any surprise to the world right now that infections can cause chronic problems, because of what we have learned from long COVID,” Fallon said. “I think it’s helped tremendously in changing the conversation. … There’s a great deal of interest in looking at something that’s been ignored.”

It is now a potent moment for Lyme research. If scientists can get the funding and resources they need to develop better diagnostics and unlock the mechanism that explains what is making chronic Lyme patients sick, it could bring profound relief to hundreds of thousands of Americans, allowing them to get the care they need. But a large part of pursuing a major medical breakthrough is separating science from pseudoscience in order to allow the scientific process to proceed with its dispassionate methods. And Kennedy has shown that he is incapable of that—and is steering his HHS accordingly.

There are urgent reasons, beyond the success of future research, for the leading medical institutions in the country to try to purge the lingering anti-scientific elements in the Lyme conversation: They may actually put patients’ health at risk. When confusion meets desperation, as it does when the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health cannot provide any clarity, patients and doctors may seek out unconventional answers.

“A lot of these patients undergo bizarre, unapproved therapies, like extended intravenous antibiotic therapies, for months or even years,” Dr. Durland Fish, the chief executive officer of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, told Slate. “A lot of them are bogus.”

These treatments, Fish said, can be expensive, as they usually aren’t covered by insurance. And they can be deeply dispiriting when they don’t work. Some patients, he said, can become depressed and even suicidal.

And perhaps even more worryingly, if a patient becomes convinced they have chronic Lyme based on an influencer’s videos, they may be diverted from identifying something else. Part of the reason chronic Lyme has always been controversial is that its symptoms are so nonspecific. Fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and joint pain can be caused by anemia, sleep disorders, mental illnesses, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, ALS, fibromyalgia, cancer, and many other conditions.

“From my perspective, I think the misdiagnosis and mistreatment is a bigger problem than the actual Lyme disease,” he said.

Now, as chronic Lyme emerges from its era of hazy theories and pseudoscience, it continues to be tainted with its previous associations. As an example, New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who attended Monday’s hearing, slipped a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed Wednesday, requiring the Government Accountability Office to investigate whether Lyme disease was bioengineered by the U.S. military. (Lyme disease, it should be noted, predates the United States itself by millennia.) During Monday’s hearing, he complained that mainstream news media, including the Washington Post, had portrayed him and his allies “like we have a tinfoil hat on our heads.” Smith is a Republican, but conspiratorial thinking on Lyme is a bipartisan problem.

And few are as damaging to chronic Lyme’s reputation among skeptics as Kennedy himself. As head of HHS, Kennedy has baselessly attributed deaths to the COVID vaccine, connected both Tylenol and circumcision to autism, and linked SSRIs to mass shootings. In one throwaway comment in the hearing, he claimed that the antiretroviral drug developed during the AIDS epidemic under Anthony Fauci’s NIH killed more people than AIDS itself.

The panel he convened was similarly questionable. Participants were largely not the leading experts in Lyme research but instead patients, medical technology business owners, politicians, and people with out-there theories about the disease. One person claimed there was a connection between Lyme disease and autism—something no mainstream researcher seems to find credible. Another person, who is a patient and an HHS official, asserted that had she followed standard medical Lyme treatments, “I would be dead today.” Lyme disease is not a fatal disease.

Still, Fish, like the other experts, said that Kennedy’s NIH putting more resources into understanding chronic Lyme could be extremely helpful for the thousands of Americans struggling with mysterious symptoms. These patients, he said, need answers and better diagnostic tools.

“These patients have serious illnesses, and I don’t blame them for raising hell about the situation,” he said.

Lyme is a disease that makes sense as a target for Kennedy, as obsessing over chronic illnesses is a core tenet of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Kennedy has said one of his sons developed Bell’s palsy from Lyme and that one son developed severe, debilitating chronic Lyme. Kennedy is also, fittingly for his family’s reputation for being full of robust outdoorsmen, a big proponent of getting outside into the woods—advice being made dangerous by the ticks. He noted the “spiritual” value of the outdoors in his address Monday.

Lyme also makes some sense as a target for the moment, when there is no epidemiological crisis such as SARS or COVID or AIDS consuming all the oxygen in the conversation. Leading experts in Lyme say people are beginning to understand the “insidious epidemic” of Lyme, as Dr. John Aucott, the director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center, put it. He and Fallon expressed the need not just for studies and testing but an entire built-out academic infrastructure around it. Right now, most academic programs are struggling under federal budget cuts; Lyme research is one area where Kennedy’s personal interest may be of use.

For countless Americans, this could be great news. Aucott noted that he watched AIDS go from a death sentence to a manageable condition—proof that painstaking, rigorous research can revolutionize the understanding and treatment of a new disease. Today, he said, some of his Lyme patients are sicker than the AIDS patients were at the end of his time treating them.

Hopefully, Kennedy’s anti-science approach will not impede the evidence-based Lyme research that comes. His sloppiness, as when he repeatedly during panel discussions conflated Lyme disease and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, may not carry through to actual policy. And in at least one way, experts gave Kennedy credit on something else: He’s right, they said, that most people are not just sick from psychosomatic causes. “These are complex illnesses we’re just starting to understand,” Aucott said. “They’ve got a hard-to-explain illness. That doesn’t mean it’s just in their heads.”

But when diseases are particularly complex, and when the medical understanding of a topic shifts rapidly, it’s particularly damaging to have a man who consistently undermines the mainstream scientific community as the face of its public health response. The public needs clarity from its government, not just disruption. In this case, clarity doesn’t just mean validating suffering patients’ frustrations. It means acknowledging the limits of our knowledge while having an open mind—and focusing not on heated feelings but on the scientific process.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">hands on Infinite Machine, a New York-based electric vehicle startup, began with a stolen Vespa.

Eddie Cohen, president and co-founder of the company, told The Register that he and his brother Joseph were living together during the COVID outbreak.

&quot;His Vespa had gotten stolen and we just kinda had this crazy idea … if we were to design one for the future that was all-electric, had the best technology, what would it look like? What would it feel like?&quot; Cohen explained.

As I stood beside P1, a $10,000 electric seated scooter, and Olto, a $3,495 bike-lane legal class 2 e-bike, that question had been answered. The brothers&#39; company started shipping the P1 to customers in October and expects to deliver Olto in early 2026.

&quot;We just started dabbling and we came up with P1, you know, just a sketch,&quot; said Cohen, who had a background in product design. &quot;And then, over the subsequent two or three years, we just continued to noodle on it. Nights and weekends, we both had other jobs.&quot;

In January, 2024, he said, Infinite Machines became their full-time job. He and his brother assembled a team and began moving from sketch to actual product.

&quot;So P1 is a plated, M-class vehicle,&quot; said Cohen, meaning drivers should be licensed for motorcycles unless they only use it in Mode 1, where speed is capped at 30 mph.

&quot;It goes 65 miles an hour, 60-mile range. The battery is in the floor. It fits two people. It has a full touchscreen – 8.5&quot; display – that has what we call Phone Connect. So it connects to your iPhone, you get Maps. Music, etc. It has whisper-quiet acceleration. It&#39;s kind of like riding a Tesla for the first time, but it&#39;s even more surreal because it&#39;s silent.&quot;

The P1, said Cohen, was designed from scratch. &quot;All of the componentry is custom-toolled and developed. That&#39;s not a trivial thing.&quot;

He pointed to the fender for example. It&#39;s not off the shelf.

&quot;We designed it,&quot; he said. &quot;We made the tooling. We made the molds, and made it so that the engineering works just because we actually care about the details.&quot;

It&#39;s an opinionated design. The use of anodized aluminum and steel makes comparisons with the Tesla Cybertruck unavoidable. But the DMC DeLorean is an equally apt comparison, perhaps more so given the challenging nature of startup vehicle companies.

&quot;We were inspired by the Cybertruck,&quot; said Cohen, &quot;but we didn&#39;t set out to design the Cybertruck of scooters. We used it as one reference point in a lineage of vehicles, like Marcelo Gandini and the Lancias back in the day. The Diablo, the Countach, the DeLorean, like these are all references that we love.&quot;

Cohen added that the plan is to explore future colors, and variants for specific markets like police and other first responders.

Your correspondent had the opportunity to take the P1 for a spin in San Francisco and it was a thrill – it&#39;s fun, fast, and handles well. I&#39;m not by nature a rider of scooters or motorcycles, though I&#39;ve enjoyed the lazy ease of electric bikes. Were I a younger man, more willing to mix it up among motorists without the protection of an automotive frame, airbags, and a seatbelt, I&#39;d be looking seriously at the P1 or the more modest Olto for urban transportation.

The P1 includes just the right number of physical buttons, with well-conceived software and hardware. It features secure storage, front and rear cameras, phone-based keyless access, and GPS location tracking, among other niceties. It relies on a Linux fork called IMOS, Infinite Machine OS.

Presently, there&#39;s no AI on-board – which this reporter considers a selling point. Cohen recounted how someone had asked the company&#39;s head of systems what AI is being explored. &quot;He kind of was like, &#39;Look, they&#39;re expensive, right? You put a Nvidia chip on here and you put a camera and it&#39;s expensive. It adds to the [bill-of-materials] cost. And it&#39;s not obvious that there is value there.&quot;

He added however that the company has ideas for ways AI might be useful to improve the safety of two-wheeled vehicles.

Software applications for the vehicles will be developed in time. Cohen said that Infinite Machine does gather data to understand how people are using its vehicles, but does so in a way that respects privacy.

&quot;So we don&#39;t know anything about the individual rider and we have anonymized everything,&quot; he said. &quot;We care about rider privacy. We also care about, like, you buy this vehicle, it&#39;s just gonna work. Like you don&#39;t have to pay a subscription ever. It&#39;s just gonna work all the time and it&#39;s your vehicle. But we do anonymize and track usage.&quot;

Cohen said he expects the target market in the US will be those who appreciate technology and design. &quot;They want something that&#39;s new and they want the best,&quot; he said.

&quot;In 2025, the ultimate luxury is really time and freedom to do what you want. And P1 saves you time. It&#39;s the fastest and best way to get around any city like in San Francisco, this thing is liberating. It&#39;s amazing. It handles the hills totally well. You can park it anywhere. You don&#39;t have to spend 30 minutes looking for a spot. You get to live life on your own terms.&quot;

Cohen expects the Olto will have broader appeal.

&quot;For Olto, I think it&#39;s for everyone,&quot; he said &quot;I think it&#39;s the mom in Brooklyn dropping her kids to school. I think it&#39;s the person that is single and wants to commute to work. I think it&#39;s the SoCal kid that&#39;s going to school. This is an accessible vehicle. It&#39;s very easy to ride, very approachable, and affordable.&quot; ®

            <h2>ATM jackpotting gang accused of unleashing Ploutus malware across US</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/19/tren_de_aragua_atm/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Venezuelan gang described by US officials as &quot;a ruthless terrorist organization&quot; faces charges over alleged deployment of malware on ATMs across the country, illegally siphoning millions of dollars.

Two indictments were returned in Nebraska, collectively charging 54 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang in connection with a spate of ATM jackpotting attacks.

The gang allegedly deployed a variant of Ploutus malware on ATMs across the US. Court documents assert that TdA members would travel in groups and compromise ATMs managed by certain banks and credit unions.

The alleged gang members would inspect each ATM for external security features before opening the machine&#39;s door, checking for alarms being triggered or law enforcement rushing to the scene.

Once they confirmed a machine could be safely tampered with, the suspects would either remove the ATM&#39;s hard drive and install the Ploutus variant before reinstalling it, or in some cases simply replace the hard drive with one that already had Ploutus installed. Other instances saw the malware deployed using external thumb drives.

Thought to be first observed in Mexico back in 2013, Ploutus malware targets the cash-dispensing module of ATMs, allowing attackers to issue commands that force the machine to spurt out bills.

According to data shared by the Justice Department, ATM jackpotting attacks have seen more than $40 million stolen via physical device tampering and malware deployment since 2020. It did not share specific figures about how much of that could be attributed to TdA.

&quot;Tren de Aragua is not just a criminal gang; they are a ruthless terrorist organization that preys on communities, spreads fear, and bankrolls violence across borders,&quot; said Mark Zito, special agent in charge at HSI Kansas City.

&quot;HSI and our law enforcement partners will track you down, break up your networks, and ensure you never find safe harbor in the United States. Our mission is to protect American families from predators who think they can operate with impunity. We will not tolerate foreign terrorists stealing from our citizens and threatening our homeland. Our communities are safer today because of the relentless work of this team, and we are just getting started.&quot;

Across the various indictments against alleged TdA members in Nebraska over the past year are additional charges related to assault, money laundering, and sex trafficking of minors.

The announcement comes as the US announces a broader crackdown on the Venezuelan gang, with a slew of indictments across various states charging hundreds of alleged members since January.

The DOJ in Washington also unsealed indictments on Thursday related to other violent crimes committed by more than 70 alleged members, including murder, kidnapping, and drug trafficking.

Two of the group&#39;s suspected leaders were indicted in Colorado on various charges, including RICO offenses, while the alleged mastermind and co-leader of TdA, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, was charged in New York.

Flores remains at large, although there is a $5 million bounty on his head. The co-leader of TdA escaped from Venezuela&#39;s Tocorón prison in 2012, allegedly with the help of Jimena Romina Araya Navarro – another TdA leader – before being sent back in 2013.

Tocorón was notoriously lawless for years, but during the early 2000s, TdA began to assemble, and by the following decade, it assumed total control of the prison, infamously building amenities such as the Tokio nightclub, a zoo, a swimming pool, and more.

In 2023, Venezuelan authorities regained control of the facility in an operation that saw 11,000 officers storm the grounds, but Flores and his associates reportedly escaped days before.

In other states, New Mexico charged 11 alleged members over violent and armed crimes, and in Texas, more suspected high-ranking members and those in leadership roles were charged with cocaine trafficking, murder, and extortion.

The renewed focus on tackling TdA began in February when Attorney General Pamela Bondi expanded the remit of Joint Task Force Vulcan. Created in 2019, it was originally tasked with bringing down MS-13 gang members, but is now also responsible for handling TdA.

&quot;Immediately upon taking office, I directed the Department of Justice to fiercely pursue the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations,&quot; said Bondi.

&quot;This latest multi-state series of charges underscores the Trump Administration&#39;s unwavering commitment to restoring public safety, dismantling violent trafficking networks, and ridding our country of Tren de Aragua terrorists.&quot; ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Energy (DOE) has a Christmas gift for the AI industry in the shape of agreements for collaboration in the Trump administration&#39;s Genesis Mission, which aims to use AI to drive scientific discoveries.

On Thursday, the DOE said it had signed agreements with 24 organizations interested in working to advance the Genesis project.

The list includes the usual AI ecosystem suspects, with developers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI; major cloud operators AWS, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle; server makers Dell and HPE; chip suppliers AMD, Intel, and Nvidia; plus everyone&#39;s favorite Bond villain organization, Palantir.

However, the agreements are not contracts to provide services as such, but are described by the DOE as Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with organizations that have either expressed interest in response to a Request for Information (RFI), or which already have active projects with DOE and its National Laboratories for activities related to the Genesis Mission.

&quot;These agreements help advance President Trump&#39;s Executive Order to build the national AI platform for scientific discovery and uplift the entire US R&D ecosystem,&quot; said Genesis Mission director and DOE Under Secretary for Science Dr Darío Gil.

The Genesis project was kick-started just last month via an executive order issued by President Trump. It aims to create an integrated Science and Security Platform for the US by pulling together supercomputers and other resources across the DOE&#39;s 17 National Laboratories and supplementing this with input from industry and academia.

Earlier this month, the agency announced $320 million in funding for four initiatives as part of the project, including the American Science Cloud (AmSC) as the infrastructure platform for Genesis, the Transformational AI Models Consortium (ModCon) to work on model development, and various projects to curate existing datasets and develop AI models validated for scientific applications.

So-called neocloud firm CoreWeave is also among the signatories with the DOE, and the rent-a-GPU biz said that it plans to make its purpose-built AI cloud platform available to support advanced scientific workloads.

CoreWeave chief exec Michael Intrator said Genesis &quot;represents a vital national commitment to accelerating scientific discovery and reaffirming America&#39;s leadership in research and innovation.&quot;

Consultants McKinsey & Company recently opined that neoclouds such as CoreWeave needed to adapt their business model to offering services built on their AI infrastructure rather than just renting GPU time, and Genesis may prove just such an opportunity.

Google&#39;s DeepMind subsidiary is set to make available its frontier AI for Science models and agentic tools to scientists at the DOE National Laboratories, starting with AI co-scientist on Google Cloud, it declared.

This it described as a &quot;multi-agent virtual scientific collaborator built on Gemini,&quot; which has been trained using Google&#39;s cloud-based TPU AI chips.

OpenAI said that the agreement builds on its existing work with DOE&#39;s National Laboratories, and creates a path for the parties to discuss and develop potential follow-on agreements as specific projects take shape.

&quot;We&#39;re excited to collaborate with the Department of Energy and contribute to the Genesis Mission. When frontier AI meets the expertise of the national labs, it opens up new ways to explore ideas, test them faster, and accelerate scientific progress,&quot; said Kevin Weil, OpenAI VP for Science. ®

            <div id="article-text">Google says it’s complying with the Epic injunction by erecting new programs and fees.

Google says it’s complying with the Epic injunction by erecting new programs and fees.

Today was the deadline for Google to reveal how it’s complying with Judge James Donato’s order to crack open Android for third-party app stores, stop illegally tying its Google Play Billing system to its app store, and let developers link to ways to download their apps outside the Play Store in the US.

But Google isn’t just letting app developers do things however and whenever they’d like. The company’s quietly updated its support pages with a January 28th deadline to enroll in specific Google programs for “alternative billing” and “external content links” — and these programs will come with large alternative fees of their own, assuming Judge Donato doesn’t opt for Epic and Google’s proposed settlement instead.

While it isn’t collecting fees yet, Google says it will charge developers $2.85 for every app and $3.65 for every game a user installs within 24 hours of clicking a link that takes you outside Google’s app store to download them outside the Google ecosystem.

Plus, it’ll take a 20 percent cut of any in-app purchases and 10 percent of any auto-renewing subscriptions. Apps still need to be submitted to Google for review, use a Google API to track them, and developers have to report all transactions (including $0 free trials) if they want to participate.

Meanwhile, developers who want to offer their own billing solutions will only get a 5 percent discount compared to Google’s current fees, likely making it not worth the effort to try alternative billing at all. Google will charge 25 percent for in-app purchases and 10 percent for auto-renewing subscriptions there; devs will need to integrate a Google API to track those, and report all transactions within 24 hours.

The company will cap some of these fees at 10 percent of a developer’s first $1 million of earnings, making it a bit easier for small developers, but perhaps no easier than it is currently. Google already offers a similar cap at 15 percent, so this too is a 5 percent discount.

How will Judge James Donato react? When Apple told Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers it would require a 27 percent fee for external payments in the parallel Epic v. Apple case, she found Apple in contempt of court, and an appeals court backed up that decision just days ago. However, the appeals court did suggest that Apple may be able to collect some fee, writing that:

Apple should be able to charge a commission on linked-out purchases based on the costs that are genuinely and reasonably necessary for its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases, but no more.

Google currently claims that “the fees associated with the external content links program reflect the value provided by Android and Play and support our continued investments across Android and Play.”

But Google also says it won’t collect any fees quite yet, writing:

In the future, Google intends to apply a service fee on successful transactions and downloads completed via external content links. At this time, however, Google is not assessing these fees and is therefore not requiring developers in this program to report these transactions or downloads to Google.

In their joint progress report today, Epic and Google’s lawyers write that while Epic agrees with the January 28th deadline and other requirements, “Epic has indicated that it opposes the service fees that Google announced it may implement in the future and that Epic will challenge these fees if they come into effect.”

Of course, none of this will come to pass if Judge Donato accepts Google and Epic’s proposed settlement instead, which would generally apply worldwide (instead of just in the US) and comes with lower standard transaction fees.

But Google signaled that settlement, too, would come with fees on alternative billing and external app downloads, and Judge Donato seemed skeptical of the settlement in November. He’s ordered an evidentiary hearing on January 22nd before he makes a decision.

Since Google’s support pages seem to be fluid as Epic v. Google continues, we’ve archived copies of their current text below.

            <div id="article-text">ININ Games quickly walked back a statement saying Nintendo will offer smaller capacity cartridges for physical game releases on Switch 2.

ININ Games quickly walked back a statement saying Nintendo will offer smaller capacity cartridges for physical game releases on Switch 2.

On Friday, retro and arcade game publisher ININ Games surprisingly announced it’s been able to “recalculate production” on offering a physical version of R-Type Dimensions III for the Switch 2 because “Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2.” Physical games on the Switch 2 have been something of a contentious topic; full physical games are reportedly expensive for developers, while game-key cards don’t actually have the game on the cart.

But later in the day, ININ removed that line from its post and published a significant correction: “There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities. Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo.” However, it will still be able to offer the physical Switch 2 version of R-Type Dimensions III, though by tacking on €10 to the retail price.

Nintendo didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Solid information about why more developers don’t offer games fully on-cartridge is hard to find, though it may come down to cost. In May, a Brazilian Nintendo journalist reported that, based on leaks from Arc System Works, Nintendo only offered two types of physical games for developers: a 64GB cartridge and the game-key card. The YouTube channel Physical Paradise has also reported that the cost of a physical cartridge is “about” $16, “which is quite expensive.”

Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad, replying to ININ Games’ initial announcement about the new cartridge sizes, said on X that “cost was always the primary factor between key cards vs full cart releases.”

If you do, please email me at jay.peters@theverge.com or message me on Signal @jaypeters.11.

It’s unclear exactly how much more affordable additional cartridge capacity sizes could be or why the company might offer them to developers now. New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen tells me it could be because of the rising cost of memory; his two cents is that this “is in anticipation of memory going up in cost soon, allowing Nintendo to charge a more reasonable price especially for third-party games.”

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <h2>China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to deal with their aging batteries.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/18/1130148/china-ev-battery-recycle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
