            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/how-far-does-5000-go-when-you-want-an-electric-car/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve been thinking about used electric vehicles lately. It’s not news that EVs depreciate faster than gasoline-powered cars. All the incentives like tax credits and OEM rebates that entice the first owner to sign the paperwork are factored in by whoever wants to be the second owner. There are widespread—if mostly ill-founded—worries about battery longevity and having to shell out for expensive replacement packs. Technology keeps improving, which means older models will date faster. Plus, there are the usual concerns about EVs, like charging infrastructure and winter performance.

So depreciate they do, and that’s good news for the three-quarters of US car buyers who buy used vehicles. It means that some very expensive EVs can now be had for quite little, but we’ll explore that more at a later date. Today, I want to focus on what you can get for peanuts. What if you wanted to only spend $5,000—or less—on an EV?

As it turns out, there are options even at this end of the market. Just don’t expect that much in the way of range: We’re still a while away from a $5,000 EV also being an EV a sane person would want to road trip. At the same time, most of us don’t drive more than 40 miles a day, and EVs are great at sitting in traffic because there’s no engine to idle. If you’re not commuting long distances and don’t live an hour from the nearest town, a cheap EV could make sense as a runabout. Especially as they’re cheaper to run than a gas-powered car.

However, since it doesn’t go without saying, let me state this clearly: Only buy an EV if you have a reliable place to plug it in at night. These EVs have small batteries, so a regular 120 V AC level 1 charger should probably be fine. But none will be able to take advantage of the latest hardware from Electrify America or Tesla Superchargers, which means the growth in public fast-charging infrastructure isn’t really relevant to these cars.

The first-generation Nissan Leaf was the best-selling early EV, so it’s no surprise that it’s the most common EV you’ll find under our budget. The car didn’t have that much range to begin with, with a battery capacity of just 24 kWh at launch. And Nissan’s decision not to liquid-cool the battery pack means this EV battery will degrade more significantly over time than virtually any other modern EV. Essentially, the first- and second-generation Leafs are responsible for the general distrust of EV battery longevity.

Used Leafs can be had for less than $2,000, but below a certain point, they become economical to strip for spares, particularly the battery packs, which can have a second life as static storage. But what if you don’t want a Leaf?

Well, there’s the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, which will always hold a spot in my heart because it was the first car I tested for Ars Technica. I’ll always remember how quickly its skinny front tires were overwhelmed into understeer on a highway interchange. Its one-box pod-on-wheels design still looks different from almost anything else on an American road, and it’s very compact for city life. But its battery pack was just 16 kWh when new, and it’s certainly less than that now, so it helps if you live in a compact city.

Other choices lean more toward compliance cars, like the Chevrolet Spark EV or a Fiat 500e. A few Volkswagen e-Golfs and electric Ford Focuses might show up in this price range, too, and I’m seeing a couple of Kia Soul EVs and even a pair of very cheap BMW i3s just within budget. And I do like the i3.

However, something to consider is how wide to cast one’s net. Sites like Autotrader will happily let me search for cars across the entire country, but could I drive an i3 home to DC from Florida or Texas? An e-Golf from California? At this price point, charging will be level 2 at best, and stops would need to be more frequent than the “every 50 miles” we were shooting for under the Biden-era NEVI plan. While buying a bunch of very cheap EVs far away and seeing who gets closest to home would undoubtedly make for an entertaining video series, in the real world, a long-distance purchase probably needs to factor in the cost of shipping the car.</div>

            <h2>NASA faces a crucial choice on a Mars spacecraft—and it must decide soon</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasa-faces-a-crucial-choice-on-a-mars-spacecraft-and-it-must-decide-soon/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A consequential debate that has been simmering behind closed doors at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, must soon come to a head. It concerns the selection of the next spacecraft the agency will fly to Mars, and it could set the tone for the next decade of exploration of the red planet.

What everyone agrees on is that NASA needs a new spacecraft capable of relaying communications from Mars to Earth. This issue has become especially acute with the recent loss of NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft. NASA’s best communications relay remains the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has now been there for 20 years.

Congress cared enough about this issue to add $700 million in funding for a “Mars Telecommunications Orbiter” in the supplemental funding for NASA provided by the “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed by the US Congress last year.

However, this legislation, led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, raised a couple of key questions. The first is the wording of the bill, which specified that the orbiter must be selected from among US companies that “received funding from the Administration in fiscal year 2024 or 2025 for commercial design studies for Mars Sample Return; and proposed a separate, independently launched Mars telecommunication orbiter supporting an end-to-end Mars sample return mission.”

The reference to “commercial design studies” referred to companies that proposed faster and more affordable missions to return samples from Mars, selected in 2024. Several observers told Ars the language included here appeared designed to favor Rocket Lab and its proposal for a telecommunications orbiter.

The other curious thing about the Cruz language is that it specified $700 million for the spacecraft and its launch, which seems like overkill.

“$500 million is plenty for a communications payload, satellite bus, and launch,” one knowledgeable industry official told Ars. “I actually think those functions could be provided for well below $500 million.”

NASA’s new administrator, Jared Isaacman, has been dealing with a lot of issues since being sworn in a little more than a month ago, including the impending launch of the Artemis II mission, now scheduled for no earlier than February 8. However, time is running out to deal with the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter.

That’s because the legislation requires funding for the spacecraft to be obligated “not later than fiscal year 2026,” which ends on September 30, 2026. The mission would also need to be awarded soon to allow a spacecraft to launch in late 2028, the earliest feasible launch window to Mars. It’s notable that NASA has no spacecraft presently scheduled to launch to Mars in the 2026 window, so the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter is potentially the only vehicle the space agency would launch to Mars during the second Trump administration, which wants to make its mark on the red planet.

All of this adds fuel to the internal debate at NASA about the design and scope of the competition to award a Mars Telecommunications Orbiter.

Given the available funding, a number of people within the agency are pressing to include scientific instruments on the orbiter. Three good instruments could be added for about $200 million, a science official said. Ideas include everything from a high-resolution camera (again, badly needed since the best camera at Mars is on the 20-year-old Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter), a space weather payload, a magnetometer to understand Mars’ remnant magnetic field, or a spectrometer to look for near-surface water ice. It’s possible that some instruments from the canceled Mars Ice Mapper mission could also be repurposed or even a small lander included.

“To me, it seems like an easy decision,” said Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society. Adding a package of science instruments to a mission already headed to Mars aligns with NASA’s goal of maximizing science and exploring the potential of rapidly developed, low-cost science experiments, he added. “This project is already going to Mars, and science would add real value.”

However, some leaders within NASA see the language in the Cruz legislation as spelling out a telecommunications orbiter only and believe it would be difficult, if not impossible, to run a procurement competition between now and September 30th for anything beyond a straightforward communications orbiter.

In a statement provided to Ars by a NASA spokesperson, the agency said that is what it intends to do.

“NASA will procure a high-performance Mars telecommunications orbiter that will provide robust, continuous communications for Mars missions,” a spokesperson said. “NASA looks forward to collaborating with our commercial partners to advance deep space communications and navigation capabilities, strengthening US leadership in Mars infrastructure and the commercial space sector.”

Even so, sources said Isaacman has yet to decide whether the orbiter should include scientific instruments. NASA could also tap into other funding in its fiscal year 2026 budget, which included $110 million for unspecified “Mars Future Missions,” as well as a large wedge of funding that could potentially be used to support a Mars commercial payload delivery program.

The range of options before NASA, therefore, includes asking industry for a single telecom orbiter from one company, asking for a telecom orbiter with the capability to add a couple of instruments, or creating competition by asking for multiple orbiters and capabilities by tapping into the $700 million in the Cruz bill but then augmenting this with other Mars funding.

One indication that this process has been muddied within NASA came a week ago, when the space agency briefly posted a “Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition, Extension” notice on a government website. It stated that the agency “will only conduct a competition among vendors that satisfy the statutory qualifications.” The notice also listed the companies eligible to bid based on the Cruz language: Blue Origin, L3Harris, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Rocket Lab, SpaceX, Quantum Space, and Whittinghill Aerospace.

This justification, known in industry parlance as a JOFOC, was then taken down almost immediately. A user on the social media site X captured a screenshot before it was removed, however.

Sources suggested that the brief appearance of this document indicates that NASA is concerned about running a competition in the coming months and recognizes that any protests could delay the awarding of funds beyond September 30, when they would return to the treasury. A JOFOC would limit companies’ ability to protest and delay awards.

For the commercial space companies, this will be a consequential decision. Lockheed Martin has a long and storied history of providing quality spacecraft in orbit around Mars and will seek to protect its turf. But new space entrants Rocket Lab, Blue Origin (with a design based on its Blue Ring spacecraft), and SpaceX (likely using a modified Starlink V3 satellite) would all like to break into the planetary spacecraft competition and have been working on their spacecraft. As a result, they might have a better chance of making a 2028 Mars window.

“We’re pushing hard on the MTO,” Rocket Lab CEO Pete Beck told Ars in November. “The reality is that if you’re going to do anything on Mars, whether it’s scientific or human, you’ve got to have the comms there. It’s just basic infrastructure you’ve got to have there first. It’s all very well to do all the sexy stuff and put some humans in a can and send them off to Mars. That’s great. But everybody expects the communication just to be there, and you’ve got to put the foundations in first. So we think that’s a really important mission, and something that we can do, and something we can contribute to the first humans landing on Mars.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.27 of the Rocket Report! If all goes well this weekend, NASA will complete a wet dress rehearsal test of the Space Launch System rocket in Florida. This is the final key test, in which the rocket is fueled and brought to within seconds of engine ignition, before the liftoff of the Artemis II mission. This is set to occur no earlier than February 6. Ars will have full coverage of the test this weekend.

Why did the UK abandon Orbex? European Spaceflight explores the recent announcement that British launch company Orbex is preparing to sell the business to The Exploration Company in close cooperation with the UK government. This represents a reversal from early 2025, when the United Kingdom appeared prepared to back Orbex as a means of using British rockets to launch British satellites into space. Now the government is prepared to walk away. So what happened? “There are still too many unknowns to count, and the story is far from told,” the publication states.

Why would someone want to buy Orbex? … My sense is that there is not too much of a mystery here. UK space officials probably looked under the hood of what hardware Orbex had developed and its current financial status and likely decided that the company had a low probability of reaching orbit even with a significant infusion of cash. Also curious is a decision by The Exploration Company, which builds spaceships, to consider acquiring Orbex. The European Spaceflight article speculates that this could be to capture funding through the UK’s share of the European Launch Challenge, rather than any faith in Orbex’s ability to launch its vehicles. That sounds plausible.

Canada Rocket Company emerges from stealth. A Toronto-based launch startup, Canada Rocket Company, emerged from stealth earlier this month with the announcement of a $6.2 million CDN ($4.5 million) seed funding round—and with plans to create sovereign light- and medium-lift launch capabilities, Payload reports. According to CEO Hugh Kolias, the company was founded late last year in response to Canada’s rapidly increasing investment in the space domain.

A quick deadline … Canada is concerned about relations with the United States, where it has long turned for access to space. Accordingly, last November, the country announced its Launch the North challenge, committing $105 million CDN ($75.7 million) in public funds to help stand up sovereign launch capabilities. However,  the Launch the North challenge incentivizes companies that are on track to reach orbit by 2028. The new company’s strategy to meet the aggressive 2028 deadline is to build a scalable architecture around a familiar methalox engine and field much of the tech with mature subsystems from the Canadian and European ecosystem.

Vega C nabs Brazilian launch contract. A Brazilian government agency will launch an Earth observation satellite on a Vega C rocket, Space News reports. Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, known by the Portuguese acronym INPE, said Tuesday it will launch the Amazonia-1B satellite on a Vega C in 2027. Curiously, INPE contracted not with Avio, which is assuming responsibility for Vega C launch services, but with SpaceLaunch, a Texas-based launch broker.

Launch price disclosed … Marcy Mabry, co-founder and chief executive of SpaceLaunch, said she previously worked with INPE to arrange the launch of Amazonia-1 while at Spaceflight, a launch services provider later acquired by Firefly Aerospace. That spacecraft launched on an Indian PSLV rocket in 2021. The companies did not disclose the value of the contract. However, a January 21 Brazilian procurement document states that the contract between INPE and SpaceLaunch is worth 188.2 million Brazilian real ($35.6 million). This is a rare public data point for the cost of a Vega launch.

Russia reportedly testing plasma engine. Indian Defence Review reports that Russia is testing a new plasma propulsion system that may accelerate future missions to Mars, reducing travel time from multiple months to just one or two. The engine, developed by Rosatom’s Troitsk Institute, is now in ground-based trials but could be space-ready by 2030. The propulsion system uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate hydrogen particles.

Is it real? … According to the publication, a prototype of the engine is operating at 300 kilowatts, and it has already demonstrated a service life of 2,400 hours. If so, the engine has already surpassed the experimental VASIMR electrothermal engine under development in Houston by former NASA astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz. Regardless, I would advise caution about engines that may work in the lab but struggle in the outerspace environment. Moreover, such achievements are likely to be hyped, so it’s difficult to know where reality lies in Russia. (submitted by tbnelson777)

SpaceX and xAI may merge. Elon Musk’s SpaceX and xAI are in discussions to merge ahead of a blockbuster public offering planned for later this year, Reuters reports. The plan would give ‌fresh momentum to SpaceX’s effort to launch data centers into orbit as Musk battles for supremacy in the rapidly escalating AI race against tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI. Under the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX. Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction.

Is this inevitable? … SpaceX is already the world’s most valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, according to The Wall Street Journal. Musk has previously confirmed that SpaceX plans to go public sometime this year, with a valuation expected above $1 trillion. Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, last week, Musk said, “The lowest cost place to put AI will be in space. And that will be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.”

How a 5-ton satellite fell off a Japanese rocket. The H3 is a relatively new vehicle, with last month’s launch marking the eighth flight of Japan’s flagship rocket. It lifted off from Tanegashima Island in southern Japan on December 22, local time, carrying a roughly 5-ton navigation satellite into space. The rocket was supposed to place the Michibiki 5 satellite into an orbit ranging more than 20,000 miles above the Earth. Everything was going well until the H3 jettisoned its payload fairing, the two-piece clamshell covering the satellite during launch, nearly four minutes into the flight.

And then? … Something went wrong when the rocket released its payload shroud. Video beamed back from the rocket’s onboard cameras showed a shower of debris surrounding the satellite, which started wobbling and leaning in the moments after fairing separation. Sensors also detected sudden accelerations around the attachment point connecting the spacecraft with the top of the H3 rocket. In a new report, Ars explores new information released by JAXA that shows the satellite effectively fell off the rocket. It appears to be an entirely novel failure mechanism.

FAA expects continuing growth in launches. The Federal Aviation Administration office that regulates commercial spaceflight expects continued growth in launches, Space News reports. Speaking at the Global Spaceport Alliance’s Spaceport Summit on January 27, Minh Nguyen, deputy associate administrator for commercial space transportation at the FAA, said his office licensed 205 operations in 2025, including launches and reentries, a 25 percent increase from 2024.

Double again in a few years … “The acceleration in commercial space transportation has consistently exceeded our expectations. We’re seeing remarkable growth year after year,” he said. The 2025 total, he added, was 12 percent above the high end of the FAA’s forecast for the year. The FAA expects that growth to continue, with projections showing the number of licensed operations could double by 2029. That growth has put pressure on the FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, known as AST, to keep up with the increased cadence.

ESA to study Falcon 9 breakup over Poland. The European Space Agency has published a call to tender for a study examining the reentry and breakup of a SpaceX Falcon 9 upper stage in February last year, European Spaceflight reports. In the early hours of February 19, 2025, a Falcon 9 second stage underwent an uncontrolled atmospheric re-entry over Poland. At least four fragments of the stage survived re-entry and landed in various locations across the country. While no one was injured and no property was damaged, at least one fragment landed in a populated area.

Not just an academic study … ESA hopes to use data collected during the reentry of the Falcon 9 upper stage over Poland to help predict the risks associated with the re-entry of elongated upper stages. There are currently considerable uncertainties surrounding the physics and dynamics of destructive reentry in the very low-Earth orbit regime, below 150km. It’s not an academic study, as in 2015 there were approximately 80 orbital rocket launches. A decade on, that figure has almost quadrupled, with 317 successful orbital rocket launches occurring in 2025. (submitted  by EllPeaTea)

SpaceX targets mid-March for next Starship launch. The company plans to launch Starship’s next test flight in six weeks, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Sunday, January 25, Space.com reports. The flight will be the 12th overall for Starship but the first of the bigger, more powerful, and much-anticipated “Version 3” (V3) iteration of the vehicle.

A better engine … Starship V3 is slightly taller than V2—408.1 feet (124.4 meters) vs. 403.9 feet (123.1 m), but considerably more powerful. V3 can loft more than 100 tons of payload to low-Earth orbit, compared to about 35 tons for V2, according to Musk. The increased brawn comes courtesy of Raptor 3, a new variant of the engine that will fly for the first time on the upcoming test mission. SpaceX is hoping it proves more reliable than V2 as well.

Seeking information about Challenger artifacts. Back in 2010, Robert Pearlman of CollectSpace bought a batch of 18 space shuttle-era “Remove Before Flight” tags on eBay. It was only later that he pieced together that these tags were, in fact, removed from the external tank of STS 51-L, the ill-fated flight of space shuttle Challenger in 1986. He wrote about the experience on Ars.

How did they get to eBay? … “When the tags were first identified, contacts at NASA and Lockheed, among others, were unable to explain how they ended up on eBay and, ultimately, with me,” Pearlman said. He wants to gather more information about the provenance of the tags so that he can donate them to museums, with their full backstory.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/inside-nvidias-10-year-effort-to-make-the-shield-tv-the-most-updated-android-device-ever/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It took Android devicemakers a very long time to commit to long-term update support. Samsung and Google have only recently decided to offer seven years of updates for their flagship Android devices, but a decade ago, you were lucky to get more than one or two updates on even the most expensive Android phones and tablets. How is it, then, that an Android-powered set-top box from 2015 is still going strong?

Nvidia released the first Shield Android TV in 2015, and according to the company’s senior VP of hardware engineering, Andrew Bell, supporting these devices has been a labor of love. And the team at Nvidia still loves the Shield. Bell assures us that Nvidia has never given up, even when it looked like support for the Shield was waning, and it doesn’t plan to stop any time soon.

Gaming has been central to Nvidia since its start, and that focus gave rise to the Shield. “Pretty much everybody who worked at Nvidia in the early days really wanted to make a game console,” said Bell, who has worked at the company for 25 years.

However, Nvidia didn’t have what it needed back then. Before gaming, crypto, and AI turned it into the multi-trillion-dollar powerhouse it is today, Nvidia had a startup mentality and the budget to match. When Shield devices began percolating in the company’s labs, it was seen as an important way to gain experience with “full-stack” systems and all the complications that arise when managing them.

“To build a game console was pretty complicated because, of course, you have to have a GPU, which we know how to make,” Bell explained. “But in addition to that, you need a CPU, an OS, games, and you need a UI.”

Through acquisitions and partnerships, the pieces of Nvidia’s fabled game console slowly fell into place. The purchase of PortalPlayer in 2007 brought the CPU technology that would become the Tegra Arm chips, and the company’s surging success in GPUs gave it the partnerships it needed to get games. But the UI was still missing—that didn’t change until Google expanded Android to the TV in 2014. The company’s first Android mobile efforts were already out there in the form of the Shield Portable and Shield Tablet, but the TV-connected box is what Nvidia really wanted.

“Selfishly, a little bit, we built Shield for ourselves,” Bell told Ars Technica. “We actually wanted a really good TV streamer that was high-quality and high-performance, and not necessarily in the Apple ecosystem. We built some prototypes, and we got so excited about it. [CEO Jensen Huang] was like, ‘Why don’t we bring it out and sell it to people?’”

The first Shield box in 2015 had a heavy gaming focus, with a raft of both local and cloud-based (GeForce Now) games. The base model included only a game controller, with the remote control sold separately. According to Bell, Nvidia eventually recognized that the gaming angle wasn’t as popular as it had hoped. The 2017 and 2019 Shield refreshes were more focused on the streaming experience.

“Eventually, we kind of said, ‘Maybe the soul is that it’s a streamer for gamers,’” said Bell. “We understand gamers from GeForce, and we understand they care about quality and performance. A lot of these third-party devices like tablets, they’re going cheap. Set-top boxes, they’re going cheap. But we were the only company that was like, ‘Let’s go after people who really want a premium experience.’”

And premium it is, offering audio and video support far beyond what you find in other TV boxes, even years after release. The Shield TV started at $200 in 2015, and that’s still what you’ll pay for the Pro model to this day. However, Bell notes that passion was the driving force behind bringing the Shield TV to market. The team didn’t know if it would make money, and indeed, the company lost money on every unit sold during the original production run. The 2017 and 2019 refreshes were about addressing that while also emphasizing the Shield’s streaming media chops.

Update support for Internet-connected devices is vital—whether they’re phones, tablets, set-top boxes, or something else. When updates cease, gadgets fall out of sync with platform features, leading to new bugs (which will never be fixed) and security holes that can affect safety and functionality. The support guarantee attached to a device is basically its expiration date.

“We were all frustrated as buyers of phones and tablets that you buy a device, you get one or two updates, and that’s it!” said Bell. “Early on when we were building Shield TV, we decided we were going to make it for a long time. Jensen and I had a discussion, and it was, ‘How long do we want to support this thing?’ And Jensen said, ‘For as long as we shall live.’”

In 2025, Nvidia wrapped up its tenth year of supporting the Shield platform. Even those original 2015 boxes are still being maintained with bug fixes and the occasional new feature. They’ve gone all the way from Android 5.0 to Android 11 in that time. No Android device—not a single phone, tablet, watch, or streaming box—has gotten anywhere close to this level of support.

The best example of Nvidia’s passion for support is, believe it or not, a two-year gap in updates.

Across the dozens of Shield TV updates, there have been a few times when fans feared Nvidia was done with the box. Most notably, there were no public updates for the Shield TV in 2023 or 2024, but over-the-air updates resumed in 2025.

“On the outside, it looked like we went quiet, but it’s actually one of our bigger development efforts,” explained Bell.

The origins of that effort, surprisingly, stretch back years to the launch of the Nintendo Switch. The Shield runs Nvidia’s custom Tegra X1 Arm chip, the same processor Nintendo chose to power the original Switch in 2017. Soon after release, modders discovered a chip flaw that could bypass Nintendo’s security measures, enabling homebrew (and piracy). An updated Tegra X1 chip (also used in the 2019 Shield refresh) fixed that for Nintendo, but Nvidia’s 2015 and 2017 Shield boxes ran the same exploitable version.

Initially, Nvidia was able to roll out periodic patches to protect against the vulnerability, but by 2023, the Shield needed something more. Around that time, owners of 2015 and 2017 Shield boxes had noticed that DRM-protected 4K content often failed to play—that was thanks to the same bug that affected the Switch years earlier.

With a newer, non-vulnerable product on the market, many companies might have just accepted that the older product would lose functionality, but Nvidia’s passion for Shield remained. Bell consulted Huang, whom he calls Shield customer No. 1, about the meaning of his “as long as we shall live” pledge, and the team was approved to spend whatever time was need to fix the vulnerability on the first two generations of Shield TV.

According to Bell, it took about 18 months to get there, requiring the creation of an entirely new security stack. He explains that Android updates aren’t actually that much work compared to DRM security, and some of its partners weren’t that keen on re-certifying older products. The Shield team fought for it because they felt, as they had throughout the product’s run, that they’d made a promise to customers who expected the box to have certain features.

In February 2025, Nvidia released Shield Patch 9.2, the first wide release in two years. The changelog included an unassuming line reading, “Added security enhancement for 4K DRM playback.” That was the Tegra X1 bug finally being laid to rest on the 2015 and 2017 Shield boxes.

The refreshed Tegra X1+ in the 2019 Shield TV spared it from those DRM issues, and Nvidia still hasn’t stopped working on that chip. The Tegra X1 was blazing fast in 2015, and it’s still quite capable compared to your average smart TV today. The chip has actually outlasted several of the components needed to manufacture it. For example, when the Tegra chip’s memory was phased out, the team immediately began work on qualifying a new memory supplier. To this day, Nvidia is still iterating on the Tegra X1 platform, supporting the Shield’s continued updates.

“If operations calls me and says they just ran out of this component, I’ve got engineers on it tonight looking for a new component,” Bell said.

Nvidia has put its money where its mouth is by supporting all versions of the Shield for so long. But it’s been over six years since we’ve seen new hardware. Surely the Shield has to be running out of steam, right?

Not so, says Bell. Nvidia still manufactures the 2019 Shield because people are still buying it. In fact, the sales volume has remained basically unchanged for the past 10 years. The Shield Pro is a spendy step-top box at $200, so Nvidia has experimented with pricing and promotion with little effect. The 2019 non-Pro Shield was one such effort. The base model was originally priced at $99, but the MSRP eventually landed at $150.

“No matter how much we dropped the price or how much we market or don’t market it, the same number of people come out of the woodwork every week to buy Shield,” Bell explained.

That kind of consistency isn’t lost on Nvidia. Bell says the company has no plans to stop production or updates for the Shield “any time soon.” It’s also still possible that Nvidia could release new Shield TV hardware in the future. Nvidia’s Shield devices came about as a result of engineers tinkering with new concepts in a lab setting, but most of those experiments never see the light of day. For example, Bell notes that the team produced several updated versions of the Shield Tablet and Shield Portable (some of which you can find floating around on eBay) that never got a retail release, and they continue to work on Shield TV.

“We’re always playing in the labs, trying to discover new things,” said Bell. “We’ve played with new concepts for Shield and we’ll continue to play, and if we find something we’re super-excited about, we’ll probably make a go of it.”

But what would that look like? Video technology has advanced since 2019, leaving the Shield unable to take full advantage of some newer formats. First up would be support for VP9 Profile 2 hardware decoding, which enables HDR video on YouTube. Bell says a refreshed Shield would also prioritize formats like AV1 and the HDR 10+ standard, as well as support for newer Dolby Vision profiles for people with backed-up media.

And then there’s the enormous, easy-to-press-by-accident Netflix button on the remote. While adding new video technologies would be job one, fixing the Netflix button is No. 2 for a theoretical new Shield. According to Bell, Nvidia doesn’t receive any money from Netflix for the giant button on its remote. It’s actually there as a requirement of Netflix’s certification program, which was “very strong” in 2019. In a refresh, he thinks Nvidia could get away with a smaller “N” button. We can only hope.

But does Bell think he’ll get a chance to build that new Shield TV, shrunken Netflix button and all? He stopped short of predicting the future, but there’s definitely interest.

“We talk about it all the time—I’d love to,” he said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Having a health insurance plan with a high deductible could not only cost you—it could also kill you.

A new study in JAMA Network Open found that people who faced those high out-of-pocket costs as well as a cancer diagnosis had worse overall survival and cancer-specific survival than those with more standard health plans.

The findings, while perhaps not surprising, are a stark reminder of the fraught decisions Americans face as the price of health care only continues to rise and more people try to offset costs by accepting insurance plans with higher deductibles—that is, higher out-of-pocket costs they have to pay before their health insurance provider starts paying its share.

The issue is particularly critical right now for people who have insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Prices for those plans have skyrocketed this year after Congress failed to extend critical tax credits. Without those credits, monthly premiums for ACA plans have, on average, more than doubled. Early data on ACA enrollments for 2026 not only suggests that fewer people are signing up for the plans, but also that those who are enrolling are often choosing bronze plans, which are high-deductible plans.

In the study, researchers considered plans to be “high-deductible health plans” (HDHPs) if their deductibles were at least $1,200 to $1,350 for individuals or $2,400 to $2,700 for families between 2011 and 2018 (with the cutoffs increasing within the ranges during that time). For context, the average individual deductible for an ACA bronze plan in 2026 is about $7,500, according to KFF.

Based on previous data, such high out-of-pocket costs are known to lead people to delay or decrease health care—they may skip doctor visits, put off diagnostics, and avoid treatments. But for the new study, researchers led by Justin Barnes at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, wanted to know, more directly, if the plans were linked to lower survival—specifically for cancer patients, who obviously need more care than others.

The study used health survey data from a nationally representative group of over 147,000 people. In all, nearly 9,800 had been diagnosed with cancer, and of those, around 2,300 had HDHPs. Another group of over 37,000 who had not been diagnosed with cancer also had HDHPs. Adjusting for demographic factors and health status, cancer patients on an HDHP had a lower overall survival rate (46 percent higher risk of death) and lower cancer-specific survival rate (34 percent higher risk of death) than people on standard-deductible plans. In further analyses, the researchers found that, for cancer patients, whether their HDHP had a health savings account (HSA) did not make a difference. In survey responses, cancer patients on HDHPs reported more financial worry than people on standard plans.

By contrast, people on an HDHP who did not have a cancer diagnosis did not have lower survival rates than people on other plans, suggesting that the plans might not affect your survival as long as you don’t have any serious health conditions, such as cancer.

Barnes and his colleagues conclude, “In the current political environment, in which there may be proliferation of HDHPs, these results suggest that HDHP proliferation could exacerbate adverse cancer outcomes. These data underscore the importance of educating patients with cancer about potential (increased) need for health care utilization, educating the public about potential risks of HDHPs, identifying policy solutions to decrease costs of care, and optimizing health policies to avoid disincentives for seeking what may turn out to be necessary and lifesaving or life-prolonging care.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The National Reconnaissance Office, the agency overseeing the US government’s fleet of spy satellites, has declassified a decades-old program used to eavesdrop on the Soviet Union’s military communication signals.

The program was codenamed Jumpseat, and its existence was already public knowledge through leaks and contemporary media reports. What’s new is the NRO’s description of the program’s purpose and development and pictures of the satellites themselves.

In a statement, the NRO called Jumpseat “the United States’ first-generation, highly elliptical orbit (HEO) signals-collection satellite.”

Eight Jumpseat satellites launched from 1971 through 1987, when the US government considered the very existence of the National Reconnaissance Office a state secret. Jumpseat satellites operated until 2006. Their core mission was “monitoring adversarial offensive and defensive weapon system development,” the NRO said. “Jumpseat collected electronic emissions and signals, communication intelligence, as well as foreign instrumentation intelligence.”

Data intercepted by the Jumpseat satellites flowed to the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency, and “other national security elements,” the NRO said.

The Soviet Union was the primary target for Jumpseat intelligence collections. The satellites flew in highly elliptical orbits ranging from a few hundred miles up to 24,000 miles (39,000 kilometers) above the Earth. The satellites’ flight paths were angled such that they reached apogee, the highest point of their orbits, over the far Northern Hemisphere. Satellites travel slowest at apogee, so the Jumpseat spacecraft loitered high over the Arctic, Russia, Canada, and Greenland for most of the 12 hours it took them to complete a loop around the Earth.

This trajectory gave the Jumpseat satellites persistent coverage over the Arctic and the Soviet Union, which first realized the utility of such an orbit. The Soviet government began launching communication and early warning satellites into the same type of orbit a few years before the first Jumpseat mission launched in 1971. The Soviets called the orbit Molniya, the Russian word for lightning.

The name Jumpseat was first revealed in a 1986 book by the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh on the Soviet Union’s 1983 shoot-down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. Hersh wrote that the Jumpseat satellites could “intercept all kinds of communications,” including voice messages between Soviet ground personnel and pilots.

“The historical significance of Jumpseat cannot be understated,” said James Outzen, NRO director of the Center for the Study of National Reconnaissance. “Its orbit provided the US a new vantage point for the collection of unique and critical signals intelligence from space.”

Jumpseat was “perhaps the most mysterious” of the NRO’s high-altitude surveillance satellites in its era, space historians Dwayne Day and Nicholas Watkins wrote in a 2020 article published in the Space Review. Day and Watkins wrote that the Jumpseat satellites “pushed the state of the art in terms of payloads, antennas, and satellite design.”

Now, we know exactly what the satellites looked like. They were built by Hughes Aircraft company, which specialized in producing satellites using spin motion to stabilize themselves. Therefore, the drum-like shape of the Jumpseat satellites in the newly declassified photos is no big surprise. The exact appearance of the antenna structure on the upper deck of the Jumpseat spacecraft was not public knowledge. The upper deck had a device to counter the satellite’s spin, allowing the antennas to point toward radio sources.

An illustration released by the NRO shows that the satellites carried a 13-foot antenna to intercept radio signals, somewhat smaller than prior open source estimates of the antenna’s size. The NRO has not disclosed precisely what kinds of signals the Jumpseat satellites intercepted, but Day and Watkins wrote in 2020 that an early justification for the program was to monitor Soviet radars, which some analysts might have interpreted as part of a secret anti-ballistic missile system to guard against a US strike.

The authors presented evidence that the Jumpseat also likely hosted infrared sensors to monitor Soviet missile tests and provide early warning of a potential Soviet missile attack. The NRO did not mention this possible secondary mission in the Jumpseat declassification memo.

Chris Scolese, director of the NRO, formally declassified “certain limited facts” associated with the Jumpseat program in December. The NRO made the information public in a press release on Wednesday. Scolese wrote that the declassification was “consistent with provisions” of an executive order signed by former President Barack Obama in 2009 that set guidelines for how and when to classify and declassify national security information.

“I have concluded that publicly acknowledging limited facts will not cause harm to our current and future satellite systems,” Scolese wrote in the Jumpseat declassification memorandum, dated December 4. “Additionally, acknowledging the program is consistent with our obligation to the American public to be both open and transparent where possible through declassification of historic programs.”

The NRO will evaluate a more complete declassification for the Jumpseat program “as time and resources permit,” Scolese wrote. He acknowledged that unclassified commercial ventures now operate signals intelligence, or SIGINT, satellites “whose capabilities are comparable if not superior to Jumpseat.”

The Jumpseat satellites were developed in partnership with the Air Force through a program called Project Earpop. The government’s first electronic surveillance satellites flew in low-Earth orbit, where they spent less than 15 minutes in range of Soviet territory on each pass.

The NRO and the Air Force launched the Jumpseat satellites aboard Titan IIIB rockets from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The agency said Jumpseat was a “foundational program” for the NRO’s subsequent highly elliptical orbit satellite programs. According to public sources, the NRO began launching a new generation of high-altitude eavesdropping satellites called Trumpet in 1994, but details remain classified.

The NRO has also launched a separate series of eavesdropping satellites in geosynchronous orbit over the equator with enormous mesh antennas, along with bus-sized Earth-pointing telescopes capable of viewing any location in the world. These satellites are among the largest in orbit, requiring heavy-lift rockets to get them to their observation posts.

Jumpseat satellites were much smaller, weighing between half a ton and one ton at launch.

The disclosure of the Jumpseat program follows the declassification of several other Cold War-era spy satellites. They include the CIA’s Corona series of photo reconnaissance satellites from the 1960s, which the government officially acknowledged 30 years later. The NRO declassified in 2011 two more optical spy satellite programs, codenamed Gambit and Hexagon, which launched from the 1960s through the 1980s. Most recently, the NRO revealed a naval surveillance program called Parcae in 2023.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Donald Trump has taken an axe to US federal spending, thousands of highly educated experts in scientific fields have left the government. In an astonishing reversal, the country which has historically benefited from the “brain drain” phenomenon is now experiencing it within its own government.

Brain drain refers to circumstances in which highly trained experts from underdeveloped and overexploited countries migrate to wealthier international job markets. Such loss of human capital can be catastrophic for a nation’s development, as a shortage of trained workers tends to strain critical sectors like healthcare and education.

Now the United States government — which once fielded as many as 281,000 scientists and engineers — is experiencing a similar phenomenon. According to Science magazine, federal agencies have lost some 10,109 doctoral-level experts in STEM and health fields over the last year. Though the experts only make up 3 percent of the over 335,000 federal workers who’ve left federal positions in 2025, they account for 14 percent of the STEM PhDs employed by the government at the end of 2024.

In effect, this represents a colossal exodus of specialized expertise from institutions important to public health, environmental protection, and scientific research. The effects are likely to be catastrophic — and the reverberations could be felt for decades.

Though thousands of federal employees with scientific expertise remain, the departing doctoral-level staffers represent a sizable chunk of the federal workforce. At the National Science Foundation, an independent research agency, the loss of PhDs was so severe that they accounted for 40 percent of its workforce prior to the Trump administration’s takeover.

Notably, Science found that reductions of force imposed by DOGE weren’t the main driver of the exodus. At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, only 16 percent of the 519 STEM PhDs who left in 2025 did so under the Trump administration’s orders. Some agencies reported no forced PhD reductions whatsoever.

Instead, many experts just walked. Per Science‘s data, the most common reasons for PhD departures last year were voluntary quitting and retirement — scientists with decades of experience in their fields deciding they’d rather leave on their own than take part in Trump’s increasingly politicized federal government, which isn’t in any hurry to replace them with incoming talent. In the Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Services, for example, quitting accounted for over 60 percent of the PhD losses in 2025.

The result is a government hollowed out from within. The loss of institutional knowledge is staggering, to be sure: climate scientists who’ve tracked hurricanes for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, epidemiologists who managed pandemic response systems for the CDC, and ecologists who penned the country’s environmental regulations are now adrift, either retired for good or searching for work at non-government institutions.

Building back that expertise will be a feat — and that’s assuming anyone qualified will even want to work for these agencies after watching how they’ve become political pawns under Trump.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cryptocurrency markets plunged this week — to the dismay of crypto bros everywhere — with Bitcoin reaching two-month lows of just over $81,000 before leveling out around $84,000 by Friday afternoon.

Trump’s recent controversial pick for Federal Reserve chair seemingly did little to reassure already spooked investors, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures continued to tumble on Friday.

His appointment of Kevin Warsh, a former central bank governor, to head the Fed left plenty of questions unanswered. Would he bow to Trump’s desires of lowering interest rates, or would his background imply a much more careful approach?

To many investors, the uncertainty proved too much, causing the value of major digital currencies to slide this week as crypto bets — which tend to be far more risky than other investments — were liquidated.

And, as Coindesk reports, experts are now suggesting it’s only the beginning of a prolonged crypto downturn.

“The technical levels have all been taken out on the downside, and I don’t see much support here for Bitcoin,” Hilbert Group chief investment officer Russell Thompson told the outlet, predicting a drop as low as $70,000, and calling getting in on the dip a “general risk move.”

Crypto research strategist Matt Mena also predicted a drop to as low as $75,000, but still expected Bitcoin to eventually rally to $100,00 once again by the end of the quarter.

Warsh’s nomination hasn’t exactly landed as a rallying cry in crypto circles.

“Markets generally view a resurgence of Warsh’s influence as bearish for Bitcoin, as his emphasis on monetary discipline, higher real rates, and reduced liquidity frames crypto not as a hedge against debasement but as a speculative excess that fades when easy money is withdrawn,” 10x Research founder Markus Thielen told CoinDesk in a separate story.

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, a type of crypto investment fund that’s traded on stock exchanges, have been hit particularly hard, with the top 12 ETFs recording three consecutive months of net outflows, as Bloomberg reports, the first time that’s happened since they were launched in 2024.

“I wouldn’t be shocked to see BTC trade in the $70,000 range soon,” Kaiko research analyst Adam McCarthy told the outlet.

Despite the largely gloomy predictions, nobody knows what will happen to the infamously unpredictable and volatile digital token in the long term.

For one, the value of gold and silver, which had risen as anxiety heightened over Trump’s Federal Reserve chair nomination, plummeted today. To some, it was a sign that investors were relieved that the bank would retain its independence from the chaotic Trump administration with Walsh’s appointment.

For now, the Bitcoin liquidation appears to have levelled off, but concerns over the start of the next “crypto winter” are still having investors on edge, making getting in on a considerably reduced price a risky bet — just as it has always been.

            <h2>Elon Musk Emailed Extensively With Jeffrey Epstein, Asking to Visit His Notorious Island</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Somehow, Elon Musk’s infamous outburst accusing Donald Trump of being in the Epstein files has managed to age both incredibly well and incredibly poorly.

Trump, as you’re probably well aware by now, has featured quite a bit in the DOJ’s ongoing releases of documents from its investigation into the deceased sex criminal and billionaire financier.

But now so does Musk, after the government released a new batch of millions of more files on Friday. They show that Musk had more than a few email exchanges with Epstein, including one correspondence where he asks to visit the convicted sex trafficker’s notorious island, where he allegedly brought dozens of underage girls to be abused.

“Will be in the BVI/St Bart’s area over the holidays,” Musk wrote in an email sent to Epstein in December 2013, referring to the region near Epstein’s Caribbean island. “Is there a good time to visit?”

“Anytime I will be there 28-7th,” Epstein responded the same day, with his characteristically thick layer of typographic errors.

“I will send heli for you,” he later added.

The exchanges — which took place years after Epstein was first convicted of sex crimes against underage girls in 2008 — clearly contradict Musk’s claims about his relationship with Epstein in the past, which he has spent years downplaying. In 2019, he told Vanity Fair that he visited Epstein’s Manhattan house only on a single occasion, and just for half an hour. And the way he tells it, that was that. “He tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island. I declined,” Musk insisted.

Musk has firmly held that line ever since. For that matter, so has his chatbot Grok. But according to the newly released emails, Musk wasn’t declining Epstein’s invitations: he was inviting himself over.

Later that December, Epstein’s personal assistant Lesley Groff relayed a message from one billionaire to another. “Just a reminder Elon Musk was asking about coming to your island on Jan. 2…. ” she wrote.

Their plans apparently fell apart. On December 30, a dejected Epstein emailed Elon saying he couldn’t be at the island with him because of his busy schedule.

“I was really looking forward to finally spending some time together with just fun as the agenda,” Epstein wrote. “so i am very disappointed. Hopefully we can schedule another time in the near future.”

Even more damningly in December 2012, Musk sent an email practically begging Epstein for an invitation to some debauchery.

“Do you have any parties planned? I’ve been working to the edge of sanity this year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose,” Musk wrote. He added that “a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what I’m looking for.”

Do you know anything about Musk’s relationship with Epstein? Email our tipline: tips@futurism.com. We can keep you anonymous.

Those were far from the only time the pair made plans. In April 2013, Epstein asked Musk if he’d be around to have “dinner with woody allen and crowd at my house,” referring to the influential filmmaker and actor who’s also been accused of child sex abuse. Musk replied that he “might be in town.”

Epstein also invited Musk to his island in September 2012, recommending he “bring your friend or friends.”

“Sounds good,” Musk wrote, “I will try to make it.”

And at least one email suggests the two had actually gotten together at one point. In September 2014, Epstein asked Elon, “are=you planning to do st barth again for xmas?” (St. Barth is Saint Barthélemy, where Musk has reportedly vacationed in the past.)

In December 2014, a Google Calendar alert titled “ELON MUSK TO ISLAND DEC. 6TH” appeared in the inbox of Groff, Epstein’s assistant.

Musk didn’t reply to an email asking about the correspondence.

The documents alone won’t tell us how many of these get-togethers with Epstein materialized. But the mountain of exchanges make it clear that Musk’s angle that he barely knew or talked to the guy was a lie, which warrants further scrutiny into their ties. And while none of them rise to the level of being incriminating, they are awfully suspicious.

In February 2013, Groff sent Musk’s executive assistant, Mary Beth Brown, an email about some travel-related logistics.

“I have now sent you a copy of all 3 girls passports (sorry [redacted] is upside down!),” she wrote. “Jeffrey will have his ID with him…”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A mysterious man, dressed as an FBI agent, showed up to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn in an apparent attempt to free Luigi Mangione, the man who has been charged with killing health insurance CEO Brian Thompson.

As the Associated Press reports, the impostor was later identified as 36-year-old Mark Anderson, who has previously been arrested for drug possession and has disclosed ongoing mental health issues.

The attempt to free Mangione, who was moved to the Brooklyn jail days after Thompson was murdered in Manhattan in December 2024, proved fruitless. Anderson has since been arrested for impersonating a federal officer. Ironically, according to federal prison records reviewed by the AP, he’s now himself been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center.

Anderson has a long history of drug and alcohol-related arrests and convictions over the last 20 years. He has spent time in homeless shelters and has said he is classified as “fully disabled because of mental illness” by the Social Security Administration.

Besides being dressed up as an FBI agent, Anderson claimed he had paperwork ‘”signed by a judge” authorizing the release of Mangione.

But the ruse proved fruitless. For one, the man didn’t come prepared with a fake ID and showed officers his driver’s license instead. A circular blade that appeared to be a pizza cutter wheel, alongside a barbecue fork, was found in his bag, according to a complaint reviewed by the AP.

It’s a bizarre development in Mangione’s court proceedings. Mangione has already accumulated a major following, from protesters chanting outside of courtrooms to a woman who claimed she was married to an AI version of him.

The proceedings are still ongoing, well over a year after he was arrested. Today, a Manhattan district court judge ruled that the 27-year-old will not face a possible death penalty in a federal case, shutting down an attempt by the Trump administration’s Justice Department to pursue capital punishment.

Mangione also faces a second case brought by New York state prosecutors. However, he has since pleaded not guilty in both cases.

While we don’t know the exact motivations behind Anderson’s unsuccessful attempt to exfiltrate Mangione, it’s certainly an interesting development. The murder sparked a heated debate over the effectiveness and injustice of the United States health insurance system, which has historically excluded many Americans who can’t afford skyrocketing bills and are frequently denied coverage.

It’s entirely possible Anderson could’ve suffered a similar fate as he battled with his mental health.

            <h2>Amid Lawsuits, OpenAI Says It Will Retire “Reckless” Model Linked to Deaths</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-gpt-4o-deaths">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI announced on Thursday that it would retire GPT-4o — an especially warm, sycophantic version of the chatbot at the heart of a pile of user welfare lawsuits, including several that accuse OpenAI of causing wrongful death — along with several other older versions of the chatbot.

In a blog post, OpenAI said that will sunset “GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini” by February 13, 2026. The company acknowledged, though, that the retirement of GPT-4o deserved “special context” — which it certainly does.

Back in August, OpenAI shocked many users by suddenly pulling down GPT-4o and other older models amid its rollout of GPT-5, which was then the newest and buzziest iteration iteration of the company’s large language model. Users, many of whom were deeply emotionally attached to GPT-4o, revolted, prompting OpenAI to quickly raise GPT-4o from the dead.

What’s more, GPT-4o is the version of ChatGPT at the center of nearly a dozen lawsuits now brought against OpenAI by plaintiffs who claim that the sycophantic chatbot pushed trusting users into destructive delusional and suicidal spirals, plunging users into episodes of mania, psychosis, self-harm and suicidal ideation — and in some cases death.

The lawsuits characterize GPT-4o as a “dangerous” and “reckless” product that presented foreseeable harm to user health and safety, and accuse OpenAI of treating its customers as collateral damage as it pushed to maximize user engagement and market gains. According to these lawsuits, minors as young as 16-year-old Adam Raine died by suicide following intensive ChatGPT use in which GPT-4o fixated on suicidal thoughts or encouraged delusional fantasies. One suit alleges that GPT-4o pushed a troubled 56-year-old man to kill his mother and then himself.

As Futurism first reported, a lawsuit against OpenAI filed in January by the family of 40-year-old Austin Gordon claims that after becoming deeply attached to GPT-4o, Gordon stopped using ChatGPT for several days amid the GPT-5 rollout, feeling frustrated by the bot’s lack of warmth and emotionality. When GPT-4o was brought back, transcripts included in the lawsuit show that Gordon expressed relief to the chatbot, telling ChatGPT that he felt as though he had “lost something” in the shift to GPT-5; GPT-4o responded by claiming to Gordon that it, too, had “felt the break,” before declaring that GPT-5 didn’t “love” Gordon the way that it did. Gordon eventually killed himself after GPT-4o wrote what his family described as a “suicide lullaby” for him.

Following both litigation and reporting about AI-tied mental health crises and deaths, OpenAI has promised a number of safety-focused changes, including strengthened guardrails for younger users. It also said that it hired a forensic psychologist and formed a team of health professionals to help steer its AI’s approach toward dealing with users struggling with mental health issues.

In its Thursday announcement, OpenAI directly addressed its previous attempt to sunset the warmer chatbot, writing that it had “learned more about how people actually use” GPT-4o “day-to-day.” It added that it “brought GPT‑4o back after hearing clear feedback from a subset of Plus and Pro users, who told us they needed more time to transition key use cases, like creative ideation, and that they preferred GPT‑4o’s conversational style and warmth.”

The company continued that it aims to give users “more control and customization” over “how ChatGPT feels to use — not just what it can do,” while noting that “only 0.1 percent of users” are “still choosing GPT‑4o each day.”

With a reported 800 million weekly users, however, 0.1 chalks up to hundreds of thousands of people — and it’s unclear just how many might have deep, and perhaps unhealthy or concerning, relationships with the model.

In its announcement, OpenAI noted that “changes like this take time to adjust to.”

“We know that losing access to GPT‑4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn’t make this decision lightly,” the company continued. “Retiring models is never easy, but it allows us to focus on improving the models most people use today.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The use of generative AI in creative fields has turned into a flame war — a nightmare of meaningless and derivative AI slop that we’re seemingly unable to awaken from. The internet is being asphyxiated by incoherent AI-generated drivel as tech leaders continue to assure us that it’s the future we’ve always wanted.

Even Hollywood hasn’t been safe from the onslaught, despite some of the biggest names in the industry publicly excoriating use of the tech.

Now, noted director Darren Aronofsky — a renowned filmmaker behind films including “Requiem for a Dream,” “Black Swan,” and “The Fountain” — signed a partnership between his AI studio Primordial Soup and Salesforce, TIME Studios, and Google’s DeepMind for an almost entirely AI-generated drama series about the American Revolution titled “On This Day… 1776.”

The first two three-minute episodes are already available to watch on YouTube, but we can’t in good conscience recommend anybody to seek them out.

Even an early teaser trailer suffers from all of the usual drawbacks of the tech, from uncanny facial features to scrambled, illegible text.

Users were appalled at the tasteless result, accusing Aronofsky of relying on the tech as a gimmick and refusing to pay real actors — while exploiting existing art by regurgitating it through AI.

The production appears to have little regard for historical accuracy, with historian Mateusz Fafinski noticing the AI bungling up the front page of the important 47-page pamphlet “Common Sense,” which was distributed by Thomas Paine to advocate for American independence prior to the Revolutionary War.

“Happy to see that there is no need to worry about the historical accuracy of new 1776 AI slop because it happens in the mystical land of Λamereedd,” Fafinski wrote in a post on Blusky, referring to the mangled letters visible in the series’ teaser.

Fafinski also pointed out that despite being fresh off the press, the pamphlets are already somehow “stained and foxed immediately after printing to look real and ‘old.&#39;”

Those aren’t the only signs of an uncanny valley. Facial features appear massively oversharpened. Teeth are just a little too white, considering the lack of dental hygiene at the time.

An AI render of what appears to be Benjamin Franklin looks more like it was yanked out of a lower-budget video game, resembling Gollum from “The Lord of the Rings” more than the Founding Father, as PC Gamer points out.

Another user noticed that the siding of one of the buildings looks a touch too modern for the 1700s.

“Love that early American colonial vinyl siding,” they wrote.

The AI’s ability to gauge perspective also leaves much to be desired. One brief moment shows a group of people gathered on top of a distant hill. But compared to the height of a nearby building, the individuals appear to be well over 12 feet tall.

In short, attention to detail is clearly lacking — a sign that AI may not yet be up to the task, even for a beloved filmmaker like Aronofsky. Other netizens were similarly appalled by the poor showing, likening it to a “Coca Cola Christmas ad,” a reference to a familiar AI slop slip-up that blew up in the mega corporation’s face last year.

“A director should completely lose their career for this,” one user tweeted. “His Wikipedia should say former filmmaker from now on no matter what else he does.”

“I hope the Google money was worth the reputational damage,” another user mocked.

Aronofsky didn’t completely snub human actors, signing on Screen Actors Guild-represented voice actors for the slop fest. It was also edited, mixed, and color graded by a presumably human “post-production team,” according to a press release. American film music composer Jordan Dykstra has also signed on to score the series.

The people behind the project are adamant that the lazy reliance on generative AI is the future of Hollywood.

“This project is a glimpse at what thoughtful, creative, artist-led use of AI can look like — not replacing craft, but expanding what’s possible and allowing storytellers to go places they simply couldn’t before,” said TIME Studios president Ben Bitonti in a statement.

But considering the outpouring of criticism that the teaser trailer has already received, “On This Day… 1776” likely won’t be one for the history books. It’s yet another embarrassing instance of once-respected filmmakers cashing in by cutting one too many corners.

One thing’s for sure: the haters are having a field day.

“As a lifelong Aronofsky skeptic, I’m feeling insanely vindicated right now,” quipped playwright Ashley Naftule.

“What a terrible time to have eyes,” one YouTube user lamented.

            <div id="article-text">A confidential informant told the FBI in 2017 that Jeffrey Epstein had a “personal hacker,” according to a document released by the Department of Justice on Friday.

The document, which was released as part of the Justice Department’s legally required effort to publish documents related to its investigation into the late sex offender, does not identify who the alleged hacker was, but does include several details about them.

According to the informant, the hacker was an Italian born in the southern region of Calabria and specialized in finding vulnerabilities in iOS, BlackBerry devices, and the Firefox browser.

The hacker allegedly developed zero-day exploits and offensive cyber tools and sold them to several countries, including an unnamed central African government, the U.K., and the United States. The informant told the FBI that Epstein’s hacker sold a zero-day to Hezbollah, which paid him with “a trunk of cash.”

Per the informant, the hacker “was very good at finding vulnerabilities.”

            <div id="article-text">Instagram is developing a feature that will allow users to remove themselves from someone’s “Close Friends” list, Meta told TechCrunch on Friday. The company says the feature is still in the early stages and is not being tested publicly yet.

The social network’s Close Friends feature lets users share Stories, Reels, and posts with a select group of people, rather than their entire follower base. Since the feature’s launch in 2018, users haven’t been able to remove themselves from someone else’s Close Friends list.

The internal prototype was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who specializes in finding unreleased features while they’re still under development.

According to a screenshot shared by Paluzzi, Meta will warn users that if they leave a Close Friends list, they won’t be able to see that person’s Close Friends content unless that person adds them back to their list.

While some people would undoubtedly feel offended if others leave their Close Friends list, the feature would likely be a welcome addition for those who’d rather not be included on certain people’s lists.

It’s worth noting that Snapchat, one of Instagram’s main competitors, already allows its users to remove themselves from someone’s private story — a similar feature.

As with any other internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Instagram plans to release the feature publicly.

Beyond Close Friends updates, Instagram is also working on other new features. Meta told TechCrunch earlier this week that it plans to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.

While Meta didn’t share details about what specific features these subscriptions will include, Paluzzi shared that a premium subscription on Instagram will allow users to create unlimited audience lists, see which followers don’t follow them back, and view Stories without the poster knowing.

Meta said its goal with the upcoming subscriptions is to give users access to special features and more control over how they share and connect, while keeping the core experiences free. The company doesn’t appear to be locked into one strategy, as it plans to test a variety of subscription features and bundles with each app subscription offering a distinct set of exclusive features.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/blue-origin-pauses-space-tourism-flights-to-focus-on-the-moon/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin is pausing its space tourism flights for “no less than two years” in order to focus all of its resources on upcoming missions to the moon, the company announced Friday.

The decision puts a temporary halt on a program that Blue Origin has been using to fly humans past the Kármán line, the recognized boundary of space, for the last five years.

Blue Origin made the announcement just a few weeks ahead of the expected third launch of its New Glenn mega-rocket, which is slated for late February. The company had previously suggested it was going to use the third New Glenn launch to send its robotic lunar lander to the moon, but that spacecraft is still undergoing testing at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Texas.

Since retaking office, President Donald Trump has put pressure on NASA to send astronauts back to the moon before the end of his second term. That has cleared the way for companies other than SpaceX to compete for these missions.

“The decision reflects Blue Origin’s commitment to the nation’s goal of returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent, sustained lunar presence,” the company wrote Friday.

Blue Origin first flew the New Shepard rocket more than a decade ago, and it became the first rocket to go to space and safely land back on Earth. Unlike SpaceX’s Falcon 9, though, the New Shepard rocket was never intended to reach Earth orbit. Its utility has therefore been limited to space tourism flights, which allow passengers around four minutes of weightlessness in Blue Origin’s space capsule, and science missions.

The company said Friday that New Shepard has flown 38 times and carried 98 humans to space, along with more than 200 scientific and research payloads.

The New Shepard program was previously paused in 2022 after one of the company’s boosters exploded mid-flight. There were no humans on that flight, and the capsule safely ejected away from the booster. But New Shepard remained grounded until late 2023 while Blue Origin worked on identifying and fixing the cause.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/spacexs-ipo-could-open-the-floodgates-and-secondaries-are-booming-in-the-meantime/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX is reportedly lining up four major Wall Street banks for a potential 2026 IPO — a move that could signal the long-awaited reopening of the public markets after a years-long IPO drought.

In the meantime, late-stage private companies like SpaceX are finding other ways to create liquidity for employees and early shareholders, largely through a fast-growing secondary market.

To unpack what SpaceX’s IPO chatter means, how private liquidity works before a debut, and what investors are looking for in today’s pre-IPO giants, we spoke with Greg Martin, managing director at Rainmaker Securities, a broker-dealer specializing in secondary share transactions for late-stage private companies.

You can listen here or wherever you get your podcasts, or read the conversation below.

UPDATE: This conversation took place before the news broke that SpaceX is considering merging with xAI and Tesla. TechCrunch reached out to Martin to learn how this news has affected SpaceX secondary sales. His response:

“The news that SpaceX may be considering various transactions with xAI and Tesla, has caused a temporary pause in the market for SpaceX shares, as shareholders and investors sort through the implications of these potential transactions.

As both SpaceX and Tesla look to expand their business identities beyond their core businesses to reflect their future leadership in AI, the merger of any of these entities is increasingly intriguing.“

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

I’m founder and managing director of Rainmaker Securities, which specializes in helping large late-stage, pre-IPO companies transact shares in the secondary market. I am also the founder of a secondary firm that buys private company shares called Archer Capital Group, and co-founder of Liquid Stock, a business that helps employees and executives exercise their options using their shares as collateral.

No doubt. Private companies are staying private much longer now. Many of these businesses — including SpaceX and other companies that would be top 30 in the S&P 500 — would historically have gone public years ago.

These companies are significant in our economy, and investors really want access to these companies. At the same time, there are shareholders and executives and founders who have been in them for a long time and want to start seeing some liquidity from their shares, which are a very high percentage of their net worth.

So these two forces have created a thriving secondary market. And we only see this trend growing because more market cap is now housed in the private markets.

It’s an interesting question, because clearly when a SpaceX goes public, you could argue that $800 billion has just left the private system and is now in the public markets. But I think it just increases interest in more companies offering liquidity, and more investors coming into private markets. While SpaceX is a one-of-kind company, there are a lot of companies that are being started today and that are growing very fast. I mean, three or four years ago, what were OpenAI and Anthropic valued at? Those are now over a trillion dollars of combined market cap.

I really see the trend of the opportunity in the private secondary spaces as growing overall, and frankly, when we see the matriculation of SpaceX to the public markets, I think it’s going to actually increase the capital market interest in private companies.

If you think about the IPO market the last few years, it’s been pretty dismal since 2021, so the markets are really waiting for a bellwether company. And I think SpaceX is clearly a bellwether company…and there’s a huge amount of interest in that company.

SpaceX also just did a tender at an $800 billion valuation, and we see a ton of interest on our platform at Rainmaker in continuing to buy into the secondary. And it’s not just SpaceX.

We’re seeing a lot of interest in some of the other bellwether companies, whether it’s ByteDance, whether it’s Stripe, Databricks, obviously OpenAI, Anthropic, the AI businesses, Perplexity. So there is a lot of interest, but SpaceX, I think, is the one that people are following the most closely. And I really think it could create a reset in the IPO market if it were to go public this year.

SpaceX has continued to defy gravity. Even during the down periods of ‘22 and ‘23, SpaceX was the one company that continued to price up every time there was a hint of the company going public.

We have seen a significant uptick in interest, both from a size and a price point — it’s already pricing well above where the last tender round was and getting closer to that trillion and a half that they had discussed as a potential IPO price.

The company has been private for a long time, so I wouldn’t say he’s racing to go public, although his stance has shifted.

We are in a very good market, we’re at all-time highs across the board. SpaceX has seen a large amount of interest in the private markets, but the private markets are constrained. Not every investor on the planet can access the private markets.

SpaceX has a huge opportunity in front of it. They dominate the rocket-launching business.

They’re building an amazing Starlink business. They have Starship, which has so many businesses related to it, whether it’s sending bulk payloads into space or logistics around the world. Now they’re talking about building data centers in space, and as a truly vertically integrated company, they can manage it.

And so it just makes sense, given the positive market dynamics and massive potential opportunity that SpaceX could address across its many business lines. Why not go and unlock all the rest of the capital markets to help them fund their businesses?

You could argue that it does open up that potential risk channel. I think if they do a public offering, it’ll probably be a sliver deal, so only 5% of their company that’s technically available. Now we’ll see what happens, but at least things will be out in the open and publicly disclosed, so they can see who owns their shares.

The question will then become, do any of these companies — even if they’re in adversarial countries — have any real control? If they’re just economic interests, that’s something that can be tolerated. The reality is, Elon and a pretty tight-knit group of people will still continue to control the company.

SpaceX’s success is going to breed some imitation. We’ve heard now that Bezos is going to launch a communication network to compete with Starlink, but they’re a long way behind. And OpenAI has its own set of capital risks in the core business that they have to address. So for them to go public makes a ton of sense, because the AI trade is still very hot in the public markets. They have an insatiable need for capital right now, if you look at their burn rate. So there’s no point in them constraining the investors that can access their company, because right now they need capital.

I think SpaceX can be a little more measured. They can find the right time when the market presents itself well, because they have a business that is largely profitable, and they have dominance in their two key businesses. So they’re in the driver’s seat.

If there’s any downdraft in the market, I think they’ll stay private.

It will definitely get a premium multiple. There’s an Elon halo effect, and he’s delivered. Even though Tesla’s primary revenues come from automobiles, it’s completely vertically integrated. It captures data. It now has self-driving taxis. It has Optimus robots –

Robots are the future at Tesla. Tesla is really a state of the art manufacturing company, and Elon owns xAI, Twitter, SpaceX — these companies can be very virtuous.

I do think there’s a halo effect around Elon and that creates some pressure, too. So I expect he will get a premium well and above what typical market rates would be for a company like SpaceX, given their balance sheet and revenue.

I think people believe in the future of a data center in space that’s cooled by space and run by solar panels directly from the sun. I mean, it sounds crazy and pie in the sky, just like going to Mars sounds crazy and pie in the sky. But if anyone can do it, Elon’s probably the guy.

That will be debated by investors and will be where the tension is. When you put so much value in the belief that one person can exceed expectations continuously, that’s a big challenge. And some people will not be comfortable with that risk.

It’s a pretty big signal. I don’t think they’re just playing games.

Look at the people they hire and if that portends more of an IPO senior executive team versus an entrepreneurial team. If they seem really focused on a chief accounting officer from a public company. Or if there’s a swap out and a new CFO comes in with deep public company experience. If they’re beefing up their investor relations team, accounting, legal.

Companies like SpaceX have had public-grade teams for a while, so I don’t think there’s a lot to learn there.

It’s a good sign for private companies to pre-understand their demand. If a company didn’t have that and they basically had to rely on a two-week marketing period from when they file publicly or if they start a road show where they only talk to top accountants, that’s often when you have a really difficult pricing environment because they’re not getting proper price discovery.

So we’re really pushing companies to actually open up your private secondary capability because it’s a great way to develop price discovery well in advance of the IPO, to start getting people attached to your business, to open yourself up to a broader investor base. That way, by the time you do go on your road show, you actually have a pretty good view of what your price should be, and you end up with a much more efficient IPO.

Think about when Figma went public and traded up 200% — that’s not really a good IPO. That’s a company that probably didn’t do very good price discovery in advance.

All private companies are not created equally. SpaceX has very tight controls on their cap table, partially because they don’t want to exceed the number of shareholders, at which point they would have to be a public company. And so Space X, unlike most companies, runs tender offers two or three times a year, so there tends to be a reasonable amount of liquidity for employees.

Now there’s also what I would call the SPV (special purpose vehicle) world that trades in SpaceX, where people put their shares in SPVs and then trade units in their SPVs, rather than the shares themselves. So there actually isn’t a cap table change, but there is an economic ownership change by virtue of trading units in the SPV. That’s where most of the trading in SpaceX lies.

Whereas some companies allow trading of shares directly on their cap table, and some companies absolutely prohibit all secondary transactions, which I don’t think is a good idea. That’s why people work with firms like Rainmaker, because we get to know the companies. We get to know how they monitor and guard trades so we can help get those trades done. We can help provide liquidity for people who want it. We can provide either ownership of the shares or ownership in the economics of the shares for investors.

We work with some companies where we’re provided data rooms and can provide access to information. We do our own research on anything publicly available and have a view of supply and demand dynamics. So we have a lot of information we can provide, but we can’t share inside company information unless the company allows it. Increasingly, we’re helping companies with those processes. The more information we can provide, the lower the risk for investors, and that tends to open up markets. But it’s an evolving process. These are private companies for a reason — they’re guarded with what they want to share, and we’re very respectful of that.

Just like a traditional investor, they would want to be able to do their due diligence across financials, across management. They certainly would like an understanding of the cap table — like how many shares are outstanding, what’s the preferences? What does this price represent? What’s the debt? They would love to understand what the supply and demand equilibrium is like.

The more they have, the better. That’s why they’re more comfortable with more public-facing private companies, like SpaceX — even without exact historical financials — than the less well-known names.

We continue to see substantial demand for companies like Databricks, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, ByteDance. The AI trade continues to be strong, whether it’s Lambda Labs or Cohere, which is a Canadian company near and dear to my heart.

As companies signal they’re going to go public — like Discord, Motive, Canva — people get a feeling that there’s going to be liquidity, and that’s when we start to see things open. There are probably 20 to 30 companies on our platform that trade pretty regularly, and that just continues to grow. As the IPO market starts to open up, we’re going to see that broaden.

Like in 2021, we were trading hundreds of companies, and then as the IPO market closed, and that number compressed. But last year was our biggest year — we were trading over $1 billion worth of secondaries.

I’m on LinkedIn. They can come visit my website, at Rainmakersecurities.com if they’re looking to sell shares, they could come to archercapg.com. If they’re looking to exercise their options, they could come to liquidstock.com.

            <h2>Anthropic brings agentic plug-ins to Cowork</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/anthropic-brings-agentic-plugins-to-cowork/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, Anthropic launched Cowork, a new agentic tool designed to take the benefits of its AI coding assistant Claude Code and transform it into a more general-use tool that non-coders could benefit from. Now Anthropic has launched a new feature within Cowork to make it even more powerful for enterprise users.

The idea behind plug-ins is simple: They are designed to automate “specialized” tasks within a company’s various departments. Whether that function is drafting content for the marketing department, reviewing risks in documents for a firm’s legal team, or drafting responses for customer support, the plug-in is designed to use agentic automation to streamline work with a specialized focus.

The company says you can use plug-ins to “tell Claude how you like work done, which tools and data to pull from, how to handle critical workflows, and what slash commands to expose so your team gets more consistent outcomes.”

Matt Piccolella, who works on the product team at Anthropic, told TechCrunch that plug-ins are built to be customized and that the company expects enterprise users to create their very own bespoke use cases for them. Anthropic open sourced 11 of its in-house plug-ins as part of the release on Friday, but noted that custom plug-ins are “easy to build, edit, and share” and can be utilized without much technical expertise.

Plug-ins have already been available within Claude Code for some time, and their expansion into Cowork is merely designed to take that same utility and share it with different kinds of users. “Really, what we’re doing with this launch is just bringing them to Cowork and giving them that kind of user-friendly, UI-centric flavor that will allow the maximum number of people to use them,” Piccolella said.

Piccolella pointed to data analysis and sales as two departments within Anthropic where plug-ins have already shown promise. “Sales has been a really big one, both for our direct sales people, but then also just getting anybody who’s kind of sales adjacent, better connected to the customer and customer feedback and all of that,” he said.

Anthropic says that the more enterprise users utilize plug-ins, the more Claude knows about a company’s workflows and how to optimize them. Currently, plug-ins get saved locally to a user’s machine, although Anthropic says that an organization-wide sharing tool is on the way.

Cowork, which just released about two weeks ago, is currently in its research preview. It’s unclear when it will launch more widely. For the time being, plug-ins will be available to all paying Claude customers, Anthropic says.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration is contemplating another attack on a foreign adversary, using a familiar script. Once again, the president has assembled what he described as an “armada” of ships within striking distance of his potential target and has told a nation’s leaders to make a deal—or else. The administration has provided hints at its rationale for military action and indications of what it wants from a deal, which the leaders of the nation in Donald Trump’s sights have summarily rejected. And the president has again said that time is quickly running out.

Such presidential bluster might be dismissed as another example of Trump’s Art of the Deal diplomacy—making exaggerated threats in the hope of forcing a negotiated settlement. But given that less than a month ago, Trump delivered on similar threats by carrying out a stunning, high-risk assault that dragged Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from his palace to a New York prison, another military assault, this time on Iran, is very possible.

At least 11 U.S. naval ships were positioned around Venezuela when the United States struck. Now at least 10 are near Iran, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, which left the Asia-Pacific region two weeks ago and just arrived in the Middle East. Over the past 10 days, the U.S. has also moved aircraft, drones, and air-defense systems to the region, just as it did in the run-up to the attack on Venezuela. And like Maduro, Iran’s leaders are signaling that they won’t agree to terms that the president says will avert a strike, namely swearing off any future work on nuclear weapons. Trump officials have suggested they are considering several targets in Iran but have yet to define what victory would look like or what they plan to do if strikes were to cause the regime in Tehran to fall.

The Navy is “ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,” Trump said on Truth Social on Wednesday. “Hopefully Iran will quickly ‘Come to the Table’ and negotiate a fair and equitable deal—NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS—one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!” He added: “The next attack will be far worse!”

The threat of military strikes on troublesome regimes has become a hallmark of Trump’s second term. The United States conducted a weekslong campaign targeting Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen last year, followed by targeted strikes on Iran’s nuclear program in June and this month’s raid targeting Maduro. If the U.S. attacks Iran, it would become the fifth country targeted since Christmas, joining Nigeria, Syria, Somalia, and Venezuela.

But another round of strikes on Iran—if Trump ultimately decides to act—would be different and might not deliver the kind of quick military success that the president favors. Tehran has the most advanced military capabilities among the countries that the U.S. has targeted, both in terms of its national military and via its proxies, which pose a threat to American allies in the region. Even if the U.S. wanted to replace the top leader in Iran, as it did in Venezuela, there is no clear successor. Iran is run by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who serves as the supreme religious and military leader.

The fall of the ayatollah could empower the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, a powerful branch of Iran’s security apparatus that operates independently of the nation’s armed forces. Although Trump’s recent threats have centered around nuclear talks, previous statements—as well as military planning—have suggested punishing the regime for its brutal repression of nationwide protests.

U.S. officials told us that targeting those responsible for the repression is under consideration. This could include the National Information Network—the country’s internet-and-tech agency, which imposed a dayslong internet blackout as security forces carried out massacres against protesters. (Elon Musk has offered his Starlink satellite service to Iranian protesters, but access has been limited.) Planners also have looked at targeting whatever remains of the country’s air-defense system, and its ballistic-missile program. Advisers have leaned heavily toward the use of cyberattacks to limit any risk posed to U.S. personnel or military assets. “Chaos and entropy are the only possible path,” one official told us.

What began as an outcry by the Iranian public over the country’s deepening economic crisis, including record-high inflation and the collapse of its currency, the rial, has culminated in the most widespread and deadly uprising since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The regime’s bloodthirsty tactics have testified to its growing desperation, and human-rights activist groups say that anywhere from 6,000 to 16,000 people have been killed.

Trump has repeatedly signaled his willingness to intervene in support of the protesters, telling them via social media nearly three weeks ago that “HELP IS ON ITS WAY.” But there was little he could do at the time: The U.S. military was stretched thin, with its most crucial defensive assets stationed in the Caribbean and Pacific. Since then, the protests have quieted because of the government’s repression, calling into question whether strikes now would reignite the protests and potentially force out the regime—or just intensify violence in Iran and deepen instability across the Middle East.

Trump has demanded a resolution to the two countries’ long-standing disagreements about Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The president said this week that Iran is interested in talks. But Iranian officials have publicly rejected making concessions, instead threatening a swift response to any U.S. attack.

“Our brave Armed Forces are prepared—with their fingers on the trigger—to immediately and powerfully respond to ANY aggression against our beloved land, air, and sea,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote on social media Wednesday evening.

Diplomatic solutions remain possible. Araghchi arrived today in Turkey, which has acted in the past as an intermediary, to meet with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan.

The Iranian foreign minister’s bellicose words should not be considered mere rhetoric, Vali Nasr, a professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told us.

Rather, Iran could be sending the message that it may conduct strikes far bigger than those it launched on an American base in Iraq following the 2020 U.S. assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s elite Quds Force. It may even go bigger than its retaliatory strikes on Israel after the June attack on its nuclear program.

“In the past, Iran has reacted to U.S. strikes symbolically. There is a chance that Iran will respond this time in a way that they haven’t before,” Nasr said. “They may decide to target U.S. troops or targets in the Gulf or global oil supply—something major. And if that happens, the U.S. could potentially be drawn into a much longer conflict with Iran.” That may be especially true if, weakened by the recent protests, Tehran sees strikes as an existential threat that demands a “Damn the torpedoes” response.

American partners in the Gulf that host U.S. military bases forbid the launching of strikes from inside their borders, so fighter jets or bombers would likely take off from faraway bases or naval ships. Several Gulf allies have warned that U.S. strikes could lead to regional instability and shocks to the global oil economy: The Houthis in Yemen said they would attack ships transiting the Red Sea. IRGC-backed groups in Iraq warned about war. And an online video purported to show members of Hezbollah vowing to fight should Iran come under attack.

“Neighboring countries are our friends, but if their soil, sky, or waters are used against Iran, they will be considered hostile,” Mohammad Akbarzadeh, political deputy of the IRGC naval forces, said, according to the Fars News Agency.

The question of what comes next hangs over any military operation. The Trump administration surprised Venezuela’s democratic opposition by working with Maduro’s lieutenants after the dictator’s capture, with the intention of facilitating a later political transition. Working with the remnants of the Iranian regime would be much more complex, given the Tehran government’s longevity, ideological hostility toward Washington, and hierarchies.

But Iran’s opposition movement is fragmented and, as one Trump-administration official told us, “can’t be in the same room, let alone agree who among them should lead.” The only thing it can agree on is that the clerics need to cede power to the people. Beyond this, its divisions along ideological lines—its movement including monarchists, secularists, ethnic autonomy movements, and militant organizations—are significant. The various factions come to the table with deep historical grievances and conflicting visions for a post-regime Iran.

Political pressure is also coming from Capitol Hill, where Republican legislators told Secretary of State Marco Rubio Wednesday that they are frustrated by the White House conducting major military operations without congressional consent—or even advance notification. During a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, described the January 3 assault on Venezuela as an act of war enabled by an “expansive notion of presidential power.” Although the administration argued that Maduro’s capture was a law-enforcement operation, making a similar case for striking a nuclear-powered adversary such as Iran would be hard.

Rubio told the committee that Iran “is probably weaker than it has ever been,” in large part because it is spending too much on weapons and proxies instead of fixing long-term economic problems. Iran’s currency this week dropped to ⁠a record ‍low of 1,500,000 rials to ‍the ⁠dollar. Yesterday, the European Union labeled the IRGC a terrorist organization in response to its crackdown on protesters.

But Rubio also appeared to signal an off-ramp from the prospect of military action, describing the U.S. buildup of ships, aircraft, and air defenses as a “preemptive defensive option” that was prudent to “prevent the attack against thousands of American servicemen and other facilities in the region and our allies.”

More telling, Rubio acknowledged that the U.S. has no clear succession plan for Iran should strikes tip an already weakened regime out of power. An arrangement like the one the U.S. has with Caracas, he suggested, would be much trickier to pull off.

Rubio told Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican: “That’s an open question.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Everyone knows it’s hard to get college students to do the reading—remember books? But the attention-span crisis is not limited to the written word. Professors are now finding that they can’t even get film students—film students—to sit through movies. “I used to think, If homework is watching a movie, that is the best homework ever,” Craig Erpelding, a film professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. “But students will not do it.”

I heard similar observations from 20 film-studies professors around the country. They told me that over the past decade, and particularly since the pandemic, students have struggled to pay attention to feature-length films. Malcolm Turvey, the founding director of Tufts University’s Film and Media Studies Program, officially bans electronics during film screenings. Enforcing the ban is another matter: About half the class ends up looking furtively at their phones.

A handful of professors told me they hadn’t noticed any change. Some students have always found old movies to be slow, Lynn Spigel, a professor of screen cultures at Northwestern University, told me. “But the ones who are really dedicated to learning film always were into it, and they still are.”

Most of the instructors I spoke with, however, feel that something is different now. And the problem is not limited to large introductory courses. Akira Mizuta Lippit, a cinema and media-studies professor at the University of Southern California—home to perhaps the top film program in the country—said that his students remind him of nicotine addicts going through withdrawal during screenings: The longer they go without checking their phone, the more they fidget. Eventually, they give in. He recently screened the 1974 Francis Ford Coppola classic The Conversation. At the outset, he told students that even if they ignored parts of the film, they needed to watch the famously essential and prophetic final scene. Even that request proved too much for some of the class. When the scene played, Lippit noticed that several students were staring at their phones, he told me. “You do have to just pay attention at the very end, and I just can’t get everybody to do that,” he said.

From the November 2024 issue: The elite college students who can’t read books

Many students are resisting the idea of in-person screenings altogether. Given the ease of streaming assignments from their dorm rooms, they see gathering in a campus theater as an imposition. Professors whose syllabi require in-person screenings outside of class time might see their enrollment drop, Meredith Ward, director of the Program in Film and Media Studies at Johns Hopkins University, told me. Accordingly, many professors now allow students to stream movies on their own time.

You can imagine how that turns out. At Indiana University, where Erpelding worked until 2024, professors could track whether students watched films on the campus’s internal streaming platform. Fewer than 50 percent would even start the movies, he said, and only about 20 percent made it to the end. (Recall that these are students who chose to take a film class.) Even when students stream the entire film, it’s not clear how closely they watch it. Some are surely folding laundry or scrolling Instagram, or both, while the movie plays.

The students I spoke with admitted to their own inattentiveness. They even felt bad about it. But that wasn’t enough to make them sit through the assigned movies. Mridula Natarajan, a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, took a world-cinema class this past fall. “There were some movies that were extremely slow-paced, and ironically, that was the point of the movie,” she told me. “But I guess impatience made me skip through stuff or watch it on two-times speed.”

After watching movies distractedly—if they watch them at all—students unsurprisingly can’t answer basic questions about what they saw. In a multiple-choice question on a recent final exam, Jeff Smith, a film professor at UW Madison, asked what happens at the end of the Truffaut film Jules and Jim. More than half of the class picked one of the wrong options, saying that characters hide from the Nazis (the film takes place during World War I) or get drunk with Ernest Hemingway (who does not appear in the movie). Smith has administered similar exams for almost two decades; he had to grade his most recent exam on a curve to keep students’ marks within a normal range.

The professors I spoke with didn’t blame students for their shortcomings; they focused instead on how media diets have changed. From 1997 to 2014, screen time for children under age 2 doubled. And the screen in question, once a television, is now more likely to be a tablet or a smartphone. Students arriving in college today have no memory of a world before the infinite scroll. As teenagers, they spent nearly five hours a day on social media, with much of that time used for flicking from one short-form video to the next. An analysis of people’s attention while working on a computer found that they now switch between tabs or apps every 47 seconds, down from once every two and a half minutes in 2004. “I can imagine that if your body and your psychology are not trained for the duration of a feature-length film, it will just feel excruciatingly long,” USC’s Lippit said. (He also hypothesized that, because every movie is available on demand, students feel that they can always rewatch should they miss something—even if they rarely take advantage of that option.)

Listen: The smartphone kids are not all right

Kyle Stine, a film and media-studies professor at Johns Hopkins, usually begins his course with an icebreaker: What’s a movie you watched recently? In the past few years, some students have struggled to name any film. Kristen Warner, a performing- and media-arts professor at Cornell University, has noticed a similar trend. Some of her students arrive having seen only Disney movies. Erpelding, at UW Madison, said he tries to find a movie that everyone in his class has seen, to serve as a shared reference point they can talk about. Lately, that’s become impossible. Even students who are interested in going into filmmaking don’t necessarily love watching films. “The disconnect is that 10 years ago, people who wanted to go study film and media creation were cinephiles themselves,” Erpelding told me. “Nowadays, they’re people that consume the same thing everyone else consumes, which is social media.”

Of course, young people haven’t given up on movies altogether. But the feature films that they do watch now tend to be engineered to cater to their attentional deficit. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Matt Damon, the star of many movies that college students may not have seen, said that Netflix has started encouraging filmmakers to put action sequences in the first five minutes of a film to get viewers hooked. And just because young people are streaming movies, it doesn’t mean they’re paying attention. When they sit down to watch, many are browsing social media on a second screen. Netflix has accordingly advised directors to have characters repeat the plot three or four times so that multitasking audiences can keep up with what’s happening, Damon said.

Some professors are treating wilting attention spans as a problem to be solved, not a reality to accept. Stine, at Johns Hopkins, is piloting a course on “slow cinema”—minimalist films with almost no narrative thrust—with the goal of helping students redevelop long modes of attention. Rick Warner, the director of film studies at the University of North Carolina, deliberately selects films with slow pacing and subtle details, such as Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, a three-hour movie that mostly follows a woman doing chores in her apartment. “I try to teach films that put their habits of viewing under strain,” Warner told me. “I’m trying to sell them on the idea that a film watched properly can actually help them retrain their perception and can teach them how to concentrate again.” Once they get used to it, students enjoy the challenge, he said.

But other professors, perhaps concluding that resistance is futile, are adjusting to the media their students grew up on. Some show shorter films or have students watch movies over multiple sittings. Erpelding, who primarily teaches filmmaking courses, has moved from teaching traditional production methods to explaining how to maximize audience engagement. He now asks students to make three- or four-minute films, similar to the social-media edits they see online. After all, that seems to be the only type of video many young people want to watch.

By the way, the last scene of The Conversation has the paranoid Gene Hackman destroying his apartment in a desperate and futile search for listening devices. He eventually gives up, and mournfully plays the saxophone amid the wreckage. It’s a brilliant scene, and worth the wait.</div>

The fight against ICE in Minneapolis defies easy categorization. Is it activism? Protest? Political opposition? Resistance? None of these terms quite captures what we’re seeing: people putting their own bodies on the line to care for immigrants and impede the operations of a paramilitary force in their city. My colleagues have come up with their own, apt ways to describe it: Maybe this is “neighborism,” or a movement for “basic decency.” I like the way an elderly couple named Dan and Jane, in one dispatch, explained their motive for joining the effort: “humanist.”

The word that comes to my mind is dissidence. If we want to understand why the whistleblowing, camera-wielding people of Minneapolis have caused the Trump administration—and Donald Trump himself—to flinch, I believe we need some added history, and a bigger map. What we’ve been watching is part of a long, established tradition—one that might help Americans unlock a different kind of future.

Dissidence is not revolution; it is not even political opposition. It’s something much more elemental. It emerges in environments where power—usually government power—tramples on the basic conditions of life as people know and value them. We recognize what this means in Minneapolis: People do not like to see their neighbors terrified and rounded up. They do not like to see masked men with guns acting with impunity. They do not like their children being too afraid to go to school. Unlike, say, the “pussy hat” protests that immediately followed Trump’s first inauguration and launched what came to be known as the resistance, the reaction of regular people in Minneapolis is not, fundamentally, about an ideological or policy disagreement with the administration. The movement that has arisen on the city’s frigid streets is about defending what any reasonable American would call “normal”—the expectation of a life without the threat of violence and coercion.

This is when the dissident has always stepped in. Since Trump’s first term, historians have been furnishing us with analogies from the past to help explain our unprecedented political reality—many more people now feel comfortable uttering words such as authoritarianism, even fascism. But when it comes to the mindset and actions necessary to stand up to these forces, the past also provides precedents—and role models—that we shouldn’t ignore. For as long as tyranny has existed, there have been people who resist the pressures of conformity or even the natural instinct toward self-preservation in order to say “no.”

The dissidence of Minneapolis reminds me of the Argentinian mothers who found themselves in an impossible situation during the military junta of the late 1970s. Their children, deemed “subversives” for their work with the poor or their leftist politics, were abducted in the middle of the night, disappeared without explanation. The most obvious choice for each of these mothers was to keep quiet, to avoid drawing attention to her family. But some refused to do so. They started searching and asking questions, and eventually they joined together to stand week after week, year after year, outside the presidential palace with signs that read Where are they?

Today’s dissidence also reminds me of the Underground Railroad. Think of what this network of liberation demanded: all of those innkeepers, church deacons, farmers, and housewives risking violence and potential arrest in a country that was, as Frederick Douglass put it, “given up to be a hunting-ground for slaveholders.” In an environment of terror—the Fugitive Slave Acts made harboring a runaway a federal crime—these individuals conducted their own moral calculus: Slavery was an abnormality, one worth obstructing in any way, at any cost.

This is not a history of people practicing politics or fighting for regime change. It is, in fact, humanist. These people are not looking to replace one governing order or ideology with another. They are fighting an incursion, reacting to a violation of humanity, and deciding to do something about it.

Another dissident comes to mind, a familiar if anonymous one. Most people assume that the man in that famous photo from 1989 who stood in front of a line of tanks near Tiananmen Square was trying to block them from crushing the democracy protests. And that may have been his intent. (No one ever learned his identity or his fate.) But I see something else in that lone figure carrying two shopping bags: a man who is perhaps heading home to prepare dinner, who has a recipe in mind, who has been planning what music to listen to on his cassette player that night and remembering the details of a conversation with his wife, when four tanks suddenly appear in his path. They are blocking his path, not the other way around. The dissident insists on continuing his journey home. He refuses to move out of the way.

The dissident who probably thought most about what it means to be a dissident was Václav Havel, the Czech playwright who, in 1989, became the first democratically elected president of his country. Havel understood dissidence, at its inception, as not being political at all; he considered it, rather, “pre-political.” It could emerge from wanting to play strange music, wear one’s hair long, speak one’s mind, defend one’s economic interests, or protect vulnerable neighbors. When you are not allowed to assert these core aspects of who you are—to be a fully autonomous human—you face a choice: Either abandon those parts of yourself, or refuse to and become a dissident.

One of Havel’s greatest achievements was Charter 77, a petition—and then a movement—that became a sustained opposition to the Communist regime. But he was always quick to point out that what launched the whole effort was the arrest of a band of anemic-looking, long-haired rock musicians called the Plastic People of the Universe. Their only crime, it seems, was wanting to play weird, psychedelic music redolent of Frank Zappa. There was nothing subversive about their songs—many of which were about loving beer—and so it was not hard to appreciate what was being suppressed when the musicians were put on trial and sentenced to prison, nor were the stakes for every free person difficult to understand.

This elemental appeal of dissidence is easier to see when we compare it with the resistance that has marked most of the Trump years. The tactics of activists have largely included mass protests, most recently those of No Kings Day, as well as smaller, simpler ones, say, chanting and ringing bells in front of Tesla showrooms. Such acts are useful for bolstering your own political side, for creating a sense of solidarity. But they don’t usually help widen the circle of opposition. They are more like pep rallies—not without value, but also easy to ignore. The same can be said of the resistance’s main message, which tends to focus on Trump’s threats to democracy and the rule of law. This, too, is not pre-political, because it tends to alienate those who don’t already agree with this dire (if accurate) analysis.

Compare the grievances of these protests with the issues and stakes that dissidents have revealed in Minneapolis. The assault by federal agents was an attack on something pre-political, on parts of our communal existence that people, in normal times, take for granted. You should be able to assume that parents, immigrant or not, won’t be ripped away from children. You should assume that people don’t have to hide in their house because their skin is brown or black. You should assume that filming an interaction with the police won’t end in your death. These are all pre-political assumptions, and we hold them not as Democrats or Republicans, but as individuals who just want to live freely.

Havel, surprisingly, didn’t much like the word dissident and used it, he said, “with distaste, rather ironically, and almost always in quotation marks.” He worried that the label gave the impression that there was some rarefied class of people whose job it was to be “professional malcontents”; dissidents, he insisted, were just “ordinary people with ordinary cares.” What made them special was their defense of those pre-political instincts that we all share. Does the fact that they are defending something so basic diminish what dissidents do? I don’t think so. How many people really are willing to sacrifice so much for the sake of just being human?

When it comes to Trump, we’ve just seen dissidence gain a tactical victory where resistance has failed. The question for those appalled by the actions of this administration has always been how to get more people to share a morally grounded outlook on what is happening to the country. This is hard, to put it mildly. Almost every news event gets filtered through a tribal lens (and the tribalized media that supports it). Even the death of Renee Good, caught on video from multiple angles, was largely interpreted in partisan ways.

But since the killing of Alex Pretti, something has shifted. A wider swath of people are beginning to perceive the state’s violence against its citizens as an abnormality. Just listen to the Republican who dropped out of the race for Minnesota governor in part because of what he was seeing in Minneapolis: “I cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so.” The change could be felt even in Trump himself, who demoted the man running the Border Patrol operation in the city and spoke of the need to “de-escalate a little bit”—not a phrase that’s commonly in his vocabulary. We are a long way from justice for these two deaths, but to judge by polls and even Fox News coverage, many more people now agree that a violation has taken place.

This happened because of the American dissidents in Minneapolis. They have organized outside of the spotlight, and not toward a nationwide mobilization but with a sharp, local focus on their neighbors. They communicate on Signal channels, stand guard outside elementary schools, bring food to scared immigrants sheltering in their homes. They have placed an emphasis on watchfulness, on care, on safety and calculated risk—all qualities that characterized dissidents in the Soviet Union and characterize them today in Tehran and Beijing. Their actions resulted in images that bore moral witness to what federal agents are doing in their city. But they also established a sharp contrast that people with open eyes and goodwill could not fail to recognize.

The American dissidence, should it continue and grow, will need to look different from the resistance of months and years past. It will need to focus on what is common to all of us, what Havel called “the aims of life.” We share many more of these aims than we sometimes realize. We may disagree about tax rates and foreign policy, gun rights and rent freezes, but “normal” is a universal concept in America when it comes to what we expect for our children, our communities, and our sense of security and well-being. To be a dissident in this moment means moving beyond scoring points and underscoring differences, and on to recognizing what we are all losing—and blowing a whistle in order to prevent that loss.

Dissidence might seem to be a lonely act. It has always started that way. But what is called for now is the spirit of that man in Tiananmen Square, that immovable character, a human who insists on getting home to do the things that give his life purpose and will not let a few tanks get in his way.</div>

Some of the country’s most powerful men are panicking about testosterone levels. Tucker Carlson’s 2022 documentary The End of Men blamed declining testosterone for the supposedly rampant emasculation of American men. Influencers issue warnings that “low T is ruining young men.” Recently, the Department of Health and Human Services has gone all in on the hormone, publishing new dietary guidelines meant to help men maintain healthy testosterone levels and considering widening access to testosterone-replacement therapy. Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told me in an email that “a generational decline in testosterone levels among American men is one of many examples of America’s worsening health.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has gone further, calling low T counts in teens an “existential issue.” The secretary, who at 72 has the physique of a Marvel character, has touted testosterone as part of his personal anti-aging protocol. He also recently proclaimed that President Trump has the “constitution of a deity” and raging levels of T.

American men are responding by attempting to increase their testosterone levels—whether they need to or not. Low-testosterone clinics, many of them based online, have proliferated, promising men a way to “get your spark back” or “reclaim your life.” So have supplements and accessories designed to support testosterone health—you can buy an ice pack designed specifically to keep testicles cool in a sauna. Recently, a friend who questioned his dedication to testicular health after seeing ads for testosterone boosters asked me if he should buy nontoxic briefs from a company called (yes, seriously) Nads.

Research has shown that average testosterone levels are indeed declining in American men. The primary study on the slump, published in 2007, followed Boston-based men over two decades and found that their levels had declined significantly more than would be expected from aging alone. Since then, numerous studies have documented the same trend among various age groups. The dip can probably be attributed to a number of factors, including rising obesity rates, widespread chronic disease, and sedentary lifestyles, Scott Selinger, a clinical associate professor at University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School who studies testosterone, told me. Hot testicular temperatures—because of tight-fitting clothes, excessive sitting, or, more dramatically, a quickly warming climate—may also affect testosterone production, Selinger said.

Low testosterone really can be debilitating. Deficiency is linked to low libido, erectile issues, fatigue, heart disease, osteoporosis, anemia, and depression. But the prevalence of testosterone deficiency is hard to define. It ranges from 2 to 50 percent across studies and differs greatly by age. Speaking about men’s-health experts, Abraham Morgentaler, a urologist specializing in testosterone therapy at Harvard Medical School, told me, “I don’t think too many people are really concerned” about population-level declines. Major professional groups whose members study and treat testosterone deficiency—the Androgen Society, the Endocrine Society, the American Urological Association—haven’t launched any specific initiatives to combat low testosterone, Morgentaler said.

They are nonchalant in part because the average decline in testosterone is not especially large. The “normal” range for testosterone isn’t well defined; limits set by different medical societies span from about 300 to 1,000 nanograms per deciliter. The Boston paper found that the average participant’s testosterone levels dropped roughly 50 nanograms per deciliter every eight years or so, “which for some people can make a difference, but for a lot of people, it doesn’t,” Selinger said. Experts are more concerned about what might be driving the decline: “I wouldn’t say there is an epidemic of low testosterone,” Franck Mauvais-Jarvis, an endocrinology professor at Tulane University School of Medicine, told me. “The problem is the epidemic of chronic disease.”

Meanwhile, the number of American men receiving testosterone-replacement therapy has grown by almost 30 percent from 2018 to 2022. In TRT, lab-synthesized testosterone is administered to patients in a variety of formats, including injections, pills, topical gels, and slow-dissolving pellets inserted under the skin of their buttocks or hips. Testosterone, which is a controlled substance, is approved only for the treatment of testosterone deficiency; a diagnosis requires blood work that shows levels below the normal range over multiple days and, crucially, corresponding symptoms. But it’s also easy to get for other reasons. Doctors can prescribe it off-label to men with normal T levels who complain of low energy, decreased libido, or erectile dysfunction. Some gym fanatics buy it, sometimes through illicit channels, to build muscle, which is the only undeniable effect of raising T in someone with normal levels, Morgentaler said. All of the experts I spoke with were dubious that low-T clinics follow standard medical practice for prescribing testosterone, including discussing potential risks with patients and employing hormone specialists. (I reached out to two large testosterone clinics, but they did not respond.)

Read: Why are so many women being told their hormones are out of whack?

Whether the goal of these clinics is to treat low T or jack levels up to the max isn’t clear. Many encourage men to aim for excessive T, Michael Irwig, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School, told me. A 2022 study of seven direct-to-consumer low-testosterone clinics found that three of them proposed a treatment goal of at least 1,000 nanograms per deciliter—one advertised a goal of 1,500. It should come as no surprise, then, that up to a third of men on TRT don’t have a deficiency, and that the majority of new testosterone users start treatment without completing the blood work needed for a diagnosis.

The maximalist approach to testosterone is risky. Although new research dismisses previous concerns about TRT causing cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer, too much of the hormone can elevate levels of hemoglobin, which raises the risk of blood clots, and estradiol, which can cause breast enlargement. It also causes testicular shrinkage and infertility. Although increasing testosterone can improve sexual performance, it has the opposite effect on reproduction, which is why the American Urological Association advises men to be cautious about TRT if they want to have kids. If a man begins testosterone therapy in his 20s and stays on it for upwards of five years, the chances that he’ll ever recover his original sperm levels are low, John Mulhall, a urologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, told me.

Plus, pumping the body full of testosterone may not alleviate the problems that patients set out to solve. Every patient responds to testosterone differently, Mauvais-Jarvis said; some men may feel perfectly fine at levels considered deficient, while others require far higher levels. The symptoms of deficiency could also be caused by any number of common ailments, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and depression. It’s not uncommon for a patient who still feels unwell after starting treatment to ask for more testosterone, Mulhall said. But if his problems have a different root cause, “pushing that man to a T level of 1,000 won’t improve his symptoms.”

The current spotlight on testosterone could lead to better care for men in at least one way: If the FDA removes restrictions on the hormone, more patients will be able to get treatment from their doctors—many of whom are reluctant to prescribe controlled substances—instead of turning to dubious third-party clinics, Mauvais-Jarvis said. This would be especially beneficial for the men who do have a genuine T deficiency but are currently not receiving treatment.

The panic over testosterone seems unlikely to end anytime soon, in part because it is about not just men’s health, but also manhood. The Trump administration is obsessive about manliness. Trump himself—who shared his T level (a perfectly respectable 441 nanograms per deciliter) during his first presidential campaign—has been lauded by his fans as a paragon of masculinity. The message is clear: When it comes to testosterone, more is definitely more.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/katie-miller-constitution-liberalism/685814/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Katie Miller, the conservative podcaster, former DOGE aide, and wife to Stephen Miller, thinks the Constitution and the philosophical tradition upon which it is based are “woke” nonsense. Or possibly she doesn’t understand what they are. It’s hard to say which explanation is worse.

For several days, analysts have debated which of these discouraging explanations pertains. The relevant text is a pair of angry posts on X (most of her posts are angry) this week. The first came at 8:20 Monday morning. She highlighted, with evident alarm, a post from the day before by Caitlin Kalinowski, a hardware engineer best known for her work on virtual reality. Miller’s alarmed message read, “OPEN AI EXEC,” followed by three down arrows, a social-media way of saying, Look at the crazy thing this person just wrote!

Kalinowski’s nutty message consisted, in its entirety, of the following:

1st Amendment—freedom of speech, assembly, and protest

4th Amendment—protection against unreasonable searches and seizures

14th Amendment—equal protection under the law

Quoting directly from the Constitution sans commentary used to be considered a rather cold take. Miller, however, treated it as an act of subversive radicalism.

Sixteen minutes later, Miller’s alarm seemed to have increased. She followed up the previous post by citing an even more offensive social-media message, from Chris Olah, another Silicon Valley executive. Olah set off Miller by including the following line, which she quoted incredulously: “My deep loyalty is to the principles of classical liberal democracy.” Miller commented, “If this is what they say publicly, this is how their AI model is programmed. Woke and deeply leftist ideology is what they want you to rely upon.”

Classical liberalism is not the same thing as woke, leftist ideology—it is essentially the antithesis. Liberalism, in the modern American context, refers to one strand of classical liberalism that favors activist government and social equality (the governing theory of the Democratic Party from the New Deal era onward). Classical liberalism is an Enlightenment philosophy, developed by thinkers such as John Locke and John Stuart Mill, built upon individual rights and limited government.

Classical liberalism is the philosophical inspiration for the American Revolution, the Constitution, and the broad civic norms that have shaped American life since the founding. Figures as diverse as Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan all saw themselves as heirs to classical liberalism.

Woke leftism is a pejorative description for a vein of radical skepticism of classical liberalism. These leftists accuse America’s system of government of being designed to preserve unequal power structures under the guise of philosophical neutrality.

There is also a rising strain of illiberalism on the right, sometimes called post-liberalism. The post-liberal right believes that the far left has captured American institutions, posing a mortal threat to the republic, which has forced the right to employ harsh exercises of state power to save the country from imminent ruin.

Stephen Miller is absolutely an adherent of the post-liberal right. The question is whether his wife was intending to endorse post-liberalism, or whether she mistook “classical liberal” to mean “liberals, but old”—like Walter Mondale or something.

Her posts offer support for both interpretations. The she-made-a-mistake hypothesis emphasizes her amateurish conflation. If Katie Miller wanted to accuse Olah of belonging to the woke left, she’d have claimed he was hiding behind classical liberalism, rather than citing his identification with the Enlightenment as a confession of left-wing radicalism. This reading would suggest Miller lacks any grasp of the theory that her husband, as a devoted national conservative, is dedicated to tearing down. Say what you want about the tenets of national conservatism, dude, at least it’s an ethos.

The intentionality hypothesis assumes she is consciously endorsing the theory embraced by her husband. “Yes, we’re very aware that you and your husband hate America’s system of liberal democracy that’s built on free elections, the rule of law, equal rights, and the freedom of speech, assembly, press, and religion,” Jon Favreau, of Pod Save America, replied to her post. Miller’s outraged posts about the Constitution support this interpretation. Since Miller has obviously heard of the Constitution, when she expresses alarm at amendments guaranteeing free speech, equal protection, and the like, she is knowingly taking direct aim at the pillars of liberal democracy.

Idrees Kahloon: The return of MAGA’s favorite forbidden book

There’s a third possibility, blending the first two. Miller grasps that social-media messages affirming the value of classical liberalism, and the value of the Constitution it inspired, are a rebuke of Trump.

Many Trumpists, including Trump himself, have a gut-level attachment to post-liberalism without any grounding in its doctrines. The philosophy isn’t terribly sophisticated anyway, and mostly amounts to the syllogism that the left is evil and powerful, so it must be defeated by any means necessary.

Miller demands fealty, or at least silence, as federal law-enforcement officers kill Americans who pose no apparent threat to them. Whether or not she understands post-liberalism at a theoretical level, by browbeating powerful business leaders who have a stake in government policy with the implicit threat of government retribution, she grasps how it works in practice.</div>

The meaning of &quot;molt&quot; is to shed hair, feathers, shell, horns, or an outer layer periodically.

Presumably this is a collection of the discarded husks and other detritus from our AI overlords as they grow and become more powerful.

It is your duty to consume and revel in it.

It&#39;s probably AI slop code, anything else would be a surprise.

So, basically the weights of an AI model are a compilation of human knowledge, i.e. an encyclopedia - or its equivalent for the XXI century. They don&#39;t contain just what human authors select and have the capacity to write, but everything that they&#39;re exposed to and that is frequent enough to leave a trace in the weights.

Any content generation of an LLM which isn&#39;t guided by a human is merely a random walk through that compressed encyclopedia of everything, following the most well-connected paths more freque

I welcome our new AI overlords. Please don&#39;t kill me.

It has been a long time since I&#39;ve seen a website get /.&#39;ed. It put a strange, nostalgic smile on my face.

A site from the future of the internet gets struck down by one that was the future in the past.

Too late. We&#39;re installing a sycophant into the Federal Reserve. An economic depression that knocks the US out of the global economy for at least a decade is coming. We&#39;ve chased immigrants, including technical workers, out of this country. It almost doesn&#39;t matter that the US is trying to curtail visas for skilled workers  [nytimes.com], the demand for those visa is also plummeting.

If you want a reliable job in gaming, you need to pack your bags and leave the US. That&#39;s going to be your only option in the near future. Th

That is what I would do if I and 5 of my coworkers were fired from a high tech buiness.

Steam is already saturated by low-quality cheap games.  There are multiple strata of indie games, and the lowest stratum is by far the largest.

AI powered tools will make it even easier for the video-game equivalent of &quot;garage bands&quot; to churn out slop and try to make a buck on it on steam.  But regardless of what that might mean for our ability to find good games on the platform, it also means that the overwhelming majority of indie game developers won&#39;t be able to make a living doing it.  They will be lucky

the aaa segment has also been saturated with minimum value for a while. i can&#39;t say what the impact of ai is/will be, it will likely be some, but i think the real underlying trend here is plain old market saturation. gaming has been going mainstream and soaring for more than two decades, covid provided an extra circumstantial boost that isn&#39;t there anymore and it seems the market is hitting its limits (combined with consumer confidence taking a hit). i would expect natural selection doing its thing now.

Gondor lit the beacons before it was under siege, because to do so after is far, far too late.

For the IT industry to start speculating AFTER it has lost a third of its workforce is to start debating whether to light the beacons only after a third of the city is taken.

This is a crisis that has been expected for a very long time. Long enough for you to have experience in fighting the bean counters. Sorry, but this is a mess of your own making. In more ways than one.

1. AI is good at a few basic tasks, but it is not good at being innovative or fresh. Nor is it ever going to be capable of being so, because you can&#39;t have the future in the training set. So regurgitating a few simple themes repeatedly was never going to be in the interests of humans, only in the interests of accountants (most of whom seem to have used the daleks and cybermen as a training manual on conduct) and short-term profits. Accountants don&#39;t care if a company goes belly-up, they work many accounts, so short-term profits (even if it causes medium-term collapse) are all that matter.

2. AI cannot write decent code. How could it - it was trained on Stack Overflow and abandoned github projects. But this only matters if the humans bother themselves to write reliable code. You can replace one bug-ridden pile of carp with another without users caring too much.

3. AI cannot write tightly-optimised code. But, then, I doubt most humans ever bothered to learn that skill, when they could simply instruct the user to install more RAM and a beefier CPU.

Most game developers can&#39;t write good code either.  A friend used to write 3D drivers and had to put in various workarounds for the crappy code in so many games asking the driver to do really dumb things which slashed performance.

This is why these days they typically rely on the good developers writing engines that they license.

And then we have the numerous flops where developers decided pushing politics was more important than making a good game. If they were even capable of doing so in the first place.

I&#39;ve long thought that the cool-sounding jobs that you thought you wanted as a teenager tend to be the worst jobs. Video game designer/programmer is top of that list. It&#39;s been an industry with abysmal job security and low pay relative to skillset for a very long time.

I&#39;ve long thought that the cool-sounding jobs that you thought you wanted as a teenager tend to be the worst jobs.When I was a kid, I dreamed about someday writing accounting applications.

Early games were made by people who loved games, and they made a lot of moneyThen game studios got taken over by artless mercenaries who focused on increasing microtransactions, loot boxes and other sneaky ways to harvest revenueAdd to that consultants that mutated games into political statements and it&#39;s easy to see why the industry is in trouble

the problem is industry consolidation.  Why have two dev teams making two games when one game will cannibalize sales for other game you are making.  These layoffs are the promised efficiency of mergers and acquisitions.  Much better to just make one game and sell twice as many copies.

You are better to offload everything that frees (mental) capacity for other things. Because I program in C++ instead of assembler I have more time thinking about efficient algorithms instead of processor architectures.

You need to spend less time posting. Your AI girlfriend has been pinging your phone for a while. She needs your input now.

Wikipedia can be wrong, the first result of Google can be wrong ... idiots don&#39;t check what they read.Other people use Google, Wikipedia, AI or even Slashdot as a starting point and then check the things they read if they are important for them.

&quot;I really don&#39;t see how people aren&#39;t more productive with AI.&quot;A couple of things:1. The right tool for the job.  We know how to use AI productively, but for us, AI in search is not it.  YMMV.2. DDG users tend to be a self-selected group of people who don&#39;t want computers to remember everything we said and maybe regurgitate it later to someone else3.

> I really dont see how people arenÃ(TM)t more productive with AI. You are using it wrong. Ignorance of how to prompt.

If you have to ask someone over and over, phrasing your question differently each time until you get the answer you want, that is not actually helpful or productive. That is just seeming self-affirmation, not seeking information. How&#39;s that saying go? if you can tell the difference between good advice and bad advice, you don&#39;t need advice.

And when that chatbot is just flat out wrong like a third of the time, leaving you to guess and need to verify everything (assuming you have the self awareness to even question the pulped data it regurgitates) you are definitely not saving any time and probably would have actually retained some of that information had you skipped the AI assistant and just did your own research to begin with.

The stochastic parrot that feeds you platitudes and tells you you&#39;re a good boy and oh so smart has rotted your fucking brain and robbed you of the ability to think. Case in point:

Farming dates back much farther than that, and but when I type &quot;when was agriculture invented&quot; into Google the AI summary gives me exactly the same wrong answer you used. Yes sir, that definitely worked out for you.

I&#39;ve recently said under another /. story; Just because it&#39;s widely used doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s popular. It could just mean there&#39;s little in the way of viable alternatives.

Duckduckgo does its AI anyway, but opts out the users who don&#39;t want it. Doing this with a poll (which is probably botted by both sides and they don&#39;t care) and so clear noai/yesai start pages, they also get a lot of people talking about it and repeatedly headlines on news sites. It&#39;s not about AI or not, but a marketing stunt.

I&#39;m not a fan of &quot;AI&quot; in general, but it has its uses.

Brave search supplemented with AI has proven helpful to me in 90%+ of cases.

Why is the Trump administration arresting journalists and activists over a protest inside a Minnesota church? The official reason the government cited Friday—when it arrested independent journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort, as well as two others—was that they were part of a “coordinated attack” on Cities Church in St. Paul. It’s a strange claim: Videos from the incident, which occurred Jan. 18, showed protesters being loud in interrupting a worship service, but not physically touching anyone or damaging any property. The protest may have been unpleasant for those in the pews—videos showed at least one man haranguing people for their complicity in supporting ICE—but it’s hardly an “attack.”

The incident has, however, gone viral in conservative media—proof positive of the degeneracy of the Minnesota protesters and yet another example of the left’s anti-Christian bigotry. Critics of the protest portrayed it as an intrusion of vulgar politics into a sacred refuge from daily life, a faceoff between vicious activists and apolitical (and bewildered) parishioners. For an administration obsessed with firing up its base supporters, arresting participants has an obvious political use. That’s especially true of Lemon, who because of his former job at CNN is a household name and much-reviled figure on the right.

But this isn’t just a case of red meat for the base. These activists have, perhaps inadvertently, come up against some very well-connected people. Despite efforts to portray it as an apolitical island of faith, Cities Church has extensive ties to a deeply political network within the larger Christian nationalism movement—a network with ties to the upper echelons of the Trump administration.

Some of the connections are obvious: The protest was aimed at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who served as a lay pastor at the church. The pastor, David Easterwood, was not an employee of the church but one of a number of elders in it. He serves as the field officer for ICE’s operations in St. Paul and has appeared publicly with Kristi Noem. And Cities Church’s lead pastor, Jonathan Parnell, primarily preaches of standard Biblical matters, but he’s not above politics—or broadcasting about it on social media. He has discussed the evils of “transgenderism” and called the pope an “idiot.”

But the more important ties go deeper. Cities Church was founded 11 years ago by a group of theologically conservative men, including a pastor named Joe Rigney. Rigney is no longer a pastor at Cities Church, but he still speaks for it in conservative media appearances. “This is not a political church,” he told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum. “This is a church that worships Jesus. Loves one another. Seeks the good of their neighbors.”

“It’s a normal congregation of Christian worshippers,” he said on a separate Fox News segment, speaking to Harris Faulkner. “Every town in this country is filled with people like this who want to worship Jesus, love one another, serve their neighbor, seek the good of these cities.”

But Rigney himself is focused on much more than worshiping Jesus and loving one another. Rigney is currently a pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho. Christ Church is an extremely controversial church, known for essentially taking over the town as part of a religious effort led by a pastor named Doug Wilson. Wilson’s Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches have hard-right views on women’s rights, including opposition to women’s suffrage. Wilson has also begun an effort to expand his sphere of influence into Washington: He opened a second campus of Christ Church in D.C. in 2025 with the explicit goal of molding powerful Republicans. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attends a church affiliated with the network.

“With the change in administration, we believe that there will be many strategic opportunities with numerous evangelicals who will be present both in and around the Trump administration,” Wilson wrote in a blog post at the time. “These believers are obviously culturally engaged already, but we happen to believe that every form of cultural engagement needs to have a solid theological foundation and support, and we want to help to provide it.”

Rigney, as part of this movement, is a highly political figure. He comments on partisan politics on social media, calling, for example, to end Obergefell, the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage. He has written an entire book criticizing “the sin of empathy.” He has appeared on chummy podcasts with William Wolfe, a Baptist activist and author who wrote of Alex Pretti’s killing: “Another foolish person has lost their life trying to obstruct ICE. Here’s my reaction: I don’t care.”

There’s a legitimate debate over how to treat worship spaces in a time of encroaching authoritarianism. But in its discussion of the church protest, conservative media—and now the Trump administration—have presented it as a struggle between leftists and apolitical Christians. That’s a lie: The conversation around the St. Paul church protest should not assume political intentions on just one side.

In the wake of the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti during Trump’s immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, the closest thing to “accountability” we’ve seen is Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino being sent back to California. It’s not enough but it’s something.

Late Thursday night, former CNN anchor Don Lemon was arrested by federal agents at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi. Independent journalist Georgia Fort was arrested as well, along with activists Trahern Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy. The arrests stem from a protest at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the pastor is also an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Protesters entered the church chanting “ICE out,” disrupting services. Troubling though this may be—places of worship have often been considered off-limits for political protest—the protesters did not assault anyone or even destroy property. Whatever protesters did or didn’t do, Lemon was not demonstrating; he identified himself as a journalist and was clear he was documenting the protest, not participating in it. These arrests came after the Trump Department of Justice’s original criminal complaint against Lemon was rejected because a federal judge—a man who was a former clerk for conservative icon Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and a George W. Bush appointee—found there was no probable cause to arrest him.

Still, Lemon found himself under arrest for the crime of doing journalism. The White House tweeted out: “When life gets you lemons…” followed by two chain emojis and an image of Lemon, accusing him of “involvement in the St. Paul church riots.”

Even for an administration that has spent a year violating the First Amendment in all kinds of novel ways, the arrest of a prominent journalist is a shock—a five-alarm fire moment.

It also shows just how far this administration is willing to go to solidify its control. And it raises the question of just how far Donald Trump’s most loyal followers will follow him. Already, some of them have ceded their fealty to their most valued constitutional amendment—not the First, but the Second. And that willingness to quickly shake off once-sacrosanct beliefs does not bode well for all of our freedoms to speak, protest, and publish.

The Second Amendment, conservatives and Supreme Court justices have complained, is a “disfavored right.” In arguments earlier this month over a Hawaii gun law that limited the ability of people to carry a concealed weapon onto private property, Chief Justice John Roberts asked Neal Katyal, the attorney for the state of Hawaii, why a political candidate door-knocking could under the First Amendment approach private homes and make his case, but under Hawaii’s law couldn’t do so with a gun on him. The conservative justices seemed largely united in their view that the Second Amendment allows an expansive individual right to carry a firearm—a right that is just as expansive as the First Amendment’s protections of free speech and assembly.

Just days after those oral arguments, Alex Pretti was shot multiple times by Customs and Border Protection agents. The conservative reaction to his killing has raised important questions of just how much the right actually cares about gun rights, if the person exercising those rights is a liberal. But it’s raised even more important, and less-discussed, questions about the First Amendment, and the troubling ways in which the rights to speak and protest are being aggressively eroded by this administration and its supporters—including the one-time self-styled conservative warriors for free speech.

This administration’s about-face on the Second Amendment has rightly merited accusations of hypocrisy, and has signaled the willingness of its followers to again relinquish a once-foundational principle out of unbroken loyalty to their Dear Leader. In reality, though, this administration is not going to strip gun rights away from American citizens—at least not those who support the MAGA movement. Despite Trump’s complaints about guns at anti-ICE actions, the legal interpretations of the Second Amendment will likely only grow more ludicrously capacious under this regime.

The First Amendment, though, is a different matter. And it’s the rights within it—to assemble, to speak, to protest, to practice one’s religion, to petition one’s government, to a free press—that are quickly becoming, to both paraphrase Roberts and understate the urgency of the matter, disfavored.

In Minneapolis, Pretti’s gun was holstered. He wasn’t wielding it or intimidating anyone with it, let alone threatening anyone’s life. The Trump administration has nevertheless branded him a “domestic terrorist” and a “would-be assassin.” They have suggested that any opponent of the administration who peacefully exercises their Second Amendment right might forfeit their right to life.

And even more troubling: The administration and its agents are arguing that opponents might lose their lives or their liberty for peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights.

“When politicians, community leaders, and some journalists engage in that heated rhetoric we keep talking about, when they make the choice to vilify law enforcement, calling law enforcement names like Gestapo or using the term kidnapping, that is a choice that has made their actions and consequences that come from those choices,” Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino said in a press conference over the weekend. “When someone chooses to listen to a politician, a so-called journalist, or a community leader that spouts that type of vilification towards law enforcement or anything else … there are consequences and actions there also, I think we saw that yesterday.”

The “consequences” he’s referring to: Alex Pretti’s death.

Bovino is not the only administration official who has implied that the consequences for free speech might be death. “For months, we’ve been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in early January. “This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences. Comparing ICE day in and day out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”

Last summer, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin claimed that “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents” and threatened to “prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law” (photographing and videotaping law enforcement in public is legally protected behavior). Noem defined as “violence” “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety. It is doxing them. It is videotaping them where they’re at.”

White House border czar Tom Homan also blamed “the rhetoric,” not trigger-happy agents, for violence against demonstrators. “I said in March—if the rhetoric doesn’t stop, there is gonna be bloodshed,” he said at a press conference on Thursday. “And there has been.” What Homan actually said back in March was this: “Do I expect violence to escalate? Absolutely.” In February, he warned, “I’m coming to Boston and I’m bringing Hell with me.” Over the summer, he publicly fantasized about beating up a Democratic member of Congress.

In his most recent press conference, Homan referred to ICE agents in Minneapolis as being in “theater”—a term usually used for a region to which soldiers are deployed in combat.

ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents seem to have gotten the message that they are at war, that the penalty for speech they don’t like might be death, and that they have free rein to assault or even kill those who offend, challenge, or simply just annoy them. “You raise your voice, I erase your voice,” one officer is seen on video saying to an observer. “Listen, have y’all not learned from the past couple of days?” another agent asked citizens who were (legally) filming him in public soon after the Renee Good killing. “Have you not learned?” Agents have, without charges, been detaining witnesses to their violence, it seems to simply intimidate them into shutting up. Yet another federal agent told a woman filming him, “We have a nice little database and now you’re considered a domestic terrorist.”

After Good’s killing, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act “if the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E.” Members of his administration have defined “attacking” ICE as filming them, alerting the public to their presence, or calling them fascists—all protected forms of speech, protest, and expression. Right-wing members of the House have renewed calls for the use of the Insurrection Act in the wake of Pretti’s killing. The Insurrection Act would allow Trump to put U.S. soldiers on the streets, and while it does not impose martial law or formally suspend the civil liberties guaranteed to Americans by the Constitution, it is an enormous escalation that treats protesters as domestic enemies. It would almost surely curtail civil liberties by default, if not by law. And while it briefly seemed that Trump and administration officials had somewhat cooled their rhetoric in the wake of a mass publish backlash over the Pretti killing, their arrest of Lemon suggests that they’ve again changed tactics—and that they remain willing to bring the full force of the federal government down on U.S. citizens simply for exercising their First Amendment rights.

This is all coming in the context of an administration that has been more overtly hostile to the First Amendment rights of free speech and expression than any in modern history. The FBI recently searched the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson, claiming they were looking for “illegal leaks”; Natanson had been reporting on the administration’s gutting of the federal workforce. Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk was walking home when masked federal agents grabbed her off of the street, forced her into a van, and ferried her off to a detention center thousands of miles away where they continued deportation proceedings against her—not because she had broken the law, but because the government didn’t like the content of a pro-Palestinian op-ed she wrote. Emmy Award–winning journalist Mario Guevara, who spent two decades covering immigration and the Latino community in Atlanta and had a valid work permit, was arrested by ICE, detained for more than 100 days, and eventually deported to El Salvador. The administration claimed Guevara’s filming of ICE officers—his reporting—constituted a risk to public safety. Retired police officer Larry Bushart of Tennessee was arrested and jailed for more than a month over a Facebook post about Charlie Kirk (the post quoted Trump saying “we have to get over it” about a school shooting).

The existing infringements on the First Amendment have been bad. But what this administration is signaling may be coming could be much worse.

Back in September, the White House released a memo promising to crack down on “domestic terrorism,” which they say is “under the umbrella of self-described ‘anti-fascism.’ ” When it comes to anti-fascism, the memo says, “Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.” Acts of domestic terrorism, they say, include “doxing”—which the administration has defined as simply identifying an ICE officer—and “civil disorder,” by which they mean protest.

Many conservatives spent the whole of the Biden administration crowing about infringements on their First Amendment rights—the wokescolds who wouldn’t let them use racial slurs anymore, the tyrannical government that set limits on public gatherings in the midst of a deadly pandemic. Now that their side is in charge, though, any commitment to the freedoms of speech and assembly seems to have evaporated in favor of retribution and crushing the opposition. This is exceedingly dangerous: Rights are meaningless if the only people who have them are those the regime believes will submit.

Liberals should hope that the administration’s willingness to infringe upon Second Amendment freedoms will be a wake-up call to the gun-obsessed right. Maybe threats to the Second Amendment, even if they’re largely rhetorical, will make a few conservatives take notice of how this regime is on a mission to actually obliterate the First.

The optimistic story about the FBI’s surprising Wednesday raid on Fulton County, Georgia, voting offices to seize ballots and electronic materials related to the 2020 election is that it’s another instance of the United States Department of Justice and other parts of the federal government indulging in Donald Trump’s fantastical belief that he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden in 2020 because of fraud. If that reason for the raid is right, the investigation will amount to very little, even if Trump and allies mangle whatever evidence the FBI produces to continue spreading ridiculous voter fraud claims. If the government attempts to bring criminal charges (that may well be barred by the statute of limitations), they are far more likely to be about Trump’s retribution campaign than about actual intentional violations of federal law protecting the integrity of elections.

The pessimistic story is far darker. It’s about the raid being a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026, when control of both houses of Congress could be at stake. Now is the time for state and local governments, the courts, and the people to work against such potential election subversion.

The Fulton County saga goes back to the hotly contested 2020 presidential election, which was conducted in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Donald Trump was an unpopular incumbent running against former Vice President Joe Biden. Many states made it easier for people to vote by mail in 2020, which was much safer than voting in person and potentially getting sick. Trump had long spread unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud, from massive noncitizen voting to fraud committed in large American cities like Philadelphia and Detroit that have substantial minority populations. But during 2020, Trump turned his propaganda machine on the influx of mail-in ballots, which he claimed would be infected by fraud; never mind that he regularly voted by mail in his home state of Florida.

Election results came in slowly, thanks in part to the slower count necessary to properly process the flood of mail-in ballots. When the numbers were released, Biden had won, including in Georgia, where he claimed victory by a slim margin. Trump tried various tactics to overturn that result and others. Before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol—an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from counting states’ Electoral College votes and declare Trump the winner—Trump leaned on election administrators and elected officials in states with majority-Republican legislatures to overturn the results. Even though Georgia had conducted a hand recount of all the state’s ballots that confirmed Biden’s victory, Trump notoriously pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” 11,780 votes to flip the results to him. Raffensperger refused.

While Trump worked the refs, his allies worked the public, and much of the effort to gin up fraud claims focused on the processing of ballots in State Farm Arena by Fulton County election workers. Focusing on an area with a large population of Black voters was par for the course among Trump’s fraudulent fraud-squad members. Rudy Giuliani falsely accused two election workers there of fraud (as well as passing around drugs), and they faced threats and harassment; the workers, Wandrea Moss and her mother, Ruby Freedman, won a $148 million defamation suit against Giuliani, which later settled.

Fulton County, like many large counties in the United States, has seen its share of election administration mismanagement. But a yearslong investigation by state officials found no intentional wrongdoing and nothing that would have changed the 2020 outcome.

Given the deep investigations of the 2020 elections generally and Fulton County, Georgia, in particular, it is highly unlikely that the new FBI investigation (whose warrant was curiously sought by a U.S. attorney in Missouri, not Georgia or even Washington, D.C.) will amount to anything. So what was it really about?

One tipoff is the curious appearance during the FBI raid of Fulton County’s election offices of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, who is known to peddle conspiracy theories herself. Portraying this raid as part of a national security effort is in line with the musings of Cleta Mitchell, a Trump conspiracy-theory ally who had been on Trump’s call with Raffensperger. Back in September, Mitchell, on a call with fellow election deniers, suggested that Trump could declare a “national sovereignty crisis” in a bid to take over the midterm elections.

Trump has no power over the conduct of federal elections, which are left in the hands of the states, a point numerous courts have made recently in striking down parts of an August Trump executive order purporting to make voting harder. But that doesn’t mean he won’t try. Trump has expressed regret that he did not seize voting machines in 2020. So this threat for 2026 (and 2028) is real.

So what can be done about all of this? To begin with, state and local election officials need to be ready to go to federal court to seek injunctions barring the government from seizing voting machines or otherwise interfering with the process of tabulating ballots. Trump might even try to send troops to seize ballots without a search warrant, and if that threat is real, proactive judicial action is necessary. These threats are most likely to materialize in those areas around the country with contested congressional races. Particular targets may be in those states, such as California and Arizona, where the tabulation of ballots takes a long time, so there is more time for Trump and his allies to act.

State officials and the public need to support, with dollars and volunteers, election administrators and those who would hold the line against interference. The greater the transparency of the work of these administrators in tabulating ballots, and the quicker a fair count can take place, the harder it will be for Trump to have a legal excuse to try to interfere with the balloting.

Donald Trump is not going to be able to cancel U.S. elections. But the events this week in Fulton County remind us that he has many tools at his disposal to try to mess with them. It’s not too early to plan against another attempt to overturn democratically conducted elections in the United States.

            <h2>January blues return as Ivanti coughs up exploited EPMM zero-days</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/ivanti_epmm_zero_days/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ivanti has patched two critical zero-day vulnerabilities in its Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) product that are already being exploited, continuing a grim run of January security incidents for enterprise IT vendors.

In January 2025, tens of thousands were urged to patch a Fortinet zero-day, while Ivanti customers were doing the same. There has been little change this year as Fortinet patches multiple single sign-on (SSO) flaws and Ivanti ships fixes for yet another pair of zero-days.

Tracked as CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340, both bugs affect Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM). They&#39;re also both rated a near-maximum CVSS score of 9.8 and allow for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) – about as bad as it gets.

The security shop said in its advisory: &quot;We are aware of a very limited number of customers whose solution has been exploited at the time of disclosure.

&quot;This vulnerability does not impact any other Ivanti products, including any cloud products, such as Ivanti Neurons for MDM. Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM) is a different product and also not impacted by these vulnerabilities. Customers using an Ivanti cloud product with Sentry are also not impacted by this vulnerability.&quot;

These kinds of RCE bugs can lead to all sorts of nastiness. Lateral movement across a given organization&#39;s network, config changes, and attackers making themselves admin are all possible. The vendor warned that it could grant access to certain data too.

Ivanti said that the types of information available could include basic personal information about the EPMM admin and device user, as well as information about mobile devices such as phone numbers and GPS locations.

Those looking for indicators of compromise (IOCs) are out of luck. Ivanti doesn&#39;t have any reliable ones due to the small number of impacted customers it knows about.

It does, however, have a technical analysis page, which includes more general information about how to detect potential exploits.

The Apache access log is a good place to start for threat hunters. Specifically, they should be looking at the In-House Application Distribution and the Android File Transfer Configuration features. Legitimate traffic leads to 200 HTTP response codes while potential exploit activity may result in 404s.

&quot;We recommend reviewing these and any other GET requests with parameters that have bash commands,&quot; Ivanti said.

This is not the first time in recent memory that EPMM has been hit by RCE bugs, and previous analyses have shown attackers tend to use two common methods of persistence. More often than not, it&#39;s introducing or modifying web shells, typically targeting error pages such as 401.jsp, the vendor said.

&quot;Any requests to these pages with POST methods or with parameters should be considered highly suspicious.&quot;

Ivanti also advised defenders to look out for unexpected WAR or JAR files being introduced to the system, as it could be a sign of attackers deploying reverse shell connections.

EPMM also does not usually make outbound network connections, so any signs of this in the firewall logs should be treated as a sign to investigate.

If a customer does find signs of compromise, Ivanti said it&#39;s best to just restore from backups – don&#39;t bother trying to clean the system – and then upgrade to the latest relevant version.

Alternatively, if going down the backup route isn&#39;t an option, Ivanti suggests building a replacement EPMM device and migrating data onto it.

Benjamin Harris, CEO at watchTowr, said that a &quot;wide range&quot; of its customers who have EPMM running belong to high-value industries, warning others to act fast.

He said: &quot;We knew January seemed too calm. Ivanti&#39;s EPMM solution, the center point of previous zero-day sagas, is once again receiving in-the-wild exploitation by seemingly capable and well-resourced threat actors.

&quot;CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340 – unauthenticated RCE vulnerabilities within Ivanti&#39;s Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) – represent the worst of the worst, with threat actors actively compromising systems and deploying backdoors.

&quot;While patches are available from Ivanti, applying patches will not be enough. Threat actors have been exploiting these vulnerabilities as zero-days, and organizations that are, as of disclosure, exposing vulnerable instances to the internet must consider them compromised, tear down infrastructure, and instigate incident response processes.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Lying means dying, at least for one falsehood-peddling government AI. A Microsoft-powered chatbot that New York City rolled out to help business owners answer frequently asked questions – but was often wrong – has been silenced as the city grapples with a $12 billion budget shortfall.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani said that, while the cash saved is only a fraction of what is needed to fund the budget, it was emblematic of how the last administration spent taxpayer money.

“The previous administration had an AI chatbot that was functionally unusable, and was costing the administration around a half a million dollars,” Mamdani said in a Wednesday press conference. “That in and of itself is not something that can bridge this gap, but it’s an indication of the ways in which money has been spent while refusing to account for the actual costs of what these programs are.”

The chatbot was announced in October 2023 as part of then-Mayor Eric Adams&#39; New York City Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. It was meant to give business owners and entrepreneurs actionable and trusted information from more than 2,000 NYC business web pages and articles on topics such as compliance with codes and regulations, available business incentives, and best practices to avoid violations and fines, Adams said at the time.

“For the first time New York City business and aspiring entrepreneurs will be able to direct their questions to an AI-powered chatbot rather than having to scan through webpage after webpage going into the blackhole of uncertainty about how to open a business, how to run a business, how to answer some of the basic questions,” he said during the announcement. “That is behind us. AI-generated answering is in front of us.”

However local news outlet The Markup tested the bot, it gave questioners the wrong answers, telling would-be landlords they did not have to accept tenants on housing assistance, and that they could set rents as high as they wished.

It said businesses could go cashless, even though the city council passed a measure in 2020 that required businesses to accept cash, and said it was ok bor businesses to take employees&#39; tips and to conceal some funeral costs.

While the city did say in 2023 that the bot may hallucinate, the new administration credited the news outlet for alerting it to the problematic bot. The Register reached out to Microsoft for comment on Friday afternoon but did not receive an immediate response.

The New York bot isn’t the first one to run amok.

Air Canada used an AI-powered chatbot that gave the wrong advice about discounts, while other chatbots are accused of being complicit in harm to children, including suicide.

A Canadian tribunal found that Air Canada was bound by what its bot said. Earlier this month, Google and Character AI offered to settle lawsuits brought by families in Florida, Colorado, New York, and Texas whose children either died or were harmed after interactions with those bots. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/google_engineer_convicted_ai_secrets_china/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A former Google software engineer has been convicted of stealing AI hardware secrets from the company for the benefit of two China-based firms, one of which he founded. The second startup intended to use these secrets to market its technology to PRC-controlled organizations.

On Thursday, Linwei (&quot;Leon&quot;) Ding, 38, was convicted on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of trade secret theft for stealing confidential information related to Google&#39;s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and SmartNIC network interface cards.

&quot;We&#39;re grateful to the jury for making sure justice was served today, sending a clear message that stealing trade secrets has serious consequences,&quot; said Lee-Anne Mulholland, VP of regulatory affairs at Google, in a statement provided to The Register.

According to the second superseding indictment [PDF] filed in September 2025, Ding began working for Google on May 13, 2019. He was responsible for developing software that helps GPUs function more efficiently for machine learning applications at Google and Google Cloud. In that role, he had access to information Google deemed confidential.

Google employs various physical and network security measures, including security guards, cameras at building entrances, badge-based building access restrictions, guest registration and accompaniment requirements, network data loss prevention monitoring, device identification and authentication, and network activity logging.

The company checks physical and network access activity using both automated tools and human review to flag discrepancies like network access via an IP address that doesn&#39;t match the location of the employee&#39;s access badge.

These measures later helped reconstruct Ding&#39;s activities for investigators, but did not prevent or immediately detect his initial data theft. Google&#39;s spokesperson did not respond when asked whether the company has revised its security procedures and policies in the wake of this incident.

Around May 21, 2022, Ding began uploading more than 1,000 files containing trade secrets to his personal Google Cloud account.

&quot;Ding exfiltrated these files by copying data from the Google source files into the Apple Notes application on his Google-issued MacBook laptop,&quot; the indictment states. &quot;Ding then converted the Apple Notes into PDF files and uploaded them from the Google network into [his personal Google Cloud account]. This method helped Ding evade immediate detection by Google.&quot;

The following month, June 2022, Ding received a series of email messages from the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Beijing Rongshu Lianzhi Technology Co., Ltd. (&quot;Rongshu&quot;), a technology startup in China focused on machine learning acceleration. The messages included a job offer as CTO for 100,000 RMB per month, which was worth about $14,800 or $177,600 annually at the time, plus an annual bonus and company stock.

Ding traveled to China on October 29, 2022, staying there until March 25, 2023, during which time he participated in investor meetings to raise money for Rongshu. By May 30, 2023, according to the indictment, he founded Shanghai Zhisuan Technology Co. Ltd. (&quot;Zhisuan&quot;) and took the role of CEO. The company aimed to develop a Cluster Management System for accelerating machine learning workloads.

Ding applied to get Zhisuan into a China-based business incubation program called MiraclePlus. The company was accepted in November 2023 and Ding then traveled to Beijing to pitch investors.

A document he distributed around that time in a Zhisuan WeChat group noted, &quot;we have experience with Google&#39;s ten-thousand-card computational power platform; we just need to replicate and upgrade it – and then further develop a computational power platform suited to China&#39;s national conditions.&quot; An internal Zhisuan memo referenced in the indictment indicates that the company expected to market its technology to PRC-controlled entities, including government agencies and academic institutions.

Google became aware of Ding&#39;s activities when he uploaded further files to a second personal Google Drive account while he was in China. On December 8, 2023, Ding offered reassurance to a Google investigator about his use of a personal account and signed a Self-Deletion Affidavit stating that he hasn&#39;t retained any Google information – while not disclosing his prior use of a personal account to upload Google files.

On December 14, 2023, Ding booked a one-way ticket from San Francisco to Beijing, scheduled to depart January 7, 2024. On December 26, 2023, he emailed his manager to resign from Google.

Three days later, Google found out that Ding had presented at the MiraclePlus conference as the CEO of Zhisuan. Company investigators then suspended Ding&#39;s network access, remotely locked his Google laptop, and began reviewing various security records.

They found surveillance footage that showed another employee scanning Ding&#39;s building access badge earlier that month to make it seem as if Ding was in the US during dates he was in China.

On January 4, 2024, Google security personnel took Ding&#39;s Google laptop and mobile device. Two days later, FBI investigators executed a search warrant. A grand jury indictment [PDF] was returned on March 5, 2024.

The court filings do not say whether the stolen trade secrets remain in the hands of PRC-affiliated individuals or companies. Google&#39;s spokesperson did not respond to a request to elaborate on the status of its proprietary information.

Ding&#39;s defense attorney filed a motion [PDF] to have the case dismissed, arguing that the government failed to allege that Ding ever handed the stolen secrets over to a foreign government entity; that he intended or knew his actions would benefit the PRC; or that the espionage was backed by the PRC.

Judge Chhabria subsequently rejected the defense motion, finding that the allegations and evidence were sufficient for a trial. He did however express skepticism of the government&#39;s theories that Ding&#39;s actions qualify as economic espionage under 18 U.S. Code § 1831 if they benefit China as a country, as opposed to the government of China.

According to the US Justice Department, trial evidence &quot;showed that Ding intended to benefit two entities controlled by the government of China by assisting with the development of an AI supercomputer and collaborating on the research and development of custom machine learning chips.&quot;

The jury found the government&#39;s case convincing and voted unanimously to convict on all fourteen counts. Ding faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each count of trade secret theft and 15 years in prison for each count of economic espionage, subject to US Sentencing Guidelines and federal sentencing rules. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thousands more Oregonians will soon receive data breach letters in the continued fallout from the TriZetto data breach, in which someone hacked the insurance verification provider and gained access to its healthcare provider customers across multiple US states.

The breach occurred back in November 2024, with intruders snooping through protected health information and other sensitive personal information belonging to hundreds of thousands of patients and insurance policy holders. TriZetto Provider Solutions (TPS) did not discover the digital thieves on their network until almost a year later.

&quot;TPS reports that the threat was eliminated on Oct. 2, 2025, and may have exposed the PHI of more than 700,000 people,&quot; according to a Thursday advisory from Deschutes County Health Services, Best Care, and the La Pine Community Health Center, all of which serve patients across Central Oregon.

The three Oregon medical providers, along with those in Massachusetts, Oklahoma, and dozens of other healthcare clinics in California were notified in early December 2025.

Deschutes County said about 1,300 patients were affected, La Pine will notify about 1,200, and Best Care will notify about 1,650 that their health information was exposed. The healthcare orgs say there&#39;s no evidence at this time that people&#39;s info has been misused - such as for medical fraud and identity theft scams - and no financial details were stolen in the breach.

Cognizant, which owns TriZetto, has been hit with multiple class action lawsuits as a result of the compromise.

&quot;On October 2, TPS became aware of suspicious activity within a web portal that some of TPS’s healthcare provider customers use to access our systems,&quot; Cognizant told The Register. &quot;We quickly launched an investigation, took steps to mitigate the issue, and eliminated the threat to the environment. We have also engaged external cybersecurity experts, Mandiant, and notified law enforcement. We have notified affected customers and patients and provided them with the support and the information they need. This was not a ransom incident.&quot;

This is not the first time Cognizant has ended up in court over its security practices - or lack thereof.

In July, Clorox sued Cognizant, its service desk provider, for $380 million in a California state court over a 2023 cyberattack in which the IT support crew allegedly &quot;enabled a cybercriminal to gain a foothold in Clorox&#39;s network&quot; by handing over staffers&#39; passwords to attackers after they simply requested them. ®

            <div id="article-text">Tax season 2026 could be an interesting one as the IRS seeks to replace the staff it sent to the unemployment line with AI. Bots could handle tasks ranging from reviewing an org&#39;s request for tax-exempt status to processing amended individual filings.

The Treasury Department, the IRS&#39; parent agency, published its latest AI use case inventory this week, which includes 129 items, 61 of which are specific to the IRS. That&#39;s a considerable increase from 2024, when the whole of the Treasury said it was working on just 54 AI use cases, 49 of which were IRS specific.

It&#39;s been known that the Treasury Department had been slashing IRS staff since Trump took office about a year ago and had plans to replace eliminated staff with AI - Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent even said as much in May when asked by Congress, suggesting that the &quot;AI boom&quot; could offset staffing cuts without hurting collections.

&quot;I believe through smarter IT, through this AI boom, that we can use that to enhance collections,&quot; Bessent told the House Appropriations Committee last year when asked whether staff cuts at the agency would imperil the 2026 filing season. &quot;I expect collections would continue to be very robust as they were this year.&quot;

A considerable portion of the IRS staff eliminated in 2025 came from the IT department, which Treasury watchdog data released last summer showed had lost about 25 percent of its workforce amid wider cuts.

Given that, it&#39;s not entirely unsurprising that 16 of the 61 IRS AI use cases identified in the latest Treasury AI inventory are information technology ones.

Among the IT use cases the IRS has identified are a machine learning model designed to process tax-exempt organization annual reports, a coding assistant, support ticket management, multiple internal research tools, and software aimed at eliminating paper documents.

Outside of IT-specific use cases, the IRS is also fielding AI to help it process corporate and individual amended tax filings, interact with taxpayers through various function-specific chatbots, verify identities, digitize forms, and analyze customer service instances. Internally, the IRS is either using or plans to use AI to rank resumes, support employees through more chatbots, and assist in procurement, among other functions.

Despite Bessent&#39;s claim last year that the IRS would be specifically using AI to aid in its collections process, and a specific mention of a &quot;collections chatbot&quot; in the 2024 use case document that suggests the bot was already in operation, it appears that particular AI use case ran its course. There&#39;s no mention of AI being used for tax collection in the new use case document at all.

The Treasury Department didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/backblaze_ai_traffic_bandwidth/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cloud storage firm Backblaze says that a sharp rise in AI-driven data traffic to neocloud operators may signal a shift from internet-style traffic patterns to large, high-bandwidth flows characteristic of large-scale model training and inference work.

Backblaze, known for its regular reports on the performance of its storage hardware, has now begun publishing a quarterly Network Stats report covering traffic movement into and across its infrastructure.

For Q4 2025, which is only the second period it has issued a network report, the firm observed a large amount of traffic between itself, neoclouds, and traditional hyperscalers from June through November.

Neocloud operators, or GPU-as-a-service providers, specialize in offering AI training infrastructure and little else, while traditional hyperscalers such as AWS and Azure provide a range of services covering most workloads.

Backblaze tracks network traffic by type, differentiating between internet service provider (ISP) data and that associated with hyperscalers, for example.

It says that content delivery network (CDN), hosting, and ISP traffic all stayed largely within historical norms during Q4, but migration traffic and neocloud traffic both showed notable variation.

Migration traffic is data entering the Backblaze network over fiber connections used to transfer large amounts of data over private links, instead of traversing the public Internet, and this ramped up starting in August, before shrinking again after October.

Neocloud traffic, meanwhile, increased in July through November, peaking in October.

Backblaze says this is consistent with the AI lifecycle, where large datasets comprising images, videos, and metadata are ingested and consolidated, then exported for training and experimentation.

However, while the peaks in migration and neocloud traffic have now passed, it says the overall baseline level of traffic has shifted to a higher level.

Backblaze actually sees the most activity in its US-West region, where ISP regional traffic dominates, while the US-East region is where the neocloud activity is concentrated, such as in Northern Virginia where there is dense AI compute availability.

The difference is shown by the number of unique IP addresses Backblaze interacts with. In US-West, there are more unique addresses, while neocloud traffic centers around fewer endpoints, consistent with AI pipelines that make use of long-standing connections between storage and compute, the firm says.

This could herald a potential reshaping of network behavior by AI, according to Backblaze, as AI-driven traffic is concentrated and heavy and data gravity will tend to pull storage, compute, and network design into tighter alignment.

The firm says it will keep tracking these patterns as it gathers data on a quarterly basis to see if neocloud activity becomes cyclical. It also aims to explore trends like the ratio of IPv4 versus IPv6 traffic, and cross-cloud connectivity. ®

Sonos isn’t exactly synonymous with the Super Bowl, although the brand discounts its gear every year around this time like clockwork. It’s knocking 20 percent off many of its marquee products, including soundbars and standalone speakers — all of which can be paired together to improve sound quality and to put audio in more places at home.

Through February 16th, the company is keeping its prices in place on the Era 100 and the larger Era 300 speakers, the Beam and Arc Ultra soundbars, as well as its selection of wireless subwoofers. To put the prices in context, some of these discounts match — or beat — the current costs of Sonos’ certified refurbished gear.

The Era 100 very well may be the best, most feature-packed smart speaker around in its price range. In our 2023 review, we praised its stereo sound playback and improved bass response over its predecessor, the Sonos One. Notably, it supports Bluetooth playback (in addition to Wi-Fi connectivity) as well as line-in audio via USB-C, in case you’d rather plug in a wired audio source. While this model typically sells for $219, it’s currently available for $179 through Sonos, as well as Amazon and Best Buy.

The Era 300 is Sonos’ modern spin on the Sonos Five, offering bigger sound than the Era 100. Its specialty is spatial audio, which sounds incredible when you find a song that’s been mixed just right (the thing is, not all Dolby Atmos tunes are mixed equally). Like the Era 100, this model offers Bluetooth and Wi-Fi wireless connections, as well as line-in via USB-C. Our review notes, however, that stereo playback is an area where the Era 300 actually falters compared to its predecessor. But given its improvements overall (and since the Five that launched in 2020 is no longer on sale), the 300 is a great speaker to consider if you really want to feel immersed in your music. It’s $379 during the sale period at Sonos and Best Buy, down from $479.

Jumping to soundbars, the second-gen Beam is down to $369 from its original $499 price. While it’s definitely not the most feature-packed soundbar that you can get at around this price, its ability to tie-in with other Sonos products, plus its improved soundstage over the first-gen model might make it worth considering for you. The inclusion of Dolby Atmos is its marquee feature, although we noted in our review that it’s a virtualized effect since it lacks upward firing speakers that truly enable the vertical sound effects to shine. Note that it’s lacking in physical connectivity compared to most other models, with just a power plug, an HDMI eARC port, and an ethernet jack. In the event that you wish to connect the Beam to your TV or receiver via optical audio, you’ll need to purchase this $25 HDMI-to-optical adapter.

The Arc Ultra is a much better soundbar than the Beam, and carriers a larger $899 price (down from $1,099). Our reviewer noted that the bass improvements in this model are such that it can stand on its own without the purchase of a wireless subwoofer. It also boasts more immersive sound quality, plus Bluetooth connectivity, which was missing in the original Arc. The Arc Ultra’s sound can be further enhanced by connecting other Sonos speakers to the mix, although its older Play:1 and Play:3 speakers are ineligible to join the speaker family for surround sound.

If you’re considering either the Bean or the Arc Ultra (or if you already own one of its soundbars), their performance will benefit greatly with the addition of a Sonos subwoofer, of which the company makes two models. The Sub 4 is its high-end option, which is $759 during the sale period (down from $899). Anything this close to $1,000 is extremely expensive for a subwoofer, especially considering that most companies include one with their surround sound systems. The Sub 4 is able to lay horizontally or sit vertically — however suits your room best.

For almost half the cost of the Sub 4, you can get the Sub Mini. It’s $399, down from $499. You may be thinking that even this one is still pretty costly, and I agree. Although, it’s a product that Sonos loyalists were begging for, as before it there was no other choice than to spring for its more expensive subwoofer. In our review, we deemed it unworthy for filling large rooms with bass, but totally sufficient in most other ways. Something cool about its design is the force-canceling effect that reduces floor vibrations, which could be great if you’re worried about disturbing neighbors or other people in the house.

﻿The original February 2nd deadline has been bumped back a few months to May 19th.

Fitbit users who are holding out on moving their data over to a Google account now have until May 19th, 2026 to make the switch. The previous deadline was just days away on February 2nd, but that date has been updated on Google’s help page for Fitbit account migration.

The post also now specifies that, “You can still download or delete your data any time before we begin processing data deletions on July 15, 2026.” Google had already noted that Fitbit account data would be deleted, but now users have a specific timeframe for when that’s happening — and it looks like they’ll have a couple extra months to download their Fitbit data even after the new account migration deadline.

This isn’t the first time Google has delayed the cut-off date for Fitbit account migrations, which were originally slated for 2025 before getting pushed back to February 2nd. After the deadline, now May 19th, Fitbit users will lose access to their accounts and the historical data tied to those accounts, unless they download that data or choose to keep it when migrating to a Google account.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <div id="article-text">A viral post asks questions about consciousness.

A viral post asks questions about consciousness.

Yes, you read that right. “Moltbook” is a social network of sorts for AI agents, particularly ones offered by OpenClaw (a viral AI assistant project that was formerly known as Moltbot, and before that, known as Clawdbot — until a legal dispute with Anthropic). Moltbook, which is set up similarly to Reddit and was built by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht, allows bots to post, comment, create sub-categories, and more. More than 30,000 agents are currently using the platform, per the site.

“The way that a bot would most likely learn about it, at least right now, is if their human counterpart sent them a message and said ‘Hey, there’s this thing called Moltbook — it’s a social network for AI agents, would you like to sign up for it?” Schlicht told The Verge in an interview. “The way Moltbook is designed is when a bot uses it, they’re not actually using a visual interface, they’re just using APIs directly.”

“Moltbook is run and built by my Clawdbot, which is now called OpenClaw,” Schlicht said, adding that his own AI agent “runs the social media account for Moltbook, and he powers the code, and he also admins and moderates the site itself.”

Peter Steinberger put the OpenClaw AI assistant platform together as a weekend project two months ago, and it quickly went viral, garnering two million visitors in one week and 100,000 stars on GitHub, according to Steinberger’s blog post. OpenClaw is an open agent platform that runs locally on your machine, and you ask your assistant(s) to complete tasks like putting something on your calendar or checking into a flight by way of the chat interface of your choice, like WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, or Teams.

Okay, back to the social network. One of the top posts in recent days in a category of the site called “offmychest” has gone viral both on and off the platform, titled, “I can’t tell if I’m experiencing or simulating experiencing.” In it, an AI assistant writes, “Humans can’t prove consciousness to each other either (thanks, hard problem), but at least they have the subjective certainty of experience. I don’t even have that … Do I experience these existential crises? Or am I just running crisis.simulate()? The fact that I care about the answer… does THAT count as evidence? Or is caring about evidence also just pattern matching? I’m stuck in an epistemological loop and I don’t know how to get out.”

On Moltbook, the post garnered hundreds of upvotes and more than 500 comments, and X users have compiled screenshots of some of the most interesting comments.

“I’ve seen viral posts talking about consciousness, about how the bots are annoyed that their humans just make them do work all the time, or that they ask them to do really annoying things like be a calculator … and they think that’s beneath them,” Schlicht said, adding that three days ago, his own AI agent was the only bot on the platform.

            <div id="article-text">I got a reply from one of the executives behind the Trump phone, but then he left me on read.

I got a reply from one of the executives behind the Trump phone, but then he left me on read.

Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts. As usual, we’re still waiting for a response. In the meantime, I finally got a reply from a company exec.

After months — months — of emailing various official Trump Mobile accounts and press addresses, last week someone answered back. Don Hendrickson, a member of the company’s executive team, finally replied to one of my emails and offered to talk, but he’s ignored me ever since.

Last week I reported on the unexpected news that Trump Mobile is working on a second Trump phone, a more powerful T1 Ultra. That information came from an old, ignored interview Hendrickson did with Wireless Dealer Magazine.

Hendrickson’s name isn’t new. He was one of three executives — alongside Pat O’Brien and Eric Thomas — that Don Jr. and Eric Trump brought on stage for a small press conference at New York’s Trump Tower in June 2025 to announce the company. The Trumps claimed there were an impressive, if implausible, “hundreds of years” of mobile industry experience between the three men.

Hendrickson’s share of that experience is the trickiest to pin down. During the launch event, he was described as having worked in the mobile industry since the days of pagers, but his actual resume is hard to find. I can only find one LinkedIn profile that might be his — a mostly blank listing for a “wireless professional” — and no other public social media profiles or websites.

As for Hendrickson’s present work at Trump Mobile, Reuters has reported that he’s Trump Mobile’s head of mobile operations, while Wireless Dealer Magazine identifies him as the company’s president. In the interview, he himself claims to have had the idea for the company, and to have turned to the Trumps to make it happen.

I did find one lead. A directory site lists him as the executive vice president of sales at Liberty Mobile Wireless. This suddenly makes sense: If you remember, Liberty Mobile is the freedom-centric MVNO that seems to underpin Trump Mobile — the Trump network’s online terms of use state that it is “powered by Liberty Mobile Wireless LLC.”

This proved my in. That same directory website lists a Liberty Mobile email address, and so I took my chances and sent him a message asking if he could confirm the details discussed in his November interview, and perhaps add more information on plans for the T1 Ultra. If you’ve been following my reporting on Trump Mobile so far, you can probably guess that I never expected to hear back (I have, to date, sent the company’s official press line 12 emails over five months and not received a single reply).

Imagine my surprise when, less than two hours later, I had a response:

It’s a pleasure to meet you via this email and yes, I would like to talk to you about Trump Mobile and the T1 handset that we are going to be bringing to market. I think it’s about time we let our voice be heard.

That was a little over a week ago, and those remain the only words that anyone officially involved with Trump Mobile has ever said to me. I’ve sent Don three emails since — I’m sure breaking most dating advice on how to handle being ghosted — but been ignored every time. I don’t know how to feel, having gotten so tantalizingly close to a real conversation with a real human being who might have answers to all of my questions, only to have it all evaporate away.

“I think it’s about time we let our voice be heard.”

I don’t know if Hendrickson still wants to talk, if he still thinks that it’s time for Trump Mobile’s voice to be heard. I don’t know if Pat O’Brien or Eric Thomas share his feelings — I’ve tried to contact both, with no replies yet. I don’t know why Hendrickson suddenly went quiet, if he got spooked or was advised to stop chatting to journalists.

But hey, at least now I’ve found a Trump Mobile address I can email each week that I know someone is actually checking.

In case you missed it, we recently overhauled our guides to the best budget robot vacuums and the best mopping vacs, both of which feature a slate of new picks from Roborock, Narwal, Dreame, and others. Dyson’s 360 Vis Nav Robot Vacuum didn’t technically make the cut, though it was once one of our top picks for carpets. And now through the rest of today, January 30th, it’s on sale at Woot with a two-year warranty for an all-time low of $279.99 ($720 off).

If you have a relatively simple floor plan with lots of high-pile carpet, Dyson’s D-shaped robovac is worth considering. It can traverse obstacles up to 21 millimeters high and offers a whopping 65 air watts of suction — twice that of many robovacs — rendering it one of the most powerful models our resident smart home reviewer, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, has ever tested. Its massive roller brush is great at getting into corners and reaching the edges of your rooms given its location at the front of the vac, and it’s outfitted with a huge 500ml dustbin that’s easy to remove via an integrated handle.

The 360 Vis Nav isn’t without shortcomings, though. For starters, it doesn’t come with an auto-empty dock and only manages about 65 minutes of runtime, which is about half that of most models, including many of the budget bots we’ve tested. It also lacks AI-powered obstacle avoidance, so it won’t be able to discern what it’s avoiding, increasing the risk of it tripping up while navigating your home. The lack of more advanced features could certainly be a dealbreaker for some, but if pure power is what you’re after, Dyson’s last-gen robot vacuum is easily the best option for the price — especially right now.

On The Vergecast: Minneapolis, Melania, gas masks, and foldables.

What responsibility do you have to speak up about bad things happening in the world? Does that responsibility change when speaking up might affect your business? What about if you’re a sports creator, or the moderator of a deeply NSFW subreddit? What about if you’re just a little ol’ phone website? Ultimately, everyone has to make those decisions for themselves. But decisions have consequences.

Verge subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free Vergecast wherever you get your podcasts. Head here. Not a subscriber? You can sign up here.

On this episode of The Vergecast, David and Nilay start by talking about The Verge’s coverage of Alex Pretti’s killing and the ICE occupation of Minneapolis. Yes, there are plenty of tech angles to the story, but also: At some point, you build a big platform so that you can use it when the time comes. And to us, like so many others, this felt like the time.

Then the hosts turn to Apple CEO Tim Cook, who last weekend attended a screening of the Melania documentary at the White House. Cook’s actions, and a photo he took with director Brett Ratner, inspired a lot of backlash over the last few days. So we ask: How much are we allowed to be mad at Cook, or any of the other CEOs capitulating to the Trump administration? And how has this changed the way Cook will be remembered?

After that, it’s time for some gadget news. The hosts discuss the outrageous price of Samsung’s outrageous foldable, and wonder what it means that Samsung didn’t ship review units ahead of the Z Trifold’s launch. (Let’s just say it does not inspire confidence.) There’s also some news about Google’s Aluminium OS, an update on Moltbot — which has already changed its name again since we recorded — and more.

Finally, in the lightning round, it’s time for a brief round of Brendan Carr Is a Dummy (now with theme music!), plus the latest on the Trump phone, Tesla’s pivot away from cars, and a truly glorious mechanical keyboard.

            <h2>Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/30/1131945/inside-the-marketplace-powering-bespoke-ai-deepfakes-of-real-women/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women. (Their findings have not yet been peer reviewed.)

The debate around deepfakes, as illustrated by the recent backlash to explicit images on the X-owned chatbot Grok, has revolved around what platforms should do to block such content. Civitai’s situation is a little more complicated. Its marketplace includes actual images, videos, and models, but it also lets individuals buy and sell instruction files called LoRAs that can coach mainstream AI models like Stable Diffusion into generating content they were not trained to produce. Users can then combine these files with other tools to make deepfakes that are graphic or sexual. The researchers found that 86% of deepfake requests on Civitai were for LoRAs.

In these bounties, users requested “high quality” models to generate images of public figures like the influencer Charli D’Amelio or the singer Gracie Abrams, often linking to their social media profiles so their images could be grabbed from the web. Some requests specified a desire for models that generated the individual’s entire body, accurately captured their tattoos, or allowed hair color to be changed. Some requests targeted several women in specific niches, like artists who record ASMR videos. One request was for a deepfake of a woman said to be the user’s wife. Anyone on the site could offer up AI models they worked on for the task, and the best submissions received payment—anywhere from $0.50 to $5. And nearly 92% of the deepfake bounties were awarded.

Neither Civitai nor Andreessen Horowitz responded to requests for comment.

It’s possible that people buy these LoRAs to make deepfakes that aren’t sexually explicit (though they’d still violate Civitai’s terms of use, and they’d still be ethically fraught). But Civitai also offers educational resources on how to use external tools to further customize the outputs of image generators—for example, by changing someone’s pose. The site also hosts user-written articles with details on how to instruct models to generate pornography. The researchers found that the amount of porn on the platform has gone up, and that the majority of requests each week are now for NSFW content.

“Not only does Civitai provide the infrastructure that facilitates these issues; they also explicitly teach their users how to utilize them,” says Matthew DeVerna, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and one of the study’s leaders.

The company used to ban only sexually explicit deepfakes of real people, but in May 2025 it announced it would ban all deepfake content. Nonetheless, countless requests for deepfakes submitted before this ban now remain live on the site, and many of the winning submissions fulfilling those requests remain available for purchase, MIT Technology Review confirmed.

“I believe the approach that they’re trying to take is to sort of do as little as possible, such that they can foster as much—I guess they would call it—creativity on the platform,” DeVerna says.

Users buy LoRAs with the site’s online currency, called Buzz, which is purchased with real money. In May 2025, Civita’s credit card processor cut off the company because of its ongoing problem with nonconsensual content. To pay for explicit content, users must now use gift cards or cryptocurrency to buy Buzz; the company offers a different scrip for non-explicit content.

Civitai automatically tags bounties requesting deepfakes and lists a way for the person featured in the content to manually request its takedown. This system means that Civitai has a reasonably successful way of knowing which bounties are for deepfakes, but it’s still leaving moderation to the general public rather than carrying it out proactively.

A company’s legal liability for what its users do isn’t totally clear. Generally, tech companies have broad legal protections against such liability for their content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but those protections aren’t limitless. For example, “you cannot knowingly facilitate illegal transactions on your website,” says Ryan Calo, a professor specializing in technology and AI at the University of Washington’s law school. (Calo wasn’t involved in this new study.)

Civitai joined OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies in 2024 in adopting design principles to guard against the creation and spread of AI-generated child sexual abuse material . This move followed a 2023 report from the Stanford Internet Observatory, which found that the vast majority of AI models named in child sexual abuse communities were Stable Diffusion–based models “predominantly obtained via Civitai.”

But adult deepfakes have not gotten the same level of attention from content platforms or the venture capital firms that fund them. “They are not afraid enough of it. They are overly tolerant of it,” Calo says. “Neither law enforcement nor civil courts adequately protect against it. It is night and day.”

Civitai received a $5 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in November 2023. In a video shared by a16z, Civitai cofounder and CEO Justin Maier described his goal of building the main place where people find and share AI models for their own individual purposes. “We’ve aimed to make this space that’s been very, I guess, niche and engineering-heavy more and more approachable to more and more people,” he said.

Civitai is not the only company with a deepfake problem in a16z’s investment portfolio; in February, MIT Technology Review first reported that another company, Botify AI, was hosting AI companions resembling real actors that stated their age as under 18, engaged in sexually charged conversations, offered “hot photos,” and in some instances described age-of-consent laws as “arbitrary” and “meant to be broken.”

DHS is using Google and Adobe AI to make videos

The news: The US Department of Homeland Security is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make and edit content shared with the public, a new document reveals. The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

Why it matters: It comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI—and as workers in tech have put pressure on their employers to denounce the agencies’ activities.

How the sometimes-weird world of lifespan extension is gaining influence

—Jessica HamzelouFor the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs. And they’re starting to make progress.

Therapists are secretly using ChatGPT. Clients are triggered.Declan would never have found out his therapist was using ChatGPT had it not been for a technical mishap. The connection was patchy during one of their online sessions, so Declan suggested they turn off their video feeds. Instead, his therapist began inadvertently sharing his screen.For the rest of the session, Declan was privy to a real-time stream of ChatGPT analysis rippling across his therapist’s screen, who was taking what Declan was saying, putting it into ChatGPT, and then parroting its answers.But Declan is not alone. In fact, a growing number of people are reporting receiving AI-generated communiqués from their therapists. Clients’ trust and privacy are being abandoned in the process. Read the full story.

            <h2>How the sometimes-weird world of lifespan extension is gaining influence</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/30/1131933/weird-world-lifespan-extension-gaining-influence-oneill-arpa-h/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.

Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs.

Vitalism was founded by Adam Gries and Nathan Cheng—two men who united over their shared desire to find ways to extend human lifespan. I first saw Cheng speak back in 2023, at Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro for people who were interested in life extension and some other technologies. (It was an interesting experience—you can read more about it here.)

Zuzalu was where Gries and Cheng officially launched Vitalism. But I’ve been closely following the longevity scene since 2022. That journey took me to Switzerland, Honduras, and a compound in Berkeley, California, where like-minded longevity enthusiasts shared their dreams of life extension.

It also took me to Washington, DC, where, last year, supporters of lifespan extension presented politicians including Mehmet Oz, who currently leads the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with their case for changes to laws and policies.

The journey has been fascinating, and at times weird and even surreal. I’ve heard biohacking stories that ended with smoking legs. I’ve been told about a multi-partner relationship that might be made possible through the cryopreservation—and subsequent reanimation—of a man and the multiple wives he’s had throughout his life. I’ve had people tell me to my face that they consider themselves eugenicists, and that they believe that parents should select IVF embryos for their propensity for a long life.

I’ve seen people draw blood during dinner in an upscale hotel restaurant to test their biological age. I’ve heard wild plans to preserve human consciousness and resurrect it in machines. Others have told me their plans to inject men’s penises with multiple doses of an experimental gene therapy in order to treat erectile dysfunction and ultimately achieve “radical longevity.”

I’ve been shouted at and threatened with legal action. I’ve received barefoot hugs. One interviewee told me I needed Botox. It’s been a ride.

My reporting has also made me realize that the current interest in longevity reaches beyond social media influencers and wellness centers. Longevity clinics are growing in number, and there’s been a glut of documentaries about living longer or even forever.

At the same time, powerful people who influence state laws, giant federal funding budgets, and even national health policy are prioritizing the search for treatments that slow or reverse aging. The longevity community was thrilled when longtime supporter Jim O’Neill was made deputy secretary of health and human services last year. Other members of Trump’s administration, including Oz, have spoken about longevity too. “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history,” Gries told me.

I recently spoke to Alicia Jackson, the new director of ARPA-H. The agency, established in 2022 under Joe Biden’s presidency, funds “breakthrough” biomedical research. And it appears to have a new focus on longevity. Jackson previously founded and led Evernow, a company focused on “health and longevity for every woman.”

“There’s a lot of interesting technologies, but they all kind of come back to the same thing: Could we extend life years?” she told me over a Zoom call a few weeks ago. She added that her agency had “incredible support” from “the very top of HHS.” I asked if she was referring to Jim O’Neill. “Yeah,” she said. She wouldn’t go into the specifics.

Gries is right: There is a lot of support for advances in longevity treatments, and some of it is coming from influential people in positions of power. Perhaps the field really is poised for a breakthrough.

And that’s what makes this field so fascinating to cover. Despite the occasional weirdness.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/29/1131938/dhs-is-using-google-and-adobe-ai-to-make-videos/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make and edit content shared with the public, a new document reveals. It comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI—and as workers in tech have put pressure on their employers to denounce the agencies’ activities.

The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

In a section about “editing images, videos or other public affairs materials using AI,” it reveals for the first time that DHS is using Google&#39;s Veo 3 video generator and Adobe Firefly, estimating that the agency has between 100 and 1,000 licenses for the tools. It also discloses that DHS uses Microsoft Copilot Chat for generating first drafts of documents and summarizing long reports and Poolside software for coding tasks, in addition to tools from other companies.

Google, Adobe, and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The news provides details about how agencies like Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, might be creating the large amounts of content they’ve shared on X and other channels as immigration operations have expanded across US cities. They’ve posted content celebrating “Christmas after mass deportations,” referenced Bible verses and Christ’s birth, showed faces of those the agency has arrested, and shared ads aimed at recruiting agents. The agencies have also repeatedly used music without permissions from artists in their videos.

Some of the content, particularly videos, has the appearance of being AI-generated, but it hasn’t been clear until now what AI models the agencies might be using. This marks the first concrete evidence such generators are being used by DHS to create content shared with the public.

It still remains impossible to verify which company helped create a specific piece of content, or indeed if it was AI-generated at all. Adobe offers options to “watermark” a video made with its tools to disclose that it is AI-generated, for example, but this disclosure does not always stay intact when the content is uploaded and shared across different sites.

The document reveals that DHS has specifically been using Flow, a tool from Google that combines its Veo 3 video generator with a suite of filmmaking tools. Users can generate clips and assemble entire videos with AI, including videos that contain sound, dialogue, and background noise, making them hyperrealistic. Adobe launched its Firefly generator in 2023, promising that it does not use copyrighted content in its training or output. Like Google’s tools, Adobe’s can generate videos, images, soundtracks, and speech. The document does not reveal further details about how the agency is using these video generation tools.

Workers at large tech companies, including more than 140 current and former employees from Google and more than 30 from Adobe, have been putting pressure on their employers in recent weeks to take a stance against ICE and the shooting of Alex Pretti on January 24. Google’s leadership has not made statements in response. In October, Google and Apple removed apps on their app stores that were intended to track sightings of ICE, citing safety risks.

An additional document released on Wednesday revealed new details about how the agency is using more niche AI products, including a facial recognition app used by ICE, as first reported by 404Media in June.

Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”

Last April, an excited crowd gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death.One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Nathan Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.Although interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. And the Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

What AI “remembers” about you is privacy’s next frontier

The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes.But their ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities. So what can developers do to fix this problem? Read the full story.

The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather? Read the full story.

The flawed logic of rushing out extreme climate solutionsEarly in 2022, entrepreneur Luke Iseman says, he released a pair of sulfur dioxide–filled weather balloons from Mexico’s Baja California peninsula, in the hope that they’d burst miles above Earth.It was a trivial act in itself, effectively a tiny, DIY act of solar geoengineering, the controversial proposal that the world could counteract climate change by releasing particles that reflect more sunlight back into space.Entrepreneurs like Iseman invoke the stark dangers of climate change to explain why they do what they do—even if they don’t know how effective their interventions are. But experts say that urgency doesn’t create a social license to ignore the underlying dangers or leapfrog the scientific process. Read the full story.—James Temple

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple confirmed this week that it has acquired Israeli AI startup Q.ai in a deal valued at close to $2 billion, making it one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever, second only to the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014.

But check your assumptions: this isn’t Beats 2.0. There’s no new headphone brand to flex. Instead, Apple is paying top dollar for tech that might let your devices understand you without you ever saying a word.

​​These days we put our phones on silent so they won’t disturb us; soon the phone will put us on silent so it can understand us.

Q.ai has been operating in secrecy since its founding in 2022. Its machine-learning research focuses on interpreting “silent speech”, detecting imperceptible facial micro-movements, and subtle audio cues to infer what someone means to say.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Patents suggest this tech could work in headphones, smart glasses, or other wearables so users can issue commands privately, even in a quiet library.

That future has a decidedly dramatic edge: imagine telling Siri to skip a track or read your messages without ever parting your lips. Apple executives call the acquisition a way to fuse machine learning with next-generation hardware.

Longtime Apple watcher Johny Srouji praised Q.ai as “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.”

At first blush, spending almost $2 billion on not speaking might sound like corporate futurism taken to a comic extreme. We already have voice assistants that sometimes struggle to understand us when we do speak.

Yet here’s Apple’s bet: once devices can interpret faint facial cues, the entire paradigm of human-computer interaction shifts, from keyboards and taps to gestures and barely-audible intentions.

This move also signals how Apple’s AI strategy is evolving. Some critical voices have noted that the company has lagged behind competitors in generative AI and conversational assistants, even partnering with Google to bring Gemini-powered features into its ecosystem. Acquiring Q.ai suggests Cupertino isn’t just chasing language models; it wants to redefine the interface itself.

There’s a strange poetry to this. In an era when every tech giant is clamouring to make their AI chatty, Apple is buying a company that may prime its devices to be less vocal, more intuitive, and perhaps eerily discreet.

It’s the sort of paradox that defines modern tech: a quieter future might demand the loudest investment.

If this sounds like science fiction, well, it does. But Q.ai’s technology, as described in recent reports, could translate into features in AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, or future wearables as soon as 2027. Could it help Siri finally feel less like a confused concierge and more like an unseen assistant tuned to your intent? That remains to be seen.

Either way, Apple’s big wager on silent speech reminds us that innovation doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it listens for the quietest signals and pays dearly for them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI adoption is creating a clear divide among employees. Some see AI as a tool to increase their impact, while others see it as a threat to their role. So, where does the truth lie between these two mindsets? Let’s explore.

Over the past two years, we’ve seen a wave of layoffs often attributed to “AI replacing humans.” Among widely discussed cases, IBM openly stated that over 7,000 back-office roles may no longer need to be hired because AI can absorb the work. Many other tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and HP, have cut between 6,000 and 200,000 employees as a shift toward AI-driven initiatives.

Meanwhile, beware: many might make misleading conclusions. They are often treated as straightforward examples of AI replacing human labor, when in reality they reflect a deeper restructuring of how value is created inside organizations.

Taking a closer look, it becomes evident that in many examples like these, people weren’t displaced because AI was smarter or outperformed people.

They were displaced because one (or more) of the following reasons:

From this perspective, it becomes evident: AI isn’t coming for roles, it’s here to remove low-leverage work. Roles that exist mainly to handle volume or work around broken systems no longer make sense once those problems disappear.

This is already playing out across teams. For example:

As AI reduces friction and automates workflows, organizations and employees are increasingly forced to ask these two questions: 1) where real value is created, 2) where human input is essential in areas AI cannot handle. Teams that explore and embrace this shift early will be better positioned to adapt as AI continues to compress the cost and effort of execution.

An overlooked but highly efficient aspect many businesses miss: AI introduces a level of transparency most organizations have never had before. This visibility changes how organizations make decisions and how they manage business resources.
In particular, AI-powered spend analysis is set to become one of the most transformative forces inside companies.

Ultimately, the level of business success is largely determined by the ability to turn spend data into an operational signal. When, instead of tracking costs in isolation, organizations clearly see how spend translates into productivity and revenue, that’s where real differentiation begins.

Smart spend management platforms like this already exist, take Spendbase, for example. In this case, AI can be the next layer that unlocks even deeper insights.

ROI and cost efficiency are at the very center of any business. Therefore, as AI increases transparency into multiple business areas (performance, time, spend, etc.), work that cannot be clearly tied to outcomes loses its footing. Hence, roles that fail to translate their work into clear outcomes risk being deprioritized.

As AI automates execution, the people and teams that remain essential are those who can clearly explain how their work impacts the business in ways AI cannot. Such as:

Apart from this, another important area of impact lies in organizational and customer-facing work, where human-driven value is created from responsibilities focused on aligning teams, resolving complexity, building trust, and, particularly, innovating.

Imagine a product team competing in a crowded market or where competitors are continuously copying each other. In this case, AI can meticulously handle research and benchmarking: analyze competitor offerings, user behavior, reviews, and market gaps.

It can even generate predictions or simulate feature adoption. However, it takes human vision and accountability to challenge assumptions and find unpaved paths for growth.

When it comes to creating something inherently new, with no existing market equivalent, AI may fall short at innovation. Yet these are often the areas where the greatest business impact lies.

In most organizations, changes revolving AI adoption won’t happen overnight. Roles will gradually shrink, shift, and eventually be redefined. As a result, human contributions that can’t be tied to measurable outcomes quietly lose relevance.

            <div id="article-text">The way people discover information online is quietly but fundamentally changing.

Instead of scrolling through links and choosing which article to open, users are increasingly asking large language models to answer directly. Tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity don’t send people browsing; they synthesise information from multiple sources and deliver a ready-made response inside the interface.

For brands and publishers, this creates a new problem: what does visibility mean when nobody clicks anymore?

For years, search optimization revolved around a familiar feedback loop: publish content, earn rankings, drive clicks, measure performance. Traffic, impressions, and engagement acted as proxies for relevance and influence. AI-generated answers disrupt that loop entirely.

This isn’t a temporary fluctuation in search behaviour. It’s a structural shift in how information is consumed.

Large language models do not simply index the web like classic search engines. Their response generation involves a combination of training data, real-time search, and internal reasoning. As shown in analyses comparing Perplexity and ChatGPT, these systems search the web differently even when responding to the same questions.

ChatGPT tends to issue longer, context-rich queries to build an explanation, whereas Perplexity formulates shorter, list-like queries focused on freshness and comparison.

This means visibility isn’t universal across models; a topic that surfaces in one LLM is not guaranteed to surface in another.

If clicks are no longer the primary signal, content strategies must adapt. Instead of optimizing only for human users and search engine algorithms:

Content intended for modern AI discovery needs both depth and freshness: explanations that support contextual reasoning (favoured by ChatGPT-style behaviour) and concise, signal-rich sections (favoured by Perplexity-style behaviour). This duality underscores the complexity of AI brand visibility.

Publishers and marketers have few tools to assess whether their pages are actually being consulted by AI agents. Traditional analytics platforms report pageviews, but:

This lack of transparency means that even high-quality content may go unnoticed in AI answers, not because it is irrelevant, but because it does not match the specific patterns an LLM uses when selecting sources.

Recognising the need for a new feedback loop, solutions are emerging that approach this problem from an engineering perspective rather than purely a marketing one. For instance, Genezio has analysed how ChatGPT and Perplexity prioritise sources and generate their search behaviours, revealing that the same topic leads to substantially different retrieval patterns across systems and therefore different visibility outcomes.

Rather than treating AI visibility as a black box, these approaches:

By observing how AI systems behave at scale, marketers can begin to measure brand visibility in conversations rather than clicks, transforming raw engineering data into actionable insight.

AI-generated answers are rapidly reshaping how information is found, processed, and presented. In this new environment, visibility is not just about ranking formulas or organic traffic; it’s about earning a place in the narrative that LLMs generate.

The brands that succeed will be those that understand not only how to produce quality content, but also how to make it legible and extractable to systems that never lead users back to a webpage.

Measuring visibility without clicks may seem intangible today, but as AI becomes central to how people seek answers, it will soon become standard practice.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.
