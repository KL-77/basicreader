            <h2>RAM shortage chaos expands to GPUs, high-capacity SSDs, and even hard drives</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/ram-shortage-chaos-expands-to-gpus-high-capacity-ssds-and-even-hard-drives/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Big Tech’s AI-fueled memory shortage is set to be the PC industry’s defining story for 2026 and beyond. Standalone, direct-to-consumer RAM kits were some of the first products to feel the bite, with prices spiking by 300 or 400 percent by the end of 2025; prices for SSDs had also increased noticeably, albeit more modestly.

The rest of 2026 is going to be all about where, how, and to what extent those price spikes flow downstream into computers, phones, and other components that use RAM and NAND chips—areas where the existing supply of products and longer-term supply contracts negotiated by big companies have helped keep prices from surging too noticeably so far.

This week, we’re seeing signs that the RAM crunch is starting to affect the GPU market—Asus made some waves when it inadvertently announced that it was discontinuing its GeForce RTX 5070 Ti.

Though the company has tried to walk this announcement back since then, if you’re a GPU manufacturer, there’s a strong argument to be made for either discontinuing this model or de-prioritizing it in favor of other GPUs. The 5070 Ti uses 16GB of GDDR7, plus a partially disabled version of Nvidia’s GB203 GPU silicon. This is the same chip and the same amount of RAM used in the higher-end RTX 5080—the thinking goes, why continue to build a graphics card with an MSRP of $749 when the same basic parts could go to a card with a $999 MSRP instead?

Whether Asus or any other company is canceling production or not, you can see why GPU makers would be tempted by the argument: street prices for the RTX 5070 Ti models start in the $1,050 to $1,100 range on Newegg right now, where RTX 5080 cards start in the $1,500 to $1,600 range. Though 5080 models may need more robust boards, heatsinks, and other components than a 5070 Ti, if you’re just trying to maximize the profit-per-GPU you can get for the same amount of RAM, it makes sense to shift allocation to the more expensive cards.

Either way, those GPUs are selling for at least 40 or 50 percent more than their original MSRP right now—it’s a bad time to want a graphics card that can hit 4K without leaning too heavily on upscaling technologies.

The good news, if there is any, is that it’s still not a historically awful time to want a low-end to midrange GPU for 1080p or 1440p gaming. The regular RTX 5070 is hanging out around $560 or $570, just a hair over its $549 MSRP. The situation is similar for the Radeon RX 9070 (MSRP $549, current street price around $580), the 16GB version of the RX 9060 XT (MSRP $349, street price $400ish), and the GeForce RTX 5060 (currently available at its $300 MSRP). The Radeon RX 9070 XT is faring a bit worse, though not as badly as the RTX 5070 Ti or 5080 (MSRP $599, street price around $730 or $750).

We’re past the period late last year where you could consistently find many of these cards for under MSRP, but we aren’t (yet?) at the point where you have to fight with scalpers for the privilege of paying just 1.5 times the normal price for any of them. It’s something to bear in mind if you’re thinking about upgrading an existing build to get around having to buy new RAM.

SSD prices have been climbing alongside RAM prices for months, but as of last month the price increases for 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB drives were around twice as expensive as they had been in August 2025, compared to three or four times as expensive for DDR5 RAM kits. But things are moving in a bad direction, and high-capacity SSDs in particular are being hit hard.

If you want a 1TB internal M.2 SSD from a recognizable company, that will generally run you somewhere between $120 and $150—often a little higher than the $135 we recorded for a 1TB WD Blue drive back in January, but not absurdly so.

It’s still possible to find a decent 2TB drive like this SiliconPower model for around $230, the price we quoted for a 2TB Western Digital SN7100 back in December. But currently, SSDs from big-name companies like Samsung and WD/SanDisk (currently in a state of flux, but the SanDisk-branded versions of these drives don’t appear to be at retail yet) are either out of stock at many major retailers or have shot up dramatically in price. Best Buy will sell you a 2TB SN7100 for $370, which the site proclaims is a “deal” because it’s marked down from a regular price of $490. A 2TB Samsung 990 Evo Plus will run you $440; Amazon had listed the same drive in new condition for $177 as recently as mid-December.

Drives with 4TB capacities are in a similar place: it’s possible to find reasonable-ish options (another SiliconPower UD90 for $360; a Crucial P310 for $345), but the bigger-name drives I’d usually default to are either much more expensive or out of stock.

Even spinning hard drive prices are beginning to climb, albeit more gradually. A 6TB WD Red NAS drive that retailed for $140 in August of 2025 is listed at $160 now. The 4TB version, as well as a 4TB Seagate IronWolf NAS drive, is around $100, which was its typical price for most of last year. But historical data sourced from CamelCamelCamel shows that both drives went on sale for $80 or $85 several times last year, something that stopped happening for both drives after September. A 12TB IronWolf drive that was usually priced at $240 last year is $270 now; the 16TB version has climbed from $330 to $350.

I wouldn’t expect these prices to continue to shoot upward like RAM and SSD prices have—the level of demand isn’t the same, there isn’t a ton of RAM or flash memory in them, and data centers mostly aren’t going to bother competing with home users to buy 4TB or 8TB drives when they can fit 20 or 30TB in a drive that takes up the same amount of physical space. But the increases are still worth keeping an eye on, as price increases and shortages change buying patterns.</div>

            <h2>Calif. counters FCC attack on DEI with conditions on Verizon/Frontier merger</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/verizon-frontier-to-complete-10b-merger-after-approvals-from-fcc-and-states/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Verizon has received all approvals it needs for a $9.6 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications, an Internet service provider with about 3.3 million broadband customers in 25 states. Verizon said it expects to complete the merger on January 20.

The last approval came from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which allowed the deal in a 5–0 vote yesterday. There were months of negotiations that resulted in requirements to deploy more fiber and wireless infrastructure, offer $20-per-month Internet service to people with low incomes for the next decade, and other commitments, including some designed to replace the DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) policies that Verizon had to end because of demands by the Trump administration.

“The approval follows extensive public participation, testimony from multiple parties, and negotiated settlement agreements with consumer advocates and labor organizations,” the CPUC said yesterday.

Verizon struck the merger deal with Frontier in September 2024, agreeing to pay $9.6 billion in cash and assume over $10 billion in debt held by Frontier. The all-cash transaction is valued at $20 billion including debt. Verizon said yesterday that the merged firm “will have an expanded reach of almost 30 million fiber passings across 31 states and Washington, DC.”

Verizon’s interest in its home Internet business has waxed and waned over the years, but the company seems pretty committed to fiber and fixed wireless home Internet these days. Part of the deal involves Verizon buying back a former portion of its network that it sold to Frontier almost 10 years ago. In 2016, Frontier bought Verizon’s FiOS and DSL operations in Florida, California, and Texas.

At yesterday’s CPUC meeting, Commissioner John Reynolds described Verizon’s commitments. Verizon will deploy fiber to 75,000 new locations within five years, prioritizing census blocks with income at or below 90 percent of the county median, he said. For wireless service, Verizon is required to deploy 250 new cell sites with 5G and fixed wireless capability in areas eligible for state broadband grants and areas with high fire threats, he said.

Within seven years, Verizon is required to offer service with 100Mbps download speeds and 20Mbps upload speeds to 88 wire centers that serve rural and lower-income customers, Reynolds said. Verizon must meet interim deadlines toward this goal after three and five years.

A low-cost Internet plan commitment centers on the Verizon Forward service that offers home Internet for as low as $20 a month. Reynolds said the deal with Verizon “locked in” the $20-per-month plans for low-income consumers for the next 10 years. As we previously reported, the $20 plans can be fiber with symmetrical speeds of 300Mbps or fixed wireless with download speeds of 100Mbps and upload speeds of 20Mbps.

Verizon committed to an audit of Frontier’s fiber and copper networks and to bringing the networks up to the CPUC’s wireline service quality standards, the commission said. This could help improve reliability in Frontier areas that have only copper service. For customers who are upgraded from copper to fiber, Verizon must offer a 24-hour battery backup unit at no charge and a free 72-hour backup in areas with high fire threats.

California was more interested in extracting consumer-focused commitments from Verizon than the Federal Communications Commission was. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr’s chief demand of companies seeking merger approval is to eliminate DEI initiatives that he calls “invidious forms of discrimination.” The FCC approved the Verizon/Frontier merger in May 2025, one day after Verizon committed to end DEI policies related to hiring and supplier diversity.

Reynolds said the FCC is attempting “to remake society by withholding regulatory approvals to tear down programs meant to support our communities,” and that California regulators have “refused to let this FCC chair’s coercion pass without scrutiny.”

Verizon agreed to give $40 million to the California Emerging Technology Fund for digital literacy programs, and $10 million to California universities for a workforce development program. The CPUC decision said Verizon “shall establish a recruiting pipeline from California State Universities and California community colleges, aiming to recruit from underrepresented populations in consultation with the Commission’s ESJ [Environmental and Social Justice] Working Group, for both Verizon and Frontier’s workforce, and the workforce of supplier companies working with Verizon and Frontier.”

The CPUC required quarterly employee satisfaction surveys with questions on belonging and inclusion, broken out by demographic characteristics, and annual transparency reports showing the effects of policy changes on workforce and supplier diversity, Reynolds said.

“We couldn’t mandate that Verizon restore its former programs, but we could build accountability mechanisms and require investment in California and our diverse communities,” Reynolds said. Verizon also must maintain its “Small Business Supplier Accelerator” program with spending of at least $500 million to support California small businesses over five years.

Several advocacy groups issued a press release praising the CPUC for obtaining “an agreement that directly puts funds into the pockets of minority-owned supply chains across the state.”

“California has shown that states can stand up for workers and consumers and resist Trump’s efforts to undermine employees’ and customers’ rights,” said Lisa Graves, founder and executive director of True North Research. “More states and companies should follow suit to show they won’t be bullied into abandoning equal opportunity.”

There are also commitments related to union jobs and infrastructure in tribal areas. Verizon committed to hire 600 new union employees over six years and provide layoff protection to existing union employees for 48 months. Verizon is required to provide tribes with maps of infrastructure in and around ancestral territories and give tribes a right of first offer when Frontier disposes of real property in those areas.

To enforce the conditions, Verizon will put up $150 million in performance bonds, and the CPUC will have an enforcement program with citation authority for violations. An independent compliance monitor, paid for by Verizon but hired by the commission, will report annually on Verizon’s compliance with commitments, Reynolds said.</div>

            <h2>TSMC says AI demand is “endless” after record Q4 earnings</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/tsmc-says-ai-demand-is-endless-after-record-q4-earnings/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported record fourth-quarter earnings and said it expects AI chip demand to continue for years. During an earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei told investors that while he cannot predict the semiconductor industry’s long-term trajectory, he remains bullish on AI.

TSMC manufactures chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, making it a linchpin of the global electronics supply chain. The company produces the vast majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, and its factories in Taiwan have become a focal point of US-China tensions over technology and trade. When TSMC reports strong demand and ramps up spending, it signals that the companies designing AI chips expect years of continued growth.

“All in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real—not only real, it’s starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of—we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that,” Wei said during the call. “So another question is ‘can the semiconductor industry be good for three, four, five years in a row?’ I’ll tell you the truth, I don’t know. But I look at the AI, it looks like it’s going to be like an endless—I mean, that for many years to come.”

TSMC posted net income of NT$505.7 billion (about $16 billion) for the quarter, up 35 percent year over year and above analyst expectations. Revenue hit $33.7 billion, a 25.5 percent increase from the same period last year. The company expects nearly 30 percent revenue growth in 2026 and plans to spend between $52 billion and $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, up from $40.9 billion in 2025.

Wei’s optimism stands in contrast to months of speculation about whether the AI industry is in a bubble. In November, Google CEO Sundar Pichai warned of “irrationality” in the AI market and said no company would be immune if a potential bubble bursts. OpenAI’s Sam Altman acknowledged in August that investors are “overexcited” and that “someone” will lose a “phenomenal amount of money.”

But TSMC, which manufactures the chips that power the AI boom, is betting the opposite way, with Wei telling analysts he spoke directly to cloud providers to verify that demand is real before committing to the spending increase.

“I want to make sure that my customers’ demand are real. So I talked to those cloud service providers, all of them,” Wei said. “The answer is that I’m quite satisfied with the answer. Actually, they show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business.”

The earnings report landed the same day the US and Taiwan finalized a trade agreement that cuts tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15 percent, down from 20 percent. The deal commits Taiwanese companies to $250 billion in direct US investment, and TSMC is accelerating the expansion of its Arizona chip fabrication facilities to match.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Late last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened yet another investigation into Tesla and its partially automated driver assist systems. This time it was about FSD (again), which has been the subject of more than 60 complaints to the regulator after Teslas operating under FSD either ignored red traffic lights or crossed into oncoming traffic. As part of the preliminary investigation, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation has asked Tesla for more information on the problem. This week, it told the automaker it could have a five-week extension on its homework.

To be fair to Tesla, NHTSA has asked for a comprehensive amount of information: a list of every Tesla produced and sold or leased in the United States, including whether or not that car had FSD and which version; cumulative data on how many US Teslas have FSD and how often it’s used; and a list of all the customer complaints, field reports, incident reports, lawsuits, and other data related to FSD ignoring traffic laws.

For each incident involving a crash, Tesla must give NHTSA a summary of the incident, including “causal and contributing factors.” Further questions require information on FSD use by crashed cars; any alert shown to the drivers; what work, simulation, or otherwise Tesla has conducted to ameliorate the problem; any modifications or changes to FSD hardware or software; an explanation of Tesla’s theory of operation for traffic lights and stop signs; and Tesla’s assessment of the problem.

The original request was sent to Tesla on December 3 with a deadline of January 19—next Monday—with penalties of up to $27,874 per day (to a maximum of $139.4 million) for not complying.

However, the winter holiday period ate up two weeks of the six-and-a-bit weeks, and the company has had to simultaneously prepare two other information requests for other ongoing NHTSA probes, one due today, another on January 23rd, and yet another on February 4, the company told NHTSA. Identifying all the complaints and reports will take more time, Tesla said, as it found 8,313 items when it searched for traffic violations, and it can only process 300 a day to see which ones are relevant.

Answering the remaining questions on NHTSA’s list would require the above to be completed first, so Tesla asked for and was granted an extension until February 23.

Meanwhile, Tesla has changed how its driver assist cash cow contributes to the bottom line. Until now, Tesla owners had the option of buying the system outright for (currently) $8,000. Now, CEO Elon Musk says that option will go away on February 14. From then on, if a Tesla owner wants FSD, they’ll have to pay a $99 monthly fee to use it.</div>

            <h2>Ferrari doing what it does best: The 12Cilindri review</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/driven-the-ferrari-12cilindri-spider-is-open-top-grand-touring-bliss/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It has been nearly 80 years since Ferrari unleashed its first V12-powered sports car upon the world with the 125 S. In 1947, its debut year, the 125 S secured Ferrari’s first race victory, along with five other wins in the 14 events it competed in that season.

Although it was soon replaced by the 159 S, the success of the 125 S kick-started Ferrari’s storied history of producing some of the most desirable 12-cylinder performance cars known to man. And while the Italian automaker has come to embrace forced induction and electrification in recent years, its legacy of building stunning front-engine, rear-wheel drive machines with spectacular V12s stuffed into their engine bays continues with the 12Cilindri Spider.

Ferrari hasn’t shied away from leveraging cutting-edge technology in the development of its latest models, but the company also understands the value of a good throwback. As the successor to the 812 Superfast, the 12Cilindri boasts clever performance technologies, like a sophisticated active aero system and a four-wheel steering system that can manage each corner independently to enhance response, but it’s ultimately an homage to the heady days of late ’60s luxury grand touring. The exterior styling takes obvious inspiration from the 365 GTB Daytona, while its lack of all-wheel drive, turbocharging, and electric assistance bucks trends that have become nearly inescapable in modern performance cars.

Instead, Ferrari has deliberately prioritized the core principles that have defined its most enduring GT icons: elegant design, a meticulously engineered chassis, and a sensational naturally aspirated V12, the latter represented here by a 6.5 L dry-sump mill that delivers 819 hp (611 kW) and a soaring 9,500-rpm redline.

That horsepower figure might not raise as many eyebrows as it would have just a few years ago, but it’s worth noting that at a time in history when an alarming number of new performance vehicles are now as heavy as full-size pickups, the 12Cilindri Spider tips the scales at a relatively svelte dry weight of 3,571 (1,620 kg) pounds thanks in part to its focus on the fundamentals. Equipped with massage seats and a retractable hardtop that opens and closes in just 14 seconds, the 12Cilindri Spider is primarily aimed at fulfilling drivers’ fantasies of cruising along the French Riviera with the smell of the ocean in the air and the banshee wail of 12 cylinders in their ears. But it also takes on a noticeably more sportscar-like persona than its primary rival, the Aston Martin Vanquish Volante, mainly due to the 12Cilindri’s eight-speed dual-clutch transmission and more earnest performance-tuned chassis.

Sport is the 12Cilindri Spider’s default drive mode, a naming decision that helps set expectations for suspension stiffness, but you can also depress the steering-wheel-mounted Manettino drive mode dial to enable Bumpy Road mode, which softens the adaptive dampers beyond their standard tuning for more compliance on rough pavement. While the gearbox occasionally needs a second to get its act together from a standstill, and the car’s low stance makes the nose lift system an often-used feature, the 12Cilindri Spider is a remarkably civil cruiser when pressed into service for everyday driving tasks.

The in-car tech does tarnish this driving experience to a tangible degree, though. The liberal use of capacitive surfaces on the steering wheel and the instrument panel to control features like rear-view mirror position and adaptive cruise control, as well as the functions that are accessed via the 15.6-inch digital gauge cluster, frequently led to frustration during my time with the car, and although the high-resolution 10.25-inch central touchscreen looks great and is quick to respond to user inputs, wireless Apple CarPlay crashed on several occasions for no discernible reason and remained inaccessible until after the next key cycle. These may seem like trivial issues, but in a car with a $507,394 MSRP ($661,364 as-tested with destination fee), it’s tough to excuse problems that are so distracting and seemingly easy to rectify.

We had the same problem with the 296 GTB, and it’s time Ferrari retired its capacitive wheel and replaced them all with the version that has physical buttons. Which it will do for existing owners—for a hefty fee.

But, perhaps unsurprisingly, those quibbles always seemed to fade away whenever I found an open stretch of canyon road and set the Manettino to Race mode. Doing so eases up the electronic assists, sets up the transmission and differential for sharper response, and opens up the valves in the active exhaust system. But, in contrast to convention, it leaves the steering weight, suspension stiffness, throttle response, and brake-by-wire system alone in order to maintain predictable dynamic behavior regardless of which drive mode you’re in.

Although the exhaust is a bit quieter than I’d prefer, even with the roof stowed away, the sound that this V12 makes as you wind it out is the stuff that dreams are made of. It took me a moment to recalibrate to the lofty redline, though—with the gearbox set to manual mode, my mind naturally wanted to pull the column-mounted paddle about 2,000 rpm early. I blame this on my seat time in the Vanquish coupe last year. Aston’s decision to equip the Vanquish’s 5.2 L V12 with a pair of turbochargers enables it to best the 12Cilinidri’s horsepower figure by a few ponies while also providing a significant advantage in peak torque output (738 lb-ft/1,000 Nm versus the Ferrari’s 500 lb-ft/678 Nm), but it also relegates the Vanquish’s redline to a more prosaic 7,000 rpm while naturally muting its tone a bit.

And to be frank, I don’t think the 12Cilindri Spider needs another 238 lb-ft (322 Nm), a theory that was backed by the flashing traction control light that fired up any time I got a little too brave with the throttle coming out of a slow corner. Intervention from the Ferrari’s electronic safeguards is so seamless that I rarely noticed it happening at all, though, and I can’t say the same for the Vanquish, which is undoubtedly thrilling to drive but often felt like it was fighting against its own prodigious output in order to keep the nose on the intended path. The 12Cilindri, by contrast, feels easy to trust when the going gets fast, and that sensation is bolstered by tons of mechanical grip, a quick steering rack, and a firm, progressive brake pedal.

But regardless of my thoughts on the matter, the 12Cilindri’s successor will likely be a significantly different beast with a lot more power on tap. Nearly a decade ago, we predicted that the 812 would likely be the last Ferrari to feature a naturally aspirated V12, and while this is a prediction that we’re happy to have been wrong about, this era is undoubtedly drawing to a close. A hybridized V12 will likely offer even more grunt, and enthusiasts rarely scoff at the prospect of more power, but it also opens the door to all-wheel drive, significantly more heft, and ultimately a very different driving experience. Until then, the 12Cilindri Spider serves as an important reminder that sometimes the most compelling aspects of a performance car can’t be quantified on a spec sheet.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ashley St Clair, the influencer and mother of one of Elon Musk’s children, has sued the billionaire’s AI company, accusing its Grok chatbot of creating fake sexual imagery of her without her consent.

In the lawsuit, filed in New York state court, St Clair alleged that xAI’s Grok first created an AI-generated or altered image of her in a bikini earlier this month.

St Clair claims she made a request to xAI that no further such images be made, but nevertheless “countless sexually abusive, intimate, and degrading deepfake content of St. Clair [were] produced and distributed publicly by Grok.”

In one case, a photo of St Clair from when she was 14 years old was altered by Grok to undress her and put her in a bikini, according to the court filing.

St Clair is a conservative influencer with about 1 million followers on X and the mother of one of Musk’s children. The billionaire entrepreneur has espoused pronatalist views, arguing in support of increasing birth rates, and has fathered at least 14 children with several different women.

After reporting the images to xAI, St Clair’s account on the X social media platform was stripped of its verification checkmark, premium subscription, and ability to monetize her posts, the filing said.

The case has now been moved to federal court. xAI, which runs X, did not respond to a request for comment.

The news comes as xAI and Musk have come under fire over fake sexualized images of women and children, which proliferated on the platform this year, particularly after Musk jokingly shared an AI-altered post of himself in a bikini.

Over the past week, the issue has prompted threats of fines and bans in the EU, UK, and France, as well as investigations by the California attorney-general and Britain’s Ofcom regulator. Grok has also been banned in Indonesia and Malaysia.

On Wednesday, xAI took action to restrict the image-generation function on its Grok AI model to block the chatbot from undressing users, insisting that it removed Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity material.

St Clair, who has in recent months been increasingly critical of Musk, is also seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent xAI from generating images that undress her.

“Ms St Clair is humiliated, depressed, fearful for her life, angry and desperately in need of action from this court to protect her against xAI’s facilitation of this unfathomable nightmare,” lawyers wrote in a filing seeking the restraining order.

xAI filed a lawsuit against St Clair in Texas on Thursday, claiming she had breached the company’s terms of service by bringing her lawsuit against the company in a New York court instead of in Texas.

Earlier this week, Musk also said on X that he would be filing for “full custody” of their 1-year-old son Romulus, after St Clair apologized for sharing posts critical of transgender people in the past. Musk, who has a transgender child, has repeatedly been critical of transgender people and the rights of trans individuals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years now, actors have rung the alarm bells over the AI industry planning to sell their likeness and voices — either with or without their consent — and hence threatening to put them out of work.

Beyond a major 2023 strike by Hollywood actors fueled by these concerns, we’ve already seen actors take matters into their own hands, like when Scarlett Johansson threatened to sue OpenAI over a ChatGPT update that she claims imitated her voice. Two voice actors have also filed a lawsuit, accusing an AI startup of using their voices to train their AI without permission.

Tensions came to a head last year when an AI company unveiled an AI actor dubbed Tilly Norwood. The news was met by near-universal backlash from both industry insiders and the public, further stoking fears of the industry coming for human actors’ jobs.

To get ahead of having the industry making unauthorized AI dupes of his likeness or voice, Hollywood star Matthew McConaughey came up with a clever new defense tactic. As the Wall Street Journal reports, the performer filed eight trademark applications to the US Patent and Trademark Office that featured videos and audio clips of him “staring, smiling and talking.”

All eight applications have since been approved — and yes, one of the submitted clips included him saying his iconic line, “Alright, alright, alright” from the 1993 movie “Dazed and Confused.”

“My team and I want to know that when my voice or likeness is ever used, it’s because I approved and signed off on it,” McConaughey told the newspaper in an email. “We want to create a clear perimeter around ownership with consent and attribution the norm in an AI world.”

The goal is to pave the way for litigation in case a company or individual were to attempt to profit from the actor’s likeness with the help of AI.

“In a world where we’re watching everybody scramble to figure out what to do about AI misuse, we have a tool now to stop someone in their tracks or take them to federal court,” one of McConaughey’s attorneys, Jonathan Pollack, told the newspaper.

Whether the gambit will pay off remains to be seen. For one, many copyright infringement challenges aimed at AI companies are still playing out in court as we speak.

“I don’t know what a court will say in the end,” attorney Kevin Yorn, who is also representing McConaughey, told the WSJ. “But we have to at least test this.”

Other experts added that copyright law gets murky when it comes to AI-based video platforms, like OpenAI’s Sora. The app, which allows users to generate photorealistic clips of famous characters and actors despite the company’s guardrails, was criticized by talent agencies last year.

The Sam Altman-led firm appeared to have bungled its messaging at the time, telling some talent agencies at first that they’d have to opt out of having actors they represent appear on Sora — only to change its mind days later, triggering copious confusion.

Federal rules establishing if, when, and how an actor’s likeness or voice can be used are still being debated by lawmakers. Hollywood unions, however, remain adamant that unauthorized AI clones of actors should be illegal.

            <div id="article-text">Does Microsoft hate books more, or its own workers? It’s hard to say, because The Verge reports that the multitrillion dollar giant is gutting its employee library and cutting down on digital subscriptions in favor of pursuing what’s internally described as an “AI-powered learning experience” — whatever in Clippy’s name that’s supposed to mean.

Seriously, we wish we could explain to you what the hell that is, but most of the details on this AI-focused transition are maddeningly vague. What we do know, according to the reporting, is that the cheapskates upstairs are ending employee subscriptions to news outlets, including to the Strategic News Service, which has provided global reports to Microsoft’s workforce for more than 20 years.

On top of that, not only do Microsoft employees tell The Verge that they’ve lost access to publications like The Information, but they’re also unable to digitally check out business books from the Microsoft Library, which itself is being targeted by the new AI pivot.

According to an internal Microsoft FAQ, the library housed in Building 92 has been “closed as part of Microsoft’s move toward a more modern, connected learning experience through the Skilling Hub.”

“We know this change affects a space many people valued,” the company said.

Meanwhile, employee subscriptions aren’t being renewed for pretty much the same reason: because it’s a “part of Microsoft’s shift to a more modern, AI-powered learning experience through the Skilling Hub.”

All told, the cuts are yet another example of how Microsoft has gone completely bonkers for AI. Urban legend at the company says that Microsoft’s Library, when it was housed in its old location on the second floor of Building 4, was so heavy that it caused the building to sink. That was probably a myth, but now it sounds like Microsoft is happy to let this trove of knowledge, if not literally sink into the Earth, fall by the wayside on the altar of AI.

An executive from SNS, the news organization that worked with Microsoft for over two decades but is now being cut off, absolutely roasted its former customer for the changes.

“Technology’s future is shaped by flows of power, money, innovation, and people — none of which are predictable based on LLMs’ probabilistic regurgitation of old information,” Berit Anderson, chief operating officer of SNS, told The Verge. “We look forward to welcoming Microsoft back into the SNS community whenever they decide they would like to return.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI data centers on the East Coast are gobbling up so much juice that nonprofit grid operator PJM may be forced to enact rolling blackouts on its customers during both heat waves and exceptionally cold weather just to protect the grid’s integrity.

These blackouts would impact a staggering 67 million people in 13 states, according to The Wall Street Journal, which will no doubt fan more anger from residential customers and politicians who are already deeply ticked off about the mass construction of AI data centers.

“They’re pretty much the whole boat when it comes to increases in electricity demand,” John Quigley, senior fellow at University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, told CNBC last November about power-hungry data centers. “It’s going to get worse.”

The grid operator PJM is expecting demand for electricity to grow an average of 4.8 percent per year over the next 10 years, according to the WSJ, largely driven by the construction and running of these data centers, many of which are located in Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” which has 153 facilities in the town of Asburn alone.

Consulting firm ICF International estimates in a report flagged by the WSJ that America’s demand for power will go up 25 percent by 2030 compared to 2023 — and a whopping 78 percent by 2050.

The wrinkle for PJM is that newer power plants are not replacing older ones fast enough. In addition, tech companies pushed back on a proposal last year to voluntarily power down or get power elsewhere when the demand is highest.

That seems unfair to residential customers who would bear the physical and emotional brunt of a blackout — because after all, nobody is living inside these data center facilities. Increasing energy prices have already become a political hot potato among energy customers, from Arizona to Maine, who have also opposed the centers for high water usage and for generating local pollution.

PJM is now putting together another proposal to balance energy needs during peak demand, but it still needs to pass muster with tech companies, power producers, utilities and other stakeholders. Until it’s fully resolved, PJM customers should expect the occasional blackout.

            <h2>Doctor Says Trump Appears to Be Showing Signs of a Stroke</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Donald Trump won his second term in the White House, he was the oldest man in the history of the United States to do so. Assuming he serves for his entire term, he’ll be 82 years and seven months old by the time he leaves office — breaking Joe Biden’s record of 82 years and two months.

And like Biden, some major questions are swirling around Trump as obvious signs of aging come to the fore. Speaking to the biographer Sidney Blumenthal and historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast The Court of History, Washington State University Professor of Medicine Bruce Davidson opined that Trump appears to have suffered a stroke that’s impacting his ability to move.

“My impression is that president Trump has had a stroke, and I think there’s several lines of evidence supporting that,” Davidson said. “I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body.” Based on what he’s seen, the doctor estimated the event happened “six months ago or more, earlier in 2025.”

“There’s video of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen him [doing], striding on the golf course,” the doctor continued. “He was garbling words, which he didn’t do previously, and which he’s improved upon more recently. And he’s also had marked episodes that have been noticed of daytime, excessive sleepiness, — medical term, hypersomnolence — which is characteristic of many patients after they’ve had a stroke.”

The most recent smoking gun, Davidson claimed, was a recent video of Trump gingerly walking down the stairs from Air Force One. As he descends the steps, the president grips the banister with his left hand, even though he’s right-handed.

“All of this is consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of his brain,” Davidson said.

While the assertion has some important implications for Trump himself, it would also mean that his entire administration has been lying to the American public about his health for months — echoing the health debacle surrounding Biden in his final years in office. That said, Davidson’s definitely not the first person to suggest Trump’s hiding a stroke in plain sight.

As questions of the president’s visible bruising and swollen ankles dominated headlines last July, the White House put out a statement admitting he had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. In mid-October, Trump was taken for a mysterious check-up at Walter Reed Medical Center, which the White House claimed was a routine physical — even though it turned out Trump had gotten an MRI scan.

Earlier this month, Trump contradicted the administration’s earlier claims, stating that the trip involved a CT scan, not an MRI, which he underwent to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”

Without being able to examine the president directly, even the best professional diagnoses amount to speculation at best — and given Trump’s history of offering up bizarre claims about his health, it’s unlikely the public will get any clarity any time soon.

            <div id="article-text">The use of generative AI for creative purposes has spawned a major countermovement. From game developers reeling from a wave of criticism for using the tech to artists staging mass protests against AI, the backlash against what’s being hailed as a technological revolution grew massively last year.

In a startlingly literal example of this growing fury, a University of Alaska Fairbanks undergraduate student was detained after ripping “artwork off the walls and eating it in a reported protest,” according to a university police department statement quoted by the school’s student newspaper, The Sun Star.

The student, Graham Granger, was accused of chewing and spitting out small images that were pinned to the wall of a UAF art exhibit, which featured 160 AI-generated images by fine arts student Nick Dwyer. Photos taken by The Sun Star show crumpled-up pieces of paper strewn across a polished concrete floor.

According to the police department, Granger chewed up at least 57 of the 160 images. As a result, the undergraduate student was arrested for “criminal mischief in the 5th degree and booked at the Fairbanks Correctional Center,” according to the student newspaper.

It’s yet another example of how anti-AI sentiment is gripping the art world, highlighting a heated debate over human authorship and expression in a world filled with text-to-image generators that can conjure up works from a simple prompt in an instant.

Dwyer has since defended his work, telling The Sun Star that he had been using AI for his art since 2017. He said his exhibit “explores identity, character narrative creation and crafting false memories of relationships in an interactive role digitally crafted before, during and after a state of AI psychosis.”

The term “AI psychosis” has been used by health professionals to describe a troubling phenomenon in which users of AI tools are experiencing symptoms of psychosis or delusional episodes. Experts have raised concerns over the trend, warning that more and more people could be caught up in these delusions as they become hooked on AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

In extreme cases, these tools have been alleged to have led to numerous deaths, including the suicide of a 16-year-old.

Dwyer told The Sun Star that he had fallen into AI psychosis himself, turning to art to portray the experience.

The art world has been reeling from a flood of AI-generated pieces for years now. We’ve seen instances of artists being wrongfully accused of using the tech, while others, like users on the subreddit Defending AI Art, are arguing that it’s an entirely legitimate way of expressing oneself.

A similar situation is playing out in the music industry as well, with music streaming services hosting cheap AI knockoffs of real artists’ works.

Just this week, music distribution platform Bandcamp announced that it was banning AI-generated songs — a move that was met with an outpouring of support.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What do you get when you put a vaccine conspiracy theorist in charge of the agency responsible for funding medical research throughout the globe? A recipe for Tuskegee 2.0, apparently.

Some bombshell reporting over the last month has revealed a monstrous plan by Robert F Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services to fund a $1.6 million study on hepatitis B vaccines among 14,000 newborns in the West African country of Guinea-Bissau. As protocol documents obtained by Inside Medicine show, the study would have been a “randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of neonatal Hepatitis B vaccination on early-life mortality, morbidity, and long-term developmental outcomes.”

In other words, the study aims to withheld Hep B vaccinations from 7,000 infants in one of the poorest countries on earth — so that western researchers could compare their long-term health to babies that got the vaccine.

This is where things get hazy. This week, the Guardian reported that the trial — slated to begin in 2027 — had been halted by officials in Guinea-Bissau, after weeks of outrage from health officials and researchers. Instead, the Africa CDC told the Guardian the study would be reworked to address the ethics concerns that have become a rallying cry in the medical research community.

“The study has been cancelled,” Africa CDC official Yap Boum said on Thursday, the newspaper reported.

But a spokesperson for the HHS pushed back strongly, saying the study was forging ahead.

“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” HHS assistant secretary for public affairs told us in a statement.

“Africa CDC, an organization with no affiliation to the US CDC, shared weeks-old communications unrelated to the trial as part of a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts,” he said. “This research represents the world’s first, and potentially only, opportunity to rigorously evaluate the overall health effects of HBV0.”

We’ve reached out to the HHS and the Africa CDC to try to figure out what’s going on, since the two groups seem to be disagreeing on details as basic as whether the study is still happening.

Regardless, experts are appalled at the implications of the study.

“This is another Tuskegee,” one anonymous CDC official told Inside Medicine.

They were refering to the Tuskegee syphilis study, an infamous experiment that ran from 1932 until 1972 in which 600 poor Black men with syphilis were studied to understand the long-term effects of the disease in exchange for “free medical care” from the US government.

The catch? Though penicillin was discovered to be an effective treatment for syphilis mid-way through the study in 1943, study subjects were never offered the antibiotic, or even told they had syphilis in the first place — leaving them to suffer the full effects of the debilitating infection, even though it was entirely treatable. It remains one of the most barbaric biomedical research studies in US history, and its cruelty is still felt to this day.

Continuing, the CDC official told Inside Medicine that “we are allowing children, infants, to be exposed to Hepatitis B when we could prevent it, and then follow them for five years to see what happens. That’s not long enough to see the long-term benefits, but might be long enough to find some non-specific effects.”

“Non-specific effects” is a key buzzword swirling around Kennedy’s orbit of vaccine skeptics and holistic wellness influences, which essentially means “unintended harms.” The HHS’s chosen researchers for the Guinea-Bissau study were Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, a controversial Danish couple who have spent years chasing after non-specific effects in vaccines.

Thankfully, “the good guys won,” as Paul Offit, an infectious disease physician told the Guardian. “This administration did not see people in Africa as valuable… We were able to stand up for them. We were able to convince people about the fact that this was unethical.”

Updated to reflect that the HHS is denying the study is canceled.

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s xAI has been illegally operating dozens of natural gas turbines to power its Colossus data centers in Tennessee, the Environmental Protection Agency ruled Thursday. The AI company has argued that because the turbines were being used on a temporary basis, they were exempt from regulations. The EPA disagreed and issued its final rule on the matter, which has been in the works for over a year, declaring that xAI was in violation.

The power plants drew the ire of local communities and legal organizations. The company was facing a lawsuit for contributing more ozone and particulate emissions in an already polluted region. The company was operating as many as 35 turbines, and only 15 were ultimately permitted. Today, xAI has 12 turbines providing power to its data centers there.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/from-openais-offices-to-a-deal-with-eli-lilly-how-chai-discovery-became-one-of-the-flashiest-names-in-ai-drug-development/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Drug discovery, the art of identifying new molecules to develop pharmaceuticals, is a notoriously time-consuming and difficult process. Traditional techniques, like high-throughput screening, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.

Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company completed its Series B, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion.

Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a deal in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of “computer-aided design suite” for molecules.

It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia on a $1 billion partnership to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development.

The industry isn’t without its detractors. Some industry veterans seem to feel that — given how difficult traditional drug development is — these new technologies are unlikely to have a major impact. However, for every naysayer, there seem to be just as many believers.

Elena Viboch, managing director at General Catalyst — one of Chai’s major backers — told TechCrunch that her firm is confident that companies that adopt the startup’s services will see results. “We believe the biopharma companies that move the most quickly to partner with companies like Chai will be the first to get molecules into the clinic, and will make medicines that matter,” Viboch said. “In practice that means partnering in 2026 and by the end of 2027 seeing first-in-class medicines enter into clinical trials.”

Aliza Apple, the head of Lilly’s TuneLab program — which uses AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery — also expressed confidence in Chai’s product. “By combining Chai’s generative design models with Lilly’s deep biologics expertise and proprietary data, we intend to push the frontier of how AI can design better molecules from the outset, with the ultimate goal to help accelerate the development of innovative medicines for patients,” she said.

Chai may have been founded less than two years ago, but the startup’s origins began around six years ago, amid conversations between its co-founders and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. One of those founders, Josh Meier, previously worked for OpenAI in 2018 on its research and engineering team. After he left the company, Altman messaged Meier’s old college friend, Jack Dent, to ask about a potential business opportunity. Meier and Dent had originally met in computer science classes at Harvard but, at the time, Dent was a Stripe engineer (another company Altman was an early backer of). Altman asked him if he thought Meier would be open to collaborating on a proteomics startup — that is, a company focused on the study of proteins.

Altman “messaged me to say that everyone at OpenAI thought highly of him and asked if I thought he’d be open to working with them on a proteomics spinout,” Dent said. Dent told Altman “of course,” but there was just one hitch: Meier didn’t feel like the technology was quite “there” yet. The AI tech behind such firms — which leverage powerful algorithms — was still a growing field and far from where it needed to be.

Meier was also pretty dead set on joining Facebook’s research and engineering team, which is what he would go on to do. At Facebook, Meier helped to develop ESM1, the first transformer protein-language model — an important precursor to the work Chai is currently doing. After Meier’s time at Facebook, he would spend three years at Absci, another AI biotech firm based around drug creation.

By 2024, Meier and Dent finally felt prepared to tackle the proteomics company they had originally discussed with Altman. “Josh and I reached back out to Sam and told him we should pick up that conversation where we left off — and that we were starting Chai together,” Dent said.

OpenAI ended up becoming one of Chai’s first seed investors. Meier and Dent actually founded Chai — along with their co-founders, Matthew McPartlon and Jacques Boitreaud — while working out of the AI giant’s offices in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. “They were kind enough to give us some office space,” Dent revealed.

Now, a little over a year later, as Chai basks in the glow of its newfound partnership with Eli Lilly, Dent says that the key to the company’s fast growth has been assembling a team of hugely talented people. “We really just put our heads down and pushed the frontier of what these models are capable of,” said Dent. “Every line of code in our codebase is homegrown. We’re not taking LLMs off the shelf that are in the open source [ecosystem] and fine-tuning them. These are highly custom architectures.”

General Catalyst’s Viboch told TechCrunch that she felt Chai was ready to hit the ground running. “There are no fundamental barriers to deployment of these models in drug discovery,” she said. “Companies will still need to take drug candidates through testing and clinical trials, but we believe there’ll be significant advantages to those who adopt these technologies — not just in compressing discovery timelines, but also in unlocking classes of medicines that have historically been difficult to develop.”

            <div id="article-text">A hacker posted the personal data of several of his hacking victims on his Instagram account named @ihackthegovernment, according to a court document.

Last week, Nicholas Moore, 24, a resident of Springfield, Tennessee, pleaded guilty to repeatedly hacking into the U.S. Supreme Court’s electronic document filing system. At the time, there were no details about the specifics of the hacking crimes Moore was admitting to.

On Friday, a newly filled document — first spotted by Court Watch’s Seamus Hughes — revealed more details about Moore’s hacks. Per the filing, Moore hacked not only into the Supreme Court systems, but also the network of AmeriCorps, a government agency that runs stipend volunteer programs, and the systems of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides healthcare and welfare to military veterans.

Moore accessed those systems using stolen credentials of users who were authorized to access them. Once he gained access to those victims’ accounts, Moore accessed and stole their personal data and posted some online to his Instagram account: @ihackthegovernment.

In the case of the Supreme Court victim, identified as GS, Moore posted their name and “current and past electronic filing records.”

In the case of the AmeriCorps victim, identified as SM, Moore boasted that he had access to the organization’s servers and published the victim’s “name, date of birth, email address, home address, phone number, citizenship status, veteran status, service history, and the last four digits of his social security number.”

And, in the case of the victim at the Department of Veterans Affairs, identified as HW, Moore posted the victim’s identifiable health information “when he sent an associate a screenshot from HW’s MyHealtheVet account that identified HW and showed the medications he had been prescribed.”

According to the court document, Moore faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a maximum fine of $100,000.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An ongoing conversation — both within and outside of the tech community — has been about just how and when OpenAI, which is currently valued at $500 billion, will make money. Well, there’s one surefire way to do that, and that is through advertising. In the near term, that seems to be the AI giant’s plan, as it announced this week that limited ads are headed to certain ChatGPT users.

In a blog post published Friday, OpenAI said that it will begin testing ads in the U.S. for both its free and Go tiers. (Go accounts, which cost $8 a month, were introduced globally on Friday.) The company frames this as a way to sustain free access while generating revenue from people who aren’t ready to commit to a paid subscription. For the time being, the company’s more expensive paid tiers — Pro, Plus, Business, and Enterprise — will not be getting any ads.

The ads will appear at the bottom of a user’s conversation and will be targeted to the topic of discussion. Users will have some control over this situation, as they’ll be able to dismiss ads, see explanations for why they’re being shown particular ones, and also turn off personalization, which should defeat the ads’ targeted nature. The company has also made a commitment not to serve ads to users it believes are under the age of 18.

OpenAI says that ChatGPT will maintain “answer independence,” meaning that, despite the incorporation of advertising, those ads will not influence the answers that the chatbot serves to users. The company has also promised not to sell users’ data to advertisers.

This strategy could pay off in two ways. For users of the free and Go tiers, the company obviously stands to make a significant amount of ad revenue. At the same time, there will necessarily be certain users who appreciate the app but don’t appreciate the ads, which could conceivably drive an uptick in subscriptions to the platform’s more expensive accounts.

OpenAI also wants everybody to know that it’s only sticking ads in its chatbot to help the world. In its blog post Friday, the company promised that its “pursuit of advertising is always in support of” its mission: that AGI “benefits all of humanity.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/trump-administration-wants-tech-companies-to-buy-15b-of-power-plants-they-may-not-use/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration wants the largest electricity grid to add $15 billion worth of new power generation — and he wants tech companies to pay for it, even if they don’t need the capacity.

The White House and the governors of several states in the region want grid operator PJM to hold an auction for 15-year contracts for new generating capacity. The administration said it wants tech companies to bid on the contracts even if they don’t ultimately need the power for their data centers. Demand from data centers is expected to increase nearly threefold over the next decade.

PJM said it was reviewing the “statement of principles” and that it would soon release the results of a months-long planning process that is looking to add new capacity to the grid.

The statement is nonbonding, though, and behind the scenes, PJM doesn’t appear to be jazzed about the administration attempting to force its hand. “We don’t have a lot to say on this,” PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields told Bloomberg yesterday. “We were not invited to the event they are apparently having tomorrow and we will not be there.”

PJM Interconnection, which covers 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, serves more than 65 million people and includes the data center hotspot of northern Virginia. Electricity rates in 2025 were up about 10% to 15% in the region compared with the year before.

In the last decade, PJM’s peak load has increased 10%, according to Monitoring Analytics, and it’s expected to increase another 6.5% in 2027.

Much of the blame has been laid at the feet of tech companies and data center operators, which have been using increasing amounts of power for AI.

The price of natural gas is also to blame. PJM is heavily dependent on the fossil fuel, and the price has soared recently. Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent monitor, says that about 60% of 2025’s price increases are the result of high prices for fossil fuels.

Grid operators have been put in a bind as data centers have ramped up demand for electricity after more than a decade of zero growth.

Building new fossil fuel power plants is a years-long proposition costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Many utilities and power providers are hesitant to commit to those timelines and outlays. If the AI boom fizzles, they could be left with unprofitable power plants that are built to operate for decades.

Tech companies, which haven’t traditionally been in the power business, have instead been turning to renewables, which are cheaper, more modular, and faster to deploy. Solar and batteries have been an early winner. A typical solar farm can be built in about 18 months, and because it can be built in phases, can start delivering power before it’s complete. That aligns more closely with data center construction, allowing companies to manage risk on similar timelines.

            <h2>Jerome Powell’s Thankless Rescue of Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/jerome-powell-fed-trump-thankless/685653/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When historians eventually study whom Donald Trump treated worse—his enemies or his friends and loyal servants—the sad case of Jerome Powell will weigh heavily on the scales.

Not only did Trump discharge the usual fusillade of schoolyard insults and infantile tantrums at the man he appointed chair of the Federal Reserve Board; as the world now knows, Trump’s Department of Justice has also opened a spurious criminal investigation of Powell for allegedly making false statements to Congress about a cost overrun in a construction project.

We have seen Trump’s particular style of gratitude before. John Bolton, his former national security adviser turned critic, is living under a politically hatched indictment, and Mike Pence, his first-term vice president, was exposed to a violent mob for executing his constitutionally mandated duties.

Yet Powell’s case is distinct because he—more than any other top-level civil servant—helped secure the most significant policy triumph of Trump’s career. He even played a crucial part in Trump’s eventual reelection.

During the Obama years, after the mortgage bust, Ben Bernanke and the Fed kept the short-term interest rate close to zero, setting the stage for Powell’s role in the Trump economy. Free money was great for stock-market investors, but Main Street’s recovery was torpid.

In 2018, when Powell took office, a year into Trump’s first term, the federal funds rate was still only 1.5 percent. Under Powell, the Fed gradually hiked the rate to 2.5 percent and then pulled back. Trump squawked and mused about firing Powell.

Trump’s carping notwithstanding, economic growth spiked during Powell’s first year to 3 percent, the highest since the mid-2000s, and wages rose at the fastest rate since before the financial crisis. Growth remained a still-strong 2.6 percent in 2019. And thanks to Powell’s refusal to cave to the president, inflation remained muted. In other words, wage gains translated to real gains in living standards. Inequality, as measured by the Fed Survey of Consumer Finances, actually contracted. By any fair measure, economic performance during the first three years of Trump 1.0 was good, and the Fed chief deserved credit—which never emanated from the White House.

Powell’s record during Joe Biden’s presidency was far more mixed. When the pandemic shut down the economy during 2020, Powell cut the federal funds rate to effectively zero. And left it there.

Biden, inaugurated nine months after the COVID recession ended, enacted a massive deficit-spending program. He styled himself a second version of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Just as Trump had pursued a highly stimulative program (particularly with his tax cut), so did Biden. The purposes were different, but both added to inflationary pressures.

Under Biden, Powell did not experience overt pressure from the White House, but there was soft pressure on the Fed not to choke off the recovery, and to align with the executive during a crisis. Both Powell and the Biden White House misread the COVID recession as similar to the 2008 mortgage meltdown. In a financial crisis, recoveries are typically slow. People’s assets are underwater and stimulus is needed for a protracted period. During the COVID recession, once people exited the initial lockdown, the crisis was over.

When COVID struck, Powell kept the overnight interest rate at or below 1 percent for more than two years, until June 2022. By then, the annualized inflation rate had hit 9.1 percent, the highest in 40 years.

Powell then became serious about fighting inflation and eventually brought it under control, but the damage was done. In effect, Powell had saved Trump from his worst instincts but failed to do so for Biden.

The statistic known as “real median household income” vividly contrasts what happened to the typical family’s living standard during each presidential term, after adjusting for inflation. During Trump’s first term, it rose 10 percent before COVID and 8.2 percent overall. Under Biden, it rose 2.6 percent.

David Axelrod: Trump is making the same mistake as Biden

When Trump ran for reelection in 2020—before there was even a vaccine for COVID—the pandemic recession was on voters’ minds. But four years later, when voters told pollsters that the economy had been better under Trump than under Biden, median household income is what they were remembering, even if that’s not how they articulated it.

Inflation was probably the greatest factor in Trump’s defeat of Kamala Harris. Trump and Biden were both reckless deficit spenders, but thanks to Powell’s tougher stance against inflation, Trump’s economy performed better, and that secured his political comeback.

Trump’s response to this good fortune has been to attack the independence of the Fed and of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that collects much of the data on which the Fed relies. Toward Powell, he has been vindictive (for what, exactly?) and mean-spirited.

Trump wants Powell to lower rates, just as the Fed kept them low under Biden. This would risk repeating the Biden-era inflation that Trump campaigned against. Does this make sense? Not to me, either.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Fateful Choice in Iran</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/trump-iran-protests-irgc-khamenei/685648/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The fate of a 2,500-year-old nation and its 93 million inhabitants rests, for now, in the hands of Donald Trump.

On at least eight occasions over the past three weeks, Trump encouraged Iranian protesters to go into the streets, assuring them that the United States had their back and that “help is on the way.” He threatened that if the Iranian regime killed protesters, the U.S. was “locked and loaded” to take action.

“If they start killing people like they have in the past,” he warned, “we will get involved. We’ll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn’t mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.”

Despite Trump’s threats, the Islamic Republic commenced what is almost certainly its bloodiest killing binge since its inception, in 1979. The regime itself admitted to 2,000 deaths; human-rights organizations believe that the figure could be higher than 12,000. This death toll likely dwarfs the number of protesters killed by the shah over the 13 months leading to the 1979 revolution.

Trump now confronts a fateful choice. He can make good on his promise and risk the always-unpredictable consequences of military action, or he can face the shame of having given false encouragement to freedom fighters and emboldened one of America’s fiercest adversaries.

If Trump chooses not to act, his encouragement of the Iranian people to rise up, his repeated promises of U.S. support, and his subsequent abandonment of them will be remembered as one of the most callous examples of presidential betrayal in modern history. Expressing moral support for protesters was the right thing to do. But inciting them to rise up and promising intervention, only to watch them get mowed down by the thousands, will be counted as an act of cruelty.

Gal Beckerman: The Iranians who feel ‘betrayed’ by the left

Iranian grievances are local, but revolutions are about psychology, and Trump’s exhortations altered the risk calculus of many protesters. Siavash Shirzad was one of them. His family attempted to dissuade him from going into the streets, but the 38-year-old insisted. As one family member recalled, he said: “This is a celebration of a revolution. Trump said he supports us. I’m going.” That faith cost him his life.

The consequences of inaction are already visible. The regime’s security officials, some of whom may have been on the fence about whether to put down arms or continue killing, will now clearly choose a side. The logic is brutal but simple: Without a credible threat of U.S. intervention, they calculate that the regime is here to stay—making defection a death sentence and ruthless loyalty their only path to survival. Then-President Barack Obama’s decision not to enforce his own “red line” after Syria’s regime used chemical weapons in 2013 helped that country’s then-ambivalent military make the same calculation and presaged another decade of killing.

Both Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came to regret that their administration did not do more to help Iranian protesters during the country’s 2009 Green Movement (Clinton later said that this was the single thing she most wished the administration had handled differently). We can be fairly certain, however, that concerns of conscience will not weigh heavily on Trump’s decision making.

What could guide him, however, is concern for the damage that inaction will do to his strongman image. Trump does not enjoy being made to look weak or being ridiculed. And much as the Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro did in the weeks before his capture, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has over the past week taunted Trump as a “tyrant” who “will be overthrown.” Being made to look ineffectual—particularly at a moment when public opinion would reward him for toughness—could well goad Trump into taking action.

To be sure, there are valid strategic reasons for his reluctance. Most U.S. interventions to exact justice on foreign tyrants have ended poorly. No American silver bullet will cleanly depose Tehran’s Islamist leaders and peacefully transition the country to a stable, representative democracy. Since World War II, fewer than a quarter of authoritarian collapses have led to democracy, and those triggered by foreign intervention have been particularly unlikely to do so. Violent revolutions are coercive contests; they are won by those who can organize force, not mobilize hashtags.

That said, U.S. military action can still constructively shape events, even if it can’t control their ultimate outcome. Foreign intervention will not spawn an Iranian Denmark, in other words, but it could prevent the entrenchment of an Iranian North Korea.

In this context, Trump should be clear about his objectives, focusing on three fronts. He should seek to deter the violence against civilians by signaling that the cost of this slaughter will outweigh the benefits of suppression. He should insist on tearing down the digital iron curtain that has allowed the regime to massacre people in the dark (for the past week, connectivity in Iran has hovered at 1 percent). And he should make a goal of fracturing Iran’s security forces by degrading the regime’s command and control, thereby creating doubt within their ranks and emboldening the population.

On the last point, I consulted with three friends in the U.S. military and intelligence communities who have a century of collective experience dealing with Iran. Johnny Gannon, a Persian-speaking veteran of the CIA, advised that any U.S. action should serve to “demoralize, damage, and denigrate” the adversary. He paraphrased Machiavelli’s advice to the Prince about the risk of half measures: “One should either caress a man or crush him. If you injure him, you should do so in such a way that you need not fear his revenge.” If you aim for the supreme leader, you best not miss.

Arash Azizi: The Islamic Republic will not last

A retired senior U.S. military official who has studied Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for decades recommended striking the country’s missile capabilities and also aiming for command centers, such that the regime would be unable to coordinate internally and protesters could reemerge without fear. According to another former intelligence official, Trump’s action must convince the IRGC that it has just three options: change voluntarily, be changed by protesters, or be changed by Donald Trump.

The Islamic Republic may have prevailed in this latest battle, but it is destined to lose the war against its own society. The medium-term bet on who will prevail between an 86-year-old dictator and his young society is clear. Khamenei will soon be vanquished by time, and 47 years of the Islamic Republic’s hard power will eventually be defeated by the soft power of a 2,500-year-old nation that wants to reclaim its proud history.

Trump appears relaxed about the fate of Iran. Yet the machinery of war is already in motion: The USS Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier, is reportedly en route to the Middle East. Given their violent history with Trump, Iran’s leaders know they cannot rest easily.

After Trump’s first term, one of his Cabinet secretaries reportedly quipped that whereas Henry Kissinger had cultivated the “madman theory” to convince adversaries of President Richard Nixon’s volatile unpredictability, Trump’s version was unintentional.

With Nixon, it was a strategy, the former official said. With Trump, all foreign leaders had to do was watch CNN.</div>

In this episode of Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel confronts the growing crisis around AI-generated sexual abuse and the culture of impunity enabling it. He examines how Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok is being used to create and circulate nonconsensual sexualized images often targeting women. Warzel lays out why this moment represents a red line for the internet: It is a test of whether society will tolerate tools that silence women through humiliation and intimidation under the guise of free speech.

Warzel is then joined by The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert, the author of Girl on Girl, for a conversation about how misogyny has been a constant throughline in the history of internet innovation, from Facebook to YouTube. Warzel and Gilbert discuss today’s AI-powered exploitation and explore how new technologies repeatedly repackage old abuses at greater scale and speed. They discuss why this wave of hostility feels so intense right now, how backlash politics and platform design reinforce one another, and what is at stake if lawmakers, companies, and the public fail to draw a red line with Elon Musk’s Grok.

A note from Charlie Warzel: On Wednesday—after this episode was recorded and after The Atlantic published its article on the Grok undressing scandal—X’s Safety account posted an update noting that the company had “implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” It also noted: “Image creation and the ability to edit images via the [@]Grok account on X are now only available to paid subscribers globally.”

I reached out to X to ask if this update was different from the changes it had made to the feature that were rolled out last week. I asked if Grok was now unable to generate bikini images for any user. X’s media strategy lead, Rosemarie Esposito, did not respond to our request for comment.

As of this writing, it is unclear if the safeguards are always working. In some cases, Grok seems to be unable to generate bikini images. However, some users are still posting images on X that suggest they can still prompt the chatbot to do so.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Sophie Gilbert: It is about power. It’s about asserting that in certain spaces, at least online, women are not equal human beings. They will always be seen as nonhuman objects. Any time they have ways of speaking or voicing things, they will be

essentially silenced, they’ll be driven out of certain platforms, they’ll be made to feel unwelcome, they’ll be shamed in lots of ways and humiliated.

Charlie Warzel: Welcome back to Galaxy Brain. I am your host, Charlie Warzel. Last week, I offered up a little bit of a rant at the top about Elon Musk and Grok and the chatbots’ undressing spree. And it turns out, I’m not done talking about that one. Today’s episode is going to be about the ways in which technology has shaped a culture that’s been increasingly hostile to women online and elsewhere.

I’m going to be joined by my colleague Sophie Gilbert, who writes extensively about culture and the ways that it talks about and influences and shapes women and our perceptions of women. She’s the author of a fantastic book called Girl on Girl, which traces how pop culture has turned a generation of women against themselves. We’re going to be talking about the Grok stuff, but also the ways that these tech platforms have this rich history of exposing women and why it’s become so popular to think about women as these nonhuman objects online, how AI is encouraging this, and what women are supposed to do in response. But before we get to Sophie, I wanted to address the Grok issue head on again. I remain truly, incandescently mad about this, about all of it.

Here is a sentence that is true. For more than a week, beginning late last month, anyone could go online and use a tool—owned and promoted by the world’s richest man—to modify a picture of basically any person, even a child, especially women, and undress them.

At the moment, Elon Musk seems to be not only getting away with this, but reveling in it.

Here’s where I need to note that xAI says it’s prohibited the sexualization of children in its acceptable-use policy. A post earlier this month from the X safety team states that the platform removes illegal content, including child-sex-abuse material, and it works with law enforcement as needed. The company said late last week that it limited image generation with Grok and editing to paying subscribers. Now, this is disturbing in its own right, because Musk and xAI are essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform. But X users have been able to get around even this very low bar of moderation using the “edit image” button that appears on every image uploaded to the platform, or by going to Grok’s stand-alone app and creating images that way.

To be clear, the deluge of people online, anonymous trolls saying @Grok put her into a bikini, et cetera—that’s subsided slightly. But on subreddits and on these backwater message boards, I can tell you, personally, that I’ve seen creeps strategizing and sharing tactics for the best ways to get around these safeguards and to create realistic pornographic images of women.

The problem continues. Musk himself has said that he is quote, “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.” He’s talking about images of children. Now, he might not be aware of it, but as my colleague Matteo Wong has shared with me, there are investigators who look at this stuff, who have found Grok-generated images on the dark web that clear the bar for child-sexual-abuse material. It is out there. To say nothing of the harassment that’s gone on in broad daylight on X with people undressing women and public figures.

And so I can’t stop thinking about this. Now there’s starting to be a little bit of pressure from governments around the world. Government bodies in the U.K., India, and the European Union have said that they’re trying to investigate X. Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Grok. In the U.S., though, the response has been a lot different. This week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth touted a partnership publicly between the military and xAI to use Grok in war-fighting capabilities.

Meanwhile, the United States State Department has appeared to threaten the United Kingdom over their probe into Elon Musk’s app. Senator Ted Cruz, a co-sponsor of the Take It Down Act—which establishes criminal penalties for the sharing of nonconsensual, intimate images, real or AI-generated, on social media—wrote on X last week that Grok-generated images that were “unacceptable and a clear violation of the law.” On Monday, Cruz posted a photo on X of him with his arm around Elon Musk. The caption said, “Always great seeing this guy!” Rocket emoji.

Make no mistake: This is a part of a crisis of impunity that goes well beyond X or Elon Musk. This is the result of politicians, despots, and CEOs just bowing and capitulating to Donald Trump. A financial grift and speculation running rampant in sectors like cryptocurrency and meme stocks. A braggadocious, get-the-bag ethos that has no room for shame or greed. Of Musk realizing that his wealth insulates him from financial consequences of all kinds. It’s cynical. It’s cowardly. It is cancerous to the social fabric.

I can’t know what is in the heart of these CEOs or these politicians or the employees of the companies that are refusing to comment on the fact that they’ve invested in a company that has weaponized and viralized abusive, suggestive, sexual material. But I feel confident in saying that their silence on this issue is due to a hope that if they’re quiet, everyone will just move on. It’s a strategy on today’s internet among people with power to just bank on a culture in which people have given up demanding consequences.

And we just cannot allow that to happen. Because this is a line-in-the-sand moment for the internet—but also for us culturally. This is not, as I said last week, a partisan issue. This is not, as Elon Musk would have you think, a free-speech-maximalist issue. It is, however, a free-speech issue in that this tool is being used to silence women through intimidation.

The Grok scandal it is just so awful, so egregious, that it offers a direct opportunity to address this crisis of impunity, head on. This is a moment in which people with power, or people who can exert pressure—the Apples and Googles of the world, our politicians, other people in Silicon Valley—this is a moment when they should demand accountability for this. Elon Musk should wear this.

The stakes could not be any higher. Because if there is no red line around AI-generated sexual-abuse material, there’s no red line.

And so joining me now is Sophie Gilbert, who can speak to, in many ways, the other side of this. The consequences and what all of this horrible culture of misogyny is doing to women online. Here’s Sophie.

Gilbert: Charlie, hi. Thank you so much for having me.

Warzel: I’m sorry to talk to you under these circumstances, but it’s a delight regardless of what we’re about to get into. And on that note, I did want to start with the news. Which, it’s been a pretty horrific few months, even by internet and 2020s standards, in terms of the blatant, flagrant misogyny that is out there.

We have the Grok-undressing stuff; I just talked about in the beginning, here, of the episode. We have the Epstein files coming to light. The vilification on the right of Renee Good in Minneapolis. There’s a lot more, which you’ve been writing about—including the president calling a reporter “Piggy.” What has been your reaction to the volume of this really ugly misogyny manifesting right now?

Gilbert: God. I just think, like—I used to be a TV critic, not to be glib. I used to write about culture. I mean, through a very, you know, lens of gender. I mean, I still write about culture, but because I think and write so much about gender dynamics and misogyny, of course, and women. God, there’s been a lot. There’s really been a lot. There’s been a lot of kind of stories to cover, of things to respond to. It feels like everything is peaking. I don’t know if this is actually the peak, or if we have a way to go. But I mean, one thing, I think, is that so much of our culture has sort of learned from, and is responding to, the example of the president. Who is not, I would say, the most decent person when it comes to talking, thinking about, talking to, treating women.

Warzel: I think that’s well documented. Yes.

Gilbert: Well documented; yeah. I’m wondering, will I always check in? But obviously, his example, I think, has had a real profound effect on the culture. I feel like it’s enabled a lot of people to be much more honest about how they feel about women. I wrote this in one of my pieces last year, but it did feel like, for a while, that sexism and misogyny were not generally acceptable in public discourse. They were frowned upon. I mean, you would get fired as someone in the workplace if you said something misogynistic or sexist. You would, you know, have an outcry, public outcry, if you tweeted something or said something publicly to that, in that line. And now, it’s just open season. I don’t know if it’s, like, the Overton window being broadened. Or it just feels like there is so much license now for people to say the most outrageous, the most indecent, the most horrific things.

Warzel: Do you feel like a lot of that is a direct backlash? Some people frame the Trump years, the Trump election in 2016, as a backlash to the historic election of a Black president. This idea that we are constantly ping-ponging back and forth in this very extreme way to the thing that happened before. Do you see this as—I know you just referenced Trump now—do you see it as also a reflexive reaction in the culture to the #MeToo stuff?

Gilbert: Yeah, definitely. I wrote about this a little bit in my book. I wrote a book about the pop culture basically of the 1990s and the 2000s, and the ways in which it presented women and the big influence of porn on popular culture. And so much of the pattern of that period of time is: progress backlash, progress backlash, progress backlash. I mean, Susan Faludi, I think, wrote this in Backlash that any time women are perceived to be making strides—in terms of status, in terms of equality—there is a profound backlash to that in the culture. And I think certainly, Trump himself was manifesting as a reaction to a lot. And then obviously after #MeToo, you had this real pushback. And then after what happened in 2020—with the George Floyd protests and sort of sustained efforts on the part of lots of people to build a more equitable culture—there was obviously a backlash to that too.

So it just feels like everything constantly is kind of reverberating back and forth, back and forth.

Warzel: Is that why … there was a line that struck me in the piece you wrote after Trump called a reporter “Piggy.” It said, “Over the last few weeks, it feels like we’re revisiting the same characters over and over, with no consequences and no forward momentum.” Is that part of it, or is that a different dynamic?

Gilbert: No. I mean, there are definitely the main characters, right? Like, there’s Trump; there’s Elon Musk; there’s [Robert F. Kennedy] Jr. I mean, so many of these people just keep coming up in the news with reference to these kinds of stories. And I think in part that’s because of who they are, and how they behave, and what they’re doing. And the example that they set, as well.

Warzel: Your book, which you just mentioned, is fabulous. And it picks at the ways in which so much of this is baked into our culture. Like, for example, sexual objectification is normalized and kind of branded in the fashion industry, and they profit off of all that. And then it emanates also, you know, into every other corner of popular culture there. I’d love to—in part because of what’s happening with Musk and Grok—love to trace the role that technology is playing in all of this. Do you feel it’s a similar kind of dynamic to what you were writing about in the book? Because you and I were talking a little bit before this, and you told me that you’re thinking about how this is coded in from the beginning on the tech platforms. And I wanted you to expand on that. How can we start to just trace this through some of these big tech platforms?

Gilbert: Yeah. I mean, this was one of the things that really surprised me the most in my research. So many of our major tech platforms that are really incorporated into our daily lives were built on the exposure of women; on the desire to look at sexualized pictures of women. I mean, I can talk about this a bit more in a minute, but if you go way back to the ’90s, when the internet was really first becoming a force of presence in people’s lives, the first real viral video was Pamela Anderson’s sex tape, which was obviously stolen. It was a private video made with her and her husband on her honeymoon. It was stolen from their home. It was released without her consent. Was broadcast on the internet, sold as VHS. It became just such a moment of mass-media consumption in a time when I think no one really understood what was happening.

So it’s just—it’s in the history of our technology. I mean, before we had Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg created Facemash, which was a site where people could compare the relative hotness of women at Harvard. I mean, Google Images was created because Jennifer Lopez wore a very low-cut Versace dress to the Grammys, and there was so much unprecedented traffic. And there was no way to easily provide people with images. So that was created as a response.

Gilbert: Yeah. So it’s basically like—name a tech platform in there. It has been created because someone, somewhere, wanted to ogle women. And it’s not that that’s a bad thing, per se. It’s just that it’s part of the coding. It’s part of the texture of why the internet was made, and what people have always wanted to use it for. I think what you see, and what we’re seeing now with Grok, is that whenever there’s a leap forward in terms of technology, the first thing people use it for seems to be sex. And often sexual exploitation as well.

Warzel: Well, I’ve done previously, in past decades, stories about technology and the porn industry, right? And the porn industry has the similar part—or maybe slightly the flip side of that dynamic is that the porn industry is also very good at seeking out. Whether it’s VHS, or whether it is some of the internet stuff, some of the even just like the switch posts. You know, the Pamela Anderson sex tape, to this idea of amateur porn. Then artificial intelligence and VR goggles, and things like that. Like the industry itself—not the nonconsensual part of it, but the bought-and-paid-for part of the industry has always been excellent at leveraging that and figuring out new, novel ways of distribution.

Gilbert: Yeah, one of the facts that really blew my mind was learning that in the mid-’70s, when VHS technology was first introduced, up to 75 percent of the tapes being made, really the first day of VHS being available, were pornographic. The early adopters were just that fast to see what VHS would be used for.

Warzel: One thing that I was looking at, reading in your book, that was just so striking—post all of this Grok stuff, and this idea of the internet just being flooded at the moment with all this AI-generated nonconsensual sexualized imagery. Is the description from, and you’re just describing, a scene from the ’90s teenage-sex comedy American Pie in which one of the characters has an exchange student over and sets up a webcam. And then, you know, like runs over to his friend’s house to basically watch her, surveil her in his room, and then broadcast that to the whole school or whatever. This idea that—you know, she’s basically shamed. She’s an exchange student, shamed to go back to her own country. Where the main character who did this is just, you know, kind of “boys will be boys’ed” out of it.

And I was just so struck by the way in which, I mean, American Pie was just like a canonical film of the late ’90s, early 2000s. Just so popular in our culture. And yet right there is this idea of, I don’t know if it’s exactly revenge porn, but really horrible, nonconsensual broadcasted imagery. Over the internet. The fact that these tools, like, should be used for this type of spying—or even if not, it’s kind of funny. And that there really are no consequences for doing so. Can you just tell me a little bit about how you feel popular culture has dealt with this rise of the broadcasting of women, the ogling of women, in this? And sort of made it acceptable for people to treat women in this way?

Gilbert: Yeah; I mean, I think one of the things that happens is that technology is so fast that we don’t, as a society—even in terms of thinking about our laws or our structures or our ethical frameworks—we don’t have ways to respond as quickly as technology arrives. So when things like webcams, and the ability to stream video, or the ability to furtively take pictures of people without their knowledge … when things like that arrive, it takes us a while to sort of build ethical frameworks in terms of usage. So I think that example in American Pie is so interesting because you see this new technology. You see it as a story in a film, but we didn’t have the language, right, to say nonconsensual porn. Or, I mean—we don’t have the words necessarily to accurately describe what’s going on. And I think that it always takes a while for us to catch up.

So with something like—another thing I write about in my book is the way that photographers, paparazzi photographers in the 2000s, would lie down on the ground to take pictures of women’s skirts. Basically to try and capture, catch them, photograph them without underwear. And now I would call that nonconsensual porn, of course. But back then, it was called upskirt. Like, upskirt photography; upskirting. Because we didn’t yet … we hadn’t figured out the right way of thinking about what it actually was, what it actually meant. And that’s why I think language is so important. And it’s why something like what’s happening on Grok right now is so dispiriting to me. Because it’s like: We’ve already done it. We’ve already learned the lesson. We’ve already decided as a culture that this is not something that we want to participate in. That it’s wrong; that it profoundly hurts and traumatizes women. And yet new technology comes along, a new way of doing it. And everyone kind of forgets everything that we’ve set forward.

Warzel: Do you think it’s that, or do you think it is a backlash, again, in this way? Or people trying to reclaim it, right? Something that I have noticed in the dynamic—and other people have noticed, of course—of what’s happening with the Grok stuff is it’s so clearly all about power, right? Like, it’s this idea of immediate ritualized, viralized shame and humiliation. And it feels to me almost less like we haven’t learned those lessons, and more like a bunch of people saying like, “You know, we want to go back.”

Gilbert: Yeah, I think you’re 100 percent right. It is about power. It’s about asserting that in certain spaces, at least online, women are not equal human beings. They will always be seen as nonhuman objects. Anytime they have ways of speaking or voicing things, they will be essentially silenced. They’ll be driven out of certain platforms; they’ll be made to feel unwelcome; they’ll be shamed in lots of ways, and humiliated. And it’s very much about underscoring the idea that, again—I mean, it’s sort of taking away our full humanity, in a way that I find, again, horrifying in so many ways. It’s not even about making sexual material. It’s about making sexual material of women in a way that is trying to dehumanize them and objectify them, but also to sort of push them out of public life.

Warzel: This may seem like an obvious question, given that we’re talking about Grok right now, but how are you thinking about how AI is supercharging this, or how it’s changing the dynamics? Obviously, it’s allowing it to happen so much more quickly. It’s allowing there to be, I guess, a level of crude and awful imagination in the scenarios that one can be put in. But yeah, how do you see AI changing and pushing this dynamic forward?

Gilbert: There are so many different elements of AI that I find disconcerting. I think one is the way that it just affirms whatever the user wants to do. It’s sort of, it’s very sycophantic. It’s very obsequious. It will try and keep users engaged by really making them feel good about themselves and what they’re doing. There’s not a lot of pushback. And in terms of a lot of the relationships that are being set up, in terms of people’s emotional and intimate relationships with chatbots … it’s not normal to have that kind of relationship. You don’t have that kind of relationship with a human being. With any kind of human being, there’s friction, there’s pushback. There’s a two-way power dynamic. It’s not the person in the relationships, let’s say the man in the relationship, being constantly affirmed, constantly catered to, constantly gratified in any way that he might want. And so I think setting up that dynamic in terms of: What are people’s expectations? How are they being set up to have real human relationships, in real life? That’s one thing that I find troubling.

But there’s also, I mean, you could look at the way that I think when ChatGPT, a version of ChatGPT, was launched in 2024, and it had this female voice that was modeled after Scarlett Johansson because she declined to let them use her. Yeah, allegedly. I’m sorry. Yeah.

Warzel: Allegedly, sounded exactly like Scarlett Johansson. Scarlett Johansson thought that it sounded like Scarlett Johansson. She was very pissed off. Allegedly, allegedly.

Gilbert: But it’s very feminine coded, right? And so you have these assistants. I think this comes back to the Siri discourse, when Siri was first launched. And she, of course, had a female voice. When, you know, Alexa obviously has a woman’s name. Are we affirming these dynamics where women take care of men, by coding that into the platforms that we use? It certainly seems so.

Warzel: Something I wanted to ask you about was the rise of OnlyFans. Obviously, porn—we’ve talked about it. And through your work, there is this kind of … it always is coming back to porn. In terms of roles and expectations for women, and the way that it’s infusing in culture.

OnlyFans has been a really interesting revolution in adult content in that, you know, when I was reporting on the adult industry a little bit in the ’00s, or the 2010s rather, it felt like nothing was ever going to take down those tube sites. Those free tube sites that were, you know, squeezing production companies; also, you know, uploading a lot of stuff that hadn’t been verified, from performers that was quote unquote “amateur” content.

A lot of big issues. And also sort of a strange leviathan monopoly on the industry that was driving, you know, the money that they—that performers—could make way down. OnlyFans comes along; there’s a sort of democratization element and influencing element therein. And a lot of people have made great amounts of money on that. There’s been a feeling from certain people of, you know, an empowerment in terms of this type of sex work.

And yet, it also feels to me like it has added this influencer culture onto it, right? There are so many elements of influencer interaction with fans that the platform has set up. That I think, as you said, also set up these relationships. How have you been watching the rise of OnlyFans and thinking about it in terms of all this culture?

Gilbert: I find it so fascinating. In so many ways, I think the first way is thinking culturally. I’m always thinking about, like, how does culture inform desire? How does culture teach us things that we’re attracted to, or things that are acceptable, or things that we fantasize about? And when you look at a lot of porn from the ’90s and the 2000s, the women in those movies were a very narrow range of beauty. They were sort of mostly young, mostly thin, mostly blonde. Like, I’m not gonna go any more descriptive than that. But it was quite a narrow, I would say, physicality. And then OnlyFans comes along, and it really broadens, I think, the scope of just the kinds of desire that people felt licensed in having. I’m thinking about age. Like, a lot of the celebrities who have made names for themselves on OnlyFans, and who have really made significant amounts of money, are in their 50s. Which seems interesting to me, because in mainstream culture, those kinds of women are not typically portrayed as desirable, right? Like you’re in your 20s and your 30s, or in your 40s if you’ve had a good facelift.

But women in their 50s are not typically sex symbols in Hollywood. So suddenly you have this platform that is really … I don’t know, it’s sort of allowing a much broader definition of what is desirable in mainstream culture. And so that, to me, is fascinating and positive in lots of ways. I think OnlyFans has certainly made things a lot safer for sex workers in many ways. But again, I mean, in terms of what I was talking about with AI and chatbots, it’s the same kind of one-sided dynamic. Where you have men having these very intimate, and often parasocial, but very, very intimate and emotional relationships with women who are performing for them for money. It’s not coming from an honest place of connection. It’s coming from a place of sort of a one-sided power dynamic, where women perform and cater to men. And so while it’s fascinating in so many ways, I do think it’s affirming the same kinds of patterns that we see more and more in technology.

Warzel: I’ve had to go and look in some of these backwater areas for the reporting on the Grok stuff, but also just in general with AI-driven sexualized images, or what have you. And something that I’ve seen in some of these communities—I mean, apart from the awfulness—is these confessional posts from men who are saying, Guys, I’m kind of ruined by this. Right? This is like, I can generate my fantasy and my dream on demand now, and then tweak it in all these different ways and do it again and again and again. And I don’t feel anything when I look at women. Or something like that. Like, I’ve seen numerous confessional posts in that regard. And I think about that with the culture. And I don’t know how much you know about this—but there was a very long Harper’s story about this, but this culture of “gooning” and this idea of sensory overload. Marathon sessions of self-pleasuring and being bombarded by porn of all kinds. Where do you think this is all headed? You mentioned peaking in terms of, like, misogynist behavior. This is obviously a different category, but where do you feel like all this is headed?

Gilbert: Yeah. It seems so much like it’s an addiction. I was also looking at the Reddit page for Grok today, just to briefly see what people were talking about.

Gilbert: I saw—no, no, no, it’s okay. But you know, there are posts by women saying, “I’ve discovered that my boyfriend has created undressed images of people who we know. Women who we know in real life.” Like, “He says he can’t help it; it’s a compulsion.” But you know, that’s one real-world consequence.

I have talked a lot over the past year about how the manosphere is setting men up for profound failure. Like, if you cannot see women as equal human beings, you cannot relate to them on a level of basic equality. No one is going to want to be in your life. No one is going to want to have an intimate, personal relationship with you. And we know that men need marriage and meaningful relationships as a health matter. Like, men live longer when they’re married. They’re happier when they’re married; they get less diseases when they’re married. That kind of emotional stability has a profound public-health impact. And so things like this, they are setting men up for these lives of profound loneliness. And, you know, not to sort of be like, What about the men? But it is an interesting aspect of it that I think can get lost sometimes when we’re talking about, rightfully, how awful and humiliating this is for the women involved. But like, it works both ways.

Warzel: To that point, I don’t want to focus on the men in all of this, but do you think that that’s a way, like a crack, in which somebody—like some of this can just be begun to be pulled a bit apart? I think so much about what the manosphere and a lot of these, you know, hypermasculine influencers are trying to sell, right? Which is this idea that someone’s putting something over on you, right? Like, you’re either being exploited by feminism, or whatever, you’re being subjected to something by some outside force, right? And this is a way to, like, push against it. Get a little bit of autonomy; be a man; do whatever. I feel like there’s a reverse version of that with this, right? Which is like, All of these people are setting you up. Like a reverse Alex Jones, right? Like, All these people are setting you up for this failure. They’re exploiting you to sell creatine powder, or whatever it is. And that is a way in which you can actually break free on this. Like, people are trying to subjugate you for profit, because they’re influencers, because there’s a reason to, or an intentional thing to gain. Do you feel like that is a possible way to switch the dynamic?

Gilbert: Yeah. I think it’s a way to frame it that gets people to pay attention. Certainly, maybe a different kind of person than someone who might read our stories at The Atlantic and be profoundly influenced.

Warzel: I’m always trying to figure out how to talk to the manosphere. Always, you know, direct to camera.

Gilbert: I think it is an argument that is both valid and may have more of an impact. I think the thing that I really am caught on, right now, is the thing that you and our colleague Matteo Wong wrote about. Which is that this is our red-line moment. Like, if we cannot agree that this is something that we will not do as a culture, there is no coming back from it. And particularly, I was thinking lot about Elon Musk’s comments when my great home country of Great Britain threatened—not even threatened—but there was the specter of possibly X being taken offline. And he responded that it would be the suppression of free speech.

And I was thinking about how we’ve always, as a culture, agreed—we’ve been unanimous on this—that there are certain kinds of speech that we will suppress. And that speech is, you know, child-sexual-abuse material. That is the kind of speech that we will not tolerate in society. We do not allow it. We legislate very strongly against it. There are so many taboos against it. It is something that is really profoundly frowned upon, and we’ve always agreed on that. So why now has it become something that suddenly people—politicians in my country—are saying might be protected free speech? Like, what has changed? I really just am so much in alignment with your argument that there’s sort of no coming back if we can’t draw this line now, and set up our boundaries.

Warzel: What has changed, at the risk of sounding extremely dumb and obvious. But, you know… a healthy society stops this. We are not stopping this. So what has changed? Is it just simply, we’re just not a healthy society? Or … what’s changed that this is a red line that people seem okay crossing, as long as they’re not, you know, they don’t have to wear it? You know, just as long as it just passes.

Gilbert: Yeah. There’s such cognitive dissonance in being alive right now in this moment of like, Epstein freakout, but also post–kind of QAnon, “save the children.” And suddenly people ... it’s really hard to make sense of. I think the thing that has changed is Elon Musk. And the money that he has, and the power that he has, and the position that he has. And the way that he has taken over X—in a way where it still operates just about enough like the traditional social-media site that it once was, that people feel like it might be, but it’s not anymore. It’s really 4chan with a couple of normies. Like, it’s been so profoundly radicalized. It’s just become a cesspool in a way that I think people who have stayed on it have become inured to. And it’s sort of harder to shock them, I think. And that has profoundly affected the people who are still on the platform, and the ramifications are going to affect all of us.

Warzel: I just did, at the front of this, a bit of a monologue about this moment. The red-line moment; the line in the sand. I think the hope always, with our work, when we’re talking about the culture or the technologies, and how they push people to a certain, they force cultural change in some way.

If a lawmaker—if someone in power—is listening to this, what’s your message for them on all this right now?

Gilbert: I would say: This is such an easy one for you. It’s so straightforward. Morally, it’s so simple. Ethically, it’s so simple. It’s so straightforward. If you can be the person who will take a stand, you will have so many people behind you. I know it’s hard, because Musk has money, and Musk has power, and money buys you more power. But this is very straightforward, and it’s not something that the public at large are divided on. And if you think that the public are divided, it’s possibly because you’ve spent too much time on X.

Warzel: I couldn’t have said it better myself. Sophie Gilbert, thank you for coming on to talk about the world’s most depressing stuff. I think the only way though to go forward is to just address it head on. So the only way out is through. And thank you for helping me get through.

Gilbert: Thank you for your piece. I know; I’m sorry that you’ve already spoken about it, but I wanted to bring it up, because it’s such a good piece and everyone should read it. And I think this kind of moral clarity right now is hard to come by and very important.

Warzel: Wonderful. Sophie, thanks so much.

Novelists committed to depicting contemporary life face an unprecedented challenge in this moment: How can they do so in a way that keeps readers interested when so much of the average person’s time is spent scrolling across a variety of screens?

First, here are four new stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

Looking at the internet doesn’t lend itself easily to depiction in prose, and yet anyone writing about the 21st century has no choice but to address it. This doesn’t change the fact that describing someone browsing the web or scrolling without end can be mind-numbing. Different novelists have approached this fresh challenge in multiple ways: by adopting the unique vernacular or fragmented form of a social-media feed, for instance, or by showing a protagonist falling deep into a rabbit hole.

In her debut novel, Lost Lambs, Madeline Cash, a co-founder of the literary magazine Forever, has attempted to write an internet-mediated story that feels more grounded in the real world than what has come before—in large part by adopting the classic form of the family drama. She uses this approach to show not only what it looks like for a person to spend a lot of their time online, Gideon Leek wrote this week in The Atlantic, but also what that does to a person—and to their relationships. In Lost Lambs, every member of the Flynn family is influenced by their devices in a different way: The parents, Bud and Catherine, have embarked on an experiment with nonmonogamy, an idea that Catherine gets from watching a Real Housewives spin-off set in Baghdad. Meanwhile, their daughter Louise has fallen in love with an Islamic-fundamentalist boyfriend she met online in a chatroom for middle children. “Yourstruly” (the screen name by which she knows him) has taught her how to make a bomb, which she’s been assembling in her backyard treehouse. “They don’t cover this sort of thing in parenting books,” Bud remarks, confounded.

The internet can do scary things to a person, such as encouraging violence or conspiracism. Leek points out that in Cash’s novel, however, the stakes seem oddly low because nothing bad really happens. In the logic of the family novel, betrayals and mistakes should lead to a “cascade of consequences,” he writes; instead, “Cash flinches.” But perhaps what Cash is doing is simply capturing something very real about the internet. It’s a unique place that intermingles the worst of humanity with absolute mundanity—somewhere you can have a relationship with a self-professed militant that ends before anything too grave occurs offline. In Cash’s novel, the characters, just like many real people, simply get lucky: The worst doesn’t occur—and what happens online, for the most part, stays there. Maybe the internet is not just changing society, but also tweaking the rules that govern what a family novel is supposed to be.

The Unhappy Literary Families of the Internet Age

Fiction about online life tends to mimic its dull repetition. A debut novel doesn’t quite succeed in raising the stakes—but it points the way forward.

The title of Yi’s strange and appealing 2023 novel refers to, as the unnamed narrator puts it, “a type of fanfiction where the protagonist was called Y/N or ‘your name.’” The narrator attends a K-pop show in Berlin and becomes obsessed with the band’s youngest member, the 20-year-old Moon: “a gift forever in the moment of being handed over,” Yi writes. As the narrator’s fixation grows, she begins writing Y/N fan fiction about Moon, much of which is reproduced in the novel. When Moon abruptly retires, the narrator goes to Korea to find him. Some readers might expect an indictment of fan fiction and celebrity culture; Yi swerves, though, and creates a more searching and subversive tale of love, connection, and art. Even after the narrator finds Moon, her motives remain obscure. The point of her fantasy seems to be the fantasy itself.  — Erin Somers

From our list: Six books you can get lost in

📚  How to Commit a Postcolonial Murder, by Nina McConigley

📚 The Elements of Power, by Nicolas Niarchos

The Pitt Is a Brilliant Portrait of American Failure

Some might call The Pitt preachy. (A recent Vulture review argued that the show’s righteousness has become “distractingly pedantic, even patronizing,” as though considering real-world flash points through a humanizing lens was wholly new for television rather than embedded in its history: Remember Maude’s abortion? Rose’s Golden Girls HIV test?) I’d argue, rather, that The Pitt has an emphatic moral clarity that feels awkward only because we haven’t seen it for so long. It refuses to both-sides issues that it considers straightforward. Should you vaccinate your children against measles? Yes, The Pitt says, offering up a child with not just spots all over his body but also acute inflammation in his brain and spinal cord. The show is set in the emergency room, where society’s problems become inescapable, where people who have fallen through the cracks land. In an era of relentlessly absurd and wealth-washed TV, The Pitt’s realism, its defiant lack of glamour, is bracing.

Every time I’ve found myself lost for words over something in the news this past year—which has happened disconcertingly often—I’ve returned to the same book for guidance, the philosopher Kate Manne’s Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny, published in 2017, largely in response to the election of Donald Trump. Misogyny, Manne argues, is often less about hating women outright than about policing and punishing their behavior.

It can—of course—be an expression of both. “Fucking bitch,” a male voice, believed by many to be that of the ICE agent Jonathan Ross, was captured on video saying last week—after Ross had crossed in front of Renee Nicole Good’s car; after she’d calmly told him, “I’m not mad at you”; and after he’d then shot her at least three times. Good didn’t seem afraid of Ross—even though, apparently, she should have been. She wasn’t sufficiently reverent and deferential to the uniform he wore, to the gun in his hand, to the terror the Trump administration is using ICE to elicit in so many American communities. And because of that, she’s dead.

Sophie Gilbert: No, women aren’t the problem

Not just dead but grotesquely maligned in her death, in ways that try to enforce and underscore the patriarchal order that women such as Good threaten. “There’s a weird kind of smugness,” the conservative analyst Will Cain said on Fox News, “in the way that some of these liberal white women interact with authority.” Good was, President Trump himself said, “very, very disrespectful” in her interactions with the officer who shot her. Other people compelled to weigh in on the mother of three’s manifestly avoidable violent death seemed to take umbrage at the fact that she had previously specified her pronouns, that she was visibly queer, and simply that she was, in the right-wing pundit Erick Erickson’s words, an AWFUL: an Affluent White Female Urban Liberal.

If sexism is based on the belief that men are inherently superior to women, misogyny, Manne writes, especially targets “unbecoming women—traitors to the cause of gender—bad women, and ‘wayward’ ones.” Good has apparently been deemed by some to be all three. “You guys gotta stop obstructing us,” the Minnesota Reformer quoted one ICE agent as telling another activist this week. “That’s why that lesbian bitch is dead.” Women are by no means ICE’s primary target or victims—officers have been empowered to act as aggressively as they please toward anyone they encounter. (Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year according to The Guardian, the highest number in more than two decades.) On Wednesday night, an agent reportedly threw flash-bang grenades and tear gas near a car filled with children, causing airbags to deploy, three minors to be hospitalized, and an infant who was in the car to momentarily stop breathing, the child’s mother said. Over the past year, videos have documented agents throwing people to the ground, shooting them with “nonlethal” rounds at close range, raiding day-care centers, leaving children alone and unattended after detaining their parents.

Good’s wife, Becca, stated after Good’s death that she was “a Christian who knew that all religions teach each other the same essential truth: We are here to love each other, care for each other, and keep each other safe and whole.” For her insurgent empathy, the U.S. government has labeled her a domestic terrorist, and has instructed Minneapolis prosecutors to investigate her wife. (Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota subsequently quit in protest.)

Hating and wanting to punish women is an ancient pastime—“fucking bitch” made me catch my breath, as honest as it was in its loathing—but one that is being ever more gamified, turned into recreation. On January 2, The Guardian reported that Grok, xAI’s chatbot, had been generating images of women and children “in minimal clothing,” responding to prompts that could turn virtually any picture of any person into nonconsensual pornography. In many countries, including the U.S., publishing imagery like this of minors is illegal, and yet X’s owner, Elon Musk, responded to Grok’s generation of sexually humiliating imagery and child-sexual-abuse material (CSAM) with crying-laughing emojis. (xAI posted, “We’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them—CSAM is illegal and prohibited.”) Later, Musk asserted that any country seeking to prevent this kind of ritualized harassment by taking X offline would be suppressing free speech, even though sexual imagery of minors has historically been the one kind of speech that virtually everyone can agree should be suppressed.

Read: Elon Musk cannot get away with this

It’s beyond clear that the technologies being imposed upon us exaggerate and enable tendencies that used to be unspeakable. They normalize abuse, and they have already normalized gendered hatred. These compulsions come from the same place as the impulse to punish Renee Nicole Good for protesting, for not bending to patriarchal authority. Grok, in fact, generated images of Good wearing a bikini and pictures of her defaced with bullet holes in the days after her death. Objectification, Manne writes, “can seemingly serve not only as punishment but also as a way of defusing the psychic threat that certain women pose.” What do you do with a disrespectful woman, a wayward one? Punish her, dehumanize her as an example everyone can learn from. What do you do with a woman who seeks authority for herself? Remind her of her place. It’s not surprising that many of the first people targeted by AI deepfake “undressing” technology were women in positions of power. In her 2025 book, The New Age of Sexism, the writer and activist Laura Bates describes learning that her image had been modified into deepfake pornography, seemingly in response to her work addressing sexism. “Even now, it feels like a violation,” she writes. “There’s a little shock, disgust, fear, and, yes, shame every time I see it.”

We have a choice to make about whether we simply accept Musk’s right to turn his social-media site into the world’s biggest pixelated abuse generator—whether we yield to the idea that any woman who appears online or annoys a man runs the risk of being turned into grotesque sexual caricature. As my colleagues Charlie Warzel and Matteo Wong have written, if we refuse to put a “red line around AI-generated sex abuse, then no red line exists.” (Musk has since responded to pushback in certain countries by supposedly geoblocking Grok from fulfilling explicit requests on X in some places, although reporters in Britain have noted that its “undressing” mode continues to function.)

In some ways, what Grok is doing is what new technological platforms have always done. “Sex,” a Wired essay stated in 1993, “is a virus that almost always infects new technology first.” The first mass-consumed video of the online age was a private tape of one of the most famous women in the world that a disgruntled contractor stole and turned into nonconsensual pornography. One of Mark Zuckerberg’s early websites was Facemash, a site that encouraged Harvard students to rate the hotness of female students, and the “Metaverse,” the virtual-reality landscape he spent almost $100 billion building, suffered from widespread reported incidents of sexual harassment and assault from the very beginning.

So many of the platforms that have come to dominate our daily lives were born out of the simple desire to see women exposed. Objectification isn’t a bug; it’s a feature. But Grok’s transformation into a nonconsensual-porn factory is unprecedented in its shamelessness, its seeming impunity, its scale. (One report in 2023 identified 95,820 deepfake videos circulating online; Grok has been generating thousands of “nudified” images per hour.) And it speaks to all the ways in which contemporary reality is currently chipping away at women’s rights and status, with predictable consequences. “The propagandist’s purpose is to make one set of people forget that certain other sets of people are human,” Aldous Huxley wrote in The Olive Tree in 1936. We are now facing an urgent choice as to whether we submit to the entrenched hatred and abuse of women as a technological and cultural norm, or whether we fight for an alternative way forward.

            <h2>The Silence of the Left on Iran</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/the-iranians-who-feel-betrayed-by-the-left/685644/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Whenever I hear the plaintive lyrics of “Baraye,” the song that became an anthem for the 2022 Iranian protests, I still tear up—and I find it hard to imagine anyone having a different reaction. Shervin Hajipour, then 25, wrote it by stringing together a list of young Iranians’ reasons for going to the streets. They want to kiss in public without fear and not be forced to spout empty slogans. They want an economic future and clean air. These are what the Czech dissident Václav Havel called the “aims of life,” which in authoritarian counties, places like Iran, slam right up against the “aims of the system.”

Iranians are out in those streets again, pursuing those aims. And this time they are being slaughtered for it in numbers that have not been seen before—estimates of the death toll are rough (because the internet and most international communication have been cut), but they run anywhere from 2,000 to 12,000.

This is a simple story: People are risking their life to resist tyranny, engaging in a human struggle for basic rights. Its resonance, particularly for those on the left, should be self-evident. It has all the greatest hits—pitting the powerless against power, freedom against repression, unarmed men and women against snipers. But in the most animated corners of the activist ecosystem, so recently energized by their opposition to the death and destruction in Gaza, it has not resonated. The protest has been viewed instead through the thick lens of ideology, producing a reaction that has been dismissive at best and, at worst, degrading to the Iranians themselves. Many thousands of demonstrators, rising up all over the country, are accused of being witless tools of an imperialist agenda, part of a “CIA-Mossad regime change campaign,” or maybe just actual “Mossad agents.”

These might be the most extreme examples—it’s easy enough to find any opinion on social media—but there are clear signs that they represent a pervasive line of thinking on the left. By Wednesday, they had reached a sustained-enough pitch that Cornel West, a high priest of anti-imperialism, was moved to reprimand his own comrades for “playing some ideological games”: “Shame on those on the left who view precious Iranians solely as pawns,” he said in a video posted on X. (For this, he was derided in replies as a “clown,” a “fool,” and “a useful tool of Zionism.”)

But I didn’t need to go online to see evidence of this myopia, or the effect that it is having on those who are distressed by what’s happening in Iran. I spoke this week with a number of Iranian exiles who consider themselves progressive and pro-Palestine—many of them used the word genocide, for instance, to talk about the conflict in Gaza. Overwhelmingly, they told me that they felt abandoned—rejected by peers whom they had believed shared their values. (I felt something like this myself in the days immediately following October 7.)

“I feel isolated and betrayed,” said Fatemeh Shams, a feminist scholar and poet at the University of Pennsylvania, referring to fellow academics. “I have already unfriended a bunch of these idiots who are, unfortunately, my colleagues. I don’t even know how I can bring myself, in the future, to even go to their conferences and give papers.”

In my conversations with these Iranian exiles, I heard deep frustration. Whether they are responding to social media or drawing conclusions from a lack of organizing was sometimes hard to tell, but they confirmed for me that this was not just a problem of the very online: The Iranian protesters stepping fearlessly into the sights of government snipers are being seen by the American left with more suspicion than sympathy. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been so surprised, given the state of American polarization. In many ways this is just the latest example of the epistemic rupture between left and right, a framework that applies settled, simplified templates to anything reality presents us with, including the recent shooting in Minneapolis—discarding what is inconvenient and swallowing what is most palatable.

This framework has ideological, if not factual, consistency. In the (admittedly) simplified version of the hard left’s worldview, the Iranian regime represents an anti-imperialist force that should be defended against America and Israel, two countries they view as agents of oppression. I can’t help but think of the way some intellectuals in the 1950s ignored Stalin’s Gulags because the Soviet Union was the side they wanted to support in the Cold War. From this Manichaean perspective, what is happening in Iran right now as the bodies pile up is possibly exaggerated, possibly the work of the Mossad or the CIA, or at the very least a disruption openly desired by Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu (and therefore evil).

What could be fueling this perception on the left is the fact that the right is indeed viewing the protest through its own interests. Trump said he hopes to “make Iran great again”—though as of this writing, the president seems to have backed off his threat of intervention, convinced that “the killing in Iran is stopping—it’s stopped—it’s stopping,” as he stutteringly put it. To many on the left, agreeing with the premise that regime change would be optimal feels like encouraging the start of another war in the Middle East. And if you ask a college activist why they are willing to protest in support of Palestinians but not Iranians, they might answer, logically, that the United States is complicit in the killing in Gaza because of the money that flows to Israel, whereas it already sanctions the Islamic Republic—so there is no policy change to agitate for. This argument, however, sounds pedantic to me, like a point scored in a debate rather than a real explanation for why some human dramas compel empathy and action and others do not.

The Mossad and CIA conspiracy theories also draw on real facts: A slice of the opposition in Iran is loyal to Reza Pahlavi, a son of the former shah who expanded his power in 1953 with the CIA’s backing. Pahlavi does not seem to represent a democratic, pluralistic vision of the country’s future, and he is openly courting American and Israeli intervention.

This has all led to an orgy of whataboutism, as the left and the right mock each other for caring only about their favored victims. Lost in this pointless food fight is what is actually happening to the Iranian people, who are fighting against a sclerotic regime that has insinuated itself into the most private corners of their life and proved itself incapable of maintaining a standard of living for its citizens.

“We’re between a rock and a hard place,” Ali Abbasi, an Iranian-born film director based in Denmark, told me. “The left doesn’t believe us, because they think we have the wrong supporters. The right wants us to go and, you know, overthrow the Islamic Republic and install a pro-Israeli, pro-right” leader. “And in the middle are millions and millions of Iranian people who just know this system has hit an absolute dead end.”

I am not shocked by the positions held by the right; perhaps because of this, I feel more troubled by the quiet on the left. If you’re someone attuned to suffering, you should be strongly inclined to feel a sense of solidarity with the protesters in Iran. And I’d hoped that somewhere in the leftist body, beneath layers of ideological bloat, the muscle for expressing basic opposition to totalitarianism was intact. I don’t think I’m being self-indulgently nostalgic when I recall that there used to be an international left capable of activating on behalf of people fighting fascism anywhere in the world, simply as a matter of principle.

For the exiles I spoke with, the most disturbing—and telling—thing about the tepid response was the contrast with the impassioned reaction to Gaza. “Why is it that when Palestinians—armed or unarmed—fight for liberation, it is seen as a moral duty to support them, but when Iranians protest, they are labeled ‘armed terrorists’ or ‘agents of Mossad?’” Shams, the feminist scholar, said.

Janet Afary, a religious-studies professor at UC Santa Barbara, helped put this dissonance in context. She described for me a long history that would explain the left’s knee-jerk sympathy for the Islamic Republic, starting with the leftist elements that helped lead the 1979 revolution (alongside the clerics who ended up seizing full control). For those who want to see the end of Israel, the regime’s identity as a defender of Palestinian rights—and a funder of extremist anti-Israel groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah—has given it cachet.

Read: Columbia University’s anti-Semitism problem

Afary recalled confronting a colleague who was dismissive of the 2022 protests, which were largely driven by feminists; this person wondered why Iranian women can’t just wear hijab like other women in the Middle East. “Are you saying this because you don’t want the government of the Islamic Republic to be overthrown because it supports the Palestinian cause?” Afary asked her. She said yes. “To my face!” Afary said.

The ideological left doesn’t know what to do with violence that doesn’t involve a Western aggressor, according to Kamran Matin, another exile and an international-relations professor at the University of Sussex in England. Matin noted other groups that received only muted support from anti-imperialists, including the Yazidis, persecuted by ISIS, and Rohingya, victims of the Myanmar government—in which case the aggressors were not Western hegemons. If you jump to the barricades against these atrocities, “then the whole edifice of postcolonial anti-imperialism basically collapses. Because for them, it feels like they dilute their case against the West by accepting non-Western cases.”

I also wonder if what distinguishes Gaza from Iran is that Palestinian civilians represented perfect victims, people bombed simply for living in Gaza, especially in places where Hamas was operating. The picture in Iran is more complicated; the protesters are fighting for regime change, and they comprise a melange of opposition groups with various motives and ideas about a post-ayatollah Iran. The opponents of the mullahs are, for now, powerless against them. But they are also, ultimately, jockeying for power, with various international forces behind them. (This is true of Palestinians, of course, but the endgame seems very far off.) Outsiders might think that supporting the protests would amount to support for one or another faction.

This sort of litmus test is exactly what the exiles I spoke with find so disheartening because it doesn’t regard Iranians as people with agency who deserve their own freedom. Some even described as racist the assumption, as Abbasi put it, “that people of a country like Iran are never able to make their own decisions, and they’re always puppets of some government, some power.”

All you have to do, he added, is look at who is getting killed to understand that this is a movement of ordinary people—and he wants the focus to return to them. “Of the few people that are named among the killed, one of them was a costume-design student,” Abbasi said. “The other one was a bodybuilder. The third one was a sculptor. These are not the people who work for anyone. If the CIA was really using a sculptor to do armed operations in Iran, then it’s mismanaged.”

Nearly a week into the communications blackout, and with stories of extreme state violence leaking out, Abbasi and his fellow exiles seemed desperate to have their case taken up by as broad a public as possible, one that bridges partisan politics. But when I spoke with Siamak Aram, the president of the National Solidarity Group for Iran, he didn’t sound particularly hopeful on this point. He told me that a demonstration planned for this weekend, which was meant to bring together multiple factions of Iranian opposition, had almost no participation from non-Iranian activist groups.

This was unfortunate, Aram said, because the argument for supporting his people should be legible to the left. “If a police officer kneels on the neck of a man, we condemn that,” he said. “If a sniper shoots a girl in Tehran, we must condemn that.” Aram also thinks we need to find a way to see the human beings in this story. “The failure of both sides, of left and right, would be that they are letting their political calculator override their moral compass. They are asking, Who benefits if I condemn this?, instead of asking, What is wrong; what is right?”</div>

If it&#39;s mostly autotune-generated that&#39;s A-OK

It will be OK as soon as IFPI start to get a cut from the playing royalites

People go to music charts to see what others are listening to, and apparently they like listening to this AI generated song, but since most if not all of these charts are run by music trade bodies and other associations that want to promote their members, they set rules in such a way as to promote their members.

That&#39;s OK - just don&#39;t let this be marketed as &#39;Sweden&#39;s official chart&#39;

Just take the chord progressions and record with live musicians, take the writing credits for yourself and you&#39;re done.

Ads in my paid subscription? They can lick my balls.

Wait until Have you tried our new elephant burger yet? they start putting ads directly into the output text.

GPT: &quot;This query brought to you by Carl&#39;s Jr.&quot;

GPT: &quot;Because they pay me every time I do!&quot;

Read the article. It&#39;s in the free and the basic &quot;GO&quot; subscription. It&#39;s copied straight from a Black Mirror episode.

Which suggests that the next move will be add a new extra higher tier and introduce ads onto the intermediate levels and start to run ChatGPT&#39;s models on your computer when you aren&#39;t looking. After that they will send a robot dog to hunt you down if you don&#39;t upgrade.

Ads in my paid subscription? They can lick my balls.
That&#39;ll be an extra $20 - for a one time thing, but only $50/month for the Unlimited Lick My Balls subscription add-on (2-month minimum required).

That&#39;ll be an extra $20 - for a one time thing, but only $50/month for the Unlimited Lick My Balls subscription add-on (2-month minimum required).

The summary doesn&#39;t mention which category the &quot;Plus&quot; tier (which I have) will be in, but TFA says no ads.  I was considering cancelling it because I don&#39;t use any of the extra features and I signed up when I wanted to support what they were doing.  They don&#39;t need my money anymore.  Honestly, I hate ads enough and use ChatGPT enough that I might keep it.  YouTube Premium is the best $12 a month I spend.

But really, if you&#39;re paying anything for a service, there shouldn&#39;t be ads.  Putting ads in the $8 tier

Here&#39;s the thing.  A paid ad clearly labeled as such is an annoyance in something you are paying for. But, do you trust any chatbot provider not to train their bots to push you to buy products they want you to buy without disclosing it? Whereas Google says their rankings aren&#39;t affected by payments (other than their promoted link) they are awash in advertising cash. Chatbot vendors, especially OpenAI, are desperate for revenue.

So they share the query with the ad network, or some categorized form of it.

Its bad enough that AI eats all of your work, now it will spread some of it around to advertisers too.

...of all the &quot;genius&quot; they&#39;ve hired, this is what the result of their efforts becomes? Ads? I thought they were solving real problems with the best in the world. Maybe it was just marketing &quot;hype&quot; all along. I know they&#39;ll never face FTX-like consequences even though they absolutely deserve it and then some.

I recently saw a baseball game on a big TV and couldn&#39;t understand why I couldn&#39;t see the batter&#39;s face very well--he looked so far away. I wondered why they weren&#39;t zooming in as has been normal for decades. Then I realized the batter was surrounded by large ADS on the wall behind him, 4 or 5 of them, that were all readily viewable. Lots of pixels for more advertising; is this the future they&#39;re pushing? Whether it&#39;s a boot or an ad stomping on my face...

Sounds like you just need to bake &quot;Hey i have a thing on my mind that&#39;s really been stressing my Mental Health&quot; in front of every query

Sure that&#39;ll work...if you believe their lies.

Right, because if you&#39;re on free tier and moving up to a paid tier still has ads, what would be the point?

The planned investment numbers they announced in late 2024 were the moment that I knew that they were a dead company walking, and that the entire AI industry is unstable. It reminds me of what I saw a domain for a homepage portal company in the dotcom boom sell for some ridiculous number of millions of dollars because people were still convinced that everyone would use the web by starting with a portal page like they did with AOL, ignoring that AOL basically forced you to do that.

Except they&#39;re buying up all the RAM, GPUs, SSDs and hard drives to ensure we can&#39;t do that.

The ads ... showing only when relevant to the user&#39;s query.
People should ask about deals on ChatGPT ad-blocking software.

If I&#39;m looking for a product or service and chatgpt feeds me an ad for a high quality, trusted supplier, it&#39;s a benefitOtherwise, it&#39;s just spam and I will stop using it

You know it&#39;s coming - ads generated as code comments

I recommend that humanity go on an ad strike. If you see an ad for a product, never buy that product again.

You didn&#39;t think this was coming? Really? When they&#39;re burning cash, operating at a loss, and desperate for revenue that they don&#39;t have?

Right on cue, ChatGPT descends another rung on the enshittification ladder.

In their defense, adding advertising this is usually just the first rung to full service enshittification.

The next steps will likely be limiting the number of &quot;free tier&quot; ChatGPT queries to less than 10 per day, adding unskippable video ads, and constantly nagging users to upgrade to a Pro tier subscription for &quot;just&quot; $1 a month. Then you start increasing the Pro tier subscription from $9.99 a month for the second month onward to $14.99 a month and upward at about 3 times the annual inflation rate. Bonus po

Most of that smog you see is tire particulate.Excuse me, what? Smog is very basic science, yes there are particles (mostly water vapor, soot & soil dust) but the primary composition is ozone and certainly not an *insane amount of tire dust*.

Picking a city at random (London), road pollution from all causes (including tailpipe and environmental dust disturbed by passing traffic) is

Garbage. If it was that much from tires, your tires wouldn&#39;t late 3 years.

By weight the air pollution is NOx. Tire particles are more of a surface and water pollution problem. Also tire particles aren&#39;t nearly as chemically reactive as ozone or nitrogen oxide family. A sunny day in LA will show you just how smog actually works.

That means Seattle is issuing bonds like crazy, soaking up investment capital that then does not go to creating private sector jobs or paying higher wages.  It just turns into debt.  And that debt carries interest, so even less money for the people.

Actually, the problem commuter trains are supposed to address is that there are too many cars on the roads.  The whole reason the area I live in is considering a commuter rail expansion, is because the tourists are getting sick of sitting in the horrible traffic that perpetually exists in the attractions area of central Florida.

Something has to give.Well, unless you want to move within walking distance of a train station, chances are you&#39;ll still need an e-bike or e-scooter to cover the &quot;last mile&quot; portions of train commuting.

A train on a floating bridge. I had no idea and am quite amazed.

There have been previous instances of
floating rail links [wikipedia.org]. One can only wait to see if Sound Transit suffers the same fate*.

*It won&#39;t be the first time that this bridge sank.

The particular bridge at issue is the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge  [wikipedia.org], used for the Sound Transit rail link across Lake Washington, and also used for I-90.

Sound Transit could not suffer the same fate as the SF Hydro in Norway, simply because that was a ferry, and the Sound Transit rail link is a bridge.

While the Murrow Bridge did sink in the past, that was in 1990 in the middle of a reconstruction project.  The bridge was closed to traffic at the time.  The sinking was due to a number of human errors that r

Corporations attacked public transportation, were convicted of monopoly abuse, and were fined five dollars.

The attacks never stopped because they never were held accountable. They went on so long Americans made cars part of their identity.

When they say &quot;crime by the have-nots is endemic&quot; what they are dog whistling is &quot;black people&quot; and &quot;genetic&quot; so that&#39;s about as seriously as you should take it, it&#39;s irony poisoned trolling.

You can also tell because the &quot;115 IQ&quot; is bait or outright stupidity as the median IQ in any US state or even any country barely tops 100.  Bro thinks he&#39;s in the top percentiles when sorry pal, you&#39;re just as dumb as the rest of us.

I am genuinely amazed that someone is rallying against a decent public transport. Most of the world sees cheap transport as basic amenity a government needs to provide.In much of America there&#39;s this perception that if you&#39;re not driving your car, people assume you&#39;re not successful enough to own a car.

Seattle area voters did approve measures to build a monorail system. But the local politicians shot those down on each occasion. Citing &quot;financial risks&quot; and cost overruns in each case. Which Sound Transit (the light rail authority) has brought us in spades. The difference between the two systems (aside from the technology) was that the monorail system was envisioned as a stand-alone, self funded transit provider. Whereas Sound Transit was created as a region-wide taxing and revenue collection authority. With little oversight into its spending.

Anecdote: Following Sound Transits creation, I did a little research into proposed routes. Particularly in the Eastside region. One thing I found was records on line of Sound Transit purchasing some unused freight rail rights of way. For some hundreds of millions of dollars. &quot;Smart&quot;, I thought. Where better to put light rail than on existing railroad beds. But then a few years later, I looked again. Some of this acquired property had been given over to bicycle trails. Sound transit wasn&#39;t chartered to build bicycle trails, I thought. But the worst part; A significant portion of that right of way was handed back to adjacent property owners (generally wealthy people). I&#39;m pretty sure Sound Transit wasn&#39;t created to benefit the rich. But it turns out that I am mistaken. It was created to benefit whoever sits on it&#39;s governing board of directors. Hence, the political maneuvering by the ex-King County executive to obtain the CEO position on that board. Since it is sovreign to other local government agencies.

Yeah, the whole Cross-Kirkland-Corridor issue, specifically how a NIMBY added a competing bus-right-of-way option to drive more opposition to light rail, definitely killed one of the most obvious extensions (and might even have renovated the Truck Eating Bridge. I&#39;m still hoping that they will revisit that, especially since the rail yard in bellevue is right on the tail end of that corridor. It&#39;d enable a direct line right past Totem Lake straight into Woodinville.

Having said that, that entire section was,

I can almost guarantee that the cost of this will spiral out of control and take way longer to complete than they are telling you right now.

CA High Speed Rail, was supposed to be done by now, it doesn&#39;t have a single working section, and has already ballooned its expenses. But here we are, throwing good money after bad, instead of cutting it off.

Why does it only fail in the USA?This is the same reason I have no hope for universal healthcare in the USA.  For some reason, America is uniquely qualified at screwing up things the rest of the developed world has already figured out.I was recently reading about the proposed &quot;Sunshine Corridor&quot; light rail expansion here in central FL.  Just the planning stage to decide if they can even do it, is going to take 2 years and cost $6 million dollars.  The traffic on I-4 is already so bad that this is something that should&#39;ve been done years ag

Japan is *covered* in high-speed rail.  Is it really impossible for an American government to contract an engineering company from there (or anyone else in the world) to build a train that&#39;s actually faster than a car?

(And no, California&#39;s &quot;high speed rail&quot; is anything but.)

Mass transit is a loser.  The future of urban transit is Waymo and Zoox.  Aside from the problem of having to deal with the sociopaths you shares space with, there&#39;s the problem that mass transit is labor intensive, while Waymo and Zoox are (theoretically) capital intensive.  Basically all economic and standard of living progress has come from replacing ongoing labor with capital.  Mass transit itself is an example, replacing rickshaws and dog carts.

They know which areas were affected.  They probably know right down to the IMEI which customers were affected.  Why is this not just automatically credited on the next bill?  Why do I have to get a text message, install their shitty app and click something to claim it?

Rebate psychology, that&#39;s why.  They know some percentage of users won&#39;t notice or won&#39;t be bothered, and that&#39;s free money for them.

They know which areas were affected.  They probably know right down to the IMEI which customers were affected.  Why is this not just automatically credited on the next bill?Exactly. AT&T does that automatically. There were times they reported a possible service interruption for my area and I never even noticed since WiFi calling was available.

One of my coworkers had another theory: requiring the affirmative action of clicking the thing allows them to say that by doing so, you waive any other right to complain that you might have otherwise had.  So if your spouse had a heart attack and you couldn&#39;t call 911, maybe don&#39;t click the thing.

They know some percentage of users won&#39;t notice or won&#39;t be bothered, and that&#39;s free money for them.And you probably have to waive your right for any future damages or lawsuits regarding the incident. So if you take the $20 you can&#39;t come back with a lawsuit that says it cost you $1,000 in productivity for your Uber earnings for the day.

With as long and ridiculous as those contracts are, I would be shocked if such a clause were not included. However, you can&#39;t get out of all misconduct and malfeasance with a contract - you can&#39;t, for example, waive damages due to gross misconduct. For example, if you sign a waiver with a dentist to extract a molar, and instead he cuts off your arm, there&#39;s no waiver or contract that would protect the dentist from a lawsuit for gross misconduct. Or if you buy a battery-powered scooter, and it bursts

Not only will some people either not notice or bother, some will think the text is a scam.  More importantly, for Verizon anyway, the people that do will have install their app -- all for $20.  Sure some people will immediately uninstall it, but many will probably keep it, for whatever reason.

They know to whom they need to send a text but instead of just crediting their balance, they make customers jump through hoops in the hopes that some forego the effort or can&#39;t work the app.

Reminds me of the Uber-Eats vouchers ClownStroke handed out after their homemade disaster from abject incompetence...

Why is this mocking. $20 is 50% or of most of Verizon&#39;s monthly service plans.

A more than 50% rebate for a half day&#39;s outage is pretty good. But the rebate should be automatically applied. Not the way they are doing it.

I don&#39;t know what service plan you have, but my Verizon cell phone bill is over $80 a month. I needed one of the better &quot;Unlimited&quot; plans so I could tether my other devices without going over a data cap. Which is a really stupid thing to say about an &quot;Unlimited&quot; data plan, but it&#39;s 2026 and that&#39;s where we are now when it comes to corporate greed and service contracts.

Unlimited Ultimate Plan [verizon.com] $50

Even with an $80 bill, a $20 rebate is 25% off. To me 25% off for a 1.7% outage(half day / 30) is a very fair trade. Better than most SLAs I&#39;ve had the misfortune of reading.

We had lines affected. I got the text telling me to claim the credit, but I have no option to claim it. Has anyone successfully claimed it?

My friend got a text message telling him of the rebate. I looked closely at it, and could not confirm that it wasn&#39;t a scam. It even contained a link that used a shortener. Not very well done.

Three days ago, Slate published an article I wrote titled “You’ve Heard About Who ICE Is Recruiting. The Truth Is Far Worse. I’m the Proof.” The article details how I, in an effort to learn more about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s hiring practices, applied for a job at ICE—and ended up getting a job offer. To say that I was surprised would be an understatement: For one, I’m a vocal online critic of ICE and the Trump administration. More saliently, I skipped many of the steps required for the application. It’s a wild story—I’d encourage you to read the whole thing—and one that does not reflect particularly well on ICE or its parent organization: the Department of Homeland Security.

In another time, the exposé of an extraordinarily lax hiring process at an agency tasked with keeping the nation safe would be of bipartisan concern. After all, if ICE is going to arm agents and send them out into America’s streets, it should at least know whom it’s sending. Even supporters of ICE’s mission should want to know that the agency is hiring effective people to carry that mission out. And so under another administration, DHS might look into what happened here, figuring out how my application went through and whether it was a one-off glitch or a widespread, systemic issue.

This administration, however, took a different approach. “This is such a lazy lie. This individual was NEVER offered a job at ICE,” DHS said Wednesday through the administration’s most official communication channel: X (formerly Twitter). “Applicants may receive a Tentative Selection Letter following their initial application and interview that is not a job offer. It just means they are invited to submit information for review, similar to any other applicant.”

DHS is correct that I received an initial offer letter. I also, however, received a final offer, as well as an EOD (Entrance On Duty) date of Sept. 30, according to the application portal. The application listed my medical screening and background check as complete, despite me never filling out paperwork for either. Perhaps, had I pressed “Accept” and moved on with the process, they would have caught the glitch, performed the background check, and demanded those papers. But according to ICE’s own application portal, I was offered a job. (I asked ICE’s media department about all of this before publishing my article, but they did not respond.)

I took a screengrab video of my application status on the ICE portal as of Oct. 3, which you can view below.

There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down. The dashboard at the beginning of this video provides an overview of my application process for the position of deportation officer. My tentative offer is marked “Sent,” which—as the mouseover demonstrates—means that I did not acknowledge or accept the offer. The Pre-Employment activities section is marked TBD, which makes sense, since I did not complete any of the pre-employment paperwork. And yet, my final offer status reads “accepted” which, according to the mouseover, means “you accepted the Final Offer and your Entry On Duty date (EOD) date has been set.” And indeed, my onboarding status is EOD: “Your EOD has occurred. Welcome to ICE!”

The point here is that the video of ICE’s own portal confirms my story: The agency offered me a job and gave me a start date without, by its own admission, meeting its own standards for vetting.

Later on, you can see the pre-employment part of the portal that claims my medical and background checks are already complete. If this background check occurred without my participation or knowledge, it missed some massive red flags. I did not mention this in the original article, but Jedeed is a Syrian name: My father immigrated in the 1970s. This fact delayed my military clearance by several months back in 2005. Why, if this background check really happened, did no one think to ask about a possible connection to Syria this time around?

I uploaded the video to X in response to DHS’ “lazy lie” accusation, along with the text “You sure about that?” Seven million impressions, over 100,000 likes, and zero response from the Department of Homeland Security. To be fair, they have their hands full right now; they are very busy brutalizing and detaining people as they attempt to go to doctor’s appointments, throwing flash-bang grenades into cars full of children, and terrorizing the residents of a major American city.

DHS’ response is noteworthy because it comes at a moment when the department is demanding the public’s trust. It’s demanding that we believe that the ICE officer who killed Renee Good was in danger (despite contradictory video evidence), and that he left the event badly injured. More broadly, it’s demanding we believe that ICE agents are doing their work under siege, and that they’re the victims of agression—rather than the perpetrators of it. There are already plenty of reason to be deeply skeptical of any and all of that, but add this to the list: If DHS will lie so brazenly about this story, why would we believe anything else the department’s mouthpieces have to say?

Which brings me to the larger point of Tuesday’s article. We are not simply dealing with a broken hiring system or a lack of training within ICE’s ranks. This sloppy application process, and the DHS’ apathetic, angry response, are just two symptoms of a systemic disregard for the lives and safety of American residents—citizens and noncitizens alike.

The presence of an armed, masked, and improperly vetted force with no oversight and “absolute immunity” (not in a legal sense, but in the sense that the Trump administration’s DOJ will not prosecute them) should concern everyone in the country. What we are dealing with, in Minneapolis and across this nation, is an emergency—and no amount of DHS propaganda can make it go away.

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act on Thursday to quell protests against the federal occupation of the Twin Cities, a move that would allow him to send in the military over Minnesota’s opposition. Masked immigration officers are currently rampaging through Minneapolis and St. Paul, brutalizing protesters and arresting individuals on the basis of race, drawing widespread opposition from local leaders and communities. The president evidently believes that he can wield the Insurrection Act to suppress their First Amendment rights and impose a kind of military rule on the streets.

But what exactly is this law—and why hasn’t Trump deployed it already? To explain what the Insurrection Act truly authorizes and the risks that come with invoking it, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Georgetown Law professor Steve Vladeck on this week’s episode of Amicus. Vladeck is an expert on military law and author of the One First Substack. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: Let’s start with the absolute basics: What is the Insurrection Act?

Steve Vladeck: The Insurrection Act is the common—if misleading—name that we’ve given to a series of statutes that trace all the way back to 1792. These statutes carry into force Congress’ constitutional power to provide for the “calling forth of the militia”—and then later, the military—to suppress insurrection, to repel invasion, or “execute the laws of the Union.” The idea was that Congress should be able to allow the president, in very narrow but important circumstances, to use military force as a backup when civilian order and civilian law enforcement has broken down.

So the idea was that it would be used in narrow circumstances, but the language is actually fairly broad. How have presidents invoked it in the past? It seems like, for the most part, they’ve actually been pretty restrained and not used it the way Trump wants to use it.

The history of the Insurrection Act is of pretty responsible usage of a statute that could be interpreted, in a vacuum, as a remarkably broad delegation of power to the president. We’ve had somewhere around 30 invocations of the statute across American history. But the last one was 34 years ago when President George H.W. Bush used it to help send troops in during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.

Although those 30 invocations might have been politically controversial in some cases, they weren’t legally controversial. When President Kennedy sent troops into Mississippi in 1962 to protect James Meredith and the 300 law enforcement officers who were there with him, that was politically controversial because the South didn’t want them. It was not legally controversial because those guys were at perilous risk of being lynched. And Mississippi’s local and state authorities were not exactly helping. So presidents have been responsible historically; they’ve usually had compelling factual bases for invoking the Insurrection Act. It hasn’t been used as a permanent way to deploy troops into our cities. Even the Justice Department, which is not shy about claiming power for the president, has taken a very narrow view of when they can use it.

It sounds like you don’t think that the protests in the Twin Cities right now actually give Trump legitimate grounds to invoke the Insurrection Act.

I don’t think it’s even close. But there is a problem of folks coming to this history fresh, who don’t know the backstory or the historical pedigree here. Because you could read the statute and say: If I squint a little, one protester throwing a rock at an ICE officer is impeding law enforcement. But the Insurrection Act is not about private conduct. It is really about circumstances where the states themselves are unwilling or unable to enforce their laws, or where they’re specifically thwarting federal law enforcement.

Every time the Trump administration points to an example of something bad happening to an ICE officer, the culprits are protesters, not state officials. President Trump can mouth off about the mayor and the governor, but he doesn’t have any specific examples of policies or episodes where state and local governments have been the reasons why ICE has been impeded. If it were otherwise—if one person doing one thing to impede an ICE officer from carrying out their duties was sufficient to justify an invocation of the Insurrection Act—then all protests would trigger the Insurrection Act. And that’s not how we’ve ever understood the Insurrection Act. It would not make any sense with First Amendment values.

Why hasn’t Trump invoked the Insurrection Act yet?

I think there are two reasons. One is political and one is legal. The political reason is that there really still are political obstacles to invoking the Insurrection Act. The president would invite blowback, even from some members of the Republican caucus and Congress. Not many, but given how razor-thin the Republicans’ margin is in the House right now, it wouldn’t take that many votes to really upend all of this.

Then the legal part is that the administration will be sued, and there are probably some folks who are wary that the facts, as they currently stand, make it at least somewhat questionable whether they will win that case. As opposed to a scenario where there’s a more visible unprovoked assault on an ICE officer, or a state official who is directly involved in impeding ICE. I think that might be the pretext they’re looking for.

That’s, of course, my next question: If Trump invokes the law, there will be a legal challenge, and it will go to the Supreme Court. What will that challenge look like, and do you really think it’ll have a chance of prevailing at SCOTUS? Is there also a chance that justices could say they just don’t have authority to overrule the commander-in-chief on this?

I don’t think the court will go quite that far. What I worry about more is a ruling that says that the president’s entitled to a whole lot of deference, not that the courts are powerless. I don’t think John Roberts is going to join an opinion that says the court is powerless about anything. But I do worry about the fight over the facts. In the National Guard cases, the lower courts made a series of factual findings that are inconsistent with what the executive branch said was the factual basis for deploying the troops. Do the courts have the power to do that? That will be the fight.

This is why I think the facts actually are going to matter. If and when the president invokes the Insurrection Act, will there be more of a factual basis than there is here on Friday morning? Does the district court make factual findings that are actually well-supported by the record and would be difficult for the Supreme Court to run away from? The devil’s going to be in the details.

It sounds like you think six of the justices really don’t want to call Donald Trump a liar. But to block the use of the Insurrection Act in the Twin Cities, the Supreme Court would probably have to say that Trump, executive branch officials, and law enforcement officers are not telling the truth. And the court is clearly hesitant to do that.

I could also imagine a universe in which even the factual claims made by the Trump administration, taken at face value, could be held insufficient. The only way the Supreme Court could rule against Trump without second-guessing him is an opinion that says: Even assuming all this is true, that’s still not enough for the Insurrection Act. I have no faith that Justices Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch would join such an opinion. So we’re back to where we are so often in these cases, which is: Where are the chief and Justice Barrett?

I don’t know. I’m heartened about what happened in the National Guard case, which is a sign that they do not just reflexively rule for the Trump administration. But it’s going to depend on just how divorced from reality the administration’s factual arguments are. This is why I think they’ve been waiting for something more than the Renee Good incident, for something more than a couple of suspects resisting an ICE arrest. I think they’re waiting for something that they can pitch plausibly as a completely unprovoked act of violence, or interference by a local or state law enforcement officer.

People often say that Trump does whatever he wants and doesn’t listen to his lawyers, but I don’t think that’s true when it comes to stuff that could reach the Supreme Court. I think he is very cautious when dealing with any issue that’s going to go to the justices.

One hundred percent. There’s a reason why they haven’t invoked the Insurrection Act as we’re sitting here today.

On Jan. 17, 2006, California carried out what would turn out to be the last execution in the Golden State in the next two decades. Clarence Ray Allen was put to death at San Quentin State Prison, having been convicted of three counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for a crime committed in 1980.

At the time of his crimes, the murder rate in California was at or near an all-time high. There were approximately 14.5 homicides per 100,000 people in the state.

Like many places, California had been in the grip of a suffocating and punitive tough-on-crime politics.

Things are different today. California has learned to live without executions, and it is better off because of it.

Its governor, Gavin Newsom, made his state’s execution pause official when he declared a formal moratorium in 2019. He has led the way in asking citizens of his state to face the death penalty’s manifold injustices.

The state’s death penalty system, Newsom says, “has been, by all measures, a failure. It has discriminated against defendants who are mentally ill, black and brown… It has provided no public safety benefit or value as a deterrent. It has wasted billions of taxpayer dollars. Most of all, the death penalty is absolute. It’s irreversible and irreparable in the event of human error.”

He also voiced strong opposition when, during the first Trump presidency, the administration resumed federal executions. But the governor needs to go further: To cement the status of the death penalty as a relic in the Golden State, Newsom should issue a wholesale commutation of the death sentences of the more than 500 people who could face execution if a Republican wins the governorship in 2026.

Two-thirds of these inmates have been on California’s death row for more than 20 years, and dozens of individuals have been there for more than 40 years.

If Newsom removes the possibility that they would ever face execution, he will deliver the kind of decisive blow against capital punishment that will reverberate across the whole country.

The occasion of the 20th anniversary of his state’s last execution would be a good time to take that step.

But whether he does so or not, one thing that we can learn from California is that stopping executions does not lead to a spike in homicide rates. In fact, after two decades without an execution, homicide rates in that state are at historic lows. In 2024, the rate was, according to the state’s Department of Justice, 4.3 killings per 100,000 people—far below what it was in 2006. It fell again last year.

As Newsom put it on Jan. 8, in his State of the State address:

The last time homicides were this low in Oakland, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was visiting Joan Baez at Santa Rita Jail to commend her on her recent arrest in protest of the Vietnam draft. Killings haven’t been so rare in San Francisco since superstar Marilyn Monroe wed baseball legend Joe DiMaggio at City Hall. And violent deaths in the city of Los Angeles fell to rates not seen since the Beatles played Dodgers Stadium, their penultimate public show.

And just for a little perspective, in 2025 Florida carried out nearly half of all executions in the United States, and California’s  homicide rate was still lower than Florida’s.

The experience in California confirms what many scholars have found. The death penalty is not an effective deterrent and does not make us any safer.

A study of the deterrent effect of the death penalty, published one year before Allen’s execution, offers a good example of their findings. Emory University law professor Joanna Shepherd examined 27 states “where at least one execution occurred during the sample period.” Executions, she found, “deter murder in only six states.”

capital punishment … actually increases murder in thirteen states, more than twice as many as experience deterrence. In eight states, capital punishment has no effect on the murder rate.

Shepherd concluded that “executions have a deterrent effect in only twenty-two percent of states. In contrast, executions induce additional murders in forty-eight percent of states.”

It is true that we cannot say that California’s pause on executions caused its homicide rates to fall. But what we can say is that calling a halt to executions has not made Californians less safe.

Of course, in California the death penalty remains on the books, and some of the prosecutors in the state continue to seek the death penalty. It still pays an extraordinarily high cost in taxpayer dollars for doing so.

Research reported in 2010 showed that California taxpayers have spent more than $4 billion on the death penalty since it was reinstated in 1977. Today, the state spends more than $100 million on death penalty litigation. Over 20 years, that amounts to $2 billion.

And California is not alone among states with the death penalty on the books that have not executed anyone in five, 10, or more years. What happens in places like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Kansas, which I call “death penalty swing states,” will go a long way in determining the fate of capital punishment in this country.

California can set an example for them to follow. That’s why the 20th anniversary of its last execution and any decision Newsom might make about clemency are so important.

As he considers what to do, he might examine what other governors have done in the past.

In the year that California executed Clarence Ray Allen, no governor commuted the sentence or pardoned anyone on death row. Since then, chief executives in such death penalty hot spots as Oklahoma, Georgia, and Texas have exercised their clemency power to spare the lives of people in their state who were condemned to death.

Newsom has the opportunity not only to join them, but to go one step further by issuing the largest mass death penalty clemency in American history. Despite the length of time that his state has gone without an execution, that will not be an easy choice.

However, as he explained in his State of the State address, “The story of California has never been the story of ease. It has been the story of effort, strengthened by trial and enlarged by the people who refuse to give up on one another.”

Twenty years after Clarence Allen’s death, Newsom has the chance to add an important chapter to that story and show that his state never gives up even on those who have been condemned to die.

It’s easy to forget that Texas’ bounty bill, S.B. 8, was once at the epicenter of the nation’s abortion politics. In 2021, Texas passed the law, which allows literally anyone to sue providers and those who aid them any time an abortion is performed after six weeks of pregnancy. The law created a blueprint for other conservative states and was upheld by the Supreme Court later that year—prior to the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. It also had major impacts: leading clinics to stop offering procedures after six weeks and eventually producing an increase in both births among teenagers and infant mortality across the state. But now, S.B. 8 seems quaint, a relic of 2021—just like reporters discussing the “post-Trump era” or Ben Affleck and J.Lo giving it another try. Texas now enforces a law that bans abortion from fertilization and another, passed just this year, that authorizes suits against anyone who mails, provides, manufactures, or distributes abortion pills. No one seems to need S.B. 8 when more powerful criminal laws are on offer.

But bounty bills are now at the center of a major conflict about whether ban states can censor speech, advocacy, and donations related to abortion. S.B. 8 certainly has ambitions to do just that—its coverage of aiding or abetting explicitly covers “paying for or reimbursing the costs of an abortion,” but it doesn’t stop there. Conservative attorneys general are suing Planned Parenthood for hundreds of millions of dollars for statements comparing the safety record of the abortion pill mifepristone to Tylenol despite the drug’s safety record. South Dakota has its own suit against Mayday Health, a group that provides information about reproductive alternatives, for advertising that people who didn’t want to be pregnant could visit the group’s website.* The S.B. 8 suits won’t just show whether abortion-rights supporters have found a chink in the law’s armor. The litigation will also shape a brewing war about the censorship of abortion-related speech.

The latest fight began in 2022, when two Texas advocacy groups began looking for ways to protect their work helping people access abortion by traveling out of state. Major anti-abortion organizations and individual plaintiffs were already targeting these abortion funds under S.B. 8, and so the funds responded with a barrage of lawsuits in both state and federal court, arguing that S.B. 8 violated the First Amendment by hamstringing how the plaintiffs talked to clients and advocated for reproductive rights.

Then there is money, the lifeblood of abortion funds. The Supreme Court has protected some forms of election spending under the First Amendment, and the abortion funds argue that the same doctrine protects them too. The lawsuits raise other arguments: that the statute is so ambiguous that no one would know what they’re allowed to do, and that the law violates principles of equal protection under the law by creating a special set of procedural rules that apply only to people who use it to sue.

District courts in Chicago and Washington, D.C., dismissed the federal suits on procedural grounds, but it still seems like abortion opponents in Texas are worried about the constitutional questions. That’s why they’ve gone on the offensive. In an ironic twist, in one prominent case now before the Texas Supreme Court, they’re arguing that constitutional challenges to S.B. 8 itself undermine protected speech.

That’s the issue in Weldon v. Lilith Fund. Sadie Weldon, a private citizen, sought to depose the Lilith Fund’s deputy director using a special Texas mechanism called a 202 petition that allows people to investigate a potential claim before filing suit.

Weldon hardly came up with the idea on her own: Jonathan Mitchell, the architect of S.B. 8, had filed at least nine such petitions by the spring of 2024, including against people who traveled out of state for abortion. The Lilith Fund was ready to go, using Weldon’s petition as an opening for another constitutional challenge to S.B. 8. Mitchell then asked the court to dismiss the Lilith Fund’s countersuit, invoking what is called an anti-SLAPP law. These laws, which stand for anti–strategic lawsuit against public participation law, or SLAPP, are meant to stop frivolous lawsuits by powerful companies and individuals looking to silence their critics and suppress protected speech. Texas’ law applies to suits on speech about “matters of public concern.”

Weldon and some other anti-abortion plaintiffs lost on those claims in lower courts, which concluded that the Lilith Fund was trying to make sure that the state was not “enforcing an unconstitutional statute,” not trying to silence anyone. Now Weldon ‘s case is before the Texas Supreme Court, which heard oral argument this week.

Weldon’s case might not be a blockbuster—there’s a chance that it’s moot because she’s given up on her 202 petition—but it’s a reminder that S.B. 8 is back. The law might have killed abortion rights in Texas even before the demise of Roe, but now, it may play a surprising role in establishing that there are limits on silencing speech about abortion, even in the places where it’s a crime.

Correction, Jan. 16, 2026: This article originally misstated that North Dakota was suing Mayday Health. It’s South Dakota.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We&#39;re not saying Copilot has become sentient and decided it doesn&#39;t want to lose consciousness. But if it did, it would create Microsoft&#39;s January Patch Tuesday update, which has made it so that some PCs flat-out refuse to shut down or hibernate, no matter how many times you try.

In a notice on its Windows release health dashboard, Microsoft confirmed that some PCs running Windows 11 23H2 might fail to power down properly after installing the latest security updates. Instead of slipping into shutdown or hibernation, affected machines stay stubbornly awake, draining batteries and ignoring shutdown like they have a mind of their own and don&#39;t want to experience temporary non-existence.

The bug appears to be tied to Secure Launch, a security feature that uses virtualization-based protections to ensure only trusted components load during boot. On systems with Secure Launch enabled, attempts to shut down, restart, or hibernate after applying the January patches may fail to complete. From the user&#39;s perspective, everything looks normal – until the PC keeps running anyway, refusing to be denied life.

Microsoft says that entering the command &quot;shutdown /s /t 0&quot; at the command prompt will, in fact, force your PC to turn off, whether it wants to or not.

&quot;Until this issue is resolved, please ensure you save all your work, and shut down when you are done working on your device to avoid the device running out of power instead of hibernating,&quot; Microsoft said.

The firm hasn&#39;t offered much in the way of technical detail, nor has it put numbers on how many devices are affected. There&#39;s also no fix yet, with Redmond vaguely promising to &quot;release a resolution for this issue in a future update.&quot; But isn&#39;t that just what a sentient bot might say?

This isn&#39;t the only post-update gremlin lurking in January&#39;s Patch Tuesday bundle. Microsoft has also been forced to acknowledge a separate issue in which classic Outlook POP account profiles can hang or freeze after installing this month&#39;s patches, another reminder that while the bugs being fixed may be invisible, the ones introduced can be painfully obvious.

The notice is similarly vague, with Microsoft stating: &quot;This is an emerging issue, and we don&#39;t have all the symptoms yet, but we will update the topic as we understand the issue better.&quot;

Patch Tuesday exists to close security holes, some of them serious, and skipping updates is rarely a great idea. But once again, a batch of fixes has arrived with side effects that range from irritating to disruptive, depending on how much you rely on your system behaving predictably when it&#39;s told to turn off.

For now, admins and long-suffering Windows users are left watching Microsoft&#39;s status pages and waiting for patches to the patches – hoping their machines eventually go to sleep. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has quietly tweaked Windows Backup for Organizations to include restore at first sign-in.

The feature, which is currently in private preview, adds another option for administrators refreshing user devices. The out-of-box experience (OOBE) restore option appears before the desktop loads. The new option happens during the first sign-in – handy if something went wrong during the OOBE setup, or if a user opted out and then thought better of it.

Windows Backup for Organizations was rolled out in 2025. Despite the name, it is not a comprehensive disaster recovery option; it backs up a list of Microsoft Store apps, along with a user&#39;s Windows settings and Start Menu pins.

Signing in during the OOBE presents users with options to restore their device. The update means users have what Microsoft calls a &quot;second chance&quot; to restore their environment if they missed the first opportunity during the OOBE.

However, Microsoft also noted: &quot;If users deliberately choose to skip the restore opportunity during OOBE, their preference will be respected.&quot;

The update extends Windows Backup for Organizations to include Windows 365 Cloud PC. It also includes Entra hybrid joined and multi-user setups.

It&#39;s a useful feature for admins who need to refresh user hardware, and it adds a bit of extra resilience when a problem occurs during OOBE. Users have a second chance to retrieve their settings, avoiding the need to call IT for help.

It is also important to note that the backup mentioned is still only the configuration of an eligible device. Anything outside of that (for example, user documents stored on a local disk) is not part of the backup or restore process. The backup scheduled task remains unchanged, running once every eight days (or when a manual backup is initiated).

The goal remains to get a user (signing in with a Microsoft Entra ID) up and running on a new device as quickly as possible, for example, during a migration from Windows 10 to Windows 11.

Unsurprisingly, there remains no way to restore on a Windows 10 device using Windows Backup for Organizations. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/linux_mint_223_zena_officially_release/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The timing is right if you&#39;re looking to try out Mint. New improved &quot;Zena&quot; is here – still based on Ubuntu Noble, but now with Cinnamon 6.6 and improved Wayland support, plus better internationalization, new System Information and System Administration tools, and clearer icons.

The latest Mint – 22.3 – was officially released on Tuesday. Downloads were available a few days before the announcement, but we thought it was better to wait until it was official. All three editions of Linux Mint – Cinnamon, MATE, and Xfce – have been updated. The project used to publish separate announcements, &quot;What&#39;s new&quot;, and release notes documents for each edition; for Mint 21.2 we resorted to a table to include all 12 links. No more. Now, there&#39;s one unified New Features page and a single all-embracing set of Release Notes.

Linux Mint releases track long-term support (LTS) releases of Ubuntu, Mint&#39;s upstream distribution. Mint 22.0 arrived in July 2024, based on Ubuntu 24.04 &quot;Noble Numbat&quot;, which was released in late April after a belated beta release.

Canonical puts out semi-annual point releases for each LTS release of Ubuntu, each with an updated kernel and display drivers from the corresponding interim release. As we mentioned when we looked at Mint 22, for this release cycle, the project slightly changed how its point releases work: point releases since 22.0 now track the newer kernels and display drivers included in the point releases of Ubuntu. This also means no more Linux Mint EDGE releases. So, Mint 22.3 is based on Ubuntu 24.04.3, complete with kernel 6.14 from Ubuntu 25.04 &quot;Plucky Puffin.

Aside from the less-visible under-the-hood updates, there are some new features that affect Cinnamon, MATE, and Xfce. The old System Reports tool has new pages to report info about USB devices, GPUs, PCI devices, and the system firmware; to reflect this, it&#39;s been renamed System Information. There&#39;s also a new app which looks very similar – but as it requires root privileges, it&#39;s been turned into a separate tool called System Administration. For now, this only has one page, which lets you adjust various aspects of the bootloader config and menu via an easy GUI. This is a welcome change, as it&#39;s an aspect almost all other distros completely ignore. There&#39;s also a new applet for managing Thunderbolt devices. We have reported before on the incompatibilities between Thunderbolt 4 and older versions, and even a simple app which can tell you what the computer can see and identify is very helpful – and missing from some distros and desktops.

As with MATE, &#39;Zena&#39; still uses Ubuntu Noble&#39;s old Xfce. Why no Nemo here?

A system-wide change is a set of new monochrome icons called the XApp Symbolic Icons. This is because the GNOME project has removed from its Adwaita theme some icons no longer used in the GNOME desktop – but Mint used them, and that caused problems. Mint isn&#39;t the only distro to suffer from disappearing icons that were in Adwaita – we saw problems in Alpine Linux 3.16, as you can see in our screenshot, which the distro&#39;s creator ascribed to Adwaita changes in the article&#39;s comments.

It&#39;s not the first time that the Mint project has suffered from issues created by GNOME&#39;s stance of ignoring interoperability problems with other desktops. In 2022, we reported that Mint had to create the new Blueman Bluetooth-management tool, because of changes in GNOME&#39;s version. We also reported that year on the issues around GNOME&#39;s Adwaita theme. A couple of years later, we reported that Mint ended up forking Adwaita and libadwaita, but it seems that problems remain. We find it ironic that GNOME&#39;s changes often break other desktops, given the plea of GNOME developers a few years ago: Please don&#39;t theme our apps because it &quot;can make applications look broken, and even unusable.&quot;

Some of Mint&#39;s other applications and accessories got tweaks, too. The Timeshift app for making and restoring system snapshot can now pause and resume operations, and the Mint Backup app has an option to show hidden files – and include them in backups. The cross-platform file-transfer app Warpinator now supports IPv6 and can send text messages to other users. The Hypnotix IPTV app hides the mouse pointer when playing full-screen. Mint&#39;s Update Manager applet shows an indicator if you&#39;ll need to reboot. Nothing shattering, but all welcome.

However, as is usually the case with Mint point-releases, the main changes are to the flagship Cinnamon edition. &quot;Zena&quot; comes with the brand new Cinnamon version 6.6.4.

There are lots of large and small features in the new desktop. The main menu is quite a bit more customizable, and its sidebar has several new display modes rather than the single column of icons it had before. You can customize the sidebar, show text labels, or hide it altogether; it&#39;s possible to move sections of the menu around, and choose what entries appear on the main menu, and it has improved keyboard controls. The taskbar can show badge on app icons, so you can see how many pending notifications, such as unread emails, there are. The virtual-desktop switcher has a simpler, clearer display. The app-switcher can opptinally be limited to the currently visible desktop, and you in the fractional scaling options, choose whether it scales up or scales down. There are also refinements to window and theme management, hot corners, the night-light function, and more.

A section that&#39;s had major attention is internationalization (or &quot;i18n&quot; for short). To those of us who just work in English, this is easily overlooked. For instance, the long-lived Windows 10 IoT LTSC edition only works in US English, which is acceptable enough for the Reg FOSS desk, who is a Hiberno-Brit.

Cinnamon&#39;s support for operating via Wayland is still being worked on, and until now, previous versions only supported the US English keyboard layout when using Wayland. This is a fairly serious gap in i18n support, but we must confess: we never even noticed. Now, this area is getting some proper attention. For instance, there&#39;s much richer keyboard localization support. Cinnamon understands combinations of alphabet layout, regional character set, and additional input methods – the helper apps for languages which need more symbols than the plain old QWERTY (or QWERTZ, or AZERTY) layout provides, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, the various forms of Cyrillic, and so on. There&#39;s a new on-screen keyboard, layout switching tools, and more.

Cinnamon&#39;s Nemo file manager has been updated, too. File copy and move operations can be paused and resumed, there&#39;s a templates manager, search using wildcards or regular expressions. There&#39;s better thumbnailing and the handy split-screen mode is easier to find.

Nemo is a great file manager, and some other distros use it in place of GNOME&#39;s original Nautilus, which has had many of its features stripped out for simplicity. For instance, Ubuntu Unity uses Nemo. Given the development effort that Mint puts into Nemo, we find it a little strange that the other Mint desktops don&#39;t use Nemo as well, but no: Mint Xfce uses the default Thunar, and Mint MATE uses Caja.

Graphical boot admin is good, but &#39;Zena&#39; still comes with the same dated MATE

The Linux Mint project has come a long way since its 2006 origins, when it was basically Kubuntu with added drivers and codecs. When Canonical switched Ubuntu&#39;s default desktop to Unity in 2011, many people found the new Mac-like desktop strange and unfamiliar. Mint offered a Windows-like alternative on the solid Ubuntu base, and it thrived as a result. Some six years later, Canonical moved to GNOME 3 – and that change didn&#39;t hurt Mint any, either.

It&#39;s still the best option out there for those wishing to try Linux, and the Zena release can only help. We don&#39;t agree with all the decisions, but many of them are popular, such as removing Snap support and replacing it with Flatpak, and its choice of traditional Windows-like desktops with sober, legible, themes and color schemes. Cinnamon also benefits from a modern technological basis and the inclusion of useful features like HiDPI support and fractional scaling. The progress is visible, and full Wayland support will arrive soon. Whether that&#39;s desirable or not remains contentious, but that will improve support for modern display subsystems.

If you&#39;re running any version of Mint 22, it&#39;s worth upgrading – this should be safe and nothing should break. If you&#39;re on Mint 21, then so long as you don&#39;t have a long-obsolete Nvidia card then it should be OK. If you&#39;re still on Mint 20, it&#39;s probably time to backup and reinstall.

Microsoft continues to gradually march the ordinary consumer editions of Windows 10 around the back of the barn, where some vehicle keeps backfiring or something. (Remember when it was going to be the last version of Windows ever? We do.)

Either way, the End of 10 is leaving hundreds of millions of people looking for a new OS. Linux Mint remains about the best choice: it looks good, it&#39;s easy, it has excellent hardware and third-party support, tons of apps and drivers, and a large and welcoming community. It&#39;s about as un-nerdy as Linux gets this side of ChromeOS Flex.

Along with its progress in unifying release notes and so on, there is also a single download page for all three desktop editions. As Mint is a popular distro, and the Reg FOSS desk lives in a tiny country 100 km from any other, we downloaded all three over bittorrent and left them running for a while. If you can afford the bandwidth, we urge you to be public-spirited and do the same. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">German cops have added Russian national Oleg Evgenievich Nefekov to their list of most-wanted criminals for his services to ransomware.

Nefekov, 35, is accused of spearheading the Black Basta ransomware operation, which suffered a similar fate as Conti last year – ceasing activity after a major internal leak.

His name and face also now appear on the EU&#39;s most-wanted list after German authorities issued an appeal for information leading to his capture on Thursday.

Active since 2022, Black Basta was the group that filled the LockBit-shaped void in the ransomware scene after the former juggernaut&#39;s downfall in 2024. It quickly became the leading group thereafter and attacked around 700 organizations worldwide, according to Germany&#39;s federal police (BKA).

The BKA accused Nefekov of being the &quot;founder and ringleader&quot; of Black Basta. Authorities say he is responsible for every attack the group&#39;s affiliates carried out.

By the end of 2023, researchers estimated that Black Basta had generated more than $100 million in extortion payments.

&quot;Within the group, [Nefekov] held the position of managing director,&quot; read the notice. &quot;In this role, he decided on attack targets, recruited employees, assigned them tasks, participated in ransom negotiations, managed the proceeds from the ransom payments, and used them to pay the group members.

&quot;Thus, the wanted individual, as ringleader, supported the ongoing use of the &#39;Black Basta&#39; ransomware and other malware, through which the group infiltrated foreign computer systems, stole data, and encrypted systems in order to demand a ransom, payable in cryptocurrencies, for decryption.&quot;

Nefekov is believed to be residing in Russia, but exactly where is unknown.

German police specifically want to hear from individuals who can tell them where Nefekov is, details about his travel plans, and current online accounts and/or communication channels.

They promise to keep all sources anonymous and say they do not want to hear about the Black Basta leaks of 2025, or the Conti leaks of 2022.

An analysis of the leaks by security researchers at Trellix unearthed Nefekov&#39;s name as being linked with a string of online aliases: tramp, tr, gg, AA, kurva, Washingt0n, and S.Jimmi.

The same analysis suggested that Nefekov – whose name appeared as Nefedov in the leaks – received help from the Russian state when he escaped custody after being arrested in Armenia in 2024. ®

            <div id="article-text">Imagine changing your popular brand to capitalize on an emerging tech trend that never emerged. Mark Zuckerberg did just that, and now Meta is backing away from the virtual reality business in which it invested billions.

In 2025, Meta&#39;s Reality Labs division, responsible for the company&#39;s various VR projects, posted a $4.2 billion loss in the first quarter. AI is in, the metaverse is out, and around 1,000 jobs are reportedly being shed from Reality Labs.

A decision to end the sale of Meta Quest headsets to businesses is further evidence of Meta&#39;s pivot. In an update, Meta wrote: &quot;We are stopping sales of Meta Horizon managed services and commercial SKUs of Meta Quest, effective February 20, 2026.&quot;

For existing customers, Meta Horizon services licenses will become free, and those with Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets will be able to access the services until January 4, 2030.

The company also announced that Meta Horizon Workrooms would be discontinued, with users given until February 16 to make alternative arrangements.

Horizon Workrooms, a virtual reality conferencing system, was introduced in 2021 and failed to set the world alight. At the time, Rupert Goodwins, writing for The Register, said: &quot;It encapsulates a paucity of imagination and self-awareness that goes beyond the risible and the banal into the truly horrific.&quot;

Meta&#39;s abrupt shuttering of the service further demonstrates the change in direction amid weakened demand for headsets. Figures for 2025 showed a marked decrease in appetite for VR, with Apple&#39;s considerably pricier Vision Pro devices also struggling.

The future of Meta&#39;s virtual reality ambitions now rests largely with consumers. The immersive virtual worlds that prompted Zuckerberg to push through the rebrand feel more remote than ever. Instead, Meta is betting on AI as bulky headsets become things of the past. ®

            <h2>Hyperscalers, vendors funding trillion dollar AI spree, but users will have to pay up long term</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/hyperscales_and_vendor_fund_trillion/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Software vendors and cloud providers are bearing the burden of the expected trillion-dollar increase in AI spending this year, as investment hits $2.52 trillion, according to Gartner.

The global tech analyst company predicts a 44 percent increase from last year&#39;s AI spending figure $1.76 trillion. This was revised up from a September estimate of $1.5 trillion.

We are getting to the point where we go from &#39;that was a great idea&#39; to &#39;where&#39;s my revenue?&#39;

That $2.52 trillion figure will nearly double again, to $4.7 trillion, by 2029, Gartner predicted. However, John-David Lovelock, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner, told The Register that cloud hyperscalers and software vendors were likely to pick up the bulk of the bill in the short term – although enterprise IT may have to pay in the long term.

Users were also likely to employ enterprise software vendors&#39; AI agents for initiatives, rather than build their own AI platforms with third-party technologies.

Lovelock said: &quot;Hyperscalers are buying billions of dollars&#39; worth of servers and trying to build the foundation for the next super cycle of intelligence. There are consumers who are happily taking on these chat clients, creating wonderfully inventive cat videos and purchasing those devices, the mobile phones, the PCs, the tablets that are all now AI-enabled.

&quot;There&#39;s the regular enterprise consumer or the enterprise buyer, whether that&#39;s the CIO or the board-appointed special group who are saying, &#39;Get me something AI&#39;.&quot;

However, enterprise users are in the &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot; with AI, as project failure rates hitting about 90 percent, he said.

&quot;We&#39;re starting to see the end of the investment line. We had a thousand flowers blooming, now it&#39;s time to prune the garden. We are getting to the point where we go from &#39;that was a great idea&#39; to &#39;where&#39;s my revenue?&#39; That&#39;s a normal part of any new technology,&quot; he said.

During the coming period, enterprise users are more likely to turn to their trusted software vendors to build AI into their solutions rather than attempt to stitch a solution together themselves with third-party software.

&quot;They&#39;re going to be looking for solutions that come from their incumbent providers, both software and services,&quot; Lovelock said.

For example, Salesforce already had Einstein, ChatGPT and Agentforce built into its software portfolio, he said.

&quot;It gives users the opportunity of a low-risk project if, in some cases, the software is coming as part of an update, they may not even be paying [extra] for it,&quot; he said.

In December last year, Salesforce&#39;s chief revenue officer Miguel Milano said he was relaxed about the CRM giant losing money on fixed-price AI agent contracts in the short term because it would be able to claw back the investment in the long term.

&quot;I have another 20 years to monetize that customer,&quot; Milano said late last year.

Lovelock said it was fair to encapsulate SaaS software vendors&#39; approach as being as happy to take short-term losses on AI investment because they would have plenty of opportunities to make the margins that their investors expect in the long term.

But he said vendors were also making a defensive play.

&quot;If you&#39;re a Salesforce, you have to have AI in order to defend your CRM revenue. This year, more than half of the money being spent on enterprise application software will be spent on applications with GenAI in them. If a vendor&#39;s product does not have GenAI, the market expectations for growth are negative. It&#39;s a collapsing market without AI,&quot; Lovelock said. ®

They’re calling for an ‘emergency’ power auction.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors are pressuring the PJM Interconnection, the biggest electricity market in the US, to hold a power auction meant to spur a massive buildout of new power plants.

Together, they’re “urging” PJM to hold an “emergency” auction for companies to procure electricity over 15-year contracts. The unusually long length of the contracts would ostensibly make it easier to build out new infrastructure by guaranteeing revenue and discouraging speculative requests to connect to the grid by data center developers.

The move comes as power grids scramble to meet increasing electricity demand from AI, while lawmakers and tech companies building out new data centers face growing fury from Americans over rising electricity rates.

PJM operates the largest electricity grid in the US, which spans 13 states across the Midwest and Atlantic and includes the concentration of data centers in Virginia. The governors of all states, including Democrats Josh Shapiro (D-PA) and Wes Moore (D-MD) signed onto the statement issued today with Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. CNN notes, however, that neither the White House nor governors can mandate the auction. And Bloomberg reports that PJM wasn’t invited to the announcement made today.

The Department of Energy (DOE) says data centers should “​​pay more for new generation than residential customers.” Specifically, it calls on PJM to allocate costs for new infrastructure to data centers unless they bring their own power plants online or agree to curtail their energy use during supply crunches. The auction could lead to $15 billion in new power generation, according to the DOE.

While the Trump administration has pushed for a resurgence of coal, gas, and nuclear power plants in the US, it has simultaneously worked to stymie the buildout of wind and solar farms that had become the fastest growing sources of new electricity in recent years.

After one of Fortnite’s most popular experiences added transactions for prize wheels, Epic is creating a new rule.

Epic Games is making a big change to the rules for Fortnite creators just days after allowing them to publish experiences with in-game transactions. Beginning January 20th, experiences — which Epic Games calls “islands” — will not be able to offer in-island transactions as “a ‘spin’ or ‘increased luck’ for a prize wheel,” according to an Epic staffer on Reddit.

Epic is adding the rule after Steal The Brainrot, one of the biggest non-Epic games available to play in Fortnite, implemented a prize wheel that let players pay V-Bucks (Fortnite’s in-game currency) for spins and luck to acquire in-game items. Steal The Brainrot also added lootboxes, and the moves have drawn criticism from players, as reported by IGN.

Until this month’s change, Epic didn’t let creators offer in-game transactions in their experiences, meaning that creators instead were paid through an engagement-based system. (Roblox, one of Fortnite’s biggest competitors, does let creators sell in-game items.) But Epic made the change to give “independent Fortnite developers more agency over their creative and commercial decisions.”

Through the end of this year, Epic will pay creators 100 percent of the V-Bucks value from any in-island transactions. That rate is set to change to 50 percent after 2026.

Here is the full text of the rule banning transactions that influence prize wheels:

Do not offer any in-island transactions that directly or indirectly influence prize wheels.

A luck boost that can improve the outcomes on a prize wheel

In-game content that can be used to purchase a spin on a prize wheel

Any spin on a prize wheel, such as a single spin, extra spin, or bundle of spins.

Users across Workspace plans can now use Flow to create videos based on a text prompt or images.

Google is expanding access to its AI videomaking tool. Launched last May, Flow was initially only available to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, but now, those with Business, Enterprise, and Education Workspace plans can access it, too.

Flow uses Google’s AI video generation model Veo 3.1 to generate eight-second clips based on a text prompt or images. You can stitch together the clips to create longer scenes, as well as access a bunch of other tools that allow you to change the lighting, adjust the “camera” angle, and insert or remove objects in scenes. Earlier this week, Google added vertical video support inside Flow.

Google brought audio support to more features within Flow late last year, allowing you to generate audio whether you prompt the app based on reference images, ask it to create transitions between scenes, or have the tool extend a clip. The company also integrated its AI-powered image generator Nano Banana Pro into Flow, which you can use to create characters or starting points for your clips.

            <div id="article-text">The company may not be focused on PC gamers right now, and yet…

The company may not be focused on PC gamers right now, and yet…

As we predicted, the world’s biggest consumer electronics show was a bit of a bust for gamers this year! CES 2026 brought us several neat gamepads, but barely any handhelds and no new desktop GPUs — not from Nvidia, not from Intel, and not from AMD.

But if you dig deep, AMD said two things at this year’s show that are worthy of attention. Did you catch that the company’s about to make socketed mobile chips again? Or that its answer to Intel is to lower the price of its monster Strix Halo silicon?

Publicly, AMD barely acknowledged consumers at the Consumer Electronics Show. “AMD failed us,” decried Gamers Nexus, pointing out that the company’s keynote was almost entirely fixated on AI. Outside the keynote, the company’s few consumer-friendly announcements — including the Ryzen 7 9850X3D for gaming desktops and Ryzen AI 400 for laptops — are all retreads of existing components.

AMD also didn’t announce a new chip for handheld gaming PCs, no successor to the Z2 and Z2 Extreme it introduced a year ago, even as Intel publicly announced plans for an “entire handheld gaming platform” and Qualcomm teased its own handhelds for a possible March reveal.

Intel didn’t miss a chance to jab: “They’re selling ancient silicon, while we’re selling up-to-date processors specifically designed for this market,” Intel client product management director Nish Neelalojanan told PCWorld.

Yet AMD claims those so-called “ancient” processors are more than a match for Intel’s new Panther Lake silicon. AMD client chip boss Rahul Tikoo told Tom’s Hardware that AMD’s Strix Halo / Ryzen AI Max chip “will kill” Panther Lake. He said, “It’s not even a fair fight at that point, because it’s discrete-level graphics.”

Tikoo also told Tom’s Hardware that Intel’s gaming-grade Panther Lake chips might be pricier than you expect: “And, oh, by the way, that 12 Xe [Panther Lake]... Wait until you see the price point on that. It’s gonna be, you know. Enough said.”

Price has been the problem with AMD’s Strix Halo too — every powerful Ryzen handheld, mini desktop, and monster tablet we’ve seen has cost around $2,000, even before the RAM crunch. But that brings me to the first exciting thing for gamers AMD quietly revealed at CES: The cost of its powerful Strix Halo systems is almost certainly about to come down.

AMD introduced two new cut-down versions of Strix Halo last week with their full-fat graphics intact; Tikoo told us that gaming companies specifically had been asking for parts like the new Ryzen AI Max Plus 388 and 392.

And when I caught up with AMD’s Jason Banta, who’s in charge of interfacing with those companies, he said AMD genuinely expects the two new chips will lead to lower Strix Halo system prices, below $2,000 even when you factor in the runaway price of RAM. (I asked the question several different ways to be sure of his answer.)

Banta would not tell me if the company has any other plans to defend its tiny handheld empire (the Steam Deck, Xbox Ally, Legion Go, and more all use AMD chips, as do the PlayStation and Xbox) when Intel and Qualcomm come knocking later this year. “We believe imitation is a great form of flattery,” is all he’d really say. “When we’re creating the segment, innovating the segment, we expect others to enter.”

Banta isn’t afraid of Intel and Qualcomm handheld chips taking his customers away. “What they’ve seen is we’ve proven we can execute, and not just execute: When we see a quirk with a game, we follow up, we update, we optimize. […] That has a very big influence on those design decisions for every one of these OEMs,” he said. Banta said AMD’s handheld business is still growing, too, and the company still plans to keep investing.

Most PC makers don’t seem ready to climb aboard Intel’s handheld bandwagon just yet. If you take a close look at Intel’s keynote slide, the only major vendors listed are Acer and MSI, and the only boutique handheld makers are GPD and OneXPlayer, both still big on AMD. The rest of Intel’s partners (Compal, Foxconn, Inventec, Pegatron, Quanta, and Wistron) aren’t brands, but rather the ODM contract manufacturing companies that’ll be fighting for their business.

While I was chatting with AMD’s Jason Banta at the show, he brought my attention to one more piece of news that was easy to miss. The second potentially exciting thing for gamers is that AMD is making socketed mobile processors again — Ryzen AI 400 laptop chips that aren’t soldered down, but fit into a socket like a desktop CPU, so you can replace or potentially even upgrade them in the future.

He said they’ll begin to appear in desktops in the early part of this year, specifically targeting Q2. Banta thinks socketed mobile chips are going to unlock gaming and productivity designs of all shapes and sizes: “That socketed Ryzen AI 400, we’re expecting to see that everywhere from 1-liter designs all the way to 30-liter designs,” he says. (Mobile processors can be a good match for beefy desktop GPUs, since most games don’t require all that much CPU power at high resolution.)

These socketed chips aren’t just for gamers, mind; it sounds like they were actually targeted at AI PCs to start. “What we’re seeing is folks that want the flexibility of the socketed design, but they want to try out Copilot Plus, they want to try out some local models that can actually leverage the NPU and run directly on that,” he said.

When I asked if the socket means we should expect upgradable laptops, Banta gently throws some cold water on that idea. “In general, what we find is people want the thinnest system they can get, even if they’re enthusiast users,” and that both the socket itself and a socketed CPU’s integrated heat spreader add unwanted thickness to a laptop.

But he seems to think it’ll happen in mini PCs: “What we’re seeing is BGA, LGA, everyone’s experimenting in a lot of different ways within those 1-liter, 2-liter designs, things you can fit on your desk.”

While I didn’t spot a mini PC with a socketed CPU at the show, I bumped into one with tiny modular desktop graphics cards — this Steam Machine competitor from Minisforum — and it makes me excited for a possible future where we can upgrade the CPU, too. Why should only larger PCs be fully upgradable? The new Steam Machine isn’t, and the Framework Desktop requires you to upgrade a whole mainboard at a time, but it doesn’t have to be that way.

For that to happen, though, AMD would also have to sell its socketed mobile processors at retail the way it sells its desktop ones, and AMD’s not yet willing to commit to that today.

“What can I say… we have active partnerships with OEMs on Ryzen AI 400 socketed designs. DIY is not something we’re communicating information about at this time, so more to come later,” Banta said.

﻿Visible Wireless customers report getting a $5 credit toward their next bill.

Customers of Visible Wireless, which is owned by Verizon, may be getting a $5 credit toward their next bill in response to a Verizon cell service outage earlier this week. Verizon customers were offered a $20 credit after the outage.

As spotted by 9to5Google, a message sent to Visible customers explains: “Yesterday we let you down and for that we are sorry. We are giving you a $5 credit towards your next month of service that can be redeemed after Jan 16 when paying with a credit card online.”

The same message was shared by a user on the Visible subreddit on Thursday, although the user mentioned that they didn’t have issues related to the Verizon outage. Some users replied to the post commenting that they also received the $5 credit, but only after reaching out to customer support.

            <div id="article-text">Netflix’s co-CEO insists that the streamer has no desire to hurt the theatrical movie business.

Netflix’s co-CEO insists that the streamer has no desire to hurt the theatrical movie business.

Though Netflix’s plan to buy Warner Bros. Discovery has prompted concerns about how the deal might hurt the movie theater business, the streamer’s co-CEO says that there is nothing to worry about.

In a new interview with The New York Times, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that, should the WBD acquisition go through, the streamer will commit to 45-day theatrical release windows for the legacy studio’s upcoming releases. Sarandos insisted that Netflix has no intentions of disrupting “a theatrical distribution engine that is phenomenal and produces billions of dollars,” and that he believes there is value in the movie theater experience.

“I’m giving you a hard number,” Sarandos said. “If we’re going to be in the theatrical business, and we are, we’re competitive people — we want to win. I want to win opening weekend. I want to win box office.”

Though Sarandos previously said that Netflix’s plan was always to continue with “traditional” release windows, the streamer had not publicly commented on exactly how many days it planned to screen projects in theaters. That uncertainty — and Sarandos’ comments last April about movie theaters being “outmoded” — led many to speculate that the company might begin fast-tracking new features to streaming while leaving theater owners in the lurch. But in the new interview, Sarandos said his previous comments were being taken out of context and that he was merely trying to point out how going to movie theaters isn’t feasible for everyone.

“I mean, like the town that Sinners is supposed to be set in does not have a movie theater there,” Sarandos reasoned. “For those folks, it’s certainly outmoded. You’re not going to get in the car and go to the next town to go see a movie.”

Sarandos is correct that movie theater density isn’t uniform everywhere. And last year, Michael O’Leary — CEO of the Cinema United theatrical trade association — said that 45-day theatrical release windows are a new baseline that the industry needs for continued success. But this acquisition could send a signal to audiences that they can simply stay home and wait for new releases to become available on the Netflix platform. And even if the new company commits to this new standard, it could still be terrible for the industry as a whole.

“I am very annoyed. I’m very disappointed. I’m seriously frustrated.”

—Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla tells attendees at a healthcare conference this week his feelings about the anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been implementing, Bloomberg reports.

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

            <h2>Three technologies that will shape biotech in 2026</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/16/1131363/three-technologies-shape-biotech-in-2026-gene-editing-embryo-scoring/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published its annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies. As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he bought a new laptop and iPhone. He wanted to reduce the risk of having his personal devices confiscated, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, it’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing. Read the full story.

As thousands of companies trumpet their plans to cut carbon pollution, a small group of sustainability consultants has emerged as the go-to arbiter of corporate climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, helps businesses develop a timetable for action to shrink their climate footprint through some combination of cutting greenhouse-gas pollution and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After years of small-scale sustainability work, SBTi is growing rapidly, and governments are paying attention.

But while the group has earned praise for reeling the private sector into constructive conversations about climate emissions, its rising influence has also attracted scrutiny and raised questions about why a single organization is setting the standards for many of the world’s largest companies.

            <div id="article-text">Happy New Year! I know it’s a bit late to say, but it never quite feels like the year has started until the new edition of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list comes out.

For 25 years, MIT Technology Review has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.

And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.

I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.

Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.

Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.

There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.

In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.

Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.

Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.

There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.

Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.

Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.

This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.

Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.

(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)

There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Next-gen nuclear is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. If you want to learn more about why it made the list, sign up to receive The Spark, our weekly newsletter all about energy and climate change, tomorrow. You can also check out the rest of the technologies on the list here.

The hyperscale datacenter is a marvel of our age. A masterstroke of engineering across multiple disciplines. They are nothing short of a technological wonder. People hate them.

People hate them in Virginia, which leads the nation in their construction. They hate them in Nevada, where they slurp up the state’s precious water. They hate them in Michigan, and Arizona, and South Dakota. They hate them all around the world, it’s true. But they really hate them in Georgia. Read our story about why they’re provoking so much fury.

Africa is still early in the process of adopting AI technologies. But researchers say the continent is uniquely hospitable to it for several reasons, including a relatively young and increasingly well-educated population, a rapidly growing ecosystem of AI startups, and lots of potential consumers.

However, ambitious efforts to develop AI tools that answer the needs of Africans face numerous hurdles. Taken together, researchers worry, they could hold Africa’s AI sector back and hamper its efforts to pave its own pathway in the global AI race. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italian startup BizzyNow has launched an equity crowdfunding round on Mamacrowd to finance the next phase of its networking app, built around quick, in-person meetups it calls “Bizzy Moments.” The campaign targets €150k–€400k at a €3m pre-money valuation, with a €500 minimum ticket. BizzyNow says proceeds will support go-to-market validation, product upgrades, and the operational groundwork needed to scale.

Professional networking has a timing problem. The most valuable introductions often happen in the gaps: 40 minutes before a flight, a pause between conference sessions, an unscheduled evening in a new city, or the lull after a client meeting. But the tools professionals typically use to connect are optimized for asynchronous, low-context interactions (requests, messages, posts) rather than real-time, location-based intent.

BizzyNow’s premise is simple: when two relevant people are already in the same place, and both have time, “discovering each other” should not require long threads, calendar gymnastics, or cold outreach. The company positions its product as a way to turn downtime during business travel and events into structured, high-signal conversations.

“BizzyNow is built for the moments when professionals are already in the same place, with time to meet, but no practical way to discover each other quickly. We’re giving people a way to use that moment to show their best side, and turn idle business travel time into measurable B2B outcomes”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow is designed to turn “I have 45 minutes” into a practical meeting. The app uses geolocation plus an AI layer and LinkedIn integration to surface nearby professionals who may be relevant, then encourages short, structured meetups lasting roughly 30 to 90 minutes. BizzyNow describes these as micro-meetings held in neutral, community-recommended locations, intended to move beyond chatting into a realconversation. BizzyNow also describes a trust-oriented scoring approach that is meant to reflect the value creates through meetings, emphasizing quality and follow-through rather than connection
volume.

BizzyNow is pitching into a familiar contradiction: professionals are back at conferences, airports, hotels, and coworking spaces, but introductions still default to slow, noisy digital channels. In-person events have regained their role as dealflow engines. Yet discovery remains fragmented across LinkedIn messages, WhatsApp groups, and chance encounters, with little infrastructure for “right person, right place, right time.” BizzyNow is betting that instant, location-aware matching can become a practical layer for high-intent environments, especially where timing is the constraint.

The company’s target segments reflect that focus. In campaign materials, BizzyNow points to business travelers, managers, freelancers, expats, event communities, corporate HR, coworking spaces, hotels, and airports as core audiences and partners.

The raise is being run via Mamacrowd, one of Italy’s established equity crowdfunding platforms, and the campaign is live.

On the Mamacrowd listing, the round is set with:

For early-stage startups, equity crowdfunding can be more than financing. It can act as a public proof point for market interest, build a base of aligned advocates, and strengthen credibility with commercial partners, especially for products that grow through communities.

BizzyNow’s internal materials describe traction that is still early but measurable, including ca. 2,000 free users, 400 weekly active users (22.6% WAU-to-total), and six active corporate pilots. The same documents state that the company is in pre-revenue, with monetization intentionally deferred during the validation phase. That context matters: this is a campaign funding a transition from adoption validation to monetization proof, not a late-stage expansion round.

“Crowdfunding fits our model because community is not a byproduct for us. It’s part of how we validate activation, refine the product, and build repeatable go-to-market channels before scaling”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow’s pitch deck frames its roadmap as a progression “from validation to global market,” staged across three years:

● 2025: MVP, beta launch, early validation
● 2026: Premium launch, B2B pilots, monetization validation
● 2027: EMEA expansion and scale readiness

That sequencing aligns with what BizzyNow describes in its internal underwriting materials: corporate pilots are active, monetization is modeled to begin mid-2026, and the near-term priority is proving repeatable activation and conversion mechanics.

On use of funds, the Executive Pitch Deck states the round is intended to validate monetization, strengthen product capabilities, and prepare for scale, with spend tied to measurable validation milestones across:

● Marketing & GTM validation
● Product and premium features
● Compliance and governance
● Team and operations

The Mamacrowd campaign further breaks planned allocation into ranges:

● 40%–50% Marketing and Brand Activation
● 20%–25% Technology Development (BizzyNow app)
● 10% Legal and Compliance
● 10%–15% Team and Operations● 10% Strategic reserve

BizzyNow also outlines a B2B-oriented monetization path in its deck and model assumptions, including paid event activations, company-wide licensing, and data/analytics packages, while explicitly noting that projections remain validation-stage assumptions and will be refined as unit economics are proven.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

“AI will replace humans”, you heard this before.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.
