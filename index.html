            <h2>The most fascinating monitors at CES 2026</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/the-most-fascinating-monitors-at-ces-2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 took place in Las Vegas last week, and as usual, we’re looking at the most interesting monitors from the show. Not every display is a monitor in the strictest sense, but they all provide a display for computers and have a unique twist that make them worth exploring.

It was a pretty safe bet that Dell would announce new UltraSharp monitors at CES. The displays are a solid recommendation for reliable USB-C monitors, including for Mac users and people needing something polished for professional or creative work. In recent years, UltraSharp monitors have also boasted more modern features, including integrated web cameras and IPS Black tech.

This year, the strategy was clear: Bigger is better.

At 51.5 inches, the UltraSharp U5226KW that Dell announced at CES is the biggest UltraSharp monitor yet. It has a resolution of 6144×2560, for a pixel density of 129 pixels per inch. The IPS Black monitor also has a bevy of ports via a Thunderbolt 4 hub that supports up to 140 W power delivery. There’s a separate pop-out box with 27 W USB-C and 10 W USB-A ports, and the monitor can connect to up to four PCs simultaneously via an integrated KVM. There’s a bounty of connectivity options across this massive display.

The U5226KW lacks any other noteworthy innovations beyond its size, but Dell is still hoping to impress professionals who frequently use numerous apps simultaneously, and especially those currently using multi-monitor setups.

Dell’s giant UltraSharp launched last week for $2,900 with a stand or $2,800 without a stand.

All-in-ones (AIOs) are often overlooked, but Lenovo arrived at CES with a unique take on the computer-monitor combo.

The Lenovo ThinkCentre X AIO Aura Edition differs from other AIOs, including Apple’s 24-inch iMac, in its square-like panel. Its 16:18 aspect ratio means it’s not a true square, but the display is still much taller than other AIOs and most regular computer monitors, which are both usually 16:9.

The Aura Edition’s specs include a 27.6-inch IPS panel with 2560×2880 resolution, up to an Intel Core Ultra X7 Series 3 processor, up to 64GB of LPDDR5x RAM, and two M.2 SSD storage slots.

Lenovo expects the PC to appeal to “creators, programmers, and data professionals who benefit from seeing two A4 pages or full data sets in an easy-to-view portrait display,” the company said in a press release.

Additionally, Lenovo will preload the system with business-friendly features, like Lenovo DeskView, which can “digitize documents placed in front of the screen for instant sharing.” And in case there’s any debate over whether the ThinkCentre X AIO is truly a monitor, Lenovo says the device will launch with Lenovo Share Zone, which lets the screen support both the AIO and a second, connected system simultaneously.

Noteworthy AIO releases are infrequent these days (Lenovo also announced a 32-inch 4K-resolution Yoga AIO I Aura Edition aimed at consumers who want their monitor’s base to light up in different colors depending on what’s on the screen. That machine is expected to release in Q2 for $2,400). Laptops, smartphones, and improvements in monitor technology and affordability have largely supplanted some of AIOs’ primary benefits, like saving space and providing an ample screen.

But with many companies pushing employees back into offices full-time or part-time, there’s an incentive to explore alternative ways to equip offices, from AIOs to big-screen tablets, and even keyboard-PCs. AIOs are easy for IT teams to set up and use minimal space. Simultaneously, Lenovo is offering an option for the growing number of people who prefer taller screens, perhaps due to the nature of their work or the increasing presence of taller displays in consumer laptops.

Lenovo didn’t announce a price or release date for its tall AIO.

A return to classic OLED subpixel layouts from panel-makers LG Display and Samsung Display is a promising sign for the versatility and legibility of future OLED monitors.

Most OLED computer monitors use either a WOLED panel from LG Display or a QD-OLED panel from Samsung Display. WOLED panels feature a red, white, blue, and green (RWBG) subpixel layout or, for newer monitors, an RGWB subpixel layout. QD-OLED monitors have a triangular RGB layout.

Both subpixel layouts have issues with text legibility on Windows. That’s because ClearType, Windows’ subpixel font-rendering software, is built for LCDs with an RGB-stripe subpixel layout. The result for OLED monitors is “fringing,” which, to astute eyes, appears as a colorful border around text. Fringing is especially common on OLED monitors with less than 4K resolution and is often more associated with QD-OLED than WOLED.

As is common in emerging, expensive computing peripherals, OLED monitors first targeted gamers, making fringing less of a concern. WOLED and QD-OLED panels were also favored by panel suppliers because they were easier to manufacture in large sizes for TVs.

And after Japanese panel maker JOLED went bankrupt (it has since been acquired), we stopped seeing new RGB-stripe OLED monitors, which should be more suitable for reading, working, and other non-gaming applications.

But this year, LG Display is making OLED panels with RGB-stripe subpixels. As the company announced in December, “the RGB stripe structure arranges the three primary color subpixels—red, green, and blue—in a straight line, significantly reducing visual distortions such as color bleeding and fringing, even at close viewing distances. Although OLED panels using the RGB stripe method existed before, their maximum refresh rate reached around 60 Hz, making them unsuitable for use as gaming monitors.”

To enable an RGB-stripe subpixel and high refresh rates, LG Display said it increased “the proportion of the pixel area that emits light.”

Similarly, Samsung Display announced at CES that this year, Asus and MSI will release monitors with Samsung’s new QD-OLED panels, which use a vertical RGB subpixel structure the company has named “V-stripe.”

“The biggest technical challenges in mass-producing high refresh rate panels with a new pixel structure include reduced organic material lifespan, heat generation, and brightness degradation,” Samsung Display’s announcement said. “By leveraging QD-OLED’s top emission structure, which offers brightness advantages, along with improvements in organic material efficiency and design optimization, we were able to mass-produce a high-performance monitor.”

Some publications that demoed RGB-stripe OLED monitors at CES reported text looking noticeably better than on other OLED monitors.

LG and Gigabyte also announced that they will release OLED monitors with RGB-stripe subpixels this year.

In true CES fashion, Samsung’s latest Odyssey 3D monitor one-ups its predecessor in every way it can.

Samsung launched its first Odyssey 3D monitor last year. We found that while the glasses-free 3D experience was impressive, the monitor was hard to recommend given its limited game support.

Back then, Samsung’s Odyssey 3D Hub app, which is used to launch stereoscopic content, had 14 games. As of this writing, there are 29 3D-supporting titles (you can see a full list at the Microsoft Store), but that still may not be enough to warrant a purchase price of what we expect will be over $2,000, based on the preceding Odyssey 3D’s release price.

The lack of applications for a glasses-free 3D gaming monitor didn’t stop Samsung from releasing a larger option, though. The Odyssey 3D that came out in 2025 has a 27-inch 4K IPS screen with a 165 Hz refresh rate. The 2026 model is 32 inches and supports 6K resolution (6144×3456) at a refresh rate of 165 Hz. The monitor is also supposed to easily drop down to 3K resolution (3072×1728), at which point it will run at 330 Hz. So although you don’t need glasses to get the most out of this monitor, you will need a decently powerful GPU.

In addition to glasses-free 3D gaming, Samsung’s 3D monitors can make 2D videos appear to be in 3D. In our testing of the 27-inch Odyssey 3D, this worked well enough on YouTube videos, albeit with a bit of a cardboard-cutout effect.

Most gamers or people seeking 6K resolution won’t opt for a 3D monitor. But Samsung’s investment in improving 3D displays alongside (slowly) growing game support should be welcome for people who have been waiting 15 years for glasses-free 3D to really take off.

G-Sync Pulsar is a backlight strobing technique designed to reduce perceived blur when viewing fast-moving content on supported monitors.

The backlight on a Pulsar monitor pulses for one-fourth of a frame right before pixels are overwritten. This enables pixels to be the proper color before they’re lit up so you don’t see pixels fading from one hue to another. The approach differs from that of most monitors, which use always-on backlights, and is reminiscent of plasma TVs, which didn’t have backlights but lit up pixels in quick pulses, helping to reduce motion blur. Pulsar also differs from other forms of backlight strobing, such as Nvidia’s Ultra Low Motion Blur, in that it works with variable refresh rates.

Speed-hungry gamers have been awaiting Pulsar monitors since Nvidia announced the technology at CES 2024. As of this writing, three Pulsar monitors are available to purchase: Acer’s Predator XB273U F5, Asus’ ROG Strix Pulsar XG27AQNGV, and MSI’s MPG 272QRF X36.

Two-year-old California startup Odinn reportedly held limited demos at CES last week of Odinn’s Omnia X,  a provocative approach to the idea of a “portable data center.”

The term “data center” is a stretch, though, as Omnia X is far from matching the computing capabilities of even a modest data center. The PC can support up to two AMD EPYC 9965 CPUs, four Nvidia H200 NVL GPUs, and 6TB of DDR5 memory.

That’s an impressive amount of power to fit in a chassis that Odinn claims is the size of carry-on luggage. The system also has a flip-down keyboard and a pair of handles, which are essential since Omnia X weighs 77 pounds. That’s more than what you’d expect from a&quot;portable” gadget, but Omnia X’s form factor is more about simplifying “data center” access for businesses and employees with demanding and sensitive computing needs who work in various locations.

In an interview with Las Vegas Sun, Oddin CEO Carl Liebel compared Omnix X to about half of a data center rack and said it could replace a company’s need to rent space in a data center.

The Omnia X makes this list due to its (optional) integrated, 23.8-inch 4K display that flips out from the system’s side. With the display and max specifications, the Omnia X could be the most well-equipped portable computing solution we’ve seen.

Odinn says that Omnia X uses a redundant power supply unit (PSU) with a high Platinum rating for efficiency. In a PSU, efficiency means less internal heat and lower energy consumption—key areas of concern in a system like Omnia’s. Interesting Engineering reported that Omnia X uses a proprietary closed-loop cooling system.

Odinn’s website targets Omnia X at heavy-lift projects, like “military AI missions,” “enterprise-grade simulations,” and portable data centers.

“Run large models without ever connecting to the cloud. Omnia AI was built for mission-critical inference at the edge, from battlefield computer vision to real-time autonomous navigation,” Omnia’s website reads. “With dual GPUs, massive RAM, and hardware-level isolation, it delivers the kind of raw AI horsepower previously reserved for large-scale data centers, right where your team needs it most.”

Odinn is also pitching the computer to cinematographers, 3D artists, and VFX editors who work on location. Analysts, investigators, and cyber operators could also benefit by using the system for “mapping threat surfaces, performing forensic investigations, or searching across massive, disconnected data sets,” the California startup claims.

Omnia X will cost at least $550,000 Liebel told Las Vegas Sun. You can see pictures of it at the show here and here.

Every year at CES, a new panel claims to be the fastest monitor that has ever existed. Sure, most people don’t need a monitor that can refresh 1,000 times per second. But extremely high refresh rates do offer visual benefits, including less blur and fast objects looking sharper. It’s also just cool to see how far professional-grade gaming monitors can go.

One of the fastest monitors at CES 2026 is Acer’s 1,000 Hz Predator XB273U F6. Last month, Philips and AOC announced upcoming monitors that could run 720p at 1,000 Hz, too. But Acer appears to be the closest to actually releasing such a monitor. The OEM gave demos of its 1,000 Hz, 27-inch display at last week’s trade show. Unlike the other monitors, Acer’s speedy screen has a launch timeframe: Q2 2026. (Samsung also announced a 1,040 Hz monitor at the show, but the additional 40 Hz seems negligible at this point, and Samsung hasn’t provided details about how it purportedly reached that speed. Further, there seemed to be minimal demos of Samsung’s 27-inch Odyssey G6 G60H at CES 2026.)

While 1,000 Hz monitors target gamers playing games at the highest levels, they are also built to support a 2560×1440 resolution at a slower—but still amazingly fast—500 Hz.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2024, scientists announced the discovery of a new species of giant anaconda in South America. A National Geographic camera crew was on hand for the 2022 expedition that documented the new species—and so was actor Will Smith, since they were filming for NatGeo’s new documentary series, Pole to Pole with Will Smith. Now we can all share in Smith’s Amazon experience, courtesy of the three-minute clip above.

Along with venom expert Bryan Fry, we follow Smith’s journey by boat with a team of indigenous Waorani guides, scouring the river banks for anacondas. And they find one: a female green anaconda about 16 to 17 feet long, “pure muscle.” The Waorani secure the giant snake—anacondas aren’t venomous but they do bite—so that Fry (with Smith’s understandably reluctant help) can collect a scale sample for further analysis. Fry says that this will enable him to determine the accumulation of pollutants in the water.

That and other collected samples also enabled scientists to conduct the genetic analysis that resulted in the declaration of a new species: the northern green anaconda (Eunectes akayama, which roughly translates to “the great snake”). It is genetically distinct from the southern green anaconda (Eunectes murinus); the two species likely diverged some 10 million years ago. The northern green anaconda’s turf includes Venezuela, Colombia, Suriname, French Guyana, and the northern part of Brazil.

Smith’s time in the Amazon also brought the arachnophobic actor face to face with a giant tarantula while scientists extracted the venom. His further adventures brought him to the South Pole, where he trekked across frigid ice fields; to the Himalayas, where he trekked to a small village in Bhutan; to the Pacific Islands to record a lost native language; to the Kalahari Desert, where he joined the hunter-gatherer San people on a hunt; and to the North Pole, where he joined an expedition to dive under the ice to collect scientific samples.

Pole to Pole with Will Smith premieres on January 13, 2026, and will stream on Disney+ the following day.

            <div id="article-text">Since 2018, a group of researchers from around the world has crunched the numbers on how much heat the world’s oceans are absorbing each year. In 2025, their measurements broke records once again, making this the eighth year in a row that the world’s oceans have absorbed more heat than in the years before.

The study, which was published Friday in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Science, found that the world’s oceans absorbed an additional 23 zettajoules’ worth of heat in 2025, the most in any year since modern measurements began in the 1960s. That’s significantly higher than the 16 additional zettajoules they absorbed in 2024. The research comes from a team of more than 50 scientists across the United States, Europe, and China.

A joule is a common way to measure energy. A single joule is a relatively small unit of measurement—it’s about enough to power a tiny lightbulb for a second, or slightly heat a gram of water. But a zettajoule is one sextillion joules; numerically, the 23 zettajoules the oceans absorbed this year can be written out as 23,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

John Abraham, a professor of thermal science at the University of St. Thomas and one of the authors on the paper, says that he sometimes has trouble putting this number into contexts that laypeople understand. Abraham offers up a couple options. His favorite is comparing the energy stored in the ocean to the energy of atomic bombs: The 2025 warming, he says, is the energetic equivalent to 12 Hiroshima bombs exploding in the ocean. (Some other calculations he’s done include equating this number to the energy it would take to boil 2 billion Olympic swimming pools, or more than 200 times the electrical use of everyone on the planet.)

“Last year was a bonkers, crazy warming year—that’s the technical term,” Abraham joked to me. “The peer-reviewed scientific term is ‘bonkers’.”

The world’s oceans are its largest heat sink, absorbing more than 90 percent of the excess warming that is trapped in the atmosphere. While some of the excess heat warms the ocean’s surface, it also slowly travels further down into deeper parts of the ocean, aided by circulation and currents.

Global temperature calculations—like the ones used to determine the hottest years on record—usually only capture measurements taken at the ocean’s surface. (The study finds that overall sea surface temperatures in 2025 were slightly lower than they were in 2024, which is on record as the hottest year since modern records began. Some meteorological phenomena, like El Niño events, can also raise sea surface temperatures in certain regions, which can cause the overall ocean to absorb slightly less heat in a given year. This helps to explain why there was such a big jump in added ocean heat content between 2025, which developed a weak La Niña at the end of the year, and 2024, which came at the end of a strong El Niño year.) While sea surface temperatures have risen since the Industrial Revolution, thanks to our use of fossil fuels, these measurements don’t provide a full picture of how climate change is affecting the oceans.

“If the whole world was covered by a shallow ocean that was only a couple feet deep, it would warm up more or less at the same speed as the land,” says Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at Berkeley Earth and a co-author of the study. “But because so much of that heat is going down in the deep ocean, we see generally slower warming of sea surface temperatures [than those on land].”

Surface temperatures, Hausfather says, are what most directly impact human societies: They have direct effects on weather patterns and most of the ocean life we interact with. But the amount of heat stored in deeper parts of the ocean is a key metric for understanding how climate change is affecting the planet.

“Ocean heat content is in many ways the most reliable thermostat of the planet,” he says. “That’s where all the heat is going—and that’s the reason why almost every year we set a new record for ocean heat content, because there’s so much heat being absorbed by the ocean.”

The estimates of ocean heating in the paper were created using a mix of mathematical models of ocean warming as well as reams of data on ocean temperatures collected from sites around the world. Humans have been tracking ocean temperatures for a long time; Benjamin Franklin recorded sea temperatures during his transatlantic voyages. In the 1870s, the HMS Challenger expedition—which is largely credited with inventing modern oceanography—took measurements at deeper depths. But regularly measuring temperatures substantially below the surface is a relatively new phenomenon. The study’s earliest data goes back to the 1960s, when some navies began taking measurements of deeper ocean temperatures.

A key tool that revolutionized our understanding of deeper ocean temperatures is the international network of Argo floats, with more than 3,500 robotic buoys that were first deployed in the early 2000s to collect data on oceans around the world. In addition to the Argo floats, the study pulls data from a variety of other sources, including data measured from buoys, ship hulls, satellites—and animals. (“We actually put instruments on mammals that swim under ice, and so we can measure temperatures while they swim,” Abraham says. “They can take measurements where our robots can’t go.”) The study also uses algorithmic models trained on particular sets of ocean data.

“It’s really quite impressive that they get such consistent results using multiple datasets,” says Raphael Kudela, a professor of ocean science at UC Santa Cruz who was not involved in the study. Kudela says that studies like these help to hammer home just how much climate change is altering the planet.

“What people often don’t grasp is that it’s taken 100 years to get the oceans that warm at depth,” he says. “Even if we stopped using fossil fuels today, it’s going to take hundreds of years for that to circulate through the ocean. We’re going to pay this cost for a very, very long time, because we’ve already put the heat in the ocean.”

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/conservative-lawmakers-want-porn-taxes-critics-say-theyre-unconstitutional/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As age-verification laws continue to dismantle the adult industry—and determine the future of free speech on the internet—a Utah lawmaker proposed a bill this week that would enforce a tax on porn sites that operate within the state.

Introduced by state senator Calvin Musselman, a Republican, the bill would impose a 7 percent tax on total receipts “from sales, distributions, memberships, subscriptions, performances, and content amounting to material harmful to minors that is produced, sold, filmed, generated, or otherwise based” in Utah. If passed, the bill would go into effect in May and would also require adult sites to pay a $500 annual fee to the State Tax Commission. Per the legislation, the money made from the tax will be used by Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services to provide more mental health support for teens.

Musselman did not respond to a request for comment.

A new age of American conservatism commands the political arena, and more US lawmakers are calling for additional restrictions on adult content. In September, Alabama became the first state to impose a porn tax on adult entertainment companies (10 percent) following the passage of age-verification mandates, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content. Pennsylvania lawmakers are also eyeing a bill that would tax consumers an additional 10 percent on “subscriptions to and one-time purchases from online adult content platforms,” despite already requiring them to pay a 6 percent sales and use tax for the purchase of digital products, two state senators wrote in a memo in October. Other states have flirted with the idea of a porn tax in the past. In 2019, Arizona state senator Gail Griffin, a Republican, proposed taxing adult content distributors to help fund the border wall, a key priority during Donald Trump’s first presidential term. So far, 25 US states have passed a form of age verification.

Although efforts to criminalize participants in the sex work industry have been ongoing for years—with new regulations unfolding at a moment of heightened online surveillance and censorship—targeted taxes have failed to gain widespread approval because the legality of such laws is up for debate.

“This kind of porn tax is blatantly unconstitutional,” says Evelyn Douek, an associate professor of law at Stanford Law School. “It singles out a particular type of protected speech for disfavored treatment, purely because the legislature doesn’t like it—that’s exactly what the First Amendment is designed to protect against. Utah may not like porn, but as the Supreme Court affirmed only last year, adults have a fully protected right to access it.”

Utah, Alabama, and Pennsylvania are among the 16 states that have adopted resolutions declaring porn a public health crisis. “We realize this is a bold assertion not everyone will agree on, but it’s the full-fledged truth,” Utah governor Gary Herbert tweeted in 2016 after signing the resolution. One of Utah’s earliest statewide responses to the proliferation of adult content happened in 2001, when it became the first state to create an office for sexually explicit issues by hiring an obscenity and pornography complaints ombudsman. The position—dubbed the “porn czar”—was terminated in 2017.

“Age restriction is a very complex subject that brings with it data privacy concerns and the potential for uneven and inconsistent application for different digital platforms,” Alex Kekesi, vice president of brand and community at Pornhub, told WIRED in a previous conversation. In November, the company urged Google, Microsoft, and Apple to enact device-based verification in their app stores and across their operating systems. “We have seen several states and countries try to impose platform-level age verification requirements, and they have all failed to adequately protect children.” To comply with the new age gate mandates, Pornhub has currently blocked access to users in 23 states.

Critics argue that age verification has never been about protecting children but rather scrubbing porn from the internet. A video leaked in 2024 by the Centre for Climate Reporting showed Russell Vought, a Trump ally and Project 2025 coauthor, calling age verification laws a “back door” tactic to a federal porn ban.

Sites like OnlyFans and Pornhub have brought platform-dependent sex work into the mainstream, but they have also made it easier to police adult entertainers and consumers. As more states begin to implement added tariffs on sex work, creators will bear the brunt of the new laws more than anyone.

The skewed ideology of cultural conservatism that is taking shape under Trump 2.0 wants to punish sexual expression, says Mike Stabile, director of public policy at the Free Speech Coalition, a trade association for the adult industry in the US. “When we talk about free speech, we generally mean the freedom to speak, the ability to speak freely without government interference. But in this case, free also means not having to pay for the right to do so. A government tax on speech limits that right to those who can afford it.”

According to company policy, OnlyFans complies with all tax requirements in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Creators are responsible for their own tax affairs. Pornhub, which is currently blocked in Utah and Alabama, did not respond to a request for comment.

Douek notes that following the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold age-verification laws in Texas, states can legally regulate minors’ access to sexually explicit material, “but a porn tax does nothing to limit minors’ access to this speech—it simply makes it more expensive to provide this content to adults.” A 2022 report from Common Sense Media, a youth advocacy nonprofit, found that 73 percent of teens age 13 to 17 have watched adult content online. Today, young people regularly access NSFW content via social media, on platforms like X and Snap. Last year, a survey by the UK’s Office of the Children’s Commissioner reported that 59 percent of minors are being exposed to porn by accident, primarily via social media, up from 38 percent in 2023.

In Alabama, as would be the case with Utah, revenue raised by the tax is being used for behavioral health services, including prevention, treatment, and recovery support for young people.

Alabama state representative Ben Robbins, the bill’s Republican sponsor, said in an interview last year that adult content was “a driver in causing mental health issues” in the state. It’s a common argument among lawmakers pushing for a nationwide porn ban. Some scientific studies suggest that adolescent exposure to porn increases rates of depression, low self-esteem, and normalized violence, but health professionals have never reached a consensus on the matter.

With lawmakers working to reframe the issue around underage harm, Stabile says it’s critical to remember that adult content isn’t different from any other kind of protected speech, noting that content-specific taxes on speech have repeatedly been struck down by the courts as unconstitutional censorship.

“What if a state decided that Covid misinformation was straining state health resources and taxed newsletters who promoted it? What if the federal government decided to require a costly license to start a podcast? What if a state decided to tax a certain newspaper it didn’t like?” he says. “Porn isn’t some magical category of speech separate from movies, streaming services, or other forms of entertainment. Adult businesses already pay taxes on the income they earn, just as every other business does. Taxing them because of imagined harms is not only dangerous to our industry, it sets a dangerous precedent for government power.”

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/spacex-gets-fcc-permission-to-launch-another-7500-starlink-satellites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX today received US permission to launch another 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites, bringing its total authorization to 15,000 Gen2 satellites including those previously approved.

“Under this grant, SpaceX is authorized to construct, deploy, and operate an additional 7,500 Gen2 Starlink satellites, bringing the total to 15,000 satellites worldwide,” the Federal Communications Commission announced today. “This expansion will enable SpaceX to deliver high-speed, low-latency Internet service globally, including enhanced mobile and supplemental coverage from space.”

The FCC gave SpaceX permission for the first set of 7,500 satellites in December 2022. The agency deferred action on the rest of the second-generation constellation at the time and limited the first batch to certain altitudes, saying it needed to “address concerns about orbital debris and space safety” before approving the full bunch.

The FCC said today’s order allows SpaceX to “upgrade the Gen2 Starlink satellites with advanced form factors and cutting-edge technology,” and “operate across Ku-, Ka-, V-, E-, and W-band frequencies, supporting both Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) and Mobile Satellite Service (MSS).” The FCC said it is waiving “obsolete requirements that prevented overlapping beam coverage and enhanced capacity,” and is letting SpaceX “add new orbital shells at altitudes ranging from 340 km to 485 km, optimizing coverage and performance.”

The news follows SpaceX’s announcement of maneuvers that will lower about 4,400 of the company’s existing satellites from an altitude of 341 miles (550 kilometers) to 298 miles (480 kilometers) during 2026. SpaceX said it is making the change to increase space safety, as the lower altitudes have less debris that satellites could collide with.

The 2022 authorization for the first 7,500 satellites didn’t include mobile service, but the FCC decided in November 2024 that SpaceX could use those satellites to provide Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) in the US. Starlink’s mobile system provides service to smartphones in areas not covered by terrestrial cellular networks.

T-Mobile is using Starlink in the US, and the satellite operator has partnerships with carriers overseas. With today’s FCC authorization, Starlink will be able to provide both fixed and mobile service from all 15,000 second-generation satellites.

SpaceX also recently struck a $17 billion deal to buy spectrum licenses from EchoStar, which will give it 50 Mhz of mobile spectrum and reduce its reliance on cellular carriers. SpaceX has been leasing 10 MHz of spectrum from T-Mobile to provide supplemental service in the US.

Starlink is separately planning to launch yet another 15,000 satellites that are designed for mobile service. SpaceX asked the FCC to approve this plan in September 2025, saying the “new system will offer a new generation of MSS connectivity, supporting voice, texting, and high-speed data.”

Starlink requests for FCC authorization often face opposition from other satellite firms, and the application for 15,000 more satellites is no exception. Viasat filed a petition to deny the application on Monday this week.

“This proposed expansion of SpaceX’s operating authority would give it an even greater ability and incentive to foreclose other operators from accessing and using limited orbital and spectrum resources on a competitive basis,” Viasat told the FCC. “At the same time, the proposed operations would generate insurmountable interference risks for other spectrum users and the customers they serve, preclude other operators from accessing and using scarce spectral and orbital resources on an equitable basis, undermine and foreclose competition and innovation, and otherwise harm the public.”

Globalstar also filed a petition to deny, and several other satellite operators raised objections. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has generally been a supporter of SpaceX and Elon Musk, however. Carr alleged that the Biden administration targeted Musk’s companies for “regulatory harassment,” and in his current role as chairman Carr pressured EchoStar into selling the spectrum licenses that SpaceX is now buying.

In today’s press release announcing the latest authorization, Carr said that “the FCC has given SpaceX the green light to deliver unprecedented satellite broadband capabilities, strengthen competition, and help ensure that no community is left behind.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It took a while, but a consensus has emerged in Europe that the continent’s space industry needs to develop reusable rockets. How to do it and how much to spend on it remain unresolved questions.

Much of the discourse around reusable rockets in Europe has focused on developing a brand-new rocket that might eventually replace the Ariane 6, which debuted less than two years ago but still uses the “use it and lose it” model embraced by the launch industry for most of the Space Age.

The European Space Agency (ESA) is offering money to emerging rocket companies in Europe to prove its small satellite launchers can do the job. ESA is also making money available to incentivize rocket upgrades to haul heavier cargo into orbit. ESA, the European Commission, and national governments are funding rocket hoppers to demonstrate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies. While there is significant money behind these efforts, the projects are not unified, and progress has been slow.

Now, there’s a proposal to retrofit the existing Ariane 6 rocket design for partial reuse. ArianeGroup, a 50/50 joint venture between Airbus and Safran, won a contract from the European Space Agency’s Boosters for European Space Transportation (BEST!) initiative in late 2024.

The origins of the Ariane 6 rocket’s design can be traced back to 2014, when Airbus and Safran unveiled the architecture that finally began flying in 2024. The rocket uses an expendable design, with a cryogenic core stage and two or four strap-on solid rocket boosters, depending on the demands of the particular mission.

At the time, SpaceX had already announced plans to recover and reuse its Falcon 9 boosters. SpaceX recovered the first Falcon 9 booster in 2015, then reused one for the first time in 2017. Officials in Europe were betting against SpaceX’s success and lost. Blue Origin joined SpaceX in successfully landing an orbital-class booster last year, and several Chinese companies are close to replicating the achievement.

Bruno Le Maire, the former French finance minister, said in 2021 that the Ariane 6 was a “bad strategic choice.” More recently, in October of last year, the head of ESA said the continent’s space industry must “catch up” with international competitors like SpaceX and develop a reusable launcher “relatively fast.”

In its submission to ESA’s BEST! initiative, ArianeGroup proposes replacing the Ariane 6 rocket’s solid-fueled side boosters with new liquid-fueled boosters. The boosters would be developed by MaiaSpace, a French subsidiary of ArianeGroup working on its own partially reusable small satellite launcher. MaiaSpace and ArianeGroup would convert the Maia rocket’s methane-fueled booster for use on the Ariane 6.

ArianeGroup’s proposal was first reported by European Spaceflight, which said the concept presented to ESA is similar to an ArianeGroup proposal from 2022, when the company described the liquid reusable boosters as a “plug-and-play” alternative to Ariane 6’s solid-fueled boosters, helping reduce operating costs and increase launch rates.

The details of ArianeGroup’s newest proposal have not been published, but the concept was summarized in a paper presented in 2025 at the European Conference for Aeronautics and Space Sciences.

Isar Aerospace, a German rocket startup, won a separate BEST! contract from ESA to study a demonstrator for a reusable first stage based on the company’s light-class Spectrum rocket. The Spectrum rocket’s initial design is expendable. Its first test flight last year ended in failure, and Isar is readying the second Spectrum rocket for another launch attempt later this month.

ESA asked ArianeGroup and Isar Aerospace to assess the feasibility of their proposals, develop technology and system development plans, and define plans and costs for a “major flight demonstration.”

MaiaSpace’s rocket won’t launch until 2027, at the earliest, and it’s unlikely any decision to use it as the basis for new Ariane 6 boosters will bear fruit until long after Maia flies on its own. Even if ESA and ArianeGroup take this route, the Ariane 6 rocket would still be predominantly expendable.

It’s infeasible to recover the Ariane 6’s core stage for many reasons. Chief among them is that the main stage burns for more than seven minutes on an Ariane 6 flight, reaching speeds about twice as fast as SpaceX’s Falcon 9 booster achieves during its two-and-a-half minutes of operation during launch. As a result, the booster would have to rid itself of much more energy when it comes back through the atmosphere. The Ariane 6’s core stage also has just a single engine, whereas SpaceX, Blue Origin, and others use multi-engine designs to better control the rocket’s descent and landing.

The Ariane 6’s payload shroud, used to protect satellites during the first few minutes of launch, is also not reusable. The upper stage is single-use, too. This is a hard problem to solve, but companies like SpaceX and Stoke Space are already working on new rockets with recoverable and reusable upper stages.

Swapping out Ariane 6’s solid rocket motors for reusable liquid boosters makes some economic sense for ArianeGroup. The proposal would bring the development and production of the boosters under full control of ArianeGroup and its French subsidiary, cutting Italy’s solid rocket motor developer, Avio, out of the program.

Introducing the liquid-fueled boosters might also be a way for ArianeGroup to rapidly gain experience in landing and reusing rockets. Each Ariane 6 launch would have multiple boosters, likely two or four, so a single Ariane 6 flight would double or quadruple the flight test data available from just a single booster.

But with this proposal, ArianeGroup is still trying to catch up to where the bleeding edge of the launch industry was 10 or 15 years ago, not where SpaceX, Blue Origin, and others are today, and a far cry from where Europe’s competition in rocketry will be by the time any such Ariane 6 Franken-rocket could ever reach the launch pad.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cosmetic surgeons have turned to using a “fat filler” harvested from dead people in order to give patients new breasts, sexier buttocks and other body contouring tweaks, according to reporting by Business Insider — in a practice that not even “Frankenstein” author Mary Shelley could have dreamed up in her day.

The hot new product in question is called alloClae, manufactured by biomedical science business Tiger Aesthetics, and it’s become increasingly popular in plastic surgery circles despite its gruesome origins and aggressive price tag — ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per procedure, according to BI — because it allows dramatically less healing time and doesn’t require patients being put under general anesthesia.

“People are paying for the convenience,” New York City plastic surgeon Sachin Shridharani told the site.

Historically, plastic surgeons have relied on implants or siphoning fat from another section of your body and injecting it into another part in order to perform body contouring. Using alloClae gives them a flexible new option.

Another reason why it’s become popular is that weight loss GLP-1 agonists drugs like Ozempic have made faces and bodies saggy — and that has them clamoring for specialists like Shridharani to fix their body issues.

“In their own words, ‘I’ve got no ass,&#39;” Shridharani said. “‘My trousers look like they’re falling off.&#39;”

So how does somebody’s fat end up in a plastic surgeon’s syringe?

What typically happens is that people donate their bodies to science, with organs going to donation or scientific research. Tissue banks also harvest fat calls from dead people’s abdomen’s, though, and Tiger Aesthetics buys it and processes the fat cells into alloClae.

“As of the beginning of 2026, we’ll be producing a ton more alloClae so that we can service the real demand that’s out there,” Tiger Aesthetics preident Caroline Van Hove told BI.

The practice isn’t entirely unprecedented. There’s already a product called Renuva, for instance, with the same origin but used for facial injections.

Is it weird to have your body sculpted with the fat from a dead person? Maybe, but you clearly can’t argue with results — or the horror of body issues.

            <h2>Red Hot Christmas Toy Crashes So Badly That Kids Can’t Actually Use It</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-11</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Parents were left scrambling on Christmas day after the hot toy of the season appeared to crash and burn, in a perfect cautionary tale about the era of connected gadgets that can easily brick if their delicate infrastructure is put under strain.

The toy, called the Tin Can, is basically a stripped down landline phone that places calls over WiFi. The devices are styled after colorful tin cans — like an old school tin can telephone, an archaic toy so thoroughly ancient that kids today presumably have no idea it ever existed — with twirly cords just like the landlines of yore.

The pitch is that the Tin Can allows parents to set up a sort of closed network of other Tin Can users, making it a nice compromise for kids who are too young for a cell phone, but who still want to communicate with their friends and family members. It’s free to call other Tin Can users, or parents can pay a $10 monthly subscription to make outside calls.

Yet when kids rushed to phone their friends over the holidays to schedule playdates and sledding runs, they found the string had been cut.

“Call volume on Christmas Day increased more than 100x from the start of the month, which impacted people’s abilities to set up their devices or make calls,” Tin Can’s founder Chet Kittleson told Business Insider in an interview. “Despite spending months and months preparing for it, we didn’t get it all right.”

“It worked great, the kids were using it,” Maria Pahuja, a parent from Virginia, told the publication. “Then, Christmas morning, it stopped working. Sometimes you’d pick it up, and there would be a dial tone, you would call, and nothing would happen. Once in a while, a call would go through, and then two minutes later another call wouldn’t.”

In other words, kids probably would have had a better chance of connecting with their friends with an actual tin can telephone, operated via vibrationson a string, on Christmas morn’.

By now, things seem to be back up and running, though there are still some issues with call quality popping up, BI reports. A January 8th status update on the company’s website — and, tellingly, a banner on the very top of its home page — advises parents that “we’re continuing to see very positive signs of recovery, but we’re still working through some lingering issues.” The company began in Seattle “with a handful of families and has since grown to serve families across more than 30 states,” its site says. BI reports the company has successfully raised $15.5 million since its launch in Autumn of 2024 — resources which apparently weren’t enough to prevent the toys from turning into a corded lump of coal at the exact moment they were supposed to make a great first impression.

            <h2>Researchers Just Discovered Something Startling About How Conservatives Pick Political Positions</h2>

            <div id="article-text">If you’ve been watching the intense partisan divide over the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minnesota this week, it’s likely felt as though different Americans are living in completely separate realities.

As it turns out, neuroscience might be able to explain why. In a new study whose findings will surprise absolutely no one who’s endured a fiery holiday dinner debate, researchers discovered that conservative and liberal brains don’t just arrive at fundamentally different conclusions, but take strikingly different paths to get there. It’s a fascinating piece of research which just might explain something about the yawning political divides currently tearing society apart.

The study, published in the journal PLOS One, explored why people rely on different types of evidence when explaining why things happen. Specifically, the paper’s authors at the University of Idaho sought to find why some people look for tons of high-level statistical information, while others are happy to listen to anecdotes or single authority figures to reach political conclusions.

In order to carry out the study, researchers recruited 583 adults from the US, who each took a political ideology survey as well as a test to measure their level of “cognitive reflection,” which measures the capacity to look past a knee-jerk response and engage in factual analysis.

Each participant was then given a fictional scenario about cash bail, a “pay-to-leave-jail” policy which critics say unjustly punishes the poor.

The participants were told that, out of the top 300 US cities by population, 100 had ended cash bail. They were then asked to evaluate whether the policy was “effective at reducing crime” based on 10 pieces of evidence. Each piece of information was either composed of statistical figures or testimony from political “experts” from groups like the Democratic Party, Republican Party, and the National Rifle Association, in order to measure which type of evidence each one gravitated toward.

Participants had the chance to go through as many bits of evidence as they wanted before they delivered their final analysis to the researchers — though not all took advantage of this. For example, the researchers found that the probability a participant would rely on a single data point for their conclusion rose from about 4 percent for “very liberal” people to over 37 percent for “very conservative” folks.

As the researchers concluded, those on the left “tend to be more likely to consult a comprehensive set of statistical data relative to those on the right.”

Outside of the left-right paradigm, those who scored high on the cognitive reflection test were more likely to compare and contrast all available statistical data to form their conclusions than those who scored lower.

“Importantly, our study shows that two major individual-level variables help to predict what type of ‘evidence seeker’ a given person is: whether or not they are ‘cognitively reflected’ and whether or not they are liberal/conservative,” the study’s lead author and professor of politics and philosophy at the University of Idaho Florian Justwan told PsyPost.

“Indeed, people’s political beliefs influence how they look for information (often without them realizing it),” Justwan continued.

Zooming out, the research adds to a body of work which suggests that left-leaning people have more trust in the scientific method than conservatives. While that isn’t exactly a bombshell revelation, it does paint an interesting picture of how people one both sides of the aisle come to their political conclusions.

Said another way: while the research surely won’t end the culture war bickering at Thanksgiving, it gives us a strong explanation why one person’s “obvious proof” is another person’s fake news — a fundamental rift which, if ever resolved, could completely change the political landscape.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly a week after US strikes bombarded Venezuela during the kidnapping of its president Nicolás Maduro, betting platform Polymarket is refusing to pay out users who gambled on the invasion of Venezeula.

Polymarket is a controversial prediction market where users can gamble on the outcome of real-world events, like who will win a certain election, or which side will control a certain village in the Ukraine-Russo war by a pre-specified date.

In this particular wager, Polymarket was supposed to pay out if “the United States commences a military offensive intended to establish control over any portion of Venezuela,” a determination to be made by “a consensus of credible sources,” the New York Times reported. To those who wagered on such an outcome, the events of January 3rd were proof positive that an invasion had taken place.

Instead, Polymarket came out with a statement arguing the opposite.

“This market refers to US military operations intended to establish control,” the note declares. “President Trump’s statement that they will ‘run’ Venezuela while referencing ongoing talks with the Venezuelan government does not alone qualify the snatch-and-extract mission to capture Maduro as an invasion.”

Those looking to cash in on the brutal attacks — which have killed at least 100 people so far — weren’t too impressed with the platform’s semantical wit.

“Pretty sure this should be yes after Trump said approximately 20 times in his press conference that the US now controls Venezuela,” groused a bettor with $1,876 wagered on a US invasion of Venezuela by March 31st. “We are going to run the country,” another user exclaimed.

“They think there will be no punishment for all this fraud. They are openly changing the rules and manipulating the market,” one user who bet $123 on the outcome complained. “A major investigation file is being prepared regarding Polymarket by the US Department of Justice. Don’t worry.”

Betting market participants relitigating results they don’t like is quickly becoming a pattern in the sector, with similar debates playing out over Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” pick and Elon Musk’s overly ambitious promises about Tesla’s self-driving taxi program.

Still, the latest incident heaps drama on Venezuela’s role in betting markets; it comes amidst some pretty compelling allegations that an insider with advanced knowledge of the US attack on Venezuela scored over $400,000 betting similar lines. (The alleged insider’s bets won all their bets.)

In this case however, every bettor who thought they were crowdsourcing the truth instead got a time honored lesson: no matter what you’re betting over, the house always wins.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hundreds of earthquakes have been detected rattling Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier, also known as the Doomsday Glacier — the disintegration of which could send between two and 10 feet of devastating flooding to coastal communities worldwide.

This stunning finding, published in a new study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, suggests that this gigantic behemoth of ice, which is almost as big as the island of Great Britain, is even more fragile than experts feared — and that world governments’ efforts to stop global warming haven’t been nearly enough.

To keep an eye on its imminent collapse, Australian National University seismologist Thanh-Son Phạm suggests in the paper that a dedicated seismic network be located and maintained on the icy continent to “monitor glacial dynamics, which may evolve abruptly in the coming decades or even years.”

The risk is high; Phạm detected a total of 362 previously unrecognized seismic events between 2010 and 2023, and they mostly occurred in the West Antarctic region, the home of the Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier, another big block of ice that’s become visibly smaller over the years due to climate change.

Glacier earthquakes are detected at around magnitude 5 on the Richter scale, and are often associated with iceberg calving in warmer months of the Arctic Circle such as the ones in Greenland. By contrast, the dynamics that drive Antarctic earthquakes are little understood because there is simply isn’t much data on them and they tend to register at a lower magnitude.

To rectify that situation, Phạm developed an algorithm to pick up wave patterns collected by seismic monitors on Antarctica. From this data, he determined that 245 of the 362 earthquakes recorded came from Thwaites Glacier, where he believes they were caused by icebergs calving off into the ocean.

Scientists are deeply concerned about the Thwaites Glacier collapse not only because of the immense amount of water it could displace, but because it acts like an icy plug on the West Antarctic ice shelf that keeps all that ice from sliding into the ocean.

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk constructed his personal mythology around a pair of weighty accomplishments: building actual, stable businesses around both rockets and electric cars.

So far, he has yet to accomplish the same thing around his AI business. According to documents obtained by Bloomberg, xAI recorded a net loss of $1.46 billion over the third quarter of 2025. That’s an even worse loss than previous months — in the first quarter of 2025, for example, the company’s net loss was roughly $1 billion, and it’s shredded $7.8 billion in cash over the last year, according to documents obtained by the publication.

It’s in good company. Every major AI company is currently losing money hand over fist on the tech. Like its peers, xAI insists that pattern is temporary; per Bloomberg, its executives told investors in a recent earnings call that the company has the resources to “continue spending aggressively.”

Eventually, they promised, the company will build “self-sufficient AI” that can power Tesla’s Optimus robots. Like xAI, Tesla’s stuttering Optimus program is eons away from ever turning a profit — or even from hitting the market, for that matter.

The financial news comes as xAI announces plans to build yet another massive data center, this time in Southaven, Mississippi. With a price tag of $20 billion, it would be the largest private investment in the state’s history — and like previous xAI data centers in Memphis, Tennessee, it will no doubt be a massive headache for its unfortunate neighbors.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">French defense tech company Harmattan AI is rising almost as fast as the supersonic planes of its new backer. Founded in 2024, the company is now valued at $1.4 billion after raising a $200 million Series B round led by Dassault Aviation, which is best known for making the Rafale fighter jet.

Harmattan AI, which builds autonomy and mission-system software for defense aircraft, had already received strong validation signals from the French and British ministries of defense in its less than two years of existence. But this funding and the accompanying partnership will give new wings to a company that once described itself as a “European Anduril.”

Like its American peer, Harmattan AI once aspired to overtake defense incumbents, which are also known as primes. But the company is now also ready to partner with them — even if it means no longer calling itself “a next-generation defense prime.”

According to Harmattan’s latest press release, the now “defense technology company” will help Dassault Aviation shape the future of air combat by developing embedded AI capabilities for its next generations of Rafales and drones while making sure this implementation is both sovereign and scalable.

The use of drones in Ukraine has been a wake-up call for NATO armies, creating tailwinds for defense tech startups that can help them adapt. According to Harmattan AI, which recently partnered with Russian drone maker Skyeton, the funding will help it extend its product offering into new domains and scale manufacturing of its platforms for drone interception, electronic warfare and ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance].

French president Emmanuel Macron praised the announcement on social media, calling it “excellent news for our strategic autonomy, for the technological superiority of our armed forces in the field of AI-activated defense drones, as well as for our economy.”

While important for France, this strategic play isn’t exclusive. Harmattan AI’s stated goal of “empowering the armed forces of liberal democracies and their allies” leaves some wiggle room for the company to sell its technology beyond France and Europe. The company is already putting this into action: it will exhibit at the World Defense Show in Riyadh next month, and is expanding its U.S. team.

The company claimed a new record in July when it was awarded a “multi-million-U.S. dollar contract by a NATO government” for the delivery of AI-enabled small drones, just one year after its founding. But according to its CEO and co-founder, Mouad M’Ghari, Harmattan AI is now “entering a new phase of scale” as it seeks to “ramp-up manufacturing.”

In that same LinkedIn post, the entrepreneur disclosed that the new funding comes in addition to the $42 million Harmattan AI had raised to date, including a seed round led by Atlantic and a Series A led by FirstMark, with other backers including Motier Ventures and Sisyphus Ventures.

Meanwhile, Harmattan AI’s CTO and co-founder Martin de Gourcuff chose a different note with political undertones. “As the international order goes off the rails,” he wrote, “we are entering an era where, increasingly, power precedes law. A reversal of the civilized world we strive for. Harmattan AI exists to protect our values and flip that relationship back, as power without law is just mere violence.”

            <div id="article-text">After five years of building an edtech company, Nathan Nwachuku, 22, realized that Africa was at a crossroads. The continent is undergoing rapid industrialization, he told TechCrunch. There is money, opportunity, and a young, driven population. He figured, soon enough, the continent was on the “edge of an industrial revolution.”

“At the same time,” he said, he felt the continent still struggled to address what was one of its biggest Achilles heels. “Terrorism and insecurity.” Africa has more terror-related deaths than any region in the world, and it is this problem that could slow down — or even stop completely — the growth of the region, Nwachuku said.

He teamed up with a friend, Maxwell Maduka, 24, and launched Terra Industries, a defense company that designs infrastructure and autonomous systems to help governments and organizations monitor and respond to threats. The company announced Monday that it emerged from stealth with a $11.75 million round led by Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC.

Others in the round include Valor Equity Partners, Lux Capital, SV Angel, and Nova Global. The company previously raised an $800,000 pre-seed round, and Nwachuku said others took much interest in the company after it appeared on CNN. African investors in the company include Tofino Capital, Kaleo Ventures, and DFS Lab.

“The goal is to build Africa’s first defense prime, to build autonomous defense systems and other systems to protect our critical infrastructure and resources from armed attacks,” Nwachuku, the company’s CEO, said. Maduka serves as the company’s CTO.

The team is stacked with military experience: 40% of its engineers held the same role in the Nigerian military; 8VC’s Alex Moore, who specializes in defense investing, is also on the board, and Nigeria’s Vice Air Marshal Ayo Jolasinmi serves as an advisor. Maduka also served as an enginner in the Nigerian Navy and founded a drone company at 19.

The company, based in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, took a multi-domain approach to product development, considering how to protect critical infrastructure from the ground, water, and air. For the air, the company produces long-range and short-range drones. On the ground, it has surveillance towers and ground drones. The company is still working on developing maritime technology to help protect infrastructure such as offshore rigs and underwater pipelines.

Terra powers its tech with its proprietary software, ArtemisOS, which collects, analyzes, and synthesizes data in real time. Once threats are spotted, they alert response forces (such as security agencies) so they can intercept them. “We want to geofence all of Africa’s critical infrastructure and resources,” Nwachuku said, adding that the problem is not lack of firepower (many African armies already have that).

Instead, it’s a lack of sovereign intelligence, as much of the intelligence that African countries depend on comes from Western powers, China, and Russia.

“We want to take the defense of our continent’s resources and infrastructure into Africa’s own hands,” Nwachuku continued. “We are the first truly Pan-African defense company.”

Terra recently won its first federal contract, though it said it cannot provide more details. The company makes money when governments and commercial customers place orders for Terra systems and then pay an annual fee for data processing and storage. Nwachuku said the company has generated more than $2.5 million in commercial revenue so far and is protecting assets valued at around $11 billion.

Commercial revenue comes from protecting private infrastructure, like gold mines or power plants. Terra said it is protecting at least two hydro power plants and several smaller mines, with most of the company’s clientele coming from Nigeria.

The company hopes to use the fresh capital to help expand and build more defense factories across Africa. It also wants to further expand its software capabilities and grow its AI team. It will open software offices in San Francisco and London, but the company said manufacturing will remain in Africa, with more factories opening across the continent to boost job creation.

“It’s clear Africa today is undergoing what I see as an epic struggle for its very survival,” Nwachuku said. “The only way for us to truly break ourselves from the shackles that have held us back for the last decade or two is ensuring the core resources, the core infrastructures of the continent, are entirely protected.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Known for its bidding-based approach to fares, inDrive is deepening its push beyond ride-hailing by rolling out advertising across its top 20 markets and expanding grocery delivery to Pakistan, executing on a “super app” strategy outlined last year to build new revenue streams and boost engagement while sustaining growth in price-sensitive markets.

The latest move by the Mountain View, California–headquartered firm comes as ride-hailing platforms face intensifying competition and tighter margins across emerging markets, pushing companies to look beyond transport for growth. Advertising offers a high-margin revenue stream that scales with usage, while grocery delivery increases how frequently users open the app. The combination could help inDrive reduce reliance on ride commissions while reinforcing its core mobility business.

InDrive has built its position on affordability, using a peer-to-peer negotiation model that lets riders and drivers agree on fares directly rather than relying on fixed pricing. It nonetheless operates in a crowded market alongside global players such as Uber and local micro-commuting options including taxis and autorickshaws, prompting the company to look beyond rides alone. That backdrop shaped inDrive’s “super app” strategy, aimed at adding higher-frequency services such as grocery delivery in frontier and emerging markets.

Advertising on inDrive is being rolled out across markets including Mexico, Colombia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Egypt, and Morocco. The rollout follows mid-2025 tests that delivered hundreds of millions of impressions and drew interest from global consumer brands and banks, said Andries Smit, inDrive’s chief growth business officer, in an interview.

The advertising business will initially focus on placements within the app, including during the waiting period after a ride is booked and while passengers are en route, moments that generate high engagement and sustained attention, Smit told TechCrunch.

In-car and on-vehicle advertising are part of the longer-term roadmap. However, Smit said inDrive plans to prioritise in-app formats through 2026, citing operational complexity around on-car advertising in emerging markets and stronger early returns from digital placements.

The focus on in-app advertising dovetails with inDrive’s push into groceries, a higher-frequency use case where the company expects to generate stronger engagement and advertising demand than from rides alone. InDrive is scaling grocery delivery in Pakistan, its second market after Kazakhstan, through a partnership with local dark-store operator Krave Mart, which received an investment from inDrive in December 2024.

Pakistan stands out, Smit said, because of a combination of rising demand for quick commerce and inDrive’s own scale in the market. Grocery retail remains highly fragmented and informal, while urban consumers are increasingly turning to app-based delivery as more households juggle work and family responsibilities. Simultaneously, inDrive has emerged as one of the country’s leading mobility platforms, giving it a large, engaged user base to cross-sell groceries without the high customer acquisition costs that have weighed on many quick-commerce startups.

Since launching in 2021, inDrive has steadily expanded its footprint in Pakistan, with ride volumes rising nearly 40% year-over-year in 2025, while deliveries through its courier services grew 67% in the first half of the year, per company data shared with TechCrunch. The company views Pakistan as one of its fastest-growing markets globally, with particularly high usage in major cities such as Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad. Overall, inDrive operates ride-hailing services in more than 20 Pakistani cities and intercity services across over 200 locations.

InDrive’s grocery rollout in Pakistan will begin in Karachi, the country’s largest city and one of the company’s strongest markets, where users will be able to order daily essentials through the app with delivery times of around 20 to 30 minutes. The service will then expand to other major cities, including Lahore, Islamabad, and Rawalpindi, later this year as inDrive builds out supply and logistics with Krave Mart. The platform plans to offer more than 7,500 products — spanning fresh produce, meat and dairy, snacks and household items — alongside free delivery on orders above PKR 499 (about $2) with no service fees.

In addition to its rapid growth as a ride-hailing market, Pakistan has also emerged as a focal point for inDrive’s capital deployment. Of the company’s $100 million multi-year investment program announced in late 2023, Smit said the largest share so far has been directed toward Pakistan, though he declined to disclose specific figures. He added that at least half of the overall $100 million commitment has already been deployed.

“We’re seeing incredible potential in Pakistan,” said Smit. “Ideally, we want to continue and double down on [investments] as we see performance.”

InDrive’s growing focus on Pakistan comes despite broader investor caution toward the market. Venture capital and public investors have largely stayed on the sidelines amid geopolitical and macroeconomic risks, even as activity shows signs of recovery. Equity funding in Pakistan rose 63% YoY in 2025 to $36.6 million across 10 rounds, per a recent report by Karachi-based startup analyst firm Data Darbar — well below the $347 million and $331 million raised in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

However, the gap between investor caution and on-the-ground demand is precisely where inDrive sees opportunity. Having operated across dozens of emerging markets, Smit said the company is more accustomed to volatility and less reliant on shifting capital-market sentiment, giving it confidence to invest where others hesitate. With an established local business and a large active user base, he noted that inDrive can also help partners scale without heavy spending on customer acquisition — an advantage that becomes especially valuable when external funding is scarce.

InDrive’s push into advertising and commerce is underpinned by scale. The company operates in 1,065 cities across 48 countries and has surpassed 360 million app downloads, making it the world’s second most-downloaded mobility app for the third consecutive year, behind Uber, per company data.

Looking ahead, inDrive expects advertising to become a more meaningful contributor over the medium term, particularly as grocery and delivery volumes grow and create more opportunities for contextual promotions. Ride-hailing, which accounted for about 95% of inDrive’s revenue just a few years ago, now makes up closer to 85%, even as the core business continues to grow, reflecting how newer verticals are beginning to scale.

Groceries, delivery, advertising and, eventually, financial services are expected to play a larger role over the next three to five years as the company expands selectively across priority markets, Smit said.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/motional-puts-ai-at-center-of-robotaxi-reboot-as-it-targets-2026-for-driverless-service/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly two years ago, Motional was at an autonomous vehicle crossroads.

The company, born from a $4 billion joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, had already missed a deadline to launch a driverless robotaxi service with partner Lyft. It had lost Aptiv as one of its financial backers, prompting Hyundai to step up with another $1 billion investment to keep it going. Several layoffs, including a 40% restructuring cut in May 2024, had whittled the company from its peak of about 1,400 employees to less than 600. Meanwhile, advancements in AI were changing how engineers were developing the technology.

Motional was going to have to evolve or die. It paused everything and picked option No. 1.

Motional told TechCrunch it has rebooted its robotaxi plans with an AI-first approach to its self-driving system and a promise to launch a commercial driverless service in Las Vegas by the end of 2026. The company has already opened up a robotaxi service — with a human safety operator behind the wheel — to its employees. It plans to offer that service to the public with an unnamed ride-hailing partner later this year. (Motional has existing relationships with Lyft and Uber.) By the end of the year, the human safety operator will be pulled from the robotaxis and a true commercial driverless service will begin, the company said.

“We saw that there was tremendous potential with all the advancements that were happening within AI; and we also saw that while we had a safe, driverless system, there was a gap to getting to an affordable solution that could generalize and scale globally,” Motional president and CEO Laura Major said during a presentation at the company’s Las Vegas facilities. “And so we made the very hard decision to pause our commercial activities, to slow down in the near term so that we could speed up.”

This meant shifting away from its classic robotics approach to an AI foundation model-based one. Motional was never devoid of AI. Motional’s self-driving system used individual machine learning models to handle perception, tracking, and semantic reasoning. But it also used more rules-based programs for other operations within the software stack. And the individual ML models made it a complex web of software, Major said.

Meanwhile, AI models originally built for language began to be applied in robots and other physical AI systems, including the development of autonomous driving. That transformer architecture made it possible to build large and complex AI models, ultimately leading to the emergence, and skyrocketing use, of ChatGPT.

Motional searched for ways to combine these smaller models and integrate them into a single backbone, allowing for an end-to-end architecture. It has also maintained the smaller models for developers, which Major explained gives Motional the best of both worlds.

“This is really critical for two things; One is for generalizing more easily to new cities, new environments, new scenarios,” she said. “And the other is to do this in a cost optimized way. So for example, the traffic lights might be different in the next city you go to, but you don’t have to redevelop or re-analyze those. You just collect some data, train the model, and it’s capable of operating safely in that new city.”

TechCrunch got a first-hand look at Motional’s new approach during a 30-minute autonomous drive around Las Vegas. One demo can’t provide an accurate assessment of a self-driving system. It can, however, pinpoint weaknesses and differences from previous iterations, and gauge progress.

Progress is what I saw as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 I rode in autonomously navigated its way off Las Vegas Boulevard and into the pickup and drop-off area of the Aria Hotel. These bustling areas are notorious in La Vegas and my experience was no different as the autonomous vehicle slowly nudged its way around a stopped taxi and unloading passengers, changed lanes, then back again, passing dozens of people, giant flower pots, and cars along the way.

Motional previously operated a ride-hailing service in Las Vegas with partner Lyft using vehicles that would autonomously handle portions of a ride. Parking lots and hotel valet and app ride pickup areas were never part of those operations. A human safety operator, always behind the wheel, would take over to navigate parking lots or the busy pickup and drop-off points of hotel lobbies.

There is still more progress to be made. The graphics displayed to riders within the vehicle are still under development. And while there was never a disengagement during my demo ride — which means the human safety operator takes over — the vehicle did take its time to nudge itself around a double parked Amazon delivery van.

Still, Major argues Motional is on the right path to deploy safely and cost effectively. And its majority owner Hyundai is in it for the long haul, she said.

“I think the real long-term vision, you know, for all of this, is putting Level 4 on people’s personal cars,” Major said, referring to a term that mean the system handles all driving with no expectation of human intervention. “Robotaxis, that’s stop number one, and huge impact. But ultimately, I think any OEM would love to also integrate that into their cars.”

            <div id="article-text">Sergey Brin and Larry Page appear to be reducing their presence in the state where they co-founded Google.

The New York Times reports that in December, 15 limited liability companies overseeing Brin’s investments and interests were terminated or converted into Nevada entities. Those include LLCs that manage one of his superyachts and his interest in a private terminal at the San Jose International Airport.

Similarly, 45 LLCs associated with Page have recently become inactive or moved out of state, and a trust associated with Page bought a $71.9 million mansion in Miami this week, according to the NYT.

Clearly, moving is not a simple, black-and-white thing for the ultra-rich, and Brin and Page both still own homes in the state, the NYT says. Still, these moves suggest that at least two of California’s billionaires are indeed hoping to dodge a prospective ballot measure that would impose a one-time, 5% tax on individuals worth more than $1 billion.

If the measure makes it onto the ballot in November and actually passes, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in the state as of January 1 of this year.

            <div id="article-text">Instagram says that although some users received suspicious-looking password reset requests, it has not been breached.

That seemingly contradicts a Friday Bluesky post from antivirus software company Malwarebytes, which shared a screenshot of an email from Instagram informing users of a request to reset their password. The post claimed, “Cybercriminals stole the sensitive information of 17.5 million Instagram accounts, including usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and more.”

This data, Malwarebytes added, “is available for sale on the dark web and can be abused by cybercriminals.”

However, Instagram subsequently posted (on X, rather than Instagram or Threads) that it had “fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people.”

The company did not offer any details about the external party or the specific issue, but its post concluded, “You can ignore those emails — sorry for any confusion.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tulsi Gabbard, a combat veteran who detests military intervention, joined the MAGA coalition full of hope that Donald Trump shared her beliefs. Gabbard especially despises—or at least despised—the notion of meddling in Venezuela, a once far-fetched idea that she had denounced many, many times.

But it turns out that President Trump’s foreign-policy doctrine is not actually isolationist. Although he doesn’t care about defending allies or toppling dictatorships to spread democracy, he’s perfectly happy to intervene overseas to steal resources or simply to show other countries who’s boss.

Gabbard has had to swallow her principles, first when Trump bombed Iran, and then when he did the very thing she had accused the neocons of plotting: invading Venezuela to take its oil. As director of national intelligence, she is stuck issuing rote endorsements of the administration’s position. “Kudos to our servicemen and women and intelligence operators for their flawless execution of President Trump’s order to deliver on his promise thru Operation Absolute Resolve,” she wrote on X on Tuesday. Poor Tulsi Gabbard never thought the leopards would eat Nicolás Maduro’s face.

Read: Trump is suddenly looking a lot smaller

There’s good reason for Gabbard to toe the party line—resigning would do nothing to advance either her policy agenda or her employment prospects. But millions of people who voted for Trump for reasons similar to Gabbard’s, but didn’t bet their whole career on supporting him, have no such dilemma. They can simply drift away from his coalition. By all accounts, this is exactly what’s happening. Trump is bleeding support, notably among his newfound constituencies: young people, minorities, and populists who distrust the system.

Trump has expressed bewilderment that his approval ratings could be so low given the breadth of change he has enacted. “I wish you could explain to me what the hell is going on with the mind of the public,” he complained at a recent gathering of House Republicans. “We’ve had the most successful first year of any president in history, and it should be a positive.”

In the president’s mind, he is living his best, Trumpiest life, and the public ought to be rewarding him for it. What he seems not to grasp is that he is losing support in no small part because he is accomplishing so many of his goals.

Winning national elections requires building big coalitions, including with groups that disagree with one another. Trump has a rare and underestimated talent for finessing these internal fissures. His rhetorical style is rambling, dishonest, and inconsistent, which makes it hard to pin him down on specific commitments. As a result, voters often see in him what they want to see.

During the campaign, Trump generally linked immigration with crime, leading many voters to believe that his plan was to focus on deporting criminals. This enabled him to make huge gains in Latino communities, which often bore the burden of accommodating the migrant surge during the Biden administration. Many of those voters have been surprised to learn that Trump’s immigration policy is actually inspired by the belief that the entire immigration pattern of the past half century was a catastrophic, civilization-threatening error, and that Trump intends to roll it back by unleashing a massive enforcement army that detains people who simply look like undocumented immigrants, with scant attention to due process.

Likewise, Trump performed well with low-income voters, many of whom expected or hoped that as president he would spare the social benefits they rely on. Indeed, Trump did not run on any promise to cut Medicaid or food stamps, and he discussed health care only rarely and in vague terms. But he has carried out the largest upward redistribution of wealth in American history, and he is taking health insurance from millions of Americans.

Those reversals might have been predictable to people who had been paying close attention to policy. What has been more surprising is Trump’s alienation of voters who are sometimes described as being “anti-system”—people who distrust authority and often gravitate toward conspiracy theories. Those voters are disproportionately young and male, and they get their news from mostly untraditional sources, such as Joe Rogan and Nick Fuentes. Their embrace of Trump had appeared to signal a durable expansion of the Republican coalition.

Trump, however, has squandered their trust. These anti-establishment voters wanted the Epstein files released, and they believed the promises of FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi that they would be. Trump has instead engaged in a clumsy cover-up, insisting that the files are both a fantastical hoax devised by his enemies and also too boring to even merit discussion.

The president also purported to champion free speech. Trump is no civil libertarian, yet he managed to present a contrast to a scolding moralism that had spread through much of American culture, especially schools and Hollywood. His willingness to offend the sensibilities of liberal elites gave him a sort of outlaw appeal.

In office, though, Trump has relentlessly cracked down on the speech that he opposes, hunting down students who criticized Israel and targeting anyone who failed to discuss Charlie Kirk’s death in sufficiently reverent terms. Voters have noticed this hypocrisy, and polling has shown that a majority believed that Trump had restricted free speech.

Trump’s embrace of a neo-imperialist foreign policy is likely to further alienate those anti-system voters. People like Gabbard, who served in Iraq and Kuwait, saw overseas conflicts as costly distractions from domestic problems, and viewed American military power with deep cynicism. Trump’s moves to bomb Iran, invade Venezuela, and threaten Greenland—his policy of speaking very loudly and carrying a big stick—make it hard to convince his supporters that he’s focusing on domestic concerns.

A through line connects these apparent reversals. Trump is alienating anti-system voters because he now controls the system. His appeal lay in his opposition to established power, but now that he has it, he is flexing it gleefully. He is the warmonger, the censor, the face of the Epstein cover-up.

It is hard to remain an outsider while holding the world’s most powerful job. But Trump seems not to have anticipated this, in part because he had far less trouble maintaining his anti-establishment identity in his first term. He managed this because that term consisted mainly of failures. Some of these failures were traditional legislative setbacks, such as the defeat of his bid to repeal Obamacare and his inability to pass the infrastructure bill that he had promised. But Trump also suffered an unusual inability to direct his own executive branch. He publicly entertained a stream of wild-sounding ideas, such as firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller and taking foreign oil, that he could not see through. His presidency ended in humiliation when he could not persuade Mike Pence to reject the election results.

Read: Donald Trump is a lamer duck than ever

These setbacks not only spared the country the full brunt of Trumpism; they also positioned Trump as a kind of outsider within his own presidency. Trump’s bond with anti-system voters remained intact because he was constantly expressing his anger that the system was working to undermine him. He fought the law and the law won.

Trump is no longer making this complaint about the established forces working against him, because he has solved this problem. His presidency is filled with loyalists. He has largely overcome any reluctance that officials might have had in carrying out his most unethical or illegal demands. He can’t present himself as anti-system, because he has become the system.

Trump relishes this power and glories in making it as visible as possible. He has duly torn down a section of the White House, staged an Army parade on his birthday, put his name on the Kennedy Center, and so on. It is as if he wakes up every morning with a new plan for getting across the idea I’m in charge now.

Trump seems to assume that voters share his own worship of power. His most intense fans may revel in his displays of dominance, but his least attached supporters—the ones who turned him from a loser in 2020 to a winner in 2024—are recoiling.</div>

            <h2>The Golden Globes Tried to Have It Both Ways</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/golden-globes-2026-winners-hamnet-one-battle-after-another/685582/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During Sunday night’s Golden Globes, the host Nikki Glaser expertly ribbed the nominees in her opening monologue. Beaming presenters read their lines off teleprompters. Some winners cried as they thanked their loved ones. The ceremony ran long.

This was business as usual, in other words. Though the Globes have developed a reputation for being a boozy affair, those inside the ballroom seemed determined to generate a polite atmosphere. Hollywood is undergoing plenty of turbulence—a month ago, Netflix struck a deal to purchase Warner Bros., and a month from now, the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA will enter into a fresh round of contract talks that could lead to another strike—but Glaser delivered only light jokes about the industry’s precarity. A few attendees wore tiny pins that read “Be Good” in honor of Renee Nicole Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE agent last week in Minneapolis. The winners who mentioned politics in their acceptance speeches opted for broader messages, describing how “we live in a very divided country” and urging “a shared humanity.” The night was a far cry from boisterous past ceremonies that also took place in times of turmoil, and farther still from the work that was being honored.

The evening’s final two film winners captured the apparent tension between defining Hollywood as a place for escapism and acknowledging real-world uncertainty. The Best Motion Picture—Musical or Comedy winner One Battle After Another, Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland, is a propulsive thriller about a former revolutionary, who is thrust back into his previous lifestyle to save his daughter. The Best Motion Picture—Drama winner Hamnet, Chloé Zhao’s take on Maggie O’Farrell’s novel imagining the hidden origins of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, is a potent tearjerker about art’s transformative power. Both movies are made by auteur filmmakers; both offer cinematic visions of best sellers. But while One Battle After Another touches, as my colleague David Sims put it, a “raw nerve” in its examination of the costs of American political violence, Hamnet is its opposite in scope and tone: a formal, intimate period piece about the Bard and his personal tragedy.

Anointing this pair of films came across like a deliberate choice. Taken together, they allowed voters to split the difference between making a point about the world Hollywood faces and recusing themselves from doing so. One Battle After Another was the most feted film of the night—it scored four trophies, including Best Director for Anderson—yet it was the somber Hamnet that closed the evening as the winner of the last category presented.

As a result, One Battle After Another’s triumphs at the Globes didn’t feel much like a coronation. Instead, last night’s remarkably muted ceremony at times seemed unsure of what it was meant to celebrate at all. The event is ostensibly meant to recognize the industry’s creative talent, yet it didn’t broadcast one of the craft categories, Best Original Score, which went to the Sinners composer Ludwig Göransson. The evening is also supposed to represent the tastes of the Globes voting body—which is composed of international members of the press—yet the only speech cut short by music was that of Kleber Mendonça Filho, the director of the Best Non-English Film winner, The Secret Agent. Even the freshly added Podcast category offered a confusing sample of what constituted quality: chitchat shows hosted by celebrities and a news program from NPR.

Late in the night, the comedian Wanda Sykes cut through the monotony and brought some sharpness to the stage. As she accepted the Best Performance in Stand-Up Comedy trophy for the absent Ricky Gervais, she thanked the trans community on his behalf, in a pointed jab at Gervais’s history of offensive joke-making. Fiery moments such as hers were few and far between, though. The ceremony was dominated by winners that had much more of substance to say on-screen than at the podium. Most of the awarded films apart from Hamnet, including The Secret Agent, If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, Marty Supreme, and Sinners, are defined by a sense of urgency; the same goes for the TV shows honored, such as The Studio, The Pitt, and Adolescence. But with a handful of exceptions—such as Teyana Taylor, who won for her performance in One Battle After Another, punctuating her speech with a rallying cry for her “brown sisters and little brown girls” to remember that “our softness is not a liability”—those in the ballroom seemed incapable of finding much of a spark.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Timothée Chalamet’s promotional campaign for his new film Marty Supreme has been a little unconventional thus far. Staged Zoom sessions. Promotional blimp work. A lot of chatter about a jacket nobody can buy. When Chalamet did The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, he was flanked by an entourage of people with giant orange ping-pongs for heads. The strategy has worked—the film is doing well at the box office—but Chalamet’s energy has vibed uncomfortably with the fusty atmosphere of awards-season campaigning, where glad-handing with showbiz retirees and eating rubber chicken at galas is still very much the norm.

Chalamet seems to have clocked that dissonance, and his speech at tonight’s Golden Globes (where he won for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Motion Picture—Musical or Comedy) was tellingly subdued despite the show’s notoriety for messy, drunken speech-giving. “My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up: Always be grateful for what you have,” he said, after tossing off a few jokes about the movie’s crowded cast and the presence of Shark Tank’s “Mr. Wonderful,” Kevin O’Leary, who plays a villainous businessman in Marty Supreme. “It’s allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty-handed, my head held high, grateful just to be here, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say those moments didn’t make this moment that much sweeter.”

It was a perfectly lovely sentiment that just sounded a tad jarring coming from a celebrity who has been delightfully un-humble over the years. After some noteworthy supporting turns as a teen actor, Chalamet burst to fame at the age of 21 with Call Me By Your Name. Since then, he has grown into a unique A-lister, finding a variety of big-budget projects that fit his skinny frame and delicate screen presence, among them the Dune films, Wonka, and the Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. He has every reason to swagger, but that’s just not something that happens at award shows, where faux-humble surprise is always the order of the day.

Read: The blockbuster that Hollywood was afraid to make

That’s what made Chalamet’s tactics last year, when he was campaigning for A Complete Unknown, stick out so sorely. “I know we’re in a subjective business, but the truth is, I’m really in pursuit of greatness,” he said when he won the SAG Award for Best Actor. “I know people don’t usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats. I’m inspired by the greats.” He then threw out some names that inspire him: Daniel Day-Lewis, Marlon Brando, Viola Davis, Michael Jordan, Michael Phelps. It was memorable stuff, but Oscar pundits pointed out that while Chalamet was yapping like an ESPN talking head, his rival Adrien Brody was working Hollywood parties. Brody, eventually, ended up with the Oscar for his turn in The Brutalist.

With Chalamet’s aggressive and surreal approach to selling Marty Supreme, it looked like he was staying true to himself, whether or not Oscar voters could handle it. But then at last week’s Critics Choice Awards (another televised show that serves as an Oscar predictor), a slightly more demure Chalamet took the stage upon winning Best Actor. He thanked his fellow nominees by name; he thanked Marty Supreme’s director, Josh Safdie; he thanked his partner, Kylie Jenner, saying, “I love you. I couldn’t do this without you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”

Classic stuff—and the kind of stuff he’s avoided. Chalamet didn’t really spotlight Jenner during last year’s awards tour, but this year she’s been front and center, getting another thank-you during the Globes speech. Gone is the lovably hyped-up guy pitching exasperated marketing executives about blimp rentals. In the parlance of political thinking, he’s now pivoting to the center after winning the primary. Given that his most major competition in Best Actor is probably coming from Leonardo DiCaprio, the star of One Battle After Another, it makes some historical sense, too. DiCaprio didn’t win an Oscar for decades, missing for hits including The Aviator, Blood Diamond, and The Wolf of Wall Street. When he finally collected, for The Revenant, it was by contritely playing the awards-season game, going to the dinners, and giving many dutiful speeches acknowledging the work he’d done to get to this moment. Now it might be Chalamet’s turn to do the same.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/02/trump-federal-worker-layoffs-interviews/685321/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Donald Trump’s destruction of the civil service is a tragedy not just for the roughly 300,000 workers who have been discarded, but for an entire nation.

The purge began late Friday night, four days after Donald Trump returned to the White House. Seventeen inspectors general—internal watchdogs embedded throughout the federal government—received emails notifying them of their termination. Three weeks later came the Valentine’s Day Massacre: the ousting of tens of thousands of federal employees with little discernible pattern, across agencies and across the country. By April, entire departments—the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—had been gutted.

Workers the administration couldn’t fire were coerced into leaving on their own. Toxicity became HR policy. Employees received an email with the subject line “Fork in the Road.” It offered eight months’ pay to anyone who resigned, and no assurances of job security to those who stayed. A follow-up email encouraged them “to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.” At the end of Trump’s first year back in office, roughly 300,000 fewer Americans worked for the government.

That number understates the destruction. When Trump anointed Elon Musk to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, he did so in the name of clearing out mediocrities and laggards. The bureaucracy does harbor pockets of waste and paper-pushing positions that could easily be culled. But the administration showed little interest in understanding the organizations it was eviscerating. Any sincere attempt to reform the government would have protected its top experts and most skilled practitioners. In fact, such workers account for a disproportionate share of the Trump-era exodus. Many of them accepted the resignation package because they possessed marketable skills that allowed them to confidently walk away. The civil service thus lost the cohort that understands government best: the keepers of its unwritten manual, the custodians of institutional integrity.

Grover Norquist, one of the chief ideologists of modern conservatism, used to fantasize about drowning the government in the bathtub. The Trump administration has realized that macabre dream—not merely by shrinking the state, but by poisoning its culture. It has undone the bargain that once made government careers attractive: lower pay offset by uncommon job security and a sense of professional mission.

The American government grew in bursts of reform, crisis, and optimism—not from the sketching table of an engineer but from the rough contingencies of history. The outraged response to a 1969 oil fire on the Cuyahoga River catalyzed the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. The failure to prevent the September 11 attacks gave rise to the Department of Homeland Security. This accidental architecture was part of the federal government’s genius. It nurtured corners of national life—declining industries, obscure sciences—that a management consultant obsessed with optimization could never properly value. It embodied the wisdom, as well as some of the imperfections, of American history. For all its flaws, the American state was a source of national greatness and power: It ushered in an age of prosperity and discovery; it made everyday existence safer and fairer. It deserves, at the very least, the dignity of a proper burial.

In the late 19th century, as the American government took on its modern form, a single word captured the spirit of the enterprise: disinterestedness. The duties of civil servants, who remained in their chairs as presidents came and went, were supposed to transcend patronage and partisanship. Their professional obligation was to present facts and judgments that reflected an objective reality—not to flatter the preferences of the administration in power.

The nascent American state aspired to become a branch of science. It measured; it mapped; it studied. After its founding, in 1879, the United States Geological Survey recruited scientists and experts from Johns Hopkins, Yale, and Harvard. Using the most advanced techniques, it tracked river flow to forecast floods and to irrigate the arid West. It charted mineral belts in the Appalachians and the Rockies, which supplied the raw materials for industrial growth.

In the earliest decades of the 20th century, the National Bureau of Standards established common definitions for such basic measurements as the volt and the ohm, making it possible to build and trade at scale. The Bureau of Labor Statistics compiled data on wages, prices, and productivity that became the basis for economic prediction. The U.S. Weather Bureau allowed farmers to foresee storms.

The spirit of disinterestedness became the foundation for a regulatory state. Armed with scientific studies, the government could intervene to prevent disasters, protect consumers, and guard against recessions. Out of that faith in expertise arose the Federal Reserve and the Food and Drug Administration. Granite and marble buildings proliferated across Washington, D.C., housing a growing constellation of university-trained specialists. In their research and reports, they described what became the shared American reality.

The flaws in this system were obvious enough, at least in retrospect. Data points might be objective, but the decisions drawn from them were not. Handing power to experts—on the assumption that they alone were qualified to exercise it—sometimes bred insular arrogance. When the Army Corps of Engineers built levees on the lower Mississippi, it inadvertently magnified the devastation of the floods it had intended to prevent. Federal policies encouraging farmers to plow the prairie led to the ecological catastrophe known as the Dust Bowl. Those tendencies, many decades later, fueled the rise of Ronald Reagan, who famously said, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’ ”

Yet regulators also prevented immense human suffering. Before the advent of the modern state, the economy convulsed with financial panics roughly every 20 years. After the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were created in the 1930s, confidence replaced chaos. Generations passed without bank runs. American markets became the safest bet on the planet.

At the dawn of the 20th century, American medicines were often laced with alcohol, opiates, or narcotics. Thanks to the FDA, those potions were gradually replaced by pharmaceuticals tested for safety—snake oil gave way to science.

The postwar era brought more triumphs. Following the arrival of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1970, which mandated crash tests and new safety features, fatality rates from car accidents were cut by more than 70 percent. After the creation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 1971, workplace fatalities fell by nearly 70 percent. The state smoothed the roughest edges of the market; it tamed intractable dangers; it made American life more livable.

In the vernacular, the federal government is synonymous with Washington. That conflation obscures the fact that roughly 80 percent of its workforce is stationed outside the District of Columbia. Still, there’s no denying that Washington contains the densest concentration of civil servants—and the story of that caste is a morality tale.

In the 1970s, Washington was a city distinctly devoid of flash. Even its most powerful denizens drove beat-up Volvos; its dandies shopped at Brooks Brothers. The elegant houses of Georgetown were ostentatiously weather-beaten. The children of wealthy law-firm partners and humble bureaucrats attended the same schools.

But beginning in the late 20th century, lobbying became a boom industry. Those law partners, who sold their ability to influence policy, began raking in seven-figure salaries. A gap in wealth—and lifestyle—started to separate the lawyers in private practice from the civil servants. They lived in different neighborhoods, shopped at different stores, sent their kids to different schools.

That high-end lifestyle was seductive, and it attracted many government workers who wanted a beach house of their own. But the surprising thing, really, was how many preeminent experts—scientists, intelligence analysts, economists, even lawyers—stayed in their government job for the entire arc of their career.

They stayed because the work allowed them to accumulate new skills, to test themselves in crises, to solve novel problems. At its best, government work supplied the rush of being in the arena, a sense of professional purpose—a higher meaning than most jobs can muster.

Until the purges of the past year, the U.S. government housed an unmatched collection of experts, capable of some of the greatest feats in human existence. The achievements of this corps bear legendary names: the Manhattan Project, Apollo, the Human Genome Project. These aren’t just gauzy tales from the past. After the National Institutes of Health helped sequence the genome, it funded research that turned that knowledge into pioneering medicines with the potential to treat hundreds of rare diseases. It kept refining technology to make those treatments more affordable—and those therapeutics have dramatically improved survival rates for illnesses, such as pediatric leukemia and spinal muscular atrophy.

Under Trump, the expertise capable of such achievements has begun to vanish. His administration isn’t simply committed to shrinking government; it sees career officials as the enemy within, an entrenched elite exploiting its power and imposing its ideology on the nation. Its demise is not collateral damage but the imperative. What took generations to build is being dismantled in months, and with it goes not just expertise but what remains of the shared American faith in expertise itself.

Bureaucrats extol their ethos of service. They describe government work as a calling. Thirty percent of federal workers are military veterans who sought to extend their patriotic devotion into civilian life. Even those who never passed through the armed forces cast their career choices in similar terms. A generation of bureaucrats, now in the prime of their career, entered government after September 11. They were moved to emulate the commitment of the first responders they saw on television. They felt an obligation to serve.

Donald Trump has betrayed those workers. By describing them as a hostile force, he’s questioned their patriotism—and robbed the sense of mission from their work. Employees who signed up to serve a transcendent national interest, who understood their duty as being to the American people, now find themselves instructed to follow the whims of a corrupt, narcissistic leader.

What’s been lost isn’t just a sense of purpose, but a body of knowledge—a way of making the machinery of the state function. Early-20th-century bureaucrats may have aspired to govern as if they were practicing science, but the reality is something more like craft. The American state, a product of compromises, is tricky terrain to master. Organizations duplicate one another; agencies are overseen by political leaders who arrive with minimal understanding of the workplace they will manage. Succeeding in such an environment requires savvy veterans who have learned how to operate such an unruly machine and can model how to do so for fresh-faced co-workers. By wiping out many of the bureaucracy’s most experienced practitioners, Trump has severed the chain that allowed one generation of civil servants to pass on the habits of effective government to the next.

Some of Trump’s firings have drawn attention, such as the peremptory dismissal of C. Q. Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, one of hundreds of military officers who have been removed alongside civil servants. But for the most part, the crumbling of the American state has unfolded as a quiet catastrophe. Bureaucrats are the definition of anonymous. Their prestige suffers because it is conflated in the public’s mind with long lines at the DMV, fastidious building inspectors, parking tickets—the stuff of local functionaries. So much of the civil service is devoted to long-term national flourishing—preventing disease, safeguarding financial markets—that its achievements go unappreciated.

The toll of the purge will become clear only gradually. When the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service loses the biologists who track bat populations, vulnerable species can no longer be rigorously protected. When bat populations dwindle, insects proliferate. Farmers will likely compensate by deploying insecticides, which government studies suggest can do significant prenatal harm. Government, too, is part of a delicate American ecosystem—as it erodes, crises that lay bare its indispensability will multiply.

Capturing the magnitude of the destruction is an almost impossible task. Statistics can convey the scale, but only individual stories reveal what has actually vanished, the knowledge and skill that have been recklessly discarded. The damage will ripple through every national park, every veterans’ hospital, every city and town.

Over the course of four months, I interviewed 50 federal workers, both civilian and military, who were either fired or forced out—who took early retirement or resigned rather than accept what their job had become. I wanted to understand how their time in government came to such an abrupt end and, more than that, to understand the career that preceded their departure. When The Atlantic asked their former agencies to comment, many declined, citing the privacy of personnel matters. In the name of protecting these workers, the government refused to defend the decisions that had upended their lives. What follows is their story—a portrait of the void that will haunt American life, a memorial to what the nation has lost.

By the beginning of 2025, there was a famine in Sudan, which meant that it was only a matter of time before the U.S. government dispatched Micaela White to the scene. She was America’s fixer of choice. Over her 16 years working for USAID, she was sent to manage the humanitarian response to catastrophes in Libya, Syria, Ukraine, and Gaza. Through street savvy and force of will, she could make the awful a little less so.

When White was brought into a crisis, she was usually granted official power to lead what is called a DART: a Disaster Assistance Response Team. Her improvisational skills were legendary. As a 29-year-old, she arrived in Haiti after the devastating earthquake of 2010 and took over an airfield in Port-au-Prince. Using a card table, she ran air-traffic control, prioritizing the arrival of search-and-rescue teams and turning away cargo planes carrying aid, which the broken nation wasn’t ready to accommodate. She said she worked until her feet were so swollen and bloody that she couldn’t remove her boots; she slept in a baggage cart; she lost 15 pounds. She imposed order on a chaotic situation so that humans could be quickly extracted from the rubble.

In 2011, White traveled to Benghazi with the envoy J. Christopher Stevens, who was later murdered in a terrorist attack. On that mission, she survived a car bombing of her hotel. She also managed to hire boat captains willing to transport food into the starving eastern half of Libya. Her persistence occasionally irked her superiors back home, like the time she assumed control of the Syrian DART without telling them that she was pregnant.

Averting mass starvation in Sudan didn’t require White to secure scarce resources. She said that when she arrived in Nairobi, Kenya, to oversee the effort, the United States had already purchased more than 100,000 tons of wheat and food products. But American officials struggled to deliver that aid to Sudan. White’s job was to find a pathway to get the supplies into the country. It soon became clear, however, that her most pressing challenge wasn’t the regime in Khartoum, but the administration in Washington. Trump had signed an executive order freezing USAID’s programs, a prelude to the agency’s dismantlement.

Over the next months, White watched as efforts to combat famine stalled. The administration barred her from communicating with the aid workers the U.S. had contracted with to operate inside Sudan. White was left with a handful of local staff, but then the administration stopped paying for their housing. White let some of them sleep in her hotel room—she amassed a $15,000 bill, which she paid with her personal credit card. (The government eventually reimbursed her.) DOGE cut off access to her email and her computer, but for some reason she could keep working on her iPhone.

American officials had managed to transport a stockpile of seeds to the country. But because the Trump administration had halted USAID programs, the agency could no longer fund the distribution of the seeds. White frantically tried to persuade European donors to take them before the stockpile spoiled. Eventually, Washington ordered her to return home. Thirty hours after landing in the U.S., she was fired.

In the years since landing a man on the moon, the greatest technological achievement of the American state has been the Human Genome Project—the mapping of the 3 billion building blocks of DNA. The project was international, but its central node was at the NIH. Eric Green, a physician and a scientist, was involved in the project from the start, and after it concluded, he became the head of the American genomics effort. Green’s accomplishment was to help make sequencing technology—once an enterprise that cost hundreds of millions of dollars—cheap enough for the average patient, enabling diagnoses of rare diseases. Under his leadership, the National Human Genome Research Institute advanced a revolution in medicine and a new understanding of cancer, because genomics could be used to analyze a tumor and suggest a treatment that might curtail its growth. On March 17, the Trump administration forced Green from his job, the first of five NIH-institute directors it removed. A Health and Human Services official told The Atlantic that “under a new administration, we have the right to remove individuals who do not align with the agency’s priorities.”

The nation’s tsunami-warning-system technology, much of which was created in the 1960s, was overdue for modernization. Corina Allen was overseeing its upgrade, which would have expanded its reach to newly discovered fault lines and improved its ability to anticipate flooding. She was fired on February 27, 2025.

A New York City physician and health official who got his start during the AIDS epidemic, Demetre Daskalakis communicated risk and allocated scarce resources—experience that enabled him to coordinate the national response to mpox. He resigned in August.

To connect with citizens in his diplomatic posts, Wren Elhai joined a Russian bluegrass band, played fiddle in a Pakistani rock group, and entered a Central Asian–folk-music competition. After taking leave to study tech policy at Stanford, he helped build the State Department’s new cyberspace and digital-policy bureau. He was preparing to deploy to Senegal when he was fired, along with more than 200 other Foreign Service officers on domestic assignment. Because of ongoing litigation, these firings have been temporarily blocked, and Elhai and other officers are on administrative leave.

On track to become an ambassador, Brian Himmelsteib served in Singapore and Laos while raising a son who uses a wheelchair. He returned to Washington in May so his son could undergo kidney surgery. Like Wren Elhai and other Foreign Service officers on domestic assignment, he was fired. While on administrative leave, he decided to retire from the Foreign Service.

Jason Robertson oversaw ski resorts and oil-and-gas operations across the Rockies, ensuring that private interests used public lands responsibly. He took a voluntary-resignation package in April, part of an exodus of roughly 4,000 Forest Service employees.

When the Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled an unsafe product—a potentially dangerous crib, batteries that could catch fire—Melissa Rivera Pabón posted the alert in English and Spanish. After she was fired, the office was down to one social-media specialist, who didn’t speak Spanish. A single mother of three, Rivera Pabón has struggled to find a full-time job.

Nadia Ford’s mother is a teacher, and her father works for Customs and Border Protection. She wanted her own career in service and applied twice to join the two-year Presidential Management Fellows program, which recruited recent graduates with advanced degrees and cultivated them for leadership. The fellowship placed her in a small office in Health and Human Services devoted to promoting “healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood.” She had never heard of the office before, but began to think of its work as her calling. The programs it funded seemed to address some of the core causes of social misery: One of them counseled fathers just released from prison; another taught anger management to young couples. Trump signed an executive order killing the Presidential Management Fellows program on February 19, 2025. Ford was fired several months later, along with hundreds of other aspiring civil servants.

The presidential pardon is the Constitution’s ultimate extension of grace. Liz Oyer believed it should not be reserved for cronies and donors. She visited prisons to explain how inmates could apply for clemency; at the Justice Department, her office then vetted the petitions. But the Trump administration had other designs. It asked her to assemble a list of convicts whose criminal history prevented them from owning firearms, so that the attorney general could restore that right. An associate deputy attorney general instructed her to add the actor Mel Gibson, who had a domestic-violence conviction, to the list. Because he hadn’t undergone a background check, as everyone else she’d recommended had, Oyer balked. Her hesitance marked her as disloyal, and she was fired on March 7. (When asked for comment by The Atlantic, a DOJ official pointed to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s comments from several months earlier, in which he disputed Oyer’s version of events and called her allegations “a shameful distraction from our critical mission to prosecute violent crime, enforce our nation’s immigration laws, and make America safe again.”)

There is no manual for soft-power diplomacy. Jeff Cohen’s education began when he was a Peace Corps volunteer in Bolivia. With USAID, he served in the Dominican Republic, Peru, and Afghanistan. He became adept at improvising programs that burnished America’s prestige. During Cohen’s last assignment, in Indonesia, where he oversaw a staff of 150, he persuaded a mining company and a church charity to help launch an initiative to fight childhood malnutrition. He ran projects to save forests and to stop tuberculosis. This wasn’t just a display of American beneficence: Cohen was acutely aware that he was competing with Chinese diplomats in a global battle for hearts and minds. On March 28, the Trump administration dismantled USAID, erasing more than 60 years of development expertise.

As a kid, Bree Fram dreamed of becoming an astronaut. After 9/11, she joined the Air Force and deployed to the Persian Gulf, where she tested new technologies to protect convoys from improvised explosive devices. That assignment led to her specialty: managing teams that built novel systems. (One came up with tools that could be used to take over an attacking drone, forcing it to fall from the sky.) The military kept sending Fram back to school, and her advanced degrees piled up. When the Space Force was created, she drafted its blueprint for acquiring the technologies of the future and ensured that new initiatives didn’t get smothered by bureaucracy. Her mission was cut short by a biographical fact: Fram is transgender. Upon arriving in office, Trump barred from service anyone who did not identify with their birth gender.

Just before Paula Soldner graduated from the University of Iowa, her mother handed her an application for federal employment. Two weeks later, she was inspecting a plant where eggs were processed for industrial bakeries and military bases. Eventually, she began working in slaughterhouses and factories that turned out sausage, bratwurst, and pork hocks, scanning for unhygienic practices that might spread disease to the nation’s kitchens. Soldner grew accustomed to the sight of blood—and to retreating to the locker room to wash animal innards off her uniform. A fierce advocate for her union, she was elected chair of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals. In April, she accepted the Trump administration’s offer of early retirement—as did many of her colleagues. According to the government’s own data, as of March, the Food Safety and Inspection Service had lost about 8 percent of its workforce.

Peter Marks was a driving force behind Operation Warp Speed—a name he coined—leading the FDA’s review of COVID‑19 vaccines at an unprecedented pace. Before entering government, he had been a clinical director at Yale’s Smilow Cancer Hospital. At the FDA, he surmounted regulatory roadblocks to advance gene and cell therapies, and helped create the Rare Disease Innovation Hub to spur treatments for often-overlooked conditions. When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took over Health and Human Services, his office asked Marks for access to a database tracking vaccine safety; he agreed. But Marks refused to give Kennedy’s team the ability to edit the data, which made his ouster inevitable. An HHS official told The Atlantic that Marks “did not want to get behind restoring science to its golden standard” and that he therefore “had no place at FDA.”

In the Navy, while serving in the Persian Gulf, Elijah Jackson lost one hand and part of a finger on the other. Doctors diagnosed him with PTSD. But he came from a military family in southern Georgia, and he still felt the tug of duty. Eventually, Jackson landed at the FDA, where he worked in an office managing IT contracts, procuring the data tools that scientists used to evaluate drug safety. By closely monitoring contractors’ sloppy billing habits, he said, his office saved nearly $18 million in a year and a half. On April 1, that office was eliminated. According to Jackson, more than 50 employees, who managed $5 billion in contracts, were reduced to two part-timers. A Health and Human Services official said in a statement to The Atlantic that “under Secretary Kennedy’s leadership, the Department has taken significant steps to streamline operations” at the agency.

When Crystal Huff, a Navy vet, went to pick up a back brace at a VA clinic in Fort Worth, Texas, in 2023, a woman at the front desk treated her with rude indifference. Offended, Huff lodged a complaint with the patient advocate’s office. A few weeks later, a supervisor at the clinic called to discuss the incident. Despite the circumstances of the call, he found Huff to be warm and loquacious. “I need someone like you, with your personality,” he told her, urging her to apply to fill a vacancy.

A year after that, Huff began as a clerk in the clinic’s prosthetics department, a misleading name: The department supplied wheelchair ramps, nebulizers, and ice packs as well as artificial limbs. She issued the equipment and arranged for it to be installed.

Huff, a Christian, aspired to a life of service. When she arrived at work, a gaggle of vets usually awaited her. During her time in the prosthetics department, she never met an ill-tempered one. In fact, she sometimes found candy and other small tokens of gratitude on her chair.

None of that goodwill, however, insulated her from DOGE. Because she had been on the job less than two years, she was fired last February, along with other federal employees classified as “probationary.” According to Huff, when she received her next paycheck, it was for $1.68, an apparent accounting error. Not long after, a judge stepped in to rescue her job, quickly ruling that the administration didn’t have the authority to fire probationary workers en masse. In March, Huff returned to the clinic.

On April 4, the VA offered employees the chance to voluntarily resign, which would allow them to be paid their full wages until September 30. Because she no longer considered the government a reliable employer, Huff accepted. In June, she left the VA, as did three other workers in her 12-person department.

But she said that when she checked her bank account, she found that the government had severely underpaid her again. After a week of frantic phone calls, Huff heard from a woman in HR, who informed her that her file indicated that she had been “terminated.” What does that mean? Huff asked. Despite having accepted the voluntary-resignation offer, Huff had been fired, and nobody had bothered to tell her or explain why. The severance she’d been promised would never arrive, and Huff was barred from federal employment for the next three years.

To pay the bills, she began delivering groceries, but the work was not enough to prevent her from falling three months behind on her mortgage.

No agency embodies government dysfunction like the IRS, where employees still type in data from paper tax returns. Merici Vinton, orphaned at 11, grew up on a remote ranch in Nebraska. After working on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, she met reformers passionate about using technology to improve government. She was a lead architect of Direct File, a free website that allowed Americans to file taxes—or claim refunds—without hiring an accountant or buying software. She was initially hopeful about the arrival of DOGE, thinking it might hasten the pace of IRS reforms. But when it became clear that Direct File was going to be scrapped and her colleagues working on modernization were dismissed, she resigned on March 11.

Mamta Patel Nagaraja’s parents, immigrants from Gujarat, India, owned a motel on the edge of a small Texas town. As a girl, she would help her father with repairs, foreshadowing a career in engineering. An internship set Nagaraja on a dream path at Johnson Space Center. She trained astronauts. She wore a headset in Mission Control. She helped design a rescue vehicle for the International Space Station. After returning to school for a Ph.D. in bioengineering, Nagaraja eventually moved to NASA headquarters. As an associate chief scientist, she helped guide experiments that exploited the manufacturing possibilities of space, where weightlessness allows for the precise fabrication of pure metals and silicon. She worked with a team that was building an artificial retina, on the cusp of entering clinical trials, and another that was creating carbon fiber in its strongest form. The Trump administration eliminated the Office of the Chief Scientist on April 10.

A demographer by training, Mark Gross was charged with estimating the number of people leaving and entering the country each year—the data he and his team produced tracked international migration down to the county level. Their numbers partly determined how federal funds were distributed. He resigned in the fall.

The Earth is never still—its axis wobbles; storms redraw shorelines—which throws maps and GPS data out of sync. Ryan Hippenstiel sent surveyors into the field to measure those subtle changes, preventing ships from running aground and keeping navigation systems accurate. He accepted a voluntary-resignation package in April.

A three-star Coast Guard admiral, David Pekoske brought stability to an agency plagued by leadership turnover and boosted pay for TSA employees, which lifted the agency’s sagging morale and stemmed the attrition of airport screening officers. The Trump administration fired him on Inauguration Day.

When models predicted El Niño or La Niña climate events, Tom Di Liberto sounded the alarm. He briefed city planners, private utilities, and officials from the National Security Council so they could prepare for the coming deluge or drought. When the Trump administration fired him, he was two weeks short of the seniority that would have saved his job.

Rebecca Slaughter pushed the FTC to crack down on companies that exploited personal data without meaningful consent. In his bid to rob agencies of their independence, Trump took the unprecedented step of firing Slaughter in March, along with the other Senate-confirmed Democratic member of the bipartisan FTC. (Slaughter has sued, and her case is pending before the Supreme Court.)

Ashley Sheriff led a team that rewrote the decades-old safety code for public housing so that it limited toxic mold and reduced the risk of catastrophic fires. She resigned in March.

Paul Osadebe immigrated to Texas from Nigeria at the age of 4. His life’s goal was to become a civil-rights attorney. At HUD, he wrote regulations that made it easier to bring housing-discrimination suits; he prosecuted cases using new authority granted by Congress to protect victims of domestic abuse living in federally funded housing. When the Trump administration froze hundreds of fair-housing cases and reassigned lawyers in his office to other divisions, Osadebe and three of his colleagues submitted a whistleblower’s complaint to Senator Elizabeth Warren. He also gave an interview to The New York Times describing how the department was shirking its legal obligation to protect civil rights and filed a lawsuit demanding that the department reinstate him to his old job. On September 29, he was told that he was being placed on administrative leave because he had disclosed “nonpublic information for private gain.” The outcome of his case is unresolved. Osadebe spoke with The Atlantic in his personal capacity, not as a representative of the government.

Karen Matragrano oversaw the Interior Department’s $2 billion portfolio of information technology, including systems tracking oil-and-gas revenue that Interior collects. When DOGE began operating in her department, it wanted unfettered access to the payroll system—which would have allowed it to circumvent HR procedures and privacy protections. Rather than comply with DOGE’s demand, Matragrano resigned. Her dissent proved futile: After her departure, DOGE gained access to the system.

Ukrainian broadcast news has never had a reputation for ethical rigor. Oligarch-owned networks tailored their reporting to serve their benefactors’ interests. Ruslan Petrychka, a veteran of Kyiv media who immigrated to Washington, D.C., made it his mission to model objectivity in the reports he produced in his native language for Voice of America. After Russia’s invasion in 2022, Petrychka’s service became indispensable. On highly watched Ukrainian-TV programs, his reporters would explain the American political system—without conspiracy, without exaggeration. On March 14, Trump ordered the dismantling of Voice of America’s parent agency.

In 2024, the NIH spent $38 billion sustaining research across universities and hospitals. Michael Lauer oversaw that money with a relentless commitment to transparency: Grantees who once buried results had to post them within a year of completion. Lauer also set up systems to probe sexual-harassment complaints in research labs, and to flag undisclosed foreign ties. He retired after Health and Human Services officials attempted to demote his boss and the Trump administration tried to freeze grants he oversaw.

Michael Feinberg was on a path to becoming the FBI’s top Chinese-counterintelligence investigator, the culmination of a career studying Beijing’s spy network in the U.S. Early in his career, the government had paid for him to study Mandarin for four summers at Middlebury College. Feinberg had begun to decipher the Chinese playbook. He’d helped build cases against espionage schemes, including a racketeering and trade-secret case against the tech giant Huawei (which is still awaiting trial). But on May 31, his supervisor told him that he faced demotion because of his friendship with the agent who helped lead the 2016 Russia-interference probe. (They went to rock concerts together and argued over the relative merits of New Order and Joy Division.) Rather than accept the demotion, he resigned.

Adam Cohen earned his stripes as a prosecutor at the end of the cocaine boom in Miami, where he began learning the structure of transnational criminal organizations—and how to dismantle them. For more than five years, he led a team of more than 500‑plus prosecutors and 1,200 agents at the DOJ. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche abruptly fired him in March.

Nearly 2 million current and former postal workers, along with their family members, rely on the federal government for health insurance. Shernice Mundell, an Air Force veteran, was the person they called when they felt that their claims had been unfairly denied, or when they were simply lost in the thicket of fine print. But because she was a relatively new hire, Mundell was considered a probationary employee. That technicality sealed her fate: On February 13, 2025, she was swept out as part of a mass termination.

On the other side of the world, a terrifying unknown illness begins to spread. A functionary in an African health ministry has a premonition of a pandemic. There used to be a default protocol for such moments of crisis: call David Boucher.

Boucher is a scientist, but he acquired the skills of an operator, someone who could rouse turf-conscious bureaucracies and nudge them to act as one. Within hours of that first call, he would mobilize the government to rummage through what he calls “the nation’s medicine cabinet”—all the stockpiled vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic equipment; all the treatments in clinical trials. If there was a plausible match, Boucher would arrange to ship it as soon as possible—getting on the phone with commercial couriers, alerting the ministry of health to what was coming and how to use it. The goal was containment: stop the spread of a disease before an outbreak became unmanageable, and before it could reach our shores.

To avoid the fumbling that tended to slow the government’s response to crises, Boucher built systems. During the Ebola outbreak in 2018, he chaired a working group that allowed scientists and health officials to update one another regularly. And after that emergency receded, he was the lead author of a pandemic-preparedness plan that would have developed vaccines, tests, and medicines for every known viral family. (Congress opted not to fund it.)

Mostly, Boucher careened from crisis to crisis. After Ebola came COVID, mpox, H5N1, and a string of more anonymous flare-ups. During COVID, as part of Operation Warp Speed, he led HHS’s negotiation of contracts with the pharmaceutical companies that the government had commissioned to develop vaccines.

The administration never pushed Boucher out; several officials even pleaded with him to stay. But after 10 years, he concluded that his job was no longer tenable, given the ethos and orientation of the administration. In late March, he resigned.

Soon after MaryAnn Tierney graduated college, catastrophe became her calling. She went to work for New York City’s Office of Emergency Management. On 9/11, she arrived at the World Trade Center just after the first plane struck and was in the lobby of an adjacent building when the first tower started to collapse. In the months that followed, she helped coordinate the removal of rubble from the site. Over 15 years at FEMA, Tierney directed responses to hurricanes and floods and oversaw the rebuilding of homes and communities. From her office in Philadelphia, she also managed planning for presidential inaugurations and other major events in Washington, D.C. Tierney was serving as FEMA’s acting deputy administrator when she resigned on May 9 to protest what she described as the White House’s reckless scaling-back of the agency.

While Ila Deiss was a prosecutor in San Francisco, colleagues praised her judicial temperament. When she saw the Justice Department advertising an opening for immigration judges, she applied and soon had a gavel of her own. The work was draining, often requiring her to set aside heartbreaking stories of good people fleeing bad situations in order to apply the law, which meant that they would be deported. Yet Deiss also reprimanded Immigration and Customs Enforcement lawyers for disrespectful treatment of immigrants, and the agency lodged a formal complaint against her. On July 17, she was fired without explanation.

Peter Garrett oversaw the hotline that helped patients find clinical trials, and he ran cancer.gov, which drew up to 100 million visitors a year. His office counteracted pharmaceutical spin and translated government data into clear language that reflected scientific consensus. Garrett retired in May. By then, the administration had fired most of his office. He once led about 90 staffers; he said two remain.

Jeffrey Hall’s job was to determine whether public-health initiatives were reaching historically underserved groups—not just Black and Latino Americans, but rural white populations, too. His office was eliminated.

Melody Joy Fields investigated police departments whose officers had abused the mentally ill. She co-wrote a report on a Mississippi town where police systematically arrested poor Black residents for minor offenses and then fined them to fund the department. When the Trump administration began assigning her colleagues to cases that had no connection to the office’s historic mission, Fields resigned.

With a pool of grants that topped out at just $6.5 million, Greg Reiner nourished American theater in venues far from Broadway. He funded playwriting classes for inmates in a Kentucky prison, backed productions for disabled actors in Denver, and supported early development of a then-fledgling idea: a hip-hop musical about the nation’s first Treasury secretary. After the Trump administration announced plans to shut down the NEA in May, Reiner took a voluntary-resignation package.

In early 2025, Milwaukee discovered that lead paint had poisoned at least four students in its public schools. Elizabeth Poole said that she was ready to descend with tests and guidance, but the Trump administration forbade her team from working on the crisis, an allegation that the EPA disputes. In March, she resigned.

Trained as an astrophysicist, Nick Hand used his expertise in data science to investigate the payment service Zelle for allegedly failing to protect consumers against fraud—an investigation that the Trump administration dropped. He resigned in the spring.

After 10 years assisting investigators working on cybercrime cases, David Maltinsky earned an appointment as a special agent in April—a promotion that required 19 weeks at the FBI Academy, in Quantico, Virginia. In week 16, the bureau fired him for an “inappropriate display of political signage” in his previous Los Angeles office. The signage was a rainbow flag—Maltinsky is gay—the same flag the government flew outside L.A.’s Wilshire Federal Building during Pride Month in 2021. When the Trump administration came to power, a colleague had complained about the flag. Maltinsky says that his supervisor and the L.A. office’s legal counsel had assured him that there was no issue, and that his supervisor had told him to keep it in plain view. When he explained this to the officials assigned to fire him, they sat in silence. Maltinsky has sued the bureau, claiming that his termination was illegal.

When Ejaz Baluch Jr. graduated college, he taught middle school in one of the poorest pockets of West Baltimore. The job was exhausting, and it provoked a question: How could such inequality persist? Baluch began studying to become a civil-rights lawyer. After a clerkship, he joined the Justice Department’s Honors Program; several hundred idealistic lawyers had applied, and Baluch was one of five accepted to the Civil Rights Division. He was assigned to investigate systemic discrimination in the Baltimore County Police Department’s recruitment practices. In 2021, Baluch helped negotiate a settlement that reshaped how the city hires new officers.

Soon after Trump’s inauguration, the acting associate attorney general announced that the Civil Rights Division would freeze its litigation. In April, Baluch was reassigned to the Complaint Adjudication Office, which he had never heard of before. It looked like Siberia, compared with his old office. He temporarily avoided that move because he had volunteered to join the administration’s investigation of campus anti-Semitism in the University of California system. But he knew that he couldn’t in good conscience work on that project after Trump appointees implied to him and his colleagues that the findings should be treated as a foregone conclusion. Rather than sacrifice his integrity, Baluch accepted a job at a nonprofit in Baltimore at half his government salary.

A Marine Corps veteran, Gregg Bafundo rescued climbers from cliffs in northern Washington State and evacuated a heart-attack victim stranded on a trail. When wildfires would sweep Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, his job was to scout for at-risk wildlife, then join the fire line. Bafundo was terminated; of the five members of his crew, none remains in their job.

Officials often failed to identify human-trafficking survivors with potential eligibility for asylum, until Katerina Herodotou rewrote questions used to screen for them. She was fired on May 23.

Using government models that forecast ocean conditions, Ana Vaz worked to protect the viability of grouper, snapper, and other species in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Fishing communities trusted Vaz; her science helped sustain the marine life they depended on. After she was fired in April, she moved to Brazil to work for a nonprofit funded by that country’s ministry of science.

At 25, Susan Miller went undercover in Moscow in the thick of the Cold War, mastering the art of giving KGB agents the slip. Before she turned 30, she was tapped to be station chief in Vilnius, Lithuania, followed by posts in Israel, the Czech Republic, and Malaysia. Eventually she led the CIA’s counterintelligence unit—making her its chief spy catcher—a job that required her to investigate Russia’s efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. After retiring in 2024, Miller continued training agents as a contractor. But she said that her investigation into the election earned her the enmity of the Trump administration, which stripped her of her security clearances in August and terminated her relationship with the agency.

Mike Gordon was folding laundry in his home office on January 6, 2021, when the television filled with images of rioters besieging the Capitol. Months later, he earned a coveted spot on the DOJ task force charged with bringing the insurrectionists to justice. A former high-school teacher, Gordon had a knack for commanding the attention of easily distracted audiences. He became the department’s closer in the highest-profile January 6 trials, notching a perfect conviction record. Eventually his bosses in Tampa, where he was based, recalled him to handle white-collar prosecutions. But even his winning record for the United States, and the high esteem of his superiors, couldn’t protect him. Attorney General Pam Bondi dismissed him without warning in June, apparently for the sin of prosecuting those who’d attempted to overturn the 2020 election; he sued the administration in July, alleging that he was the target of politically motivated retaliation.

During a long legal career in private practice, Michael Missal developed a specialty in internal investigations. CBS hired him to probe the anchor Dan Rather’s specious reporting alleging that George W. Bush had received preferential treatment during the Vietnam War. Bankruptcy courts deployed him to dissect the collapses of WorldCom and New Century Financial Corporation. In Missal’s nearly nine years as the VA’s in-house investigator, his office issued 2,500 reports and 10,000 recommendations, saving billions of dollars. He led the inquiry that uncovered a nursing assistant who’d murdered seven veterans with insulin injections. At one point, his office was pursuing more than 1,000 criminal investigations. Missal was one of the 17 inspectors general Trump fired four days into his second term. A federal judge later found that Missal and seven others had been unlawfully fired, but did not reinstate them.

Brendan Demich’s ancestors descended into the coal mines of western Pennsylvania and rarely emerged whole. A great-grandfather lost a leg; a grandfather contracted black lung; an uncle survived a cave-in, his pelvis crushed.

At an early age, Demich resolved to spare others that fate. For a high-school project, he shadowed a researcher at the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, a government lab devoted to developing new techniques for preventing explosions, collapses, and lung disease. That division offered him a summer internship, and then, after he studied engineering in college, a job.

Mining is far safer now than it was in 1910, when the government first began studying how to keep miners alive. But it remains lethal work, and the division employed many of the world’s foremost experts in mine-safety research. It housed an acoustic chamber, which allowed for research into hazardous noises; it kept a test mine, where scientists could ignite controlled explosions.

Demich belonged to a unit that sought to improve the training of the rescuers who respond to mine disasters. By law, companies must field their own rescue teams, almost always composed of miners themselves, who know the tunnels’ moods and weaknesses. Training sessions unfolded in high-school gyms or on football fields, where scraps of paper on the ground symbolized likely hazards. But Demich and his fellow researchers theorized that technology could offer a better way.

His unit developed a virtual-reality simulation that let miners practice the careful steps of rescue—deploying gas readers to track methane, probing roofs to test their strength. In the headset’s glow, they could rehearse, so they would be ready to act in a real emergency.

By early last year, the software was ready, and Demich was in the final stages of collecting data that confirmed its effectiveness. But it might not ever be deployed, because the research division is part of Health and Human Services, and the department’s secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., effectively closed the office in April. He fired Demich, along with many of the nation’s other mine-safety-research experts; they are now on administrative leave, thanks to a judge’s order, while a lawsuit challenging the legality of their firings wends its way through court. Because Demich’s employment status is unresolved, an unauthorized conversation with a reporter could become grounds for retaliation. He spoke with The Atlantic in his capacity as vice president of his union, not as a representative of the government.

Fluent in Arabic, Yael Lempert served as one of the Iraq desk officers before the war began there in 2003 and co-wrote the prophetic memo “The Perfect Storm,” which detailed the risks of an invasion. Despite her misgivings, she deployed to Baghdad to work for the Coalition Provisional Authority, and over the next two decades rose to the rank of career minister—the second-highest tier of the Foreign Service. As U.S. ambassador to Jordan, home to 2 million Palestinian refugees, she soothed the government’s anxious response to the Gaza War and facilitated the transport of humanitarian aid from Jordan to Gaza. At the turn of every administration, ambassadors ritualistically resign from their posts. Those resignations are ritualistically rejected. To Lempert’s surprise, her resignation was accepted on January 20, 2025, with no explanation. Without a diplomatic post, she remained a Foreign Service officer, albeit one whose employer didn’t seem to especially want her. Despite having successfully served in the first Trump administration, she concluded that her career had reached a dead end. In August, she resigned from the government.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A few years ago, I visited my childhood home and heard a surprising sound: the bright and bouncy music of the Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny. My parents are white Baby Boomers who speak no Spanish and have never shown a taste for hip-hop, but they’d somehow gotten into Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, whose sex-and-rum-drenched lyrics they couldn’t begin to decipher. The vector of transmission appeared to be the streaming service hooked to their smart speakers. When in need of a pick-me-up, Mom would shout, “Alexa, play Bad Bunny,” and make her Southern California kitchen sound like a San Juan nightclub.

Stories like this help explain how Bad Bunny has reached across language barriers to dominate pop domestically and abroad. Since uploading his first single in 2016, he’s broken U.S. sales records and claimed the title of the most streamed artist on Spotify in four separate years. His popularity, high standing with critics, and duration of success make him a peer—and sometimes a better-selling one—of such contemporary titans as Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, and Kendrick Lamar. Like them, he’s figured out that 21st-century-pop success is achieved by assembling excitingly hybrid sounds around an iron core of identity. In his case, that means performing almost exclusively in Spanish.

Many Latin American singers have enjoyed cross-over fame before, but none has done it in the way Bad Bunny has, or at the same scale. Before streaming, they couldn’t: Major-market radio DJs, record-label execs, and the media still decided what constituted the American mainstream, and conventional wisdom said that audiences preferred music whose lyrics they could understand. Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias, and Shakira cracked U.S. markets only after they started singing in English. Rare exceptions, such as “Macarena,” by Los del Río, didn’t even confer name recognition upon their creators.

But the internet has revealed popular desires that last century’s gatekeepers didn’t know how to exploit. Bad Bunny arose from a transnational scene—widely called música urbana—whose primary audience is Spanish speakers, including the 44 million who live in the United States. Streaming has also helped English-only audiences connect with his music, just as it has for K-pop and Afrobeat. This month, Bad Bunny will occupy a cultural stage once reserved for America’s classic-rock gods and pop goddesses: the Super Bowl halftime show.

Bad Bunny has touted his game-day gig as a triumph for Latino—particularly Puerto Rican—representation. And in plain ways, his ascendance contradicts Donald Trump’s decree, made last March, that English is the sole national language. MAGA voices attacked the “crazy” decision by the “woke” NFL to book someone who’s not “a unifying entertainer.” They cited Bad Bunny’s political stances (he doesn’t want ICE outside his concerts) and gender-bending fashion (his biceps look great in a minidress). But they also tend to express the view that he, though an American citizen, is somehow un-American. The conservative activist group Turning Point USA is planning an alternative halftime show; in a poll sent to its supporters about what they’d like to see, the first option was “anything in English.”

The truth is that Bad Bunny’s rise is plenty American, and not simply because it reinforces the pluralistic ideals that Trump’s movement seeks to diminish. Bad Bunny’s music has reached all corners of the planet because it is a state-of-the-art product; he is a victor in the ever more crowded race for the freshest and most broadly appealing sound. Language barriers have turned out to be yet another bit of old friction that the internet has sanded down to create a cosmopolitan, commercialized middle ground. Does what’s lost in translation matter?

From the November 2022 issue: Jaquira Díaz on the case for Puerto Rican independence

At the center of Bad Bunny’s sound is the rhythm that has ruled Latin American pop for decades: reggaeton, which marries dancehall and rap in crisp, minimalist fashion. Inspiring partying often with just a drum machine and a vocalist, reggaeton first flourished as the sound of working-class urban life in Puerto Rico. “This is where I was born, and so was reggaeton, just so you know,” Bad Bunny boasts in Spanish in one song.

He also grew up as a highly online Millennial at a time when American pop culture was ruled by Fall Out Boy’s pop punk, Lady Gaga’s synth pop, and Drake’s rap blues. All of those touchstones now inform his maximalist take on reggaeton. In any given Bad Bunny song, the melodies roll and sway between emo dejection and childlike glee, the electronic beats call to mind Nintendo games, and the low end churns as ominously as a lava pit. Bad Bunny’s vocal tone is unique: husky and flat, peppered with gasps and grunts, and shimmering with digital effects. He sounds like a ringmaster in a futuristic circus, and you don’t need to know Spanish to feel that a thrilling story is unfolding.

Indeed, Bad Bunny’s success with English-speaking audiences might seem to answer the perennial music-fan debate about how important lyrics really are. Any Rolling Stones listener oblivious to what Mick Jagger is yowling about knows that the art form’s pleasures don’t require intelligibility. And the ideals of enlightened music appreciation dictate that listening to music you don’t understand can be a mind-expanding exercise. As David Byrne once put it, “To restrict your listening to English-language pop is like deciding to eat the same meal for the rest of your life.”

Music, however, is also a form of communication. That’s especially the case in the tradition Bad Bunny builds on: hip-hop, in which narrative, persona, and wordplay are crucial. He raps with intoxicating fluidity, stringing syllables together in a steady murmur that encourages close listening. Translations get you only part of the way to comprehending this aspect of his appeal. His themes are largely the same as those of English-language pop rappers—success, partying, and girls. (Lots of girls: “Me gustan mucho las Gabriela, las Patricia, las Nicole, las Sofía,” goes his smash “Tití Me Preguntó,” a little black book in song form.) But as I read along, I can sense all the things I’m missing: puns, connotations, references.

Even some fluent Spanish speakers may feel similarly. He raps in a Caribbean dialect that is “full of so many skipped consonants, Spanglish, neologisms, and argot that it borders on Creole,” the Puerto Rican anthropology professor Yarimar Bonilla wrote in The New York Times. Bad Bunny’s success proves the cliché that music is a universal language, but it also highlights how universality can shear art from its social context—of which, in this artist’s case, there is a lot.

Bad Bunny has taken care to make his most important messages clear through not only lyrics but also videos, album art, and interviews. He’s more than a Puerto Rican Casanova with an ear for appealing musical pastiche. He’s also a protest artist, and part of what he’s protesting is the very process by which he has become so famous.

The title of his latest album, DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS (or “I Should Have Taken More Photos”), expresses a sense of loss about the culture he grew up in. The cover image is of two empty chairs against a backdrop of banana trees. The songs long for friends and neighbors who have emigrated. A short film released with the album portrays an old man visiting a San Juan coffee shop only to find that it has been gentrified beyond recognition—filled with tourists and digital nomads scarfing overpriced vegan quesitos. (The video also features a talking toad belonging to an endangered local species.)

Bad Bunny is articulating the surreal and sad feeling of seeing his homeland transformed by internet-supercharged globalization. The U.S. territory’s economy has long relied on tourism, but in recent years, a wave of laptop-toting mainlanders lured by the balmy climate and notoriously loose tax laws has driven rent increases and threatened to wash out the local identity. Bad Bunny’s new album, Bonilla wrote, is a “lament for a Puerto Rico slipping through our fingers: betrayed by its leaders; its neighborhoods displaced for luxury developments; its land sold to outsiders, subdivided by Airbnb and crypto schemes and repackaged as paradise for others.”

Read: The Bad Bunny video that captures the cost of gentrification

Bad Bunny seeks not just to point out the problem of displacement, but also to do something about it. He’s portrayed his refusal to sing in English as a proactive maneuver against the pressures of Anglo-assimilation. On his latest tour, he skipped the continental U.S. entirely, citing fears that ICE agents would target his concerts. Instead, he hosted a 31-show residency in San Juan, the title of which, No me quiero ir de aquí, means “I Don’t Want to Leave Here.” He has campaigned for the island’s independence and against its potential statehood. One song on the new album spotlights Hawaii—a tourist playground whose natives have been utterly marginalized—as an example of the fate that could befall Puerto Rico if its residents do not resist the influence from their north.

Yet, inevitably, Bad Bunny’s worldwide fame is bound up in the same cycle he bemoans. Though many tickets for his concert residency were set aside for locals, the gambit of course attracted outsiders to the island. Some made a pilgrimage to the supermarket where he once worked in his hometown of Vega Baja. One was shot and killed in La Perla, a poor San Juan neighborhood that began to attract tourists only after being featured in the video for Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s 2017 reggaeton smash, “Despacito.”

In this context, Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl booking represents an uneasy trade. He gets to perform on America’s most watched stage—expressing his vision on a grand scale in ways that could energize his fans and expand his audience. The NFL not only gets a popular performer to juice ratings; it gets to advertise itself to the Spanish-speaking world at a time when professional football is eyeing the global market share of soccer and other sports, eager to carve out a niche. Some might say that the NFL is a mainland-American institution with colonial ambitions, and that Bad Bunny is now part of that effort.

Exports, imports, migration, melding—the costs of these historical engines of change and progress are now the preoccupation of popular art and politics. In a strange way, MAGA and Bad Bunny are each responding to versions of the same 21st-century phenomenon: the decoupling of culture and geography, which has left so many people—wherever they were born—feeling strangely placeless and adrift. But the cruel absurdities and dark historical parallels of Trump’s nationalist agenda reflect how perverse, and ultimately futile, strident identity protectionism is in 2026. American country music has been catching on abroad; American listeners have KPop Demon Hunters fever. And the Super Bowl will be headlined by an artist who seems sure he can create something meaningful out of interconnectivity—something that’s his own, no matter how much it’s shared.

            <h2>What If There Is No Domino Effect?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-cuba-havana-venezuela-maduro/685579/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In November 1999, Havana’s Latinoamericano stadium sold out for a baseball game that was billed as a friendly rivalry between Latin America’s oldest and newest revolutionary leaders. Hugo Chávez had been Venezuela’s president for fewer than nine months when he took the field opposite Cuba’s Fidel Castro, who had led his country’s revolution 40 years earlier, when Chávez was just 4 years old. The crowd roared “Chávez! Chávez!” as the energetic Venezuelan leader trotted onto the field, dressed in white pinstriped pants and a red-blue-and-yellow windbreaker with white stars across the sleeves—a nod to his country’s flag. Castro, dressed in green slacks, a red cap, and a blue windbreaker emblazoned with the letter C, spent most of the night calling the plays in the manager’s box.

Castro saw Chávez as a loyal protégé, a fellow socialist traveler who shared his dream of creating the united Latin America that Simón Bolívar, known as El Libertador, strived to build as a soldier and statesman in the early 19th century. U.S. sanctions were stifling Cuba, and Castro was still trying to recover from the loss of his country’s top benefactor, the Soviet Union, when it collapsed in 1991. He saw Chávez’s ascendance as a turning point, the baseball game epitomizing the ideological union between Havana and Caracas. The relationship proved so symbiotic that it outlived both Castro and Chávez, surviving decades of geopolitical tumult and hostility from Washington.

Today, that relationship is being tested in new ways. The Trump administration has forecast that the arrest and extradition of Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, is only the first in a series of dominoes to fall, with Cuba perhaps the most important and symbolically resonant. “We are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on NBC’s Meet the Press the day after Maduro was seized.

“If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned,” he’d earlier told reporters at Mar-a-Lago.

So intertwined are the two Latin American nations that among the roughly 75 people killed by U.S. forces in the Caracas raid, at least 32 were Cubans. They were part of a large cadre working as Maduro’s bodyguards and in Venezuela’s domestic intelligence services to determine “who spies on who inside, to make sure there are no traitors,” Rubio said.

The administration has no plans to conduct any military operation against Cuba akin to its raid on Caracas, U.S. officials told me. (One official, sounding exhausted by recent events, just laughed in response to my question.) For now, those who want to see the Cuban government fall hope that Maduro’s removal will be enough to sink the regime that Castro’s revolution installed in 1959.

Many experts I spoke with are skeptical. Yes, the future looks bleak for the island of 11 million people, who are already suffering from a dismal economy and aggressive state repression. Yes, the regime appears fatigued, having lost the leadership of both Fidel (who died in 2016) and his brother, Raúl, who is 94 and has yielded power to President Miguel Díaz-Canel.

But Cuba has survived many periods of severe hardship over the past six decades, and it remains difficult to discern any real impetus for dramatic change, absent a major U.S. military attack (and the last time Washington tried such a thing, in 1961, it ended in disaster). There is no opposition capable of igniting change from the inside. The intricate barter system that Cuba and Venezuela developed to survive U.S. sanctions may be hard to unwind, especially because the regime in Caracas continues to reign, even without Maduro. Russia and China, though chastened by their inability to protect Venezuela, retain a strong interest in propping up Havana, given Cuba’s location just 90 miles south of Key West. And the oil that Havana depends on from Venezuela can, at least in part, be substituted by supplies from elsewhere.

“I’ve spoken to people in the Department of State, and when they say, ‘This is it, it’s going to collapse,’ my question is, ‘Explain to me how it’s going to collapse?’ And they don’t have an answer for that,” William LeoGrande, a co-author of Back Channel to Cuba, a history of negotiations between Washington and Havana, told me. “They’re engaging in a kind of magical thinking.”

When President Trump talked about Venezuela in the months before Maduro’s capture, he repeated three mantras: We need to hit drug traffickers; we need the oil; and we need Maduro to go. When Trump talks about Cuba, there are fewer particulars. Observers believe his central aim is to appeal to Cuban and Venezuelan Americans, who make up an influential voting bloc in the president’s adopted home of South Florida.

I saw this firsthand at a July 2024 rally in the 100-degree-plus heat near the tenth hole of Trump’s National Doral hotel and golf club in Miami. Over the course of nearly two hours, Trump mentioned Cuba more than a dozen times, eliciting big cheers as he drew parallels between socialism there and the views espoused by his Democratic opponents. “They are turning America into Communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela,” he told the rapturous crowd. He said he would stand with the “people of Cuba in their long quest for justice, liberty, and freedom.” Many people I spoke with had been born in the U.S. but raised by parents or grandparents who’d lost everything to socialism.

Watch: Vivian Salama on Venezuela and Trump’s warning for other world leaders

Enter Rubio, the former Republican senator from Florida, who was influenced as a child by his Cuban grandfather’s stories about the Cold War. Rubio was a driving force for the overthrow of Maduro and now is the chief intermediary with his successor, former Vice President Delcy Rodríguez.

For Rubio and many other officials from Florida, toppling the Cuban regime represents the ultimate victory of American liberty over Soviet-inspired Latin American repression.

After the military operation in Venezuela, Trump continued to speak about Cuba in terms of domestic politics, and in a manner less belligerent than he uses even when speaking about Greenland, a protectorate of a NATO ally. “We want to help the people in Cuba, but we want to also help the people that were forced out of Cuba and are living in this country,” Trump told reporters after Maduro’s capture, adding, “I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about.”

For all their connections and shared ideologies, Venezuela and Cuba have very different histories. Venezuela had a vibrant democratic society prior to the rise of Chavismo, the political ideology named for Chávez, who came to power less than 30 years ago. Although the administration has not made restoration of democracy in Venezuela a near-term goal—Trump didn’t mention democracy once during his Mar-a-Lago press conference after the Maduro raid—the country’s former democratic institutions could be restored now that Maduro is out, Trump officials told me. Venezuela was “an imperfect but long-standing democracy” with opposition groups and a civil society, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, a former U.S. diplomat who served in Havana, said. Cuba, meanwhile, has been a one-party Communist state for almost 70 years.

Venezuela also has a vibrant political opposition, which the U.S. worked with to pile pressure on Maduro. Cuba’s opposition? “They don’t even exist anymore,” LeoGrande said. He told me there is “nearly universal discontent” among Cubans with their government over the state of the economy, which has been acutely suffering since the coronavirus pandemic. GDP is at least 10 percent down from pre-COVID levels. But there is no counterweight to the regime that might help change the country’s direction. And many Cubans still appreciate the provision of state-financed health care and education, even if the quality has deteriorated. Should the regime end, Cubans may opt for reform rather than completely abandoning socialist practices.

“Cuba has human resources. They have a good educational system,” Brian Nichols, the State Department’s top Latin America official under President Biden, told me. “They generate a significant number of professionals, but their ability to take advantage of that is largely absent.”

Venezuela is also attractive to Trump because of its oil; the country holds the world’s largest reserves, estimated at 300 billion barrels. Cuba’s offshore reserves are estimated at a fraction of that, between 4.6 billion and 9.3 billion barrels. “Cuba is much less enticing in terms of payoff,” one U.S. official told me, although this morning on Truth Social, Trump said of Havana: “I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”

One of the rallying cries of the Cuban Revolution was Patria o Muerte, Venceremos, “Homeland or death, we shall overcome.” Cuba has had to embrace that approach constantly since Castro took power in 1959.

The following year, Cuba seized and nationalized American economic assets, including oil refineries, prompting President Dwight Eisenhower to end U.S. exports, save for food and medicine. His successor, President John F. Kennedy, broadened the embargo to almost all goods and services. Moscow, eager for a Communist beachhead in the Americas, replaced the U.S. as the chief economic sponsor of the Cuban regime, purchasing sugar at subsidized prices and providing oil on credit.

After the failed Bay of Pigs invasion—the covert White House plan to overthrow Castro using 1,400 CIA-trained Cuban exiles—the U.S.S.R. ramped up military aid too, deploying the nuclear missiles that sparked the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.

The Soviet Union’s deterioration in the late 1980s sent Cuba’s economy into a free fall. Havana resorted to extreme austerity, shifted to more sustainable agriculture, introduced market-oriented reforms, and accelerated oil extraction. It also forged a major new alliance across the Caribbean, in Caracas. By 2013, the year Maduro succeeded Chávez, Venezuelan financial aid and oil subsidies accounted for almost one-quarter of Cuba’s national output, though Mexico recently supplanted Venezuela as Cuba’s chief source of oil as U.S. sanctions constricted Venezuela’s ability to do business.

Russia, meanwhile, has revived its Cuban partnership, docking warships and nuclear-powered submarines at Cuban ports for drills, and providing the regime with oil and grain. In return, Cuba has dispatched thousands of mercenaries to bolster Russian forces in Ukraine. Havana also turned to China for military and intelligence cooperation, although both Beijing and Moscow may value their alliances as much for their symbolism, given Cuba’s proximity to the United States. Chinese and Russian support for Cuba “was always designed to poke us more than it was to do anything substantive,” Alexander Gray, who served as a top national-security official during Trump’s first term, told me.

Through the decades, the U.S. has maintained its blockade, now the longest in modern history. Otherwise, Cuba policy has ebbed and flowed. President Ronald Reagan, for instance, named Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1982. President Obama lifted the designation. President Trump, in his first term, restored it. President Biden gave notice in the final days of his presidency that he would rescind it again, but the measure never took effect.

Cuba’s complicated barter system with Venezuela—exchanging oil for thousands of Cuban doctors, teachers, sports trainers, technical advisers, and intelligence operatives—has endured. “What Cuba gave back didn’t have much actual market value,” Francisco Monaldi, a Latin America–energy expert at Rice University, told me. “But politically, it was extremely valuable because the intelligence advisers and political advisers, especially, were key for the sustenance of the regime.”

Foreigners greased the system. Companies in Panama set up by Ramon Carretero, a Panamanian businessman, for example, received contracts worth millions of dollars from Venezuela’s national oil company, Ivan Ruiz, a writer at Transparencia Venezuela en el Exilio, an activist group, told me. In turn, Carretero’s companies made payments to Maduro’s niece and nephew, Ruiz said. (In September, Carretero walked away from the mysterious crash of a plane used by Maduro’s regime for official trips to Cuba, according to local news reports and activists. His whereabouts are unknown; the U.S. slapped sanctions on him in December for facilitating oil payments on behalf of the Venezuelan government.)

On that night nearly 30 years ago at Latinoamericano stadium, Castro and Chávez, beaming and sweaty after the long-awaited game, declared their union unbreakable. Castro awarded Chávez Cuba’s highest honor, the Order of José Martí, named after a 19th-century poet—a leader in Cuba’s movement for independence from Spain.

The teams comprised veteran baseball stars from both nations. But as the game wore on, spectators realized that Castro had disguised some young professional players as bearded, older men to play cleanup in the final innings. The Cubans beat the Venezuelans, 5–4. As another U.S. official told me: “The Cubans always find a way.”</div>

Is feasibility. If 3.6% of steam users (130M total, hence 4.7M on Linux) find gaming on Linux feasible, then it is. With the recent crap that Microsoft is pulling all over the place, even people that were too lazy (like me) are seriously considering moving gaming over. And all other things (like Office, Teams, etc.) are less demanding on the platform. I expect a landslide to something like 20% at some time and then this will not go away anymore.

Slashdot is not pro-capitalism or pro-Communism. They&#39;re pro-Anarchism and pro-Fuedalism, more or less. In different batches and different people.

Collective bargaining for wages and benefits is a bad thing?

The only way your ilk would recognise actual extreme left is while being murdered by an urban guerilla. Because to a fascist everyone else looks like left.

Will the office close because of unionisation or did the employees unionise because they knew closure and redundancies were coming?

Considering that everything that was valuable in Ubisoft has been packaged and sold to Tencent and remaining company seems to be just the vehicle to slowly spin down the rest, it&#39;s probably the latter.

Yup correlation is not causation and all that blah..

But if you want to predict why someone does something look at their past behaviour. Historically capitalism doesn&#39;t like unions, they get in the way of control and profit.

We need balance in all things. You are not being made to work 7 days a week because of collective action in the past. Learn your history. Capitalism doesn&#39;t care about you, you are a resource and a consumer to be exploited. The other &#39;ism&#39;s have their own faults, but being totally governed by greed so someone can have gold taps in their bathroom is a shit idea.

Ubisoft can think up of many reasons to close a branch, it&#39;s up to the unionists to prove it was because of them getting too comfortable. Which they can&#39;t.In Canada in this case the burden of proof would actually be on the employer [justice.gc.ca]:(4) Where a complaint is made in writing pursuant to section 97 in respect of an alleged failure by an employer or any person acting on behalf of an employer to comply with subsection 94(3), the written complaint is itself evidence that such failure actually occurred and, if any party to the complaint proceedings alleges that such failure did not occur, the burden of proof thereof is on that party.

You are an ill informed cad and bounder. Unions are what got us the labor laws and protections we have. Without them we&#39;d be working 60+ hours a week, in dangerous conditions, for pennies. You need to learn some labor history.

A shorter working day and improved working conditions were part of the general protests and agitation for Chartist reforms and the early organisation of trade unions.

A shorter working day and improved working conditions were part of the general protests and agitation for Chartist reforms and the early organisation of trade unions.

To elaborate, if you look for the sorts of things that seem like they are causative, the big ones are war and politics. Some magnates like Henry Ford probably had a big influence as well. It&#39;s very difficult to tease out the causality, but based on how little mention unions get, it seems like they were at most a part of the conversation.

Now in most civilised countries (this may not include the USA)  however employees have legally binding - on both employer and employee - contracts and employers can&#39;t treat people like cattle or worse. And thats over and above any working condition legislation the given country may have.

It&#39;s probably the opposite. They went woke with their key titles (they made that hilarious NYC hate crime simulator in place of long awaited Japanese Assassin&#39;s Creed), and sales cratered.

So everything that was still valuable in the company, like the brands was sold to Tencent last year. Remains of Ubisoft seem to be a vehicle to just spin down a handful of remaining studios.

So wokeness killed the company in another way already. This is likely employees fishing for better severance as they almost certainly

The 14 principle characteristics of Fascism, as laid out by Eco:

1) &quot;The cult of tradition,&quot; characterized by cultural syncretism, even at the risk of internal contradiction. When all truth has already been revealed by tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement.

2) &quot;The rejection of modernism,&quot; which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the Enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system.

3) &quot;The cult of action for action&#39;s sake,&quot; which dictates that action is of value in itself and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with anti-intellectualism and irrationalism, and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science.

4) &quot;Disagreement is treason&quot; – fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.

5) &quot;Fear of difference,&quot; which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.

6) &quot;Appeal to a frustrated middle class,&quot; fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.

7) &quot;Obsession with a plot&quot; and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society. Eco also cites Pat Robertson&#39;s book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession.

8) Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as &quot;at the same time too strong and too weak.&quot; On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.

9) &quot;Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy&quot; because &quot;life is permanent warfare&quot; – there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to not build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.

10) &quot;Contempt for the weak,&quot; which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate leader, who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force.

11) &quot;Everybody is educated to become a hero,&quot; which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, &quot;[t]he Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.&quot;

12) &quot;Machismo,&quot; which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold &quot;both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.&quot;

13) &quot;Selective populism&quot; – the people, conceived monolithically, have a common will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will (though truly he alone dictates it). Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democrati

Umberto Eco is laying out the &quot;symptoms&quot; of Fascism, things that indicate that Fascism might be going on.

The underlying cause (and why it&#39;s called fascism) goes back to before the Roman Republic.  The imagery explains it:  The rod represents civil authority (by an elder).  The bundle of rods represents the elders uniting. The addition of the axe represents the military, which are young men (compared to the elders) overriding the traditional, civil authority.  This is typically due to war.Believers in fascis

I don&#39;t know what the politics of Ubisoft&#39;s management is.  But if one goes by most of the market, and these guys are as woke as others, then it&#39;s hilarious to watch this: bankrolling the Left so that they don&#39;t turn on them, while in the meantime, cracking down on Left-leaning work policies such as unionization

If, otoh, they were apolitical (this being Canada, I can&#39;t imagine them being Right-leaning), then what you are saying is perfectly true

Ubisoft the gaming company has been dead for a while now. Everything that was valuable has been sold to Tencent last year.

And this is shit tier mobile games side of Ubisoft. Obviously Tencent didn&#39;t want it. So it was probably in the process of being shut down when employees decided to unionize in hope of getting better severance payments.

Good for them I say. If you&#39;re an employee trying to get the most out of Ubisoft while giving as little as possible in return, you simply have the same attitude to the company as they have to you.

This is a silly and ignorant take. These employees produced valuable work, which is why Ubi acquired their company several years ago. These employees didn&#39;t ask to be acquired by Ubi, and didn&#39;t feel the need to unionise before Ubi acquired them. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to see that Ubi acquiring their company was bad for the employees, and that they were doing good work before. Otherwise why would the acquisition take place to begin with? Your take makes no sense and performs very poorly at explaining real

Why? It seems like we agree to me. I&#39;m not saying they were lazy, or mercenary. All I&#39;m saying is that if they were mercenary in the way OP suggested (organizing to get better deals when threatened with closure), they did nothing improper to their new owner.

Indeed, I misunderstood who you meant with &quot;they&quot;.

Keep up the good work! :-)

This tactic probably wouldn&#39;t work for all cases, but Japanese bus drivers strike by giving free rides [theguardian.com]

Instead of forming a picket line, protesting bus drivers in the Japanese city of Okayama have been completing their routes – but not taking fares from passengers.
The companies lost ticket revenue and still had to pay for fuel and maintenance...

Explain to me how drivers that refuse to collect tolls aren&#39;t eligible to fe terminated, union or no union?

If you ran the bus company, and your drivers pulled this stunt, how would you feel inviting the union in as your new partner?

If, for example, those Starbucks workers looking to unionize were to refuse to charge customers for their drinks, by what logic would Starbucks have to keep them on the payroll?

The risk you face with that is that even if your system is popular in the country and most people support the unions, anyone who fights against them can become a hero to those who disagree.  So there&#39;s always a potential risk - it&#39;s best to codify these things into law.

Tesla, early on during the &quot;unionization drive&quot; (which was actually just a tiny handful of people, used as a wedge by outside unions, rather than a real grassroot effort), despite all the headwinds from all the unions trying to block service

cool, that is why I do not have an office in any of the nordic countries.  I like being in control and do not tolerate someone trying to take away control, that is the primary reason I left contracts back in 2009 and went on my own, building my own tech,,searching for clients, eventually hiring people.  So to quit in search of control just to lose it eventually to other people does not work for me.

At this point I wouldn&#39;t even pirate a ubisoft game.

Always doing the least moral thing they can. Well, I have long since stopped buying anything from them. It would require real desperation on my part to look at their offerings now.

Perhaps it&#39;s people like you that are driving Ubisoft to close/consolidate operations?

I&#39;m not a gamer, but the comment section here is rapidly filling up with comments about Ubisoft selling off valuable chunks of the company and how they seem to trying to squeeze maximal revenue from players, and the players resentment it and are boycotting their products.

If that is the state of their business, it shouldn&#39;t be hard to document losses that inspired the shutdown.

I&#39;m not sure how Canadian unionizing works, but

Since you are not a gamer, you obviously have no clue about the overall quality of Ubisoft games lately.  They are shit.

By all means, unionize.  But don&#39;t expect to keep your jobs when you make shit games.

Union or not, you can&#39;t force a company to keep offices open just to safeguard jobs.

But &quot;We&#39;re simultaneously catching new bugs faster AND slowly working through ~5,400 ancient bugs that have been hiding for over 5 years.&quot; 

They&#39;ve also developed an AI model called VulnBERT that predicts whether a commit introduces a vulnerability, claiming that of all actual bug-introducing commits, it catches 92.2%.  &quot;The goal isn&#39;t to replace human reviewers but to point them at the 10% of commits most likely to be problematic, so they can focus attention where it matters...&quot;

What does that have to do with what I said?

How long to Microsoft, Apple, or the BSD people take?

Spectre and Meltdown, according to the Google AI, took three to four weeks to fix.

Seems reasonable to me as somewhat of a layman.

It&#39;s because you have to look inside, not &quot;on&quot; it. /s

Not just that, now if there are, shouldn&#39;t AI be able to fix it and apply those changes everywhere?

It depends on what you are looking for. The total time from the creation of the bug to its fix is important. A bug might be having adverse effects without being explicitly logged and known to developers (something like random disk corruption that nobody can reproduce - maybe it&#39;s a hardware problem, maybe it&#39;s software). Adverse effects include black hats keeping the bug to themselves. The total reaction time of the developers (e.g. once a bug is known how long does it take to fix) is also important.

I think that some bug scenarios are more complex than described in this article.

I recall working on a Bluetooth kernel crash more than 10 years ago. The crash was a race condition between 2 Bluetooth threads when the RFCOMM link was being disconnected. To trigger the crash, the execution order of the 2 threads had to be reversed from &quot;normal&quot; so that 1 thread freed the memory containing the reference counter that the other thread relied on to not free the memory! This was a case of inappropriate use of reference counters when an abrupt disconnect had to be handled.

The crash was observed under very heavy processor loading that caused CPU starvation to the Bluetooth threads resulting in an &quot;abnormal&quot; execution order. Static analysis suggested that the reference counter would provide lock protection because reference counters are used through-out the kernel&#39;s networking protocol implementations. However, the flaw is that the reference counter can momentarily go to zero to trigger memory freeing but a second thread can come along and add 1 to the reference counter despite the memory now being in a freed state.

Looking through the commit history revealed about 4 attempts to fix this issue by 4 individuals over a period of about 5 years. I had to remove these ineffective and misguided workarounds to implement a proper fix that completely removed the use of the reference counter and immediately delete the state memory as soon as the disconnect was detected. NULL pointer checks prevented any use-after-free scenarios.

Therefore, kernel bugs may go through several workaround fixes before the root cause is fully understood and fixed. So saying that a bug was resident for 5 years may not mean that no attempts had been made to resolve it during that period.

The story says half of the issues are fixed quickly. The actual research post (not the short writeup /. links to) adds that 30% are what they called &quot;self fixes&quot; and incomplete features being implemented rather than stable features with defects. Most developers consider this just normal development processes, not the dangerous types of bugs.

It doesn&#39;t break down issues by severity and frequency. Bugs caught in experimental features not used by anyone VS bugs in features

One.. Two... Three... decades. That&#39;s how long I&#39;ve been trying to get working video drivers. Every time I retire a Windows or Mac system, I try to extend its life with Linux. I fail every time. All the way back to the ET4000.

It may catch &quot;92%&quot;, but these will be the simple-to-find ones. CVE-level? Probably almost none.

as a customer mistreated by amazon, i would never shop there again. i can understand why sellers would be f*cking furious if their products were listed on amazon without their consent, particularly if their product descriptions were incorrect and generated complaints! that is defamation and should be addressed appropriately.

If a seller has no prior relationship with Amazon, then Amazon has no right to list their products unless Amazon purchases the products, takes physical possession of them, and re-sells them.Well your theory invalidates the entire concept of drop-shipping relied upon by the a world full of small businesses. Since the early days of the internet there&#39;s a lot of businesses which very much do not take physical possession of any products. Resellers that act more like purchasing agents and sometimes do so without direct relationships.

Oh no, what would the world be like without dropshipping?

This was noticed about 2 weeks ago by store owners. Amazon uses distinctive email addresses when placing the order so they can track progress, which allows store owners to reject the orders or refuse to accept them. Amazon&#39;s opt-out attitude is pissing store owners off something awful, so I expect stronger measures will develop.

Tell them Amazon has offered a refund plus additional gift card for messing up their order. Give them Amazons customer support number.

How will testing help? When driving it helps to simultaneously see far clearly and the dashboard instruments clearly. If I’m understanding correctly, the glasses won’t support that.

Products with this have already been developed and are undergoing clinical performance testing. Not by some random startup, but by established players. Also even the EC contributed 2.5million EUR in funding for testing such glasses.

This isn&#39;t some pie in the sky idea, it&#39;s an application of a very real functional lens design that is over a decade old, combined with eye tracking features developed for

If you can simultaneously focus on both far and near objects, you are definitely not human. That&#39;s not how eyes work at all.

> Another limitation is that more testing is required to make the glasses safe for drivingHow will testing help? When driving it helps to simultaneously see far clearly and the dashboard instruments clearly. If I’m understanding correctly, the glasses won’t support that.The tracking mechanism will estimate the focal distance needed for what you&#39;re looking at, whether that be the dashboard or the road.  The testing is needed to (1) quantify the estimation error and associated conditional probabilities and (2) the safety of the fail-safe fallback in the case of car driving.  The basic design is already there.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s mainly the testing that is needed, especially across all the different prescriptions, faces, environments, and uses cases.

I figure they reckon you don&#39;t need to see the dashboard that badly (Teslas dont even have dashboards).. and besides usually the speed is shown big and clearly enough that you can ascertain your speed or when something important like a tire pressure warning or check engine appears. I mean if you&#39;re that frigging blind you shouldn&#39;t be driving. Nothing important on any car display requires perfect version. Secondarily, what&#39;s the chances your glasses fail AND you get a tire pressure warning or something like

Dashboards are far enough away anyway to not run into problems with people&#39;s presbyopia anyway.  Even older eyes can see dashboards normally.

As specified, the glasses would support that.

This is a solution for presbyopia instead of something like progressive lenses.  Which kind of suck for driving because the dashboard isn&#39;t really close enough to be right for the &#39;reading&#39; part, but that&#39;s the part of your vision it occupies, and especially likely to be in the distorted areas to the sides of the lower part of the lense.

These glasses would, in theory, monitor your gaze and depth and adjust accordingly to compensate for the lack of your own abilit

There&#39;s no &quot;simultaneously see far clearly and the dashboard instruments&quot; as the other comments told you, sure it HELPS to have distance and near vision corrected (we&#39;re talking here specifically about a different correction needed) when driving depending where you look, but it isn&#39;t required or critical to operate the vehicle. Now many people would have bi/vari-focals because let&#39;s face it mobile phones but it isn&#39;t that much of a deal to drive a vehicle with just distance glasses even when you need readin

Certainly no problems that could be fixed by making them more expensive, heavier, laggy, unpredictable and subject to batteries going flat.

There you go, thinking selfishly about yourself again. What about the poor venture capitalists who&#39;ve invested millions into these companies, hoping to get richer? What about poor Amazon? Can you not spend a few seconds to think about their need for more money?

Ugh, I&#39;m generally annoyed by my varifocals.  Having to move my head around and do a head tilt if something is close to me but higher than nearby things usually are... And that distortion to the lower sides...

I&#39;d love a solution that worked in practice like these things claim to in theory.  Subject, of course, to it actually working well, silently,

They claim 22g, which would be a respectable weight.

I&#39;m not going to be getting on a wait/pre-order list or anything, but if they deliver as promised, I certainly

Yeah, working closely with vari-focals on something you can&#39;t put on your desk or in your lap is crazy house. Luckily a lot of mechanical work is anyway done half blindly and partly by touch because other parts or tools or your hands are in the way, or the lighting isn&#39;t the best just in the corner you&#39;re trying to work and so on.

It is mentioned in the summary. The stated difference is the Vixion product &quot;do[es] not resemble standard glasses&quot;.

I wear trifocals, I&#39;d be very interested. Failing to distance vision would not be a problem while driving. You are supposed to be looking out the window anyway. The dashboard is at the medium distance lens, the only thing at reading distance is the steering wheel and it&#39;s not interesting.

Presbyopia is a pain in the ass and at present the only cure is to rip the lense out and put in a multifocal and hope for the best.

You wouldn&#39;t wear them until your own reflex of accommodation is already failing.  If you have aged up into reading glasses, your eyes are already not focusing on their own.

From the looks of it, basically it&#39;s normal glasses that when it detects &#39;reading distance&#39; threshold, turns some part of the lense to reading glasses.  So it&#39;s like part-time bifocals, not something continuously adjusting to just the right distance.  Which makes sense unless you have a more complicated eye exam to get corrections across

&quot;powered by technology hidden within the frame that tracks eye movements and adjusts focus instantly — whether you&#39;re looking near or far...&quot;

If you&#39;re reading something, it will be able to figure out the distance and adjust accordingly. But if you&#39;re in let&#39;s say Colorado and looking across the plains to the Rockies, how does it know if you&#39;re looking at the Rockies or the plain? Or maybe a herd of pronghorn grazing on the plain?  What if you&#39;re looking into the viewfinder of a camera?  You want the object you&#39;re photographing to be in focus, not the eye piece.

That&#39;s an interesting question. Or, for that matter - what if you&#39;re looking through a window that is partially obscured / frosted / has decorations on it?

The distance lense on my trifocals works for everything past three feet out. The reading lens is good from 6 inches to about 16 inches, the middle lens is from 16 inches to the three feet including the desktop  computer monitor.

The mountains and the plain are at the same focal distance. It&#39;s not linear. A young person&#39;s perfectly functioning biological eyeball naturally relaxes to a focus of about 6 m (20 ft) which is fine for anything that far or further.

Thereâ(TM)s something called hyper focal length: the shortest distance at which a lens can focus and keep infinity in focus.  Aperture size affects this, so depth of field gets worse in low light when the aperture (or human pupil) is larger.  As for camera view finders, they have a focus adjustment.

But youâ(TM)re right: how will it know what youâ(TM)re looking at?  Look at all the photos people take where the subject is out of focus and the background is in sharp focus.  My middle aged eyes r

You are overestimating the precision. From reading, it seems more like it decides if it should be &#39;normal&#39; prescription across the lense or if it should change a lot of the lens to &#39;reading glasses&#39;.  Looks like a boolean. Basically bifocals with only part-time reading area, with the reading area made much larger since it is only sometimes active.

I suppose if you are using viewfinder and not a screen, you have a potential point, though I imagine the logic for the glasses could treat being within a couple of

Everything from a few meters to Andromeda Galaxy (the furthest you can regularly see with the naked eye) is the same focus for the human eye.

If you look through a camera viewfinder you take out the glasses and use the camera viewfinder diopter adjustment. You don&#39;t need to adjust your eyes/glasses to see a clear image, just the camera focus itself depending where the subject is (this has nothing to do with your eyesight you need to do it anyway for a sharp picture).

Sounds like the intent is that when the battery runs out, it changes from auto-bifocal to just plain glasses. Not exactly a horrible outcome...

As described, it sounds like they have some typical prescription, and then just like bifocals there&#39;s a near vision adjustment.  The difference is that the electronics will detect if something is in the &#39;reading&#39; distance range and auto change part of the lens to reading glasses.

The Wyoming Supreme Court struck down its state’s sweeping abortion ban on Tuesday, preserving access to reproductive health care by a 4–1 vote. Its opinion found that Wyoming had (perhaps inadvertently) enshrined a right to abortion access when it ratified the freedom to make medical decisions in 2012 as part of a backlash to Obamacare. The majority also dismantled lawmakers’ justifications for its draconian abortion restrictions, reflecting a sensitivity toward the complexity of pregnancy that stands in stark contrast to the U.S. Supreme Court. Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the ruling, its ironic backstory, and its clear-eyed refutation of SCOTUS on this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus. An excerpt from their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This is a pretty bold ruling, coming from a court in an extremely red state. Can you just talk us through how Wyoming, of all places, wound up with such incredibly robust protection for reproductive freedom?

Mark Joseph Stern: The Wyoming Supreme Court’s five justices are all Republican appointees. But the Wyoming Constitution explicitly declares that “each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.” How did a ruby-red state wind up enshrining that fundamental right? Well, when Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act back in 2010, GOP politicians and activists decided they were going to fight back by banning socialized medicine in state constitutions. They claimed they were worried that the government would force everyone into a state-run health care system in which bureaucrats dictated exactly what would be provided. So they pushed for these constitutional amendments that would preserve private insurance and give everyone the right to access and pay for medical treatment.

As Michigan State University College of Law professor Quinn Yeargain has documented, five states ultimately enacted those amendments, including Wyoming in 2012. But their proponents wrote them in broad language rather than framing them as an explicit rebuke to Obamacare. So Wyoming’s amendment begins by granting every adult this sweeping right to make their own health care decisions, and it shields that right from “undue government infringement.” Everybody ignored that this was part of the state constitution until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Then the Wyoming Legislature passed a ban on virtually all abortions at every stage of pregnancy. A group of doctors sued and said: These abortion bans violate the right to medical decisionmaking secured in our state constitution. And on Tuesday, the Wyoming Supreme Court said they were correct.

I can hear the woodwinds and strings in your ode to creative lawyering in the states. But I think it’s really worth flagging that, as you said, these are not rabid lefty judges. They are Republican appointees. And you could certainly imagine conservative judges finding a way to get the results they wanted by saying: Look, this was all about Obamacare. This has nothing to do with abortion. This decision does not take the easy route. It says that words have meaning.

I’ll note two things. First, even though these are not flaming liberal judges, Wyoming does have a merit-based judicial-selection system. So these are also real judges who are committed to trying to figure out what the law means. Second, the key move here is the court’s holding that terminating a pregnancy is a health care decision. The state of Wyoming argued that it wasn’t. It said: Abortion isn’t health care, so it doesn’t fall under this provision whatsoever. And the majority said that that was wrong; given the often detrimental impact of pregnancy on an individual’s health, the choice to terminate is clearly a health care decision. That means all restrictions on it must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.

This led to another interesting analytical move, which Mary Ziegler wrote about in Slate: The court held that Wyoming’s ban was not narrowly tailored to protect “fetal life.” And it did so by pointing to its lack of meaningful, coherent exceptions. So, for instance, state law allows termination for lethal fetal defects only if the baby would die within hours or days of birth. But the plaintiffs had doctors testify that they could not know for certain whether an infant with these defects would live for days, weeks, or maybe even a few months before suffering a painful death. So the majority said: Look, it’s illogical for the state to make patients carry a doomed high-risk pregnancy just because that infant might live a few more days or a few more weeks before inevitably dying. In legal terms, the law was tailored in a very arbitrary way, seemingly to prolong the suffering of women, as well as fetuses who were not going to survive if they were born.

The majority also pointed to Wyoming’s exception for rape, which is barely an exception at all, and noted that it really violates the logic of the ban: If Wyoming has an obligation to protect life from conception, as the state claims, how can it deem a life unworthy of protection because it was the product of sexual assault? The majority also pointed out that rape victims can terminate a pregnancy only if they report their assault—but many victims do not file a police report for a variety of reasons, including fear of retaliation by the perpetrator, who is often a family member. This is especially perverse because a minor who becomes pregnant from rape is not, under Wyoming law, allowed to request an abortion herself; she has to go through her parents or guardians. And if her parent or guardian is the person who raped her, they can veto her attempt to terminate the resulting pregnancy.

The majority said this was all deeply irrational and unworkable, and not remotely tailored to serve the state’s alleged interest. That is just solid legal analysis that really should not have a partisan or ideological slant. It’s just rooted in reason and the real world.

What you are describing is the anti-Dobbs opinion, right? This is a rebuke to Justice Samuel Alito and his completely inane analysis about the complexity of pregnancy. But it’s also a rebuke to state lawmakers who think they understand how medicine works, and to the entire pro-life industrial complex, which keeps treating pregnancy as though it’s a simple, check-the-box enterprise. This is an opinion that deeply honors the fact that pregnancies are complicated. They are fraught. They are a big deal. It sweeps in questions of rape and abuse and power differentials and reporting and how the criminal justice system works. It sweeps in granular questions about when life begins and whose life matters.

This is not the kind of thing that Alito can just imagine away, because he likes the idea of fetuses above all. What you’re describing is a court that is really sensitive to the principle that Alito missed completely in Dobbs, which is that when the government tries to regulate pregnancy and abortion in simpleminded cartoonish ways, women are oppressed and tortured. But then there’s the other piece of this that I want you to just amplify, which is that this is a court doing actual, principled, Scalian textual analysis. I’ve almost forgotten what that looks like, because you sure as hell don’t see it at the Supreme Court.

Those are the two pieces that braid together so nicely. This is a court saying that constitutional language has consequences and courts can’t just pretend that the words in the Constitution don’t exist because they’re inconvenient. This amendment, whatever its intent, was ultimately approved by the voters of Wyoming. We don’t know exactly what those voters thought they were approving when they enshrined this into their founding charter. People had different ideas. You can’t read their minds. Maybe a lot of them thought it was about socialized medicine. But what they ended up doing was create a fundamental right to make health care decisions. And because that right still exists, the state Supreme Court felt an obligation to enforce it.

That meant striking down Wyoming’s whole anti-choice regime—which, as you say, collapsed under its own internal contradictions. What the court did was say: This is a fundamental right, so we have to apply real, meaningful scrutiny to it. And once you do that, you see how horrible and irrational these abortion laws are on the ground. Forcing minors to get approval from the parent who raped them in order to terminate the resulting pregnancy. Forcing doctors to tell a patient: Sorry, you have to give birth to this doomed fetus because I can’t certify that it’ll die within days rather than weeks. All of these realities of pregnancy on the ground that Alito totally glossed over are front and center in this opinion.

I find that to be the ultimate kind of rejoinder to Dobbs, because in Dobbs, there are no acknowledged victims. The victims of that decision are concealed and hidden. It’s presented as this great win for “fetal life” and democracy. And the women who die because they can’t get a medically necessary abortion? The women whose lives are forever altered in a terrible way because they are forced to carry a pregnancy with lethal defects to term? The rape victims who cannot terminate a pregnancy that results from assault? Alito pushes them under the rug. But this Wyoming Supreme Court opinion brings them out and says they matter too. And that is the opinion that I felt I needed to read since the day the Dobbs draft leaked. And I’m just shocked that it came from Wyoming.

On Friday, the Supreme Court decided Bowe v. United States, a procedural case that will meaningfully reshape how federal prisoners challenge unlawful convictions and sentences. The court held that a key restriction Congress imposed on state habeas petitions does not apply to federal prisoners, and that federal prisoners may seek Supreme Court review when courts of appeals deny permission to file successive post-conviction motions. Together, the pair of holdings loosens a set of procedural choke points that have blocked many federal habeas claims from merits review even when the underlying law has shifted decisively in a prisoner’s favor. In practice, it means more prisoners will have the opportunity to secure post-conviction relief when new law is established that supports their claims, even after previously failed appeal bids.

The case emerged from Michael Bowe’s mandatory 10-year added sentence—on top of an initial 14-year sentence—under a federal firearms statute that applies only when a defendant commits a qualifying “crime of violence.” His predicate offenses were conspiracy and attempted Hobbs Act robbery. After Bowe was sentenced, the Supreme Court dismantled the legal basis for treating those crimes as violent. In 2019, the court followed with United States v. Davis, which struck down part of the “crimes of violence” statute as unconstitutionally vague. In 2022, the court followed with United States v. Taylor, holding that attempted robbery, as defined in the Hobbs Act, does not qualify under the remaining part of the statute. The 11th Circuit has also held that conspiracy does not qualify, either. If Bowe were sentenced today, his firearm enhancement would almost certainly disappear.

But post-conviction law does not move in straight lines. Federal prisoners typically get one opportunity to challenge their convictions or sentences. A second or successive motion is permitted only if the prisoner can show either newly discovered evidence establishing innocence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court. Statutory interpretation decisions, standing alone, do not open the gate.

That framework created a procedural trap for Bowe. After Davis, he sought relief arguing that his firearm conviction rested on an unconstitutional basis. The 11th Circuit rejected the claim because, at the time of his conviction, circuit precedent still treated attempted Hobbs Act robbery as a qualifying crime for a sentence enhancement even under Davis. Even if the portion of the statute struck down in Davis was an invalid reason for sentence enhancement, the court concluded, the conviction survived anyway under the separate portion of the statute. Then Taylor arrived and eliminated that fallback theory. When Bowe returned to court, the 11th Circuit blocked him again, this time on procedural grounds. His Davis claim had already been raised once in a prior motion and was therefore barred as an old claim. His Taylor argument could not open the door because it was statutory rather than constitutional. The sequencing of Supreme Court decisions left him trapped between two doors that would never open at the same time.

The Supreme Court granted review to resolve two questions that had divided the lower courts. First, the court addressed whether it had jurisdiction to review denials of authorization to file successive federal habeas motions. A provision of federal law bars Supreme Court review of authorization denials in state habeas cases. Several circuits had treated that bar as extending to federal prisoners as well. The court rejected that reading. The statute speaks in terms of state habeas “applications,” while federal prisoners file post-conviction “motions” under a different statute. Congress did not clearly withdraw the court’s jurisdiction over federal authorization decisions, and absent a clear statement, the court declined to read its own authority away. That holding restores a meaningful layer of appellate oversight in an area that had become largely insulated from review.

The decision reinforces the value of Supreme Court review itself in a corner of the legal system where access to any forum is often vanishingly thin. Post-conviction litigation frequently turns not on whether a claim has merit, but on whether any court remains available to hear it at all. When authorization denials become effectively unreviewable, legal error hardens into permanence by default. In a system built on layered review, preserving a path to Supreme Court review keeps open a forum of last resort in cases where liberty depends on whether the courthouse door has closed forever.

The second holding addressed the mechanism that had blocked Bowe’s claim. The statute that bars repeat claims applies, by its terms, only to second or successive habeas petitions filed by state prisoners under a specific section of the statute. Federal prisoners proceed under a different section, which contains its own gatekeeping rules. Some courts had imported the state-law old-claim bar into federal practice by assumption and policy reasoning. The Supreme Court refused to do so. Congress used different language in the two statutes for a reason. Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor confirmed that courts cannot graft additional restrictions onto the federal scheme simply because they think the result would be cleaner or more restrictive.

That correction matters because it removes the procedural device that trapped Bowe. Without the old-claim bar, federal prisoners are no longer automatically foreclosed from re-presenting claims that were previously rejected under legal assumptions the Supreme Court has since repudiated. Bowe may now again seek authorization to file a successive motion based on Davis, using Taylor to show that once the unconstitutional residual clause is removed, no valid predicate remains.

Importantly, though, the decision does not dismantle the draconian framework for seeking renewed appeal. Prisoners must still satisfy the strict requirements for successive motions. Statutes of limitations remain in force. Courts of appeals continue to screen habeas filings aggressively. While Bowe leaves unchanged the existence of barriers, it eliminates a uniquely arbitrary one that punished prisoners for the timing of legal change rather than the legality of their sentences.

More broadly, the case corrects a distortion in post-conviction law. Constitutional doctrine and statutory interpretation often evolve in stages. When procedural rules freeze prisoners at an intermediate moment in that evolution, legal error becomes permanent by accident of timing. Bowe restores coherence by allowing federal prisoners to return to court when later developments reveal that earlier denials rested on conclusions the Supreme Court has since rejected.

For Michael Bowe, the ruling offers another opportunity to challenge a decade of imprisonment that may no longer be legally justified. For the federal system and similarly situated prisoners, it reopens a path that had narrowed over time and ensures that procedural rules in federal post-conviction practice do not entrench legal error simply because the law evolved in stages.

I don’t know exactly what I should be doing right now, as a person who lives in the United States in 2026 and cares about others. But I know I’m falling short. I think about this often: When I’m sobbing over a news report about a toddler orphaned after his parents are swept up in an ICE raid, asking myself, “How are you helping, other than donating money here and there and sharing Instagram stories?” When I’m imagining what I’ll one day tell my children I did for the people who were scared and suffering back in 2026, when I’m reading a post that commands me to reject hopelessness and get involved in my community, I immediately start to hear my own excuses about work and kids and energy and time.

It feels awful to disappoint myself. What feels worse is my feeling that Renee Good, who was killed by a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis during a raid on Wednesday, was the kind of person I want to be, and as a result, she’s dead.

When I say she was the kind of person I want to be, I’m talking specifically about her presence at the scene of the immigration raid. The New York Post reported that she was involved with an “ICE Watch” group; though the tabloid claims that such groups “can turn confrontational,” their purpose is to help prevent immigrants from being suddenly swept into detention centers. It is exceedingly clear that Good was not threatening agents when she was shot. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR that Good was “anything but” a domestic terrorist, despite the claims of Trump administration officials who say she was interfering with the ICE agent’s work. Instead, he said, she was a “compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors.”

If that’s the case, it means she must have felt the same horror I feel when I see how so many people in this country are living through pain I can’t imagine—and then she did something. Instead of taking a break from the news, or fantasizing about leaving the county, or despairing over the world her kids will inherit (or who knows, maybe she did these things too!), maybe she thought, How can I help?

She didn’t have the power to change the outcome of the election, or change the minds of all the people who voted for this horrifying reality, or even to stop ICE from chasing down the people in her community, or to reunite kids with their parents. But she still showed up, to be the kind of person we all hope will be there if we’re having the worst day of our life. I imagine that, before she was killed, her presence was a comfort that showed that someone was watching and that someone cared.

“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known,” her mom told the Minnesota Star Tribune (she also disputed the idea that her daughter was involved in any kind of protest against ICE). “She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.” It is very easy to leave to others the job of showing up when people are in danger—the job of documenting and witnessing. Memes about how the world is terrible but being a mother is enough (evolutionary, even!) appear often in my Instagram feed. I understand why I’m seeing them. My algorithm is undoubtedly shaped by two kinds of content. The first: Reels about things like the way 3-year-olds yell at their parents for singing, and how 1-year-olds do gymnastics while breastfeeding. The second: Footage documenting the unspeakable suffering of kids in Gaza, stats about the number of people around the world who will face hunger or die as a result of this administration’s policies, and reporting on people in Latino neighborhoods in Chicago who form a walking school bus for kids whose parents are too afraid of ICE to leave the house. So I’m served content perfectly tailored to someone peeking out from the working-mom-with-two-little-kids trenches, looking around, and despairing over the world—until someone needs a snack or the potty or the kind of comfort I wish I could give to all the kids in the headlines.

These messages about how I’m doing my part by raising kind humans are always beautifully illustrated with whimsical drawings and pleasant fonts. I really do appreciate them and the comfort they bring to others. But these “You’re enough when you feed your child breakfast” messages just don’t resonate with me. Maybe it’s because my kids, while very sweet, are still young enough that they’d walk through an active crime scene to get to a veggie straw, so it’s just hard to picture them fixing the world. Maybe it’s because I think of myself as a decent person, but I wonder if I am really contributing if I raise people who are every bit as empathetic as I am, but I fail to give them the example of what to do with that empathy. Or maybe it’s because I know that plenty of women throughout history have had just as much on their plates as—and the same clichéd struggle to work and parent and shower—and still managed to try to make the world outside their homes better.

Women like Renee Good. She was the mother of three, including of a 6-year-old whom she dropped off at school Wednesday morning. Afterward, she could have filled her time with countless other things: laundry, a summer camp lottery, taking down holiday decorations, finding a lost glove. Or maybe she could have done something for herself: calling a friend, getting a haircut, or finally doing that 10 minute daily meditation or 25 minutes of weight-bearing exercise that are supposed to solve so many of our problems if we can squeeze them in. Instead, something brought her to a residential street in south Minneapolis where some of her neighbors were living through a nightmare and others were trying to help.

What I keep thinking about isn’t that she was killed even though she was a good person (many good people have been killed, and ICE isn’t supposed to kill bad people either!). I believe she was killed because she was a good person. Because she decided to be there. She’s gone now, her kids don’t have a mom, and the world is missing the kind of woman who found the time to go stand in the street and let her neighbors know they weren’t alone. She should still be alive. But because she’s not and I am, I hope I can honor her memory by being more like her.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which if officially BACK from hiatus and is ready to see if the news is now “good” again. [Checks out the ol’ news.] Ah well.

We may be a little rusty, so bear with us. This week, Donald Trump fantasized about which Western Hemisphere landmasses he can conquer next. Tim Walz can’t catch a break ever since he inserted himself into national politics. A solution for expired health care subsidies remains mired in the limbo of a dreaded Senate working group.

And while we were hoping to lead with a “fun one” in this return edition, that wasn’t in the cards.

On Wednesday in Minnesota, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was in her car, perpendicular to traffic, during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis. An agent approached her and demanded she get out of the car. As that officer began trying to open her door, another approached from the other side. Good tried to drive away, turning her wheels right to avoid the officer who had approached from the other side. As the officer tried to get out of the way, he fired multiple shots from feet away and killed Good. We can’t predict how a court of law would judge the officer’s self-defense argument. But the naked eye tells that this was an overuse of force.

This administration, though, can’t afford you believing the naked eye. It has a lot riding on ICE. Anti-immigrant zealot Stephen Miller, who runs White House policy—or, really, just runs the White House—pushed with all of his might to secure a mammoth expansion of ICE capacity and personnel in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A supersized ICE is Miller’s tool to implement mass deportations. And so, a scandal in which an ICE officer unnecessarily shoots someone in the face, which could threaten public support for Miller’s grand ICE project, is not something the administration can afford.

This is why the administration went from zero to she was a terrorist in about 10 seconds. Miller described Good’s driving as “domestic terrorism,” intended to run over officers, a line echoed by the Department of Homeland Security’s spokesperson and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem herself. Vice President J.D. Vance performed a hammy scolding of the media for daring to question the officer’s actions during Thursday’s White House press briefing. The response was quick and well over-the-top. It was high-stakes crisis communications to protect Miller’s dream for America.

Feeling his imperialist oats after having kidnapped a head of state so that he could take the country’s natural resources, Trump has once again turned his attention to Greenland, a large ice sheet controlled by the Kingdom of Denmark that Trump wants to annex because it looks really big on a distorted map. Trump reiterated early in the week that “we need Greenland” and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, observed that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option” that Trump could use to secure it. Our good friend Stephen Miller, meanwhile, gave a characteristically unhinged interview, saying that the U.S. has a right to take Greenland because “we live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Buddy, this is CNN, not an Xbox headset.

At least there’s been reasonable pushback, with European leaders formally condemning the saber-rattling and observing that an attack on Greenland would mean the end of NATO (perhaps a feature, for elements of Trump’s administration). Senate Republicans, by Senate Republican standards, have also been forceful in their rejection of the idea. One possible defense of what Trump’s doing, though, is making threats as a means of getting Denmark to put Greenland up for sale. Can we observe, before the savvy negotiator spin takes hold, that purchasing Greenland would also be absurd? It could cost in the trillions at a time when the federal budget is calamitous, higher interest rates and inflation have returned, and there are better things—really, anything else—to spend trillions of dollars on. There are real national security interests and economic interests involved in Greenland. The way to manage that is not to conquer the island but to reach an agreement with Denmark, which was our friend up until about 10 minutes ago.

The Minnesota governor used to have a nice life. He put a solid 12 years into the House of Representatives then cruised to a comfy couple of terms as governor. Then, in 2024, he had to have the dotty idea to throw himself into contention for the vice presidency. Not good! It’s not just that he’ll forever be associated with a catastrophic presidential race for Democrats. It’s that the scrutiny returned home with him when he returned to Minnesota.

Walz withdrew his bid for a third gubernatorial campaign this week amid various social services fraud scandals in the state that have drawn national media attention and a federal probe from the Trump administration. (Fortunately for Minnesota Democrats nervous about scandals engulfing the party in the midterms, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who always puts up strong margins in statewide races, may swoop into the governor’s race.) That decision hardly allows Walz to slink away from the spotlight, though, as now Minnesota is embroiled in an escalating standoff with the administration over ICE. His peace and quiet are another long year away.

As the Surge wrote in a separate piece this week, the long-standing battle between interventionist Sen. Lindsey Graham and isolationist Sen. Rand Paul for Trump’s heart and mind took a dramatic turn in Graham’s favor when Trump sent the military into Venezuela to abduct its leader. Graham was waltzing around the Capitol with a grin on his face all week as if he had won the 250-year chess match of American politics once and for all. He even went out of his way to neener-neener Rand Paul, who was rather upset by the president’s interventionist turn, on social media.

Paul did have one move up his sleeve, though. He, along with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, forced a vote on a war powers resolution that would block the president from further military action in Venezuela barring congressional approval. The measure, somewhat surprisingly, advanced on a procedural vote on Thursday as five Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting it. This infuriated Trump, who said that those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Graham, meanwhile, said that he would try to convene a meeting of the Senate GOP “regarding Democrats’ efforts to restrict President Trump’s authority as Commander in Chief under the War Powers Act” concerning “the constitutional effect of the War Powers Act and the damage it will do to our national security.” Graham has had just about enough of Congress, the Article I branch of government to which Graham belongs, having a say in foreign policy.

Last year, Sen. Mark Kelly joined a handful of other Democrats in Congress in a video telling members of the military that they can refuse illegal orders. The administration took that personally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened Kelly’s retirement rank and pension for having the … the … the nerve to suggest that anyone could refuse to obey his illegal orders, calling it “seditious.” Earlier this week, then, Hegseth followed up and posted that the department had, in fact, “initiated retirement grade determination proceedings.” Most delightful, though, was his “letter of censure” to Kelly listing a bevy of offenses (various criticisms of the Trump administration) that disgraced the military. The censure letter, bless its heart, includes the line, “I hereby formally CENSURE you.” It’s a light and airy read.

The letter is more than a window into the Trump administration’s deep and dangerous insecurities. Mark Kelly was nearly selected to be Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election and, having dodged that bullet, must maintain some presidential ambitions. His flaw has always been that he’s a bit dry, though. So what better way to elevate his profile and spice up his credentials ahead of a Democratic presidential primary than a letter of censure (CENSURE) from the try-hard fitness instructor running the Pentagon?

With Nick Maduro sitting in the clink in Brooklyn, who’s going to run Venezuela? (Under the watchful eye of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, of course). The administration’s plan, at least for now, is to leave the existing Chavista regime in place under Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, so long as she does everything the United States wants. When Trump was asked early in the weak why he wouldn’t push to install the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, instead, he said that while “she’s a very nice woman,” she “doesn’t have the support within, or the respect within, the country.”

The administration’s overriding interest is in restructuring Venezuela as a colony, not making it a democracy, and the CIA determined that replacing the existing regime right now would be more trouble than it’s worth. But it didn’t break Trump’s heart to deny Machado control of the country. Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year after Trump had campaigned for it. The Washington Post, citing sources close to Trump, reported that this effectively killed her chances of running Venezuela after Maduro’s ouster. “If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ ” one source said, “she’d be the president of Venezuela today.” Trump and Machado are nevertheless expected to meet soon, and Machado has said she would be willing to present her prize to Trump to express her gratitude. Trump liked the sound of that and said it would be a “great honor” to accept it. The world could not be more odd right now.

On Thursday, 17 House Republicans joined all Democrats to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for another three years. This vote was made possible through use of a discharge petition, through which a majority of members can force a vote on a bill against House leadership’s wishes, and allows vulnerable Republican members to at least say that they tried. And while this particular bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, it does put pressure on Senate Republicans to address rising premiums in some way—or absorb the political blowback from failing to.

So what is Senate Majority Leader John Thune to do? The Senate has convened bipartisan working group trying to develop an extension that tightens subsidy eligibility. One of the stickiest points, as ever with ACA subsidies, is abortion. Republicans want more stringent Hyde Amendment protections in ACA plans to ensure that federal dollars would never even consider comingling with payments for abortion services. How does this get resolved? Perhaps with some browbeating from Trump. “You have to be a little flexible on Hyde, you know that,” Trump told House Republicans at a gathering this week. We’re not sure they know that at all.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft&#39;s latest Windows Insider release introduces a policy allowing admins to remove the Copilot app from managed devices. But there&#39;s a catch - actually, several.

The announcement arrived in the first Windows Insider release of 2026 and intruduces a new policy titled RemoveMicrosoftCopilotApp. It all sounds promising for admins who want the code off their computers, but Microsoft has attached some strict conditions.

First, a device must have both Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Copilot installed. Second, the Microsoft Copilot app cannot have been installed by the user. Third, the app must not have been launched in the last 28 days.

The last requirement is particularly onerous as getting through even a day without Copilot appearing can be tricky for many users. And even if admins succeed in removing it, users can simply reinstall Copilot if they choose.

Administrators have long been able to remove Microsoft Copilot via Intune or other management tools. According to Microsoft, the new policy enables removal &quot;in a targeted way.&quot; Unless, of course, the user puts it straight back on.

The update arrived in build 26220.7535 for the Dev and Beta Windows Insider Channels, so there is no guarantee it will make it into production. The update also marks a brief window during which the Dev and Beta Channels are synchronized, allowing insiders to switch between them without reinstalling.

Other Copilot features in the update include AI-generated descriptions of images, charts, and graphs for Copilot via Narrator on all Windows 11 devices, rather than just on Copilot+ PCs, which, according to Microsoft, continue &quot;to provide instant, on-device image descriptions using local AI.&quot;

The announcement reflects Microsoft&#39;s balancing act: offering enterprise control while protecting its very substantial investment in AI technology. ®

            <h2>Infamous BreachForums forum breached, spilling data on 325K users</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/breachforums_breach/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">BreachForums, the serially resurrected cybercrime marketplace, has tripped over itself after a data breach spilled details tied to about 324,000 user accounts.

The latest incarnation of the notorious hacking forum was burgled in August 2025, exposing email addresses, usernames, and hashed passwords, according to Have I Been Pwned, which added the incident to its database on January 10.

The allegedly stolen user data was later posted to shinyhunte[.]rs, alongside a message from a self-described cyber outlaw calling himself &quot;James,&quot; who appeared keen to make sure his handiwork didn&#39;t go unnoticed.

Have I Been Pwned&#39;s listing of the incident shows that the breach occurred before law enforcement&#39;s October 2025 takedown of the BreachForums domain, and that the leak comprised roughly 324,000 unique email addresses, usernames, and Argon2-hashed passwords, pulled from public posts, private messages, and other forum records.

According to Resecurity&#39;s analysis of the breach, the leaked database includes records linked to real individuals active in the cybercrime world, including crims previously associated with groups such as GnosticPlayers. PGP keys tied to accounts using handles such as ShinyHunters and IntelBroker were also found in the dump.

The database was published alongside a rambling, self-indulgent manifesto by &quot;James,&quot; which included remarks and identifiers pointing to other miscreants allegedly involved in malicious activity. Some entries appear to have been edited, partially scrubbed, or tampered with, but Resecurity said a significant chunk of the material appears to be authentic.

One detail that caught researchers&#39; attention was timing. The most recent registration date in the leaked database is August 11, 2025, the same day the previous BreachForums site at breachforums[.]hn was shut down, suggesting the data was lifted as the forum was entering its final hours.

Resecurity said it reviewed the IP data in the leak, while warning that VPN use muddies the picture. Even so, the records indicate heavy use from the US and parts of Europe, alongside activity in the Middle East and North Africa, including Morocco, Jordan, and Egypt.

The security biz warned that publishing the data could carry real consequences for those named. &quot;Following the publication of this data, undoubtedly many threat actors will face difficulties in hiding their identities and an increased risk of getting arrested,&quot; the company said.

The leak also prompted a rare public response from BreachForums&#39; current administrator, who goes by the alias N/A. In a forum post, the admin apologized for the exposure while insisting the data itself was not new.

&quot;We want to address recent discussions regarding an alleged database leak and clearly explain what happened,&quot; N/A wrote. &quot;First of all, this is not a recent incident. The data in question originates from an old users-table leak dating back to August 2025, during the period when BreachForums was being restored/recovered from the .hn domain.&quot;

According to the administrator, the problem stemmed from sloppy handling during the forum&#39;s recovery. &quot;During the restoration process, the users table and the forum PGP key were temporarily stored in an unsecured folder for a very short period of time. Our investigation shows that the folder was downloaded only once during that window,&quot; N/A added.

The admin also suggested that &quot;James&quot; may be linked to the ShinyHunters collective – a claim that has not been independently verified.

Details that once sat inside a semi-private forum can now be picked and cross-referenced – and for anyone named in the leak, that&#39;s a very different problem from an old forum backup quietly gathering dust on a server. ®

            <div id="article-text">Opinion For a world economy driven by consumerism, it&#39;s become markedly unkind to consumers. This goes double – literally – for digital tech, where memory prices have increased by between 100 and 250 percent in six months. If you think GPUs are pricey now, you&#39;ll only have to wait six weeks, during which both AMD and Nvidia are expected to demonstrate supply-side economics much as the Road Runner demonstrated gravity to Wile E Coyote.

Six months and six weeks are as nothing to 2026, which took just three days to increase the chances that everything tech will look back to now as a lost golden age of availability and affordability. America&#39;s actions in abducting Venezuela&#39;s president while threatening to annex Greenland are many things, but let&#39;s concentrate on the simultaneous rejection of international laws and the concept of alliance.

Such abdication can only embolden other proponents of direct military action as primary national policy. This most certainly includes China, which just celebrated Christmas by conducting huge live-fire invasion exercises around Taiwan. President Xi Jinping is widely believed to have 2027 in mind for the actual invasion, which is bad news for Taiwan, but especially so for TSMC.

American doctrine here, as far as such a thing exists, is to reduce its fab yields to zero by using 2,000 lb kinetic contaminants via the B-2 bomber deposition process to turn them back into the sand from whence they came. This would destroy more than half the world&#39;s silicon supply and almost all of the latest circuits that drive the most active sectors in IT. It would take ten years to rebuild, assuming that this could even be done with the revenue taps turned off, the world economy in massive recession, and infrastructure scattered to the winds.

Such an event would be orders of magnitude greater than the 2021 chip supply chain sclerosis. That cost the worldwide automotive industry alone some $200 billion. Estimates vary on how much damage would be done to the world economy by the combination of chip supply chain collapse and sanctions post-invasion, with economists thinking between $5 trillion and $15 trillion. With Nvidia and Apple having a combined market cap of some $8 trillion and a shared existential reliance on the status quo, such estimates may even be optimistic. The silicon winter will be long and hard.

An actual optimistic view of the situation is that China would be among the hardest hit economically by such a universal depression. TSMC actually creates a so-called Silicon Shield, dissuading aggression. It&#39;s a comforting and plausible thought, but impossible to quantify. Xi has been resolute in calling and preparing for invasion, but is also resolute in maintaining internal stability, built to a great extent on economic growth.

How that equation works out is unknown. One of the better explanations of Chinese political motivation is Dan Wang&#39;s 2025 Breakneck: China&#39;s Quest to Engineer the Future. This points out that the upper levels of Chinese leadership have been largely composed of engineers who see governance as a series of technical issues to be solved in the molding of the nation. The US is more run by lawyers, concerned with regulation and process. How long this latter analysis remains true in 2026 is to be seen, although Wang&#39;s argument that a synthesis of the two approaches is unlikely to be tested. In engineering terms, gain and stability often work against each other, and that seems as useful an encapsulation of China&#39;s approach to Taiwan as any.

One final factor, perversely, is the recognition of the dangers of reliance on Taiwanese semiconductors. Europe, the US, and Japan are pouring state funds and encouraging other investments into local fabs capable of decoupling their economies to some extent from Taiwanese production. If this works, it will decrease the effectiveness of the Silicon Shield and change the invasion equation. It&#39;s not clear that this will work, nor if so by when – another destabilizing factor.

The final and most worrying concept is that the US&#39;s own highest levels of policy deciders will see the loss of Taiwan as a cost to be borne. There is a great air of American supremacy, along the lines of &quot;I&#39;m not saying we won&#39;t get our hair mussed,&quot; and that chaos is in America&#39;s own interests. It is unlikely that Greenlanders would find this implausible.

For now, it seems unlikely that the worst case will come to pass. It&#39;s just impossible to know how long now will last. On a pragmatic level, the question is whether it&#39;s worth turning into a digital prepper and buying the fattest, fastest tech you can afford right now, even as prices plump up. There may be a 20-year upgrade cycle coming. Still, look on the bright side. You&#39;ll be able to stop worrying about that AI bubble. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ofcom is investigating X over potential violations of the Online Safety Act, Britian&#39;s comms watchdog has confirmed.

The probe follows heavy pressure from politicians for the regulator to take action after a period of heightened scrutiny of its AI chatbot, Grok, generating sexualized images without the consent of users, mainly women.

Announcing the investigation, Ofcom said on Monday: &quot;There have been deeply concerning reports of the Grok AI chatbot account on X being used to create and share undressed images of people – which may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography – and sexualised images of children that may amount to child sexual abuse material (CSAM).

&quot;As the UK&#39;s independent online safety watchdog, we urgently made contact with X on Monday, January 5, and set a firm deadline of Friday, January 9, for it to explain what steps it has taken to comply with its duties to protect its users in the UK.

&quot;The company responded by the deadline, and we carried out an expedited assessment of available evidence as a matter of urgency.&quot;

Ofcom did not offer any details about the nature of X&#39;s response, but the regulator is understood to have sought urgent clarification from xAI about how it plans to protect UK users.

The formal review will assess whether X understands the risk of UK users – including children – seeing illegal content on the platform, whether it has taken the appropriate steps to prevent access to illegal content, and its efforts to remove illegal content once posted.

Offenses under the Online Safety Act can be punished with fines of up to £18 million ($24 million) or 10 percent of qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.

The most serious offenders may also be subjected to business disruption measures, which would see a UK court compel payment providers and advertisers to cease their trading relationships with a given organization.

An Ofcom spokesperson said: &quot;Platforms must protect people in the UK from content that&#39;s illegal in the UK, and we won&#39;t hesitate to investigate where we suspect companies are failing in their duties, especially where there&#39;s a risk of harm to children.

&quot;We&#39;ll progress this investigation as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process. As the UK&#39;s independent online safety enforcement agency, it&#39;s important we make sure our investigations are legally robust and fairly decided.&quot;

Technology Secretary Liz Kendall, said in a statement today that she welcomes Ofcom&#39;s decision to invesitgate X, which needs to conclude &quot;swiftly&quot; on behalf of victims and the general public.

&quot;The content created and shared using Grok in recent days has been deeply disturbing and I will be updating Parliament later today on the government&#39;s response.&quot;

Despite the controversies around Grok and its capability to digitally undress people surfacing months ago, discussions of the issue reached a fever pitch last week as UK authorities started looking seriously at X.

On Friday, Members of Parliament pressed the UK government for answers as to why it has not penalized X over the Grok nudification furor.

In letters to to tech minister Liz Kendall and Ofcom CEO Melanie Dawes, Dame Chi Onwurah, chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, said Grok&#39;s non-consensual sexualized deepfakes were &quot;extremely alarming.&quot;

Dame Onwurah pointed to legislative gaps that, at present, seemingly allow these nudification tools to operate unchecked.

Passed in July 2025, the Data Use and Access Act includes a provision to ban the creation of deepfake imagery, although it is not yet in force, as secondary legislation must be passed.

Similarly, the Online Safety Act makes intimate image abuse a criminal offense, but it does not specifically legislate against AI-generated intimate imagery, provided that it is not shared.

These legislative gaps aside, there are provisions in UK law that ban the kinds of content Grok was generating. For example, the Sexual Offences Act makes it illegal to share non-consensual intimate images or CSAM, and this section of law was inserted into the Online Safety Act.

The majority of Dame Onwurah&#39;s questions were leveled at Ofcom, the UK&#39;s communications regulator. She asked [PDF] Dawes why the regulator has only now made urgent contact with xAI, X&#39;s AI arm, instead of beginning an immediate investigation when reports of Grok&#39;s abuse began circulating months ago.

Ofcom did not address these questions head-on in its announcement today.

Additionally, Ofcom is expected to explain its views on other related matters, such as X limiting Grok&#39;s image functionality to paid users only, whether the regulator feels equipped to enforce penalties under existing laws, and what kinds of talks it has held with X thus far.

The committee chair simply asked [PDF] Kendall when the government will ban nudification tools, and what it is doing to track the AI harms that aren&#39;t covered by existing legislation.

&quot;Reports that xAI&#39;s Grok has been used to create non-consensual sexualised deepfakes on X are extremely alarming,&quot; said Dame Onwurah. &quot;My committee warned last year that the Online Safety Act was riddled with gaps – including its failure to explicitly regulate generative AI. Recent reports about these deepfakes show, in stark terms, how UK citizens have been left exposed to online harms while social media companies operate with apparent impunity.

&quot;I&#39;ve written to both the government and Ofcom seeking urgent clarity on how they will tackle the rapid rise of these AI-generated intimate deepfakes. We need transparency on Ofcom&#39;s conversations with xAI and a clear explanation of whether it has the powers to take effective enforcement action. The government must also set out when it will finally introduce the promised ban on nudification tools and take the steps needed to protect women and children online.&quot;

Kendall issued a statement on Friday, unconnected to Dame Onwurah&#39;s letter, denouncing Grok&#39;s nudification functionality, calling on Ofcom to exercise the full legal powers given to it.

She also confirmed that the government is &quot;in the coming weeks&quot; implementing new powers that will criminalize the creation of non-consensual intimate images, and the Crime and Policing Bill, which is currently in the process of becoming law, includes a ban on nudification tools.

Kendall pointed to Ofcom&#39;s guidance on preventing violence against women and girls (VAWG), published in November, saying she expects all platforms to abide by the principles as set out in that document [PDF].

The regulator&#39;s VAWG guidance technically applies to all platforms in scope of the Online Safety Act, and mandates that special action must be taken to detect harmful activity and support those at risk. Punishments can range from having to ban users to full regulatory enforcement action.

Kendall&#39;s statement also rejected X&#39;s decision to restrict Grok&#39;s image-generation functionality to paid users only – an apparent effort to limit the abuse of Grok by the masses.

&quot;Sexually manipulating images of women and children is despicable and abhorrent,&quot; she said. &quot;It is an insult and totally unacceptable for Grok to still allow this if you&#39;re willing to pay for it.

&quot;I would remind xAI that the Online Safety Act includes the power to block services from being accessed in the UK, if they refuse to comply with UK law. If Ofcom decides to use those powers, they will have our full support.&quot;

However unlikely an outright ban on X may be, it would not be unprecedented. In recent days, the governments of Malaysia and Indonesia both blocked public access to the social media platform over Grok&#39;s nudifying issues.

Malaysia&#39;s Communications and Multimedia Commission said X failed to address the problem, while Indonesia&#39;s minister of communications and digital affairs, Meutya Hafid, described Grok&#39;s deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights and dignity. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A blog post by programmer Nemanja Trifunovic, The Late Arrival of 16-bit CP/M, is on the face of it an interesting little excursion into the late delivery of a long-forgotten bit of software – one that turned out to be pivotal for the entire computer industry.

It&#39;s the story of why the 16-bit version of Digital Research CP/M was late, but the delayed arrival of this now-obscure OS is what catalyzed the development of a different, but source-level compatible, OS. That OS started Microsoft on its way to its current $3.5 trillion capitalization, and is also what led to the development of OS/2, Windows, and indirectly Linux. There&#39;s a good chance that you already think you know how what happened, but if you reckon it&#39;s anything to do with DR&#39;s Gary Kildall being out flying a plane, that&#39;s not the true story, as The Register covered in 2011 (we&#39;ll get back to why not later in this piece). The real reason is the delay in delivering CP/M-86, and that&#39;s what Trifunovic covers in detail.

The CP/M-86 User Guide [PDF] bears a copyright year of 1981. The problem is it was designed for Intel&#39;s 8086 processor, and that shipped in 1978 – followed a year later by the budget model, the cut-down Intel 8088. In other words, the new edition of CP-M arrived about three years late. Its target, the 8086, was the exciting new 16-bit successor to the Intel 8080. As Intel&#39;s own page says:

It didn&#39;t revolutionize microprocessors – it created the microprocessor market.

This is no exaggeration, and a big reason it did so well was that it had a de facto standard OS: Digital Research&#39;s CP/M. CP/M was completely dominant. The early business microcomputer industry ran on it and essentially nothing else.

CP/M was an OS for business microcomputers costing thousands of dollars because it needed at least one floppy diskette drive. In turn, that&#39;s why BASIC interpreters running from ROM chips dominated the growing market for inexpensive home computers.

In the period between Intel launching the 8086 and Digital Research (DR) finally launching an OS for the new processor, the three computers of BYTE Magazine&#39;s &quot;1977 Trinity&quot; jointly created the home computer market: the Commodore PET, the Apple II, and Radio Shack&#39;s TRS-80.

There was another processor that ran CP/M: Zilog&#39;s Z80. Although a fine chip and still mourned today, the Z80 was very much an eight-bit device, limited to a total of 64 KB of memory (RAM and ROM put together) without complicated bank switching.

As memory grew more affordable, what businesses needed was a partly compatible successor to the 8080 that could handle more of it. Intel delivered that with the 8086, which, rather than being limited to 64 KB, could handle 16 separate segments of 64 KB – for a total of one whole megabyte of memory space.

The problem was that, unlike the Z80, the 8086 was not binary compatible with the 8080. You couldn&#39;t run the 8080 version of CP/M (soon renamed CP/M-80) on it, like you could with a Z80. To use the new chip, hundreds of thousands of CP/M users needed a new OS. DR originally promised it would deliver one by November 1979, but it didn&#39;t happen. Trifunovic&#39;s article explains why and how it slipped.

As a result, one of the hardware OEMs selling 8086 boards was more or less forced to develop its own independent, third-party-compatible OS. No, not Microsoft, and not IBM either. Back in 2007, Tim Paterson, the developer of that OS, wrote about how and why he did it. He called the result 86-DOS, and a couple of years ago, we covered the rediscovery of the oldest known version of that OS.

Paterson started work on 86-DOS in 1980 because CP/M-86 was already late. That was more than a year before IBM launched the first IBM PC – with the budget cut-down 8088, so it cost &quot;only&quot; $1,500.

In fact, it&#39;s likely IBM selected CP/M-86 but was forced to look, at least temporarily, elsewhere as DR&#39;s effort to port CP/M to the Intel 8086/8088 CPU was taking longer than planned. Gates may well have pitched an alternative – IBM was already talking to Microsoft about using the latter&#39;s implementation of the Basic programming language – and appears to have won the deal in November 1980.

Not long after, Microsoft licensed 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products (SCP), specifically to sub-license the OS to IBM in turn. 86-DOS had been created by SCP as a stand-in for CP/M-86 and was thus intentionally compatible with the DR OS.

In time, that made the fortune of Microsoft. Because IBM didn&#39;t get Microsoft to sign an exclusive deal, Microsoft was allowed to sell its DOS to whoever it wanted. That, together with cheaper IBM-compatible hardware, created the x86 PC industry.

The limitations of DOS, especially its memory management, are why Intel&#39;s successor chip, the 80286, was a bit of a flop. Although the 80286 had protected mode, which allowed it to support 16 MB of RAM and multitasking, this did little to help DOS — or IBM&#39;s new OS/2 1.0.

Here, too, DR missed out again. It had lost the deal to be the default OS on IBM&#39;s PC, but when Intel was developing the 80286, DR was ready for it.

It had already effectively merged its multiuser multitasking MP/M [PDF] OS into CP/M-86 to create the multitasking Concurrent CP/M. It then added MS-DOS compatibility to create Concurrent DOS. The problem was that you can&#39;t fit many DOS apps into the 640 KB of RAM in an 8088 or 8086 PC.

So DR enhanced Concurrent DOS to make a native Intel 80286 OS. Concurrent DOS 286 was able to use up to 16 MB of RAM, and multitask lots of DOS apps in all that room (IBM and Microsoft&#39;s OS/2 1.0 wouldn&#39;t follow for over two more years, and still couldn&#39;t multitask DOS apps when it did).

The issue was that DR developed Concurrent DOS 286 on pre-release Intel 286 prototypes. Although the 80286 was released in 1982, it reached the PC market with IBM&#39;s new PC/AT in 1984. The problem was that the shipping version of the 80286 chip removed some features Concurrent DOS 286 needed.

By 1985, Intel released a new stepping of the 80286, which replaced the missing features, but the damage was done. Once again, this seriously damaged DR, but it recovered. It turned CDOS into a real-time OS, FlexOS 286. Versions of this remained on sale well into the 21st century, including IBM 4690 OS [PDF], Toshiba 4690 OS [PDF], and Siemens S5-DOS/MT [PDF].

DR also continued to work on its pre-Windows GUI desktop GEM (in its early days, The Reg covered the news of GEM going FOSS). Late last year, Mr Trifunovic also published an excellent History of the GEM Desktop Environment, which we also recommend. Later versions of DR FlexOS and its derivatives included a multitasking version of GEM called X/GEM [PDF].

DR worked around the limitations of the 80286, and found ways to put them to good use. Microsoft, for the most part, did not. Even Windows/286 couldn&#39;t use most of the memory of an 80286 PC, as we looked at last year.

As a result of the limitations of Microsoft&#39;s DOS, the 80286 was mainly just used as a faster 8086. This drove Intel to develop its following generation of CPU, the 80386. This supported multiple hardware-assisted DOS VMs with memory protection – and even if you just ran plain old single-tasking DOS, that memory protection let you rearrange that crucial first megabyte of RAM to free as much as possible of the 640 KB which was all DOS could directly use.

Without widespread use of multitasking, let alone GUIs, on late-1980s PCs, the original all-32-bit 80386DX was too expensive – even without its theoretical 4 GB memory capacity. So, once again, it was the limitations of MS-DOS that drove Intel to develop the cheaper 16-bit-bus 80386SX. This created a market for cheap 386SX PCs with cheap 16-bit RAM and a low ceiling of just 16 MB.

That market of cheap commodity 386 PCs is the soil in which Linux grew and flourished. Early 1990s 386 PCs were not workstation-class hardware. They were never expected to multitask, and they didn&#39;t run GUIs very well, but they ran DOS just great... and even their low specs allowed Linux to thrive.

Yes, Gary Kildall was in his plane when IBM visited. No, he wasn&#39;t on a pleasure trip. He was flying to make a site visit with a very important business partner, Bill Godbout, for whom The Reg ran an obituary in 2018. Along on the trip was his colleague Tom Rolander, who has told this story repeatedly, including on video (from 17 minutes onward). Rolander has also told the story to industry commentator Robert Scoble (Scoble&#39;s interview can be found on the Wayback Machine).

DR was based in Pacific Grove, some 80 miles or nearly a 90-minute drive from Silicon Valley. Kildall often chose to fly. If you had that option, wouldn&#39;t you?

Kildall wasn&#39;t at the meeting with IBM because it was not his job – he was a programmer. His wife and business partner, Dorothy McEwen Kildall, co-founded DR and she handled corporate negotiations.

IBM wanted a harsh NDA and a one-off payment. She refused, which was a sensible call; DR dominated business computing, and IBM wasn&#39;t even in that market.

In other words, IBM tried to drive a tough deal with the big player that dominated the sector. It didn&#39;t work, so it negotiated poorly with a bunch of upstart kids: it let Microsoft keep a licence to resell DOS to other vendors. Two poor deals in a row show that it wasn&#39;t IBM being canny; it was merely IBM being bureaucratic and institutional, poor at negotiation and compromise. It handed Microsoft the keys to the bank, and the tiny startup used them.

We&#39;ve even seen a perception that what the industry got from Microsoft was better: more capable and more open.

In fact, it was DR, consigned to second place, that worked harder. It delivered a small, fast, clean GUI with GEM. Abort Retry Fail has a good Short History of CP/M-86, which shows how DR delivered and continued to deliver. It had a multitasking CP/M-86 by 1982.

Alongside its PC efforts, DR also offered a version of CP/M for the Motorola 68000 as well, complete with GEM. A development of this became the standard OS of the Atari ST, a computer that outperformed the Mac and was better for music sequencing than the Amiga thanks to built-in MIDI ports as standard. A FOSS recreation of that OS called EmuTOS is still in active development today, as is a multitasking offshoot called FreeMINT. We wrote about how to get and run them in 2022.

The Motorola 68000 world matters today too. In part, it was because the mid-1980s offerings from Intel and Microsoft were so bland and uninspiring that Apple, Commodore, and Atari thrived, each with their own alternative platforms.

Its significance was explained on The Reg nearly 15 years ago by the late, great Chris Bidmead. The Mac, Amiga, and ST indirectly drove little British micro maker Acorn Computers to create the world&#39;s best-selling family of CPUs... because they were so unimpressed by the performance of the 68000 and its American contemporaries.

By 1984, Concurrent CP/M became Concurrent DOS, a true multitasking OS that could run MS-DOS apps. In 1985, DR released the C rewrite, Concurrent DOS 286, two years before IBM and Microsoft&#39;s combined effort. By 1987, when OS/2 staggered out, DR was offering Concurrent DOS 386, with built-in networking as well.

The Reg FOSS desk used and supported Concurrent DOS 386 in his first job, and it was remarkable. On his employer&#39;s demo machines, he used CDOS to generate large Mandelbrot sets, which took many hours, using Fractint – but with Fractint running in the background, and CDOS 386 running a copy of COMMAND.COM from IBM PC DOS 3.3 in the foreground session, so it looked exactly like a standard DOS computer and could be used as normal.

Without a time machine, we can&#39;t tell what DR would have done if it had delivered CP/M-86 on time. Perhaps it worked so hard on GEM, Concurrent DOS, DR-DOS, FlexOS, and so on because it ended up the also-ran. It worked very hard to rectify its mistakes, and if the PC industry had defaulted to DR OSes rather than Microsoft ones, it might have advanced rather faster. DR could have offered a multitasking 32-bit GUI OS with networking, able to run DOS apps, nearly a decade before Windows 95.

But it didn&#39;t. Squeezed out of the mainstream desktop OS market, it focused on multiuser, real-time, and point-of-sale systems instead. In the end, Novell acquired DR in 1991.

All because CP/M-86 was late. Trifunovic explains why and how that happened. That&#39;s vital info: it shaped the future of the PC industry, and trillion-dollar businesses hinged upon it. As wise people have noted, it&#39;s important to know your history.

Trifunovic&#39;s day job is at Ab Initio Software, which was founded by Sheryl Handler – founder and former CEO of Thinking Machines, the company that built Danny Hillis&#39;s Connection Machine – as partly co-designed by Richard Feynman – and also designed the DataVault, which has a claim to be the first ever RAID storage device. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! It isn&#39;t only a computer&#39;s software underbelly exposed during a bork. Sometimes the poor thing&#39;s innards are on show as engineers attempt to wring a little more life from long-expired systems.

Spotted by an eagle-eyed Register reader in delightful Portugal, today&#39;s fail comes courtesy of the nation&#39;s rail network or, in this case, the ticket-selling machinery.

The machine looks as though it&#39;s had a hard life, and we&#39;re not sure we&#39;d want to go jabbing that touchscreen. However, a tougher life has been led by the software running behind the scenes: Windows 2000 Professional – that famously hard-to-kill operating system.

Microsoft finally called time on the software in 2010 after ending mainstream support more than 20 years ago, in 2005.

However, as evidenced in Portugal (and in customer-facing devices around the world), Windows 2000 did not go gentle into that good night. A stepping stone from Windows NT 4.0, the operating system formerly known as NT 5.0 has continued to run thanks, in part, to hardware requirements that seem positively quaint by today&#39;s standards, and a general bomb-proof nature that would be the envy of many of today&#39;s platforms.

Assuming, of course, you don&#39;t plug it directly into the internet.

As well as Windows 2000 Professional, we were delighted to note that the ticket kiosk features a keyboard inside. Back when this writer used to prowl datacenter corridors, poking a rack to make a keyboard and screen fold out represented the pinnacle of design technology. Such things would probably be regarded as antiquated in the lights-out behemoths of today, so seeing the hardware live on within a Portuguese ticket machine is enough to generate a nostalgic thrill.

There&#39;s no mouse visible, but we&#39;re sure that any engineer worthy of the title could easily navigate their way through Windows 2000 without needing such fripperies.

When Microsoft finally released Windows 2000 to manufacturing, as the last century drew to a close, the company claimed the operating system, which apparently outperformed Windows 95, 98, and NT 4 on 64 MB of memory, was &quot;an ideal platform for the next generation of business computing.&quot;

So much so that Windows 2000 continues to endure well into the 2020s as engineers squeeze every last ounce of life from the software and the hardware it runs on. ®

            <div id="article-text">The search giant wants to dominate AI-powered shopping with a new protocol and buy now features on Gemini.

The search giant wants to dominate AI-powered shopping with a new protocol and buy now features on Gemini.

Google turned up the heat in the AI shopping wars this weekend, announcing plans to turn Gemini into a merchant and launching an open-source standard built together with major retailers including Shopify, Walmart, and Target. The move comes as companies like OpenAI, Amazon, and Perplexity jostle for power and influence at the heart of a growing AI-powered shopping ecosystem, with consumers increasingly turning to the technology to streamline purchasing.

At the National Retail Federation’s annual conference this weekend, Google said it had partnered with Shopify, Target, Walmart, Wayfair, and Etsy to develop a protocol it hopes will become the industry standard for shopping with AI. The standard, called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), is designed to streamline how AI agents and retailers’ systems communicate throughout the shopping process, from product discovery and payment to post-purchase support, Google vice president of ads and commerce Vidhya Srinivasan explained in a blog post. In other words, it sets up a common language for agents — AI tools capable of acting independently — and online shopping systems.

Google says the new standard will power a forthcoming “checkout feature” on Search and Gemini, which would allow users to make purchases directly using the AI tools without having to switch between apps or webpages. The feature will bring Gemini and Google’s AI Mode in Search in line with competitors like Microsoft’s Copilot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which launched purchasing options last year.

Google hopes UCP will be widely used by retailers and others in the e-commerce ecosystem, an area that is quickly becoming a battleground for companies to prove the tangible value of generative AI. UCP is open-source, meaning companies can freely use it rather than having to develop their own tools to deal with AI agents. It is compatible with existing industry standards like the Model Context Protocol, Srinivasan says. It will compete with a similar standard for agentic shopping OpenAI launched last year, the Agentic Commerce Protocol, which is also open-source.

UCP has already secured buy-in from more than 20 other companies in the online shopping ecosystem, the Google executive says. This includes payment giants like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, PayPal, and Stripe, as well as retailers like The Home Depot, Macy’s, Best Buy, Kroger, Lowe’s, Gap, and Zalando. Ant Group, an affiliate of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba, has also endorsed the standard. Many of these partners are likely to — or already — partner with other AI companies as well. Shopify merchants, for example, can sell in AI modes on Gemini, ChatGPT, and Microsoft Copilot, and PayPal has also partnered with OpenAI.

As well as the buy button on Gemini and the UCP standard, Google also said it is launching a business agent on Monday that will allow shoppers to chat with brands directly on Search. In this case, “directly” means chatting with a virtual assistant from the brand that can “answer product questions in a brand’s voice.” Retailers including Lowe’s, Michael’s, Poshmark, and Reebok have been among the first to sign up.

The announcements come as companies bet big on AI-driven shopping, with firms like Amazon infusing it into almost every step of the shopping experience. The technology has yet to prove itself as a useful assistant — The Verge’s experience has been glitchy, to say the least — but companies are certain AI agents are the future. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company’s new standard is laying the “groundwork” for agentic shopping, which “will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future.”

            <div id="article-text">Amazon also admitted that it was in touch with fundraisers months before the White House released its list of donors in October.

Amazon also admitted that it was in touch with fundraisers months before the White House released its list of donors in October.

The Trump administration approached Microsoft for its donation to fund the White House’s $300 million ballroom, documents released by Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) office reveal.

In response to a Democrat-led letter questioning Big Tech’s involvement in the ballroom’s construction, Microsoft counsel Karen Christian writes that the company “was contacted by a fundraiser for the effort regarding a possible donation” around two months after President Donald Trump announced plans to replace the White House’s East Wing with a privately funded ballroom.

“At that time, Microsoft was provided information concerning the Trust for the National Mall’s management of contributions for this project as a partner of the National Park Service, instructions on how to donate, and an invitation to attend a dinner held for supporters of the project, which Microsoft attended,” Christian says.

In another letter, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, Brian Huseman, similarly admitted that the e-commerce giant “communicated with the fundraising group working on the project beginning in August 2025.” Huseman added that Amazon “did not review any construction plans or enter into an agreement related to the donation.”

Meanwhile, Comcast’s letter says the company “pledged an unrestricted donation to the Trust for the National Mall,” with “no specific limitations or conditions on how the proceeds were to be used or spent.” It also says it “made the donation with no expectations of receiving anything in return.”

The letters written by other companies, including Meta, Nvidia, and Apple, didn’t reveal much about the donation process. Apple’s government affairs head, Tim Powderly, for example, writes that the donation was “handled ethically, honestly, and in full compliance with the law.”

Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.

            <div id="article-text">The latest from one half of Armand Hammer is his darkest record to date.

The latest from one half of Armand Hammer is his darkest record to date.

Billy Woods has one of the highest batting averages in the game. Between his solo records like Hiding Places and Maps, and his collaborative albums with Elucid as Armand Hammer, the man has multiple stone-cold classics under his belt. And, while no one would ever claim that Woods’ albums were light-hearted fare (these are not party records), Golliwog represents his darkest to date.

This is not your typical horrorcore record. Others, like Geto Boys, Gravediggaz, and Insane Clown Posse, reach for slasher aesthetics and shock tactics. But what Billy Woods has crafted is more A24 than Blumhouse.

Sure, the first track is called “Jumpscare,” and it opens with the sound of a film reel spinning up, followed by a creepy music box and the line: “Ragdoll playing dead. Rabid dog in the yard, car won’t start, it’s bees in your head.” It’s setting you up for the typical horror flick gimmickry. But by the end, it’s psychological torture. A cacophony of voices forms a bed for unidentifiable screeching noises, and Woods drops what feels like a mission statement:

“The English language is violence, I hotwired it. I got a hold of the master’s tools and got dialed in.”

Throughout the record, Woods turns to his producers to craft not cheap scares, but tension, to make the listener feel uneasy. “Waterproof Mascara” turns a woman’s sobs into a rhythmic motif. On “Pitchforks & Halos” Kenny Segal conjures the aural equivalent of a POV shot of a serial killer. And “All These Worlds are Yours” produced by DJ Haram has more in common with the early industrial of Throbbing Gristle than it does even some of the other tracks on the record, like “Golgotha” which pairs boombap drums with New Orleans funeral horns.

That dense, at times scattered, production is paired with lines that juxtapose the real-world horrors of oppression and colonialism, with scenes that feel taken straight from Bring Her Back: “Trapped a housefly in an upside-down pint glass and waited for it to die.” And later, Woods seamlessly transitions from boasting to warning people about turning their backs on the genocide in Gaza on “Corinthians”:

If you never came back from the dead you can’t tell me shitTwelve billion USD hovering over the Gaza StripYou don’t wanna know what it cost to liveWhat it cost to hide behind eyelidsWhen your back turnt, secret cannibals lick they lips

The record features some of Woods’ deftest lyricism, balancing confrontation with philosophy, horror with emotion. Billy Woods’ Golliwog is available on Bandcamp and on most major streaming services, including Apple Music, Qobuz, Deezer, YouTube Music, and Spotify.

Experts described the results as ‘alarming’ and ‘dangerous.’

Earlier this month, The Guardian published an investigation that showed Google was serving up misleading and outright false information via its AI overviews in response to certain medical inquiries. Now those results appear to have been removed. According to the original report:

In one case that experts described as “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.

In another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.

As of this morning, the AI overviews for questions like “what is the normal range for liver blood tests?” have been disabled entirely. Google declined to comment on the specific removal to The Guardian. Spokesperson Davis Thompson told The Verge that, “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information. Our internal team of clinicians reviewed what’s been shared with us and found that in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high-quality websites. In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”

But this is just one more controversy for a feature that has told people to put glue on pizza, eat rocks, and been the subject of multiple lawsuits.

﻿From smartwatches to devices designed to help you focus, we’ve gathered tools to help you make lasting changes.

It happens every year: we set ambitious New Year’s resolutions — work out more, spend less, keep the house cleaner — full of optimism and motivation. Then life happens, and suddenly it’s June and you can’t recall what your resolutions even were.

But it doesn’t have to be that way. Sometimes the problem isn’t a lack of motivation but rather a lack of tools, the kind that can make those goals feel more manageable and easier to achieve. After all, the right gear can help turn good intentions into habits that actually last.

Below, we’ve rounded up a few of our favorite tools, all of which are designed to help our readers achieve many of the most common New Year’s resolutions. If improving your health and fitness is at the top of your list, we’ve included fitness-focused earbuds with built-in heart-rate tracking, along with wearables in a variety of styles. We’ve also sprinkled in powerful robot vacuums and bullet journals to support cleaning and organization goals, while budgeting apps and bento boxes that help you prepare lunch at home can help you save money.

No matter what you’re hoping to improve, our guide is filled with all kinds of tech and other tools designed to help you get started — and, hopefully, keep going long after January ends.

We’ve all heard about the benefits of meditation. Actually sitting down and doing it is the hard part. Headspace makes it a little easier to turn meditation into a habit, with hundreds of expert-guided meditations designed to help reduce stress, improve focus and creativity, and even sleep better. The app also goes beyond meditation to include breathing exercises, sleep sounds, and even optional mental health coaching for an extra fee.

Staying hydrated is one of the simplest ways to improve overall health and fitness. The Owala FreeSip Sway helps make it part of your daily routine with a lightweight design and handle so you can carry it anywhere. It’s also got a spout that lets you sip through a built-in straw or take a swig, while triple-layer insulation helps keep drinks cold for up to a full day.

The latest Kindle can help you achieve a range of New Year’s resolutions that are easier to stick with, whether that’s reading more, building better habits, or picking up a low-cost hobby. Its pocketable six-inch design and sharp, glare-free display encourage reading anywhere, while its long battery life lets you enjoy long, uninterrupted reading sessions without worrying about recharging.

If you’re looking for a budget-friendly wearable that plays nicely with Android, the Amazfit Active 2 is our top pick. The platform-agnostic smartwatch punches well above its price with features like continuous heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, along with offline maps and turn-by-turn navigation. It even looks more expensive than it is, thanks to an OLED touchscreen and a sharp, stainless steel build.

If getting fitter is one of your New Year’s goals, knowing how hard you’re working matters — and that’s where the Powerbeats Pro 2 come in. The wireless earbuds offer built-in heart-rate monitoring so you can track and work out at a more effective intensity level without needing a dedicated fitness tracker. They’re also just a great pair of workout earbuds, with solid sound, ANC, and a secure ear-hook design.

It may be considered an entry-level smartwatch, but the latest Apple Watch SE is the one most iPhone owners should buy. It brings features once reserved for pricier models, like an always-on display and on-device Siri. And, more importantly, it covers the health and fitness basics most people need and extras like abnormal heart-rate and sleep apnea alerts, making it a smart investment for anybody looking to improve their health.

The Thermomix TM7 is the closest thing to hiring a cook for your kitchen. This all-in-one cooker can replace over 20 appliances, handling everything from chopping and blending to steaming. Its 10-inch touchscreen also guides you through recipes, making restaurant-style dishes easier to make at home. It’s easy to clean, too, thanks to a built-in self-cleaning mode.

The portable All In Motion Adult Bento Box makes it easier to spend less on meals when you’re away from home. Its three divided sections help with portion control so you don’t overindulge, while the included fork and knife mean you don’t even have to remember to bring utensils when packing food. It’s a simple way to save money and also avoid the temptation of grabbing fast food on the go.

If you want a wearable that won’t disrupt your sleep, the fourth-generation Oura Ring is far more comfortable to wear overnight than a smartwatch and lacks a distracting screen. It’s particularly well suited for tracking sleep and recovery, but you can also use it to monitor light workouts, stress levels, menstrual cycles, and other core health metrics, making it a great tracker for wellness-focused people. Just note that to get the most out of the ring, you’ll need a membership that costs $5.99 a month.

Whether your New Year’s goals include traveling more or spending less, the AeroPress Coffee Maker Go is a useful tool for achieving both. It brews rich, delicious coffee in under two minutes, while offering full control over brew time, temperature, and grind size. It even comes with its own small microwaveable mug, making it easy to drink great coffee on the go.

If you can’t afford the Thermomix TM7, the Instant Pot Pro is a more affordable all-in-one machine. It combines 10 appliances in one, working as a pressure cooker, rice cooker, slow cooker, yogurt maker, and sous-vide machine. Simply choose a recipe, tap a few buttons, and it can prepare an entire meal for up to six people, making cooking at home a lot less stressful.

The adjustable Te-Rich Smart Weighted Jump Rope adds smartwatch-like tracking to an otherwise basic jump rope, helping you stay accountable as you work toward your fitness goals. It tracks reps, time, and calories burned via a built-in backlit LCD screen, while the weighted handles add extra resistance for more effective workouts.

You Need A Budget (YNAB) makes intentional spending easier. Instead of simply tracking what you’ve already spent, the app helps you assign every dollar a job by breaking your income and expenses into clear, customizable categories, so you can see where your money is going before it’s gone.

One of the easiest ways to keep your home clean is to automate the job. The Ecovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni is a top-notch robot vacuum and mop you can schedule in advance and even control hands-free through major smart home platforms. It offers powerful 16,600Pa suction with lidar-based navigation, and can even maintain itself thanks to a self-cleaning roller mop and a self-emptying, self-washing dock.

Nothing ruins the mood of a trip quite like a dead phone when you’re exploring somewhere new. The tiny Iniu P55-E2 Power Bank offers up to 45W charging speeds along with two USB-C ports and a USB-A port, so you can quickly power everything from your phone to a gaming handheld while traveling. It also includes a detachable lanyard that doubles as a USB-C cable, making it one less thing to pack.

If you have trouble waking up or falling asleep early and want to fix that this year, the Philips Hue Twilight sleep and wake-up light can help. It offers six sunlight-inspired scenes, simulating a gentle sunrise to ease you into the morning and using warm, red-toned light at night to promote relaxation without blue light. As a bonus, it also doubles as a bedside reading lamp.

The Original Magic Bullet Blender makes it easy to quickly whip up post-workout smoothies or protein shakes, and it even includes portable cups so you can drink it on the go. It’s also shorter than a ruler, so you don’t have to reorganize your kitchen counter to fit it in.

The new year is the perfect time to reset your routines and get organized, and the Echo Show 15 is a great tool for doing just that. Designed to function as a shared household hub, it keeps calendars, schedules, reminders, to-do lists, and notes visible at a glance, making it easier to keep on top of things. As an Alexa-enabled smart display, you can also add events by voice and control compatible smart home devices.

Despite the name, you don’t need to own a Peloton device to use a Peloton membership. A base plan grants access to thousands of on-demand classes, including strength training, yoga, stretching, meditation, outdoor running, and more, with extras like live classes and leaderboards available on higher-tier plans. With sessions ranging from quick 10-minute workouts to one-hour programs, it’s easy to fit fitness into your schedule without necessarily leaving home.

Sitting for long hours at a desk can take a toll on your body and make it harder to concentrate. The Vivo standing desk converter sits on top of your existing desk and uses a simple handle to let you switch between sitting and standing throughout the day. It helps reduce stiffness, ease back and neck strain, and encourage movement, making it easier to stay energized and focused while you work.

If premade planners feel too confining, the Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal offers a more flexible way to organize your year. Its dot-grid layout lets you design your own system, so you can plan your days your way. Helpful additions like an index, a guide, and stickers also make it easy to get started.

Big New Year’s resolutions often fail because they’re too vague. In Atomic Habits, James Clear offers science-based strategies for building good habits and breaking bad ones by focusing on small actions that add up over time. It’s a genuinely helpful read for anyone looking to make lasting changes this year.

If you need help sticking with Dry January, a subscription to the Curious Elixirs Curious Cocktail Club can help ease the transition. Each month, you’ll receive four or 12 nonalcoholic beverages — from cocktail-inspired drinks to beer and wine alternatives — all made with organic juices, herbs, spices, roots, and botanicals with no refined sugar.

We’ve all been there: you mean to hit the gym, make that deadline, or finally read that book — and then get lost in TikTok videos. Thankfully, The Brick helps cut down on distractions. By tapping your phone against the small device, you can block apps or sites and set up custom focus modes. To regain access, you have to physically return to The Brick, making it less likely you’ll give in.

If you’re one of the many, many people who received a password reset email from Instagram the other day, the company says it fixed the issue. What was the issue? Unclear. We reached out to Meta for clarification and have yet to receive a response. All we know is that an “external party” triggered the emails, and Instagram says you can safely ignore them.

The company posted on X that the issue had been fixed and also claimed there was no breach of its systems. This seemingly contradicts reports from Malwarebytes, which said that information on 17.5 million Instagram accounts, including usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, was available on the dark web.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <h2>Securing digital assets as crypto crime surges</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1129479/securing-digital-assets-as-crypto-crime-surges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2025, cyberattackers thought to be linked to North Korea executed a sophisticated supply chain attack on cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. By targeting its infrastructure and multi-signature security process, hackers managed to steal more than $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum in the largest known digital-asset theft to date.

The ripple effects were felt across the cryptocurrency market, with the price of Bitcoin dropping 20% from its record high in January. And the massive losses put 2025 on track to be the worst year in history for cryptocurrency theft.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins have established themselves as benchmark monetary vehicles, and, despite volatility, their values continue to rise. In October 2025, the value of cryptocurrency and other digital assets topped $4 trillion.

Yet, with this burgeoning value and liquidity comes more attention from cybercriminals and digital thieves. The Bybit attack demonstrates how focused sophisticated attackers are on finding ways to break the security measures that guard the crypto ecosystem, says Charles Guillemet, chief technology officer of Ledger, a provider of secure signer platforms.

”The attackers were very well organized, they have plenty of money, and they are spending a lot of time and resources trying to attack big stuff, because they can,” he says. “In terms of opportunity costs, it&#39;s a big investment, but if at the end they earn $1.4 billion it makes sense to do this investment.”

But it also demonstrates how the crypto threat landscape has pitfalls not just for the unwary but for the tech savvy too. On the one hand, cybercriminals are using techniques like social engineering to target end users. On the other, they are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities to exploit at different points in the cryptocurrency infrastructure.

Historically, owners of digital assets have had to stand against these attackers alone. But now, cybersecurity firms and cryptocurrency-solution providers are offering new solutions, powered by in-depth threat research.

One of the advantages of cryprocurrency is self custody. Users can save their private keys—the critical piece of alphanumeric code that proves ownership and grants full control over digital assets—into either a software or hardware wallet to safeguard it.

But users must put their faith in the security of the wallet technology, and, because the data is the asset, if the keys are lost or forgotten, the value too can be lost.

”If I hack your credit card, what is the issue? You will call your bank, and they will manage to revert the operations,” says Vincent Bouzon, head of the Donjon research team at Ledger. &quot;The problem with crypto is, if something happens, it&#39;s too late. So we must eliminate the possibility of vulnerabilities and give users security.”

Increasingly, attackers are focusing on digital assets known as stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the value of a hard asset, such as gold, or a fiat currency, like the US dollar.

Stablecoins rely on smart contracts—digital contracts stored on blockchain that use pre-set code to manage issuance, maintain value, and enforce rules—that can be vulnerable to different classes of attacks, often taking advantage of users&#39; credulity or lack of awareness about the threats. Post-theft countermeasures, such as freezing the transfer of coins and blacklisting of addresses, can lessen the risk with these kinds of attacks, however.

Software-based wallets, also known as “hot wallets,” which are applications or programs that run on a user’s computer, phone, or web browser, are often a weak link. While their connection to the internet makes them convenient for users, it also makes them more readily accessible to hackers too.

“If you are using a software wallet, by design it&#39;s vulnerable because your keys are stored inside your computer or inside your phone. And unfortunately, a phone or a computer is not designed for security.” says Guillemet.

The rewards for exploiting this kind of vulnerability can be extensive. Hackers who stole credentials in a targeted attack on encrypted password manager application LastPass in 2022 managed to transfer millions worth of cryptocurrency away from victims in the subsequent two or more years.

Even hardware-based wallets, which often resemble USB drives or key fobs and are more secure than their software counterparts since they are completely offline, can have vulnerabilities that a diligent attacker might find and exploit.

Tactics include the use of side-channel attacks, for example, where a cycbercriminal observes a system’s physical side effects, like timing, power, or electromagnetic and acoustic emissions to gain information about the implementation of an algorithm.

Guillemet explains that cybersecurity providers building digital asset solutions, such as wallets, need to help minimize the burden on the users by building security features and providing education about enhancing defense.

For businesses to protect cryptocurrency, tokens, critical documents, or other digital assets, this could be a platform that allows multi-stakeholder custody and governance, supports software and hardware protections, and allows for visibility of assets and transactions through Web3 checks.

As the threat landscape evolves at breakneck speed, in-depth research conducted by attack labs like Ledger Donjon can help security firms keep pace. The team at Ledger Donjon are working to understand how to proactively secure the digital asset ecosystem and set global security standards.

Key projects include the team’s offensive security research, which uses ethical and white hat hackers to simulate attacks and uncover weaknesses in hardware wallets, cryptographic systems, and infrastructure.

In November 2022, the Donjon team discovered a vulnerability in Web3 wallet platform Trust Wallet, which had been acquired by Binance. They found that the seed-phrase generation was not random enough, allowing the team to compute all possible private keys and putting as much as $30 million stored in Trust Wallet accounts at risk, says Bouzon. “The entropy was not high enough, the entropy was only 4 billion. It was huge, but not enough,” he says.

To enhance overall safety there are three key principles that digital-asset protection platforms should apply, says Bouzon. First, security providers should create secure algorithms to generate the seed phrases for private keys and conduct in-depth security audits of the software. Second, users should use hardware wallets with a secure screen instead of software wallets. And finally, any smart contract transaction should include visibility into what is being signed to avoid blind signing attacks.

Ultimately, the responsibility for safeguarding these valuable assets lies on both digital asset solution providers and the users themselves. As the value of cryptocurrencies continues to grow so too will the threat landscape as hackers keep attempting to circumvent new security measures. While digital asset providers, security firms, and wallet solutions must work to build strong and simple protection to support the cryptocurrency ecosystems, users must also seek out the information and education they need to proactively protect themselves and their wallets.

            <div id="article-text">Our reporters and editors constantly debate which emerging technologies will define the future. Once a year, we take stock and share some educated guesses with our readers. Here are the advances that we think will drive progress or incite the most change—for better or worse—in the years ahead.

Sodium-ion batteries, made from abundant materials like salt, are emerging as a cheaper, safer alternative to lithium. Backed by major players and public investment, they’re poised to power grids and affordable EVs worldwide.

AI coding tools are revolutionizing how we write, test, and deploy code, making it easier and faster to build sophisticated websites, games, and other applications than ever before. Just be sure to double-check what they come up with.

Nuclear power already provides steady electricity to grids around the world, without producing any greenhouse-gas emissions. New designs rely on alternative fuels and cooling systems or take up less space, which could get more reactors online faster.

From molten salt to TRISO fuel, here’s how technological advancements could upend an old power technology.

Every day, millions of people interact with AI chatbots. Some of them form what feel like close, personal bonds with the bots. There’s mounting evidence that this can be dangerous, and politicians are finally waking up.

When he was just seven months old, baby KJ became the first person to receive a personalized gene-editing treatment. A clinical trial is now planned, and bespoke gene-editing drugs could be approved within the next few years.

Growing banks of gene information on extinct creatures are providing clues to new treatments and suggesting solutions to climate change—and may help save endangered species.

Nobody knows exactly how large language models work, which means we don’t have a clear idea of their limitations. But that’s changing: Clever research techniques are giving us the best glimpse yet of what’s really going on inside the black box.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

Space tourism may seem fanciful, but this might be the year paying customers can finally check into a room with a galactic view. The shiny new modules will also support research missions by scientists and space agencies.

Screening embryos for genetic diseases is relatively common practice in fertility clinics today, and it can give potential parents some peace of mind. Now, though, new startups are making bold claims about using similar techniques to predict certain traits, including intelligence.

The race for AI supremacy has supercharged data centers. Hyperscale AI data centers pack powerful computer chips into synchronized clusters that work like giant, high-speed supercomputers—sizzling hot, power-hungry behemoths pushing infrastructure to its limits.

MIT Technology Review’s annual list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies aims to help our audience know which emerging technologies are really worth paying attention to right now. Our editors and reporters pitch advances that they think should make the list, and we discuss and debate the merits of each over the course of several months.

We look for breakthroughs that will have a broad impact and make meaningful differences in our lives and work. We give equal consideration to those that we think will have a positive effect or bring negative consequences. Every year, we have to pass on many worthy candidates. Here’s what didn’t make the list this year.

This is the 25th year we’ve produced this list. Predicting the future is tough and we don’t always get it right. Look back through our archives to see what’s worked out—and what hasn’t. Or read this special analysis by an MIT researcher about some of the flops.

            <h2>Why some “breakthrough” technologies don’t work out</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1130726/opinion-breakthrough-technology-failures-flops/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every year, MIT Technology Review publishes a list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies. In fact, the 2026 version is out today. This marks the 25th year the newsroom has compiled this annual list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning.

We ask these MIT students to find some of the “flops” from breakthrough lists in the archives and consider what factors or decisions led to their demise, and then to envision possible ways to “flip” the negative outcome into a success. The idea is to combine critical perspective and creativity when thinking about technology.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. It reveals how factors outside what is narrowly understood as technology play a role in its success—factors including cultural context, social acceptance, market competition, and simply timing.

In some cases, the vision behind a breakthrough was prescient but the technology of the day was not the best way to achieve it. Social TV (featured on the list in 2010) is an example: Its advocates proposed different ways to tie together social platforms and streaming services to make it easier to chat or interact with your friends while watching live TV shows when you weren’t physically together.

This idea rightly reflected the great potential for connection in this modern era of pervasive cell phones, broadband, and Wi-Fi. But it bet on a medium that was in decline: live TV.

Still, anyone who had teenage children during the pandemic can testify to the emergence of a similar phenomenon—youngsters started watching movies or TV series simultaneously on streaming platforms while checking comments on social media feeds and interacting with friends over messaging apps.

Shared real-time viewing with geographically scattered friends did catch on, but instead of taking place through one centralized service, it emerged organically on multiple platforms and devices. And the experience felt unique to each group of friends, because they could watch whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted, independent of the live TV schedule.

Here are a few more examples of flops from the breakthroughs list that students in the 2025 edition of my course identified, and the lessons that we could take from each.

The DNA app store (from the 2016 list) was selected by Kaleigh Spears. It seemed like a great deal at the time—a startup called Helix could sequence your genome for just $80. Then, in the company’s app store, you could share that data with third parties that promised to analyze it for relevant medical info, or make it into fun merch. But Helix has since shut down the store and no longer sells directly to consumers.Privacy concerns and doubts about the accuracy of third-party apps were among the main reasons the service didn’t catch on, particularly since there’s minimal regulation of health apps in the US.

Elvis Chipiro picked universal memory (from the 2005 list). The vision was for one memory tech to rule them all—flash, random-access memory, and hard disk drives would be subsumed by a new method that relied on tiny structures called carbon nanotubes to store far more bits per square centimeter. The company behind the technology, Nantero, raised significant funds and signed on licensing partners but struggled to deliver a product on its stated timeline.Nantero ran into challenges when it tried to produce its memory at scale because tiny variations in the way the nanotubes were arranged could cause errors. It also proved difficult to upend memory technologies that were already deeply embedded within the industry and well integrated into fabs.

Light-field photography (from the 2012 list), chosen by Cherry Tang, let you snap a photo and adjust the image’s focus later. You’d never deal with a blurry photo ever again. To make this possible, the startup Lytro had developed a special camera that captured not just the color and intensity of light but also the angle of its rays. It was one of the first cameras of its kind designed for consumers. Even so, the company shut down in 2018.

Ultimately, Lytro was outmatched by well-established incumbents like Sony and Nokia. The camera itself had a tiny display, and the images it produced were fairly low resolution. Readjusting the focus in images using the company’s own software also required a fair amount of manual work. And smartphones—with their handy built-in cameras—were becoming ubiquitous.

Many students over the years have selected Project Loon (from the 2015 list)—one of the so-called “moonshots” out of Google X. It proposed using gigantic balloons to replace networks of cell-phone towers to provide internet access, mainly in remote areas. The company completed field tests in multiple countries and even provided emergency internet service to Puerto Rico during the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. But the company shut down the project in 2021, with Google X CEO Astro Teller saying in a blog post that “the road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped.”

Sean Lee, from my 2025 class, saw the reason for its flop in the company’s very mission: Project Loon operated in low-income regions where customers had limited purchasing power. There were also substantial commercial hurdles that may have slowed development—the company relied on partnerships with local telecom providers to deliver the service and had to secure government approvals to navigate in national airspaces.

While this specific project did not become a breakthrough, the overall goal of making the internet more accessible through high-altitude connectivity has been carried forward by other companies, most notably Starlink with its constellation of low-orbit satellites. Sometimes a company has the right idea but the wrong approach, and a firm with a different technology can make more progress.

As part of this class exercise, we also ask students to pick a technology from the list that they think might flop in the future. Here, too, their choices can be quite illuminating.

Lynn Grosso chose synthetic data for AI (a 2022 pick), which means using AI to generate data that mimics real-world patterns for other AI models to train on. Though it’s become more popular as tech companies have run out of real data to feed their models, she points out that this practice can lead to model collapse, with AI models trained exclusively on generated data eventually breaking the connection to data drawn from reality.

And Eden Olayiwole thinks the long-term success of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm (a 2021 pick) is in jeopardy as awareness grows of the technology’s potential harms and its tendency to, as she puts it, incentive creators to “microwave” ideas for quick consumption.

But she also offers a possible solution. Remember—we asked all the students what they would do to “flip” the flopped (or soon-to-flop) technologies they selected. The idea was to prompt them to think about better ways of building or deploying these tools.

For TikTok, Olayiwole suggests letting users indicate which types of videos they want to see more of, instead of feeding them an endless stream based on their past watching behavior. TikTok already lets users express interest in specific topics, but she proposes taking it a step further to give them options for content and tone—allowing them to request more educational videos, for example, or more calming content.

It’s always challenging to predict how a technology will shape a future that itself is in motion. Predictions not only make a claim about the future; they also describe a vision of what matters to the predictor, and they can influence how we behave, innovate, and invest.

One of my main takeaways after years of running this exercise with students is that there’s not always a clear line between a successful breakthrough and a true flop. Some technologies may not have been successful on their own but are the basis of other breakthrough technologies (natural-language processing, 2001). Others may not have reached their potential as expected but could still have enormous impact in the future (brain-machine interfaces, 2001). Or they may need more investment, which is difficult to attract when they are not flashy (malaria vaccine, 2022).

Despite the flops over the years, this annual practice of making bold and sometimes risky predictions is worthwhile. The list gives us a sense of what advances are on the technology community’s radar at a given time and reflects the economic, social, and cultural values that inform every pick. When we revisit the 2026 list in a few years, we’ll see which of today’s values have prevailed.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

We’ll keep following these developments, but this just wasn’t their year. Here’s why.

It’s free and easy to nominate yourself or someone you know—here’s how.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

            <h2>The astronaut training tourists to fly in the world’s first commercial space station</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1130817/vast-astronaut-drew-feustel-nasa-space-station/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, space stations have been largely staffed by professional astronauts and operated by a handful of nations. But that’s about to change in the coming years, as companies including Axiom Space and Sierra Space launch commercial space stations that will host tourists and provide research facilities for nations and other firms.

The first of those stations could be Haven-1, which the California-based company Vast aims to launch in May 2026. If all goes to plan, its earliest paying visitors will arrive about a month later. Drew Feustel, a former NASA astronaut, will help train them and get them up to speed ahead of their historic trip. Feustel has spent 226 days in space on three trips to the International Space Station (ISS) and the Hubble Space Telescope.

Feustel is now lead astronaut for Vast, which he advised on the new station’s interior design. He also created a months-long program to prepare customers to live and work there. Crew members (up to four at a time) will arrive at Haven-1 via a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will dock to the station and remain attached throughout each 10-day stay. (Vast hasn’t publicly said who will fly on its first missions or announced the cost of a ticket, though competing firms have charged tens of millions of dollars for similar trips.)

Haven-1 is intended as a temporary facility, to be followed by a bigger, permanent station called Haven-2. Vast will begin launching Haven-2’s modules in 2028 and says it will be able to support a crew by 2030. That’s about when NASA will start decommissioning the ISS, which has operated for almost 30 years. Instead of replacing it, NASA and its partners intend to carry out research aboard commercial stations like those built by Vast, Axiom, and Sierra.

I recently caught up with Feustel in Lisbon at the tech conference Web Summit, where he was speaking about his role at Vast and the company’s ambitions.

Responses have been edited and condensed.

What are you hoping this new wave of commercial space stations will enable people to do?

Ideally, we’re creating access. The paradigm that we’ve seen for 25 years is primarily US-backed missions to the International Space Station, and [NASA] operating that station in coordination with other nations. But [it’s] still limited to 16 or 17 primary partners in the ISS program.

Following NASA’s intentions, we are planning to become a service provider to not only the US government, but other sovereign nations around the world, to allow greater access to a low-Earth-orbit platform. We can be a service provider to other organizations and nations that are planning to build a human spaceflight program.

Today, you’re Vast’s lead astronaut after you were initially brought on to advise the company on the design of Haven-1 and Haven-2. What are some of the things that you&#39;ve weighed in on?

Some of the things where I can see tangible evidence of my work is, for example, in the sleep cores and sleep system—trying to define a more comfortable way for astronauts to sleep. We’ve come up with an air bladder system that provides distributed forces on the body that kind of emulate, or I believe will emulate, the gravity field that we feel in bed when we lie down, having that pressure of gravity on you.

Kind of like a weighted blanket, but you’re up against the wall, so you have to create, like, an inflatable bladder that will push you against the wall. That’s one of the very tangible, obvious things. But I work with the company on anything from crew displays and interfaces and how notifications and system information come through to how big a window should be.

How big should a window be? I feel like the bigger the better—but what are the factors that go into that, from an astronaut’s perspective?

The bigger the better. And the other thing to think about is—what do you do with the window? Take pictures. The ability to take photos out a window is important—the quality of the window, which direction it points. You know, it’s not great if it’s just pointing up in space all the time and you never see the Earth.

You’re also in charge of the astronaut training program at Vast. Tell me what that program looks like, because in some cases you’ll have private citizens who are paying for their trip that have no experience whatsoever.

A typical training flow for two weeks on our space station is extended out to about an 11-month period with gaps in between each of the training weeks. And so if you were to press that down together, it probably represents about three to four months of day-to-day training.

I would say half of it’s devoted to learning how to fly on the SpaceX Dragon, because that’s our transportation, and the greatest risk for anybody flying is on launch and landing. We want people to understand how to operate in that spacecraft, and that component is designed by SpaceX. They have their own training plans.

What we do is kind of piggyback on those weeks. If a crew shows up in California to train at SpaceX, we’ll grab them that same week and say, “Come down to our facility. We will train you to operate inside our spacecraft.” Much of that is focused on emergency response. We want the crew to be able to keep themselves safe. In case anything happens on the vehicle that requires them to depart, to get back in the SpaceX Dragon and leave, we want to make sure that they understand all of the steps required.

Another part is day-to-day living, like—how do you eat? How do you sleep, how do you use the bathroom? Those are really important things. How do you download the pictures after you take them? How do you access your science payloads that are in our payload racks that provide data and telemetry for the research you’re doing?

We want to practice every one of those things multiple times, including just taking care of yourself, before you go to space so that when you get there, you’ve built a lot of that into your muscle memory, and you can just do the things you need to do instead of every day being like a really steep learning curve.

Strawberries and other perishable foods are freeze-dried by the Vast Food Systems team to prepare them for missions.

Do you have a facility where you’ll take people through some of these motions? Or a virtual simulation of some kind?

We have built a training mock-up, an identical vehicle to what people will live in in space. But it’s not in a zero-gravity environment. The only way to get any similar training is to fly on what we call a zero-g airplane, which does parabolas in space—it climbs up and then falls toward the Earth. Its nickname is the vomit comet.

But otherwise, there’s really no way to train for microgravity. You just have to watch videos and talk about it a lot, and try to prepare people mentally for what that’s going to be like. You can also train underwater, but that’s more related to spacewalking, and it’s much more advanced.

How do you expect people will spend their time in the station?

If history is any indication, they will be quite busy and probably oversubscribed. Their time will be spent basically caring for themselves, and trying to execute their experiments, and looking out the window. Those are the three big categories of what you’re going to do in space. And public relation activities like outreach back to Earth, to schools or hospitals or corporations.

This new era means that many more everyday people—though mostly wealthy ones at the beginning, because of ticket prices—will have this interesting view of Earth. How do you think the average person will react to that?

A good analogy is to say, how are people reacting to sub-orbital flights? Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic offer suborbital flights, [which are] basically three or four minutes of floating and looking down at the Earth from an altitude that’s about a third or a fifth of the altitude that actual orbital and career astronauts achieve when they circle the planet.

If you look at the reaction of those individuals and what they perceive, it’s amazing, right? It’s like awe and wonder. It’s the same way that astronauts react and talk when we see Earth—and say if more humans could see Earth from space, we’d probably be a little bit better about being humans on Earth.

That’s the hope, is that we create that access and more people can understand what it means to live on this planet. It’s essentially a spacecraft—it’s got its own environmental control system that keeps us alive, and that’s a big deal.

Some people have expressed ambitions for this kind of station to enable humans to become a multiplanetary species. Do you share that ambition for our species? If so, why?

Yeah, I do. I just believe that humans need to have the ability to live off of the planet. I mean, we’re capable of it, and we’re creating that access now. So why wouldn’t we explore space and go further and farther and learn to live in other areas?

Not to say that we should deplete everything here and deplete everything there. But maybe we take some of the burden off of the place that we call home. I think there’s a lot of reasons to live and work in space and off our own planet.

There’s not really a backup plan for no Earth. We know that there are risks from the space around us—dinosaurs fell prey to space hazards. We should be aware of those and work harder to extend our capabilities and create some backup plans.

            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.
