            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jared Isaacman, a pilot and financial tech billionaire, has commanded two groundbreaking spaceflights, including leading the first private spacewalk.

But his most remarkable flying has occurred over the last year. And on Wednesday, he stuck the landing by earning formal Senate approval to become NASA’s 15th administrator.

With a final tally of 67 to 30, Wednesday’s Senate confirmation came 377 days after President Trump first nominated Isaacman to serve as NASA administrator. Since that time, Isaacman had to navigate the following issues:

One of the biggest questions about Isaacman after his nomination in late 2024 was whether he had the political gamesmanship to run NASA. Few questioned his interest in space, knowledge of the industry, or flight experience. But he had no political experience. Could he handle the rigors of managing a tempestuous White House and fractured Congress?

The answer after he navigated the last year appears to be, quite clearly, yes.

The 42-year-old private astronaut becomes the youngest person to lead NASA. He has waited more than a year to take on the job, subjecting himself to scrutiny of his financial dealings, divesting himself of conflicts of interest, and answering question after question from lawmakers.

Now, finally, he will get a chance to act, rather than react to everyone else.

As the Project Athena plan clearly demonstrates, Isaacman has a good handle on the problems besetting NASA, an aging and increasingly bureaucratic agency. NASA can still do great things, but it has become almost infinitely harder since the heady days of Apollo six decades ago.

Isaacman has ideas to shake things up, but not to the extent of wanton change for the sake of change. It is clear from the interviews he has given to others, and in talking to him myself, that Isaacman is also a good listener. He wants to understand problems to he can work with others to apply thoughtful solutions.

Perhaps most importantly for NASA, unlike some other Trump administration nominees, he appears to be a builder, not a leveler.

Isaacman is coming into a beleaguered and bruised agency that has faced an extraordinarily difficult year. Thanks in part to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, about 20 percent of the agency’s 17,500 employees took buyouts or early retirements. There have been significant layoffs at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and there are concerns about the future of Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Moreover, the agency is locked into a high-stakes race with China to return humans to the Moon, which, over the last 12 months, has swung in China’s favor.

NASA’s administrator is responsible for carrying out the administration’s policies and working with Congress to secure funding to do so. In this, Isaacman finds himself between a Trump administration that sought to cut NASA’s budget by 24 percent, and a House and Senate that rejected the vast majority of those cuts in budget bills.

Looking over the last year, it would be easy to say NASA and Isaacman have lost more than half a year because of the withdrawal of Isaacman’s nomination in late May, when he was within days of bipartisan Senate approval. However, in the intervening months, Isaacman has made strong contacts within the US Senate and the White House. As part of the campaign to build support for his renomination, Isaacman emerges with considerably more political experience, a much closer relationship with Trump, and a deeper roster of contacts in his phone.

All of which is good, because for all of the fancy flying Isaacman has done to reach this point, his most difficult sorties lie ahead of him.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Physicists at the University of Amsterdam came up with a really cool bit of Christmas decor: a miniature 3D-printed Christmas tree, a mere 8 centimeters tall, made of ice, without any refrigeration equipment or other freezing technology, and at minimal cost. The secret is evaporative cooling, according to a preprint posted to the physics arXiv.

Evaporative cooling is a well-known phenomenon; mammals use it to regulate body temperature. You can see it in your morning cup of hot coffee: the hotter atoms rise to the top of the magnetic trap and “jump out” as steam. It also plays a role (along with shock wave dynamics and various other factors) in the formation of “wine tears.” It’s a key step in creating Bose-Einstein condensates.

And evaporative cooling is also the main culprit behind the infamous “stall” that so frequently plagues aspiring BBQ pit masters eager to make a successful pork butt. The meat sweats as it cooks, releasing the moisture within, and that moisture evaporates and cools the meat, effectively canceling out the heat from the BBQ. That’s why a growing number of competitive pit masters wrap their meat in tinfoil after the first few hours (usually when the internal temperature hits 170° F).

Ice-printing methods usually rely on cryogenics or on cooled substrates. Per the authors, this is the first time evaporative cooling principles have been applied to 3D printing. The trick was to house the 3D printing inside a vacuum chamber using a jet nozzle as the printing head—something they discovered serendipitously when they were trying to get rid of air drag by spraying water in a vacuum chamber.  “The printer’s motion control guides the water jet layer-by-layer, building geometry on demand,” the authors wrote in a blog post for Nature, adding:

At very low pressure, water molecules at the liquid surface escape continuously as vapor. Each departing molecule carries the latent heat of vaporization, thus cooling the water jet. The very fine jet we use for printing has a very high surface-to-volume ratio, making heat extraction very efficient: the bulk liquid cools rapidly, dropping tens of Kelvin over a fraction of a second. When the jet reaches the substrate or a previously deposited ice layer, it freezes just after its impact.

And when the holidays are over, just turn off the vacuum pump and watch your tree melt back into its watery state, “no residue, no post-processing waste.”

The applications aren’t limited to Christmas trees. The purity of the ice makes it ideal for biological applications such as scaffolding for tissue: any branching ice form can be cast in resin or polymer and when it melts, it will leave behind hollow channels. It can also be used to create custom fluid networks for microfluidics applications. And if you have plans to camp out on Mars with its cold temperatures and thin atmosphere, the method could enable 3D printed structures out of water ice, with no need for heavy and expensive cryogenic equipment.

            <h2>OpenAI’s new ChatGPT image generator makes faking photos easy</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/openais-new-chatgpt-image-generator-makes-faking-photos-easy/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For most of photography’s roughly 200-year history, altering a photo convincingly required either a darkroom, some Photoshop expertise, or, at minimum, a steady hand with scissors and glue. On Tuesday, OpenAI released a tool that reduces the process to typing a sentence.

It’s not the first company to do so. While OpenAI had a conversational image-editing model in the works since GPT-4o in 2024, Google beat OpenAI to market in March with a public prototype, then refined it to a popular model called Nano Banana image model (and Nano Banana Pro). The enthusiastic response to Google’s image-editing model in the AI community got OpenAI’s attention.

OpenAI’s new GPT Image 1.5 is an AI image synthesis model that reportedly generates images up to four times faster than its predecessor and costs about 20 percent less through the API. The model rolled out to all ChatGPT users on Tuesday and represents another step toward making photorealistic image manipulation a casual process that requires no particular visual skills.

GPT Image 1.5 is notable because it’s a “native multimodal” image model, meaning image generation happens inside the same neural network that processes language prompts. (In contrast, DALL-E 3, an earlier OpenAI image generator previously built into ChatGPT, used a different technique called diffusion to generate images.)

This newer type of model, which we covered in more detail in March, treats images and text as the same kind of thing: chunks of data called “tokens” to be predicted, patterns to be completed. If you upload a photo of your dad and type “put him in a tuxedo at a wedding,” the model processes your words and the image pixels in a unified space, then outputs new pixels the same way it would output the next word in a sentence.

Using this technique, GPT Image 1.5 can more easily alter visual reality than earlier AI image models, changing someone’s pose or position, or rendering a scene from a slightly different angle, with varying degrees of success. It can also remove objects, change visual styles, adjust clothing, and refine specific areas while preserving facial likeness across successive edits. You can converse with the AI model about a photograph, refining and revising, the same way you might workshop a draft of an email in ChatGPT.

Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in a blog post that ChatGPT’s chat interface was never designed for visual work. “Creating and editing images is a different kind of task and deserves a space built for visuals,” Simo wrote. To that end, OpenAI introduced a dedicated image creation space in ChatGPT’s sidebar with preset filters and trending prompts.

The release’s timing seems like a direct response to Google’s technical gains in AI, including a massive growth in chatbot user base. In particular, Google’s Nano Banana image model (and Nano Banana Pro) became popular on social media after its August release, thanks to its ability to render text relatively clearly and preserve faces consistently across edits.

OpenAI’s previous token-based image synthesis model could make some targeted edits based on conversational prompts, but it often changed facial details and other elements that users might have wanted to keep. GPT Image 1.5 appears designed to match the editing features that Google already shipped. But if you happen to prefer the older ChatGPT image generator, OpenAI says the previous version will remain available as a custom GPT (for now) for users who prefer it.

GPT Image 1.5 is not perfect. In our brief testing, it didn’t always follow prompting directions very well. But when it does work, the results seem more convincing and detailed than OpenAI’s previous multimodal image model. For a more detailed comparison, a software consultant named Shaun Pedicini has put together an instructive site (“GenAI Image Editing Showdown”) that conducts A/B testing of various AI image models.

And while we’ve written about this a lot over the past few years, it’s probably worth repeating that barriers to realistic photo editing and manipulation keep dropping. This kind of seamless, realistic, effortless AI image manipulation may prompt (pun intended) a cultural recalibration of what visual images mean to society. It can also feel a little scary, for someone who grew up in an earlier media era, to see yourself put into situations that didn’t really happen.

For most of photography’s history, a convincing forgery required skill, time, and resources. Those barriers made fakery rare enough that we could treat many photographs as a reasonable proxy for truth, although they could be manipulated (and often were). That era has ended due to AI, but GPT Image 1.5 seems to remove yet more of the remaining friction.

The capability to preserve facial likeness across edits has obvious utility for legitimate photo editing and equally obvious potential for misuse. Image generators have already been used to create non-consensual intimate imagery and impersonate real people.

With those hazards in mind, OpenAI’s image generators have always included a filter that usually blocks sexual or violent outputs. But it’s still possible to create embarrassing images of people without their consent (even though it violates OpenAI’s terms of service) while avoiding those topics. The company says generated images include C2PA metadata identifying them as AI-created, though that data can be stripped by resaving the file.

Speaking of fakes, text rendering has been a long-standing weakness in image generators that has slowly gotten better. By prompting some older image synthesis models to create a sign or poster with specific words, the results often come back garbled or misspelled.

OpenAI says GPT Image 1.5 can handle denser and smaller text. The company’s blog post includes a demonstration where the model generated an image of a newspaper with a multi-paragraph article, complete with headlines, a byline, benchmark tables, and body text that remains legible at the paragraph level. Whether this holds up across varied prompts will require broader testing.

While the newspaper in the example looks fake now, it’s another step toward the potential erosion of the public’s perception of the pre-Internet historical record as image synthesis becomes more realistic.

OpenAI acknowledged in its blog post that the new model still has problems, including limited support for certain drawing styles and mistakes when generating images that require scientific accuracy. But they think it will get better over time. “We believe we’re still at the beginning of what image generation can enable,” the company wrote. And if the past three years of progress in image synthesis are any indication, they may be correct.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in October, word started making the rounds of an AI startup called Doublespeed. Backed by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Doublespeed offers customers a unique service: access to a massive phone farm that could be used to operate hundreds of AI-generated social media accounts.

Now, 404 Media reports in an explosive scoop that Doublespeed has been hacked. This wasn’t just one account associated with the startup, but the entire backend used to manage its phone farm — so it provides an extraordinary glimpse at how the service is actually being used to manipulate social media at scale.

Speaking to 404 on condition of anonymity, the hacker said they can “see the phones in use, which manager [computers controlling the phones] they had, which TikTok accounts they were assigned, proxies in use (and their passwords), and pending tasks. As well as the link to control devices for each manager.”

The hacker also shared a list of over 400 TikTok accounts operated by Doublespeed’s phone farm, about half of which were actively promoting products. Most of them, the publication reports, did so without disclosing that the posts were ads — a direct violation of TikTok’s terms of use, not to mention the Federal Trade Commission’s digital advertising regulations.

While undisclosed ads might seem like small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, the speak to a bleak trend. Not only is Doublespeed a possible breeding ground for disinformation campaigns or financial scams, but they seem to be getting away with their phone farm operation without any pushback from TikTok.

Doublespeed’s TikTok accounts ran a gamut of different cons, promoting language learning apps, supplements, massage products, dating apps and more. One account, operating under the unambiguously human-sounding name of Chloe Davis, had uploaded some 200 posts featuring an AI-generated woman hawking a massage roller for a company called Vibit, 404 reported.

Though the hacker says he reported the vulnerability to Doublespeed on October 31, he notes that he still had access to the company’s back end as recently as today.

So far, Doublespeed is only active on TikTok, though it has plans to expand to Instagram, Reddit, and X-formerly-Twitter. When it does, it seems all bets are off — with social media engagement, and all the influence it entails, being relegated to the highest bidder.

            <h2>AI Sends School Into Lockdown After It Mistook a Student’s Clarinet for a Gun</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-17</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Students at Lawton Chiles Middle School in Florida were sent scrambling into lockdown last week, after an alert from an AI surveillance system detected a student carrying a gun.

There’s just one issue: the “gun” was actually a band student’s clarinet.

The whole thing unraveled quickly, according to local reporting. When the alert went out, it triggered an automatic “code red,” giving administrators no choice but to react to the AI system’s decision.

Luckily nobody was hurt, and local police soon declared the lockdown over. “The code red was a precaution and the children were never in any danger,” local police wrote in a Facebook post.

In a message to parents, school Principal Dr. Melissa Laudani said the district has “multiple layers of school safety, including an automated system that detects potential threats. A student was walking in the hallway, holding a musical instrument as if it were a weapon, which triggered the code red to activate.” (It’s not known what exactly constitutes a “code red,” as it isn’t mentioned in the school’s latest Parent Student handbook.)

Rather than blame the faulty AI system for the commotion — without which the fiasco never would have happened in the first place — the school blamed the young clarinetist.

“While there was no threat to campus, I’d like to ask you to speak with your student about the dangers of pretending to have a weapon on a school campus,” Laudani wrote.

It’s not known what particular system Lawton Chiles has on overwatch, but the fact that it can’t differentiate between a clarinet with 17 keys and a rifle with none is concerning.

The Lawton Chiles incident comes soon after another similar case, in which AI led to the violent detention of a 16-year old teen in Baltimore by at least eight officers with guns drawn. In that case, the school’s AI had somehow misidentified a small bag of Doritos for a handgun, prompting a heavily armed response from city police.

Like the story from Lawton Chiles, the Baltimore false positive could’ve easily been prevented had a human being been in the loop. Instead, it seems both systems allowed the AI to make the call without any challenge from a human being.

Omniilert, the company behind the Dorito incident, insisted that its AI system “functioned as intended: to prioritize safety and awareness through rapid human verification.”

It all underscores just how important it is that these AI school surveillance systems actually work before they’re forced into schools — because when it comes to identifying students with guns, false positives can be just as deadly as a false negatives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not using AI to pretend you have the hot bod of your dreams? Then clearly you’re not the CEO of a half-trillion-dollar AI company.

On Tuesday, OpenAI head honcho Sam Altman posted a holiday themed simulacrum of himself as a hunky firefighter with chiseled abs. Christmas lights are dangled around his neck like a bandolier, while he stands in front of an oversaturated smear that’s supposed to represent a decorated living room in the background. Shoved at the bottom is a calendar for the month of December.

The image was generated with the just-released new version of ChatGPT Images, GPT Image 1.5. OpenAI claims the new model “adheres to your intent more reliably,” allowing users to better fine-tune their images across multiple prompts “while keeping elements like lighting, composition, and people’s appearance consistent.”

The new model comes as Google dominates the conversation with its own image model released last month, Nano Banana Pro, which can generate astonishingly life-like images akin to what you’d see taken by a smartphone. That’s in addition to Google’s other recent showstopping AI release, Gemini 3 Pro, which together have largely dispelled the aura of invincibility OpenAI once possessed in the AI arms race. OpenAI has apparently been so rattled by Google’s massive leapfrog that Altman declared a “code red” behind the scenes.

He’s presenting a much different face to the world, though. The firefighter image of himself that looks ripped from the cover of a $8.99 smut paperback is another example of how Altman is willing to sacrifice whatever vestiges of self-respect he yet possess on the altar of hype through memes and cultural trends.

When OpenAI released Sora 2 this September, Altman allowed fans to use his likeness to generate deepfakes of himself. And the gamble paid off. AI corners of social media, not to mention the Sora 2 app itself, were drowning in a flood of videos showing Altman in all kinds of bizarre and absurd scenarios, like Altman wearing a dress and riding a horse through New York while firing a gun that dispenses money, and begging for GPUs through a doorbell camera, and even grilling a dead Pikachu.

That trend didn’t spawn out of nowhere. To kick off Sora 2’s launch, OpenAI posted a deepfaked video of Altman announcing the new AI app, and shared another promotional video generated with Sora that showed him on a slapstick quest to get to Sora’s launch on time.

Now Altman’s seemingly trying to recapture some of that viral potential with this latest debasement of himself created with his own tech, which is a little sad. It’s clearly a coordinated effort at the company, since another meme-ready AI image of Altman, wearing what appears to be at least five shirts, was posted by the official OpenAI account, too.

Unfortunately for Altman, his AI parody doesn’t look like it’s doing great numbers at the box office. In fact, many instead pointed out something in his firefighter image even more embarrassing than the fact that he was peddling AI thirst traps of himself: the December calendar at the bottom is straight-up inaccurate, showing dates that don’t align with the days of the week. Or at least, not this year; if he’d posted it in 2022 or 2033 instead, it would’ve been on the money.

            <h2>Instacart’s AI-driven pricing tool attracted attention — now the FTC has questions</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/instacarts-ai-driven-pricing-tool-attracted-attention-now-the-ftc-has-questions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">According to Reuters, Instacart is currently getting the regulatory equivalent of a throat-clearing from the FTC, which has sent the grocery delivery platform a civil investigative demand regarding its AI-powered pricing tool, Eversight. Put another way, the agency wants to know why some people are paying substantially more for their organic granola than others.

The issue came to light after a study revealed that shoppers are seeing fairly different prices for identical groceries from the same stores — up to 23% higher prices in some cases. Instacart says these price tests were randomized, not tied to an algorithm that targets customers based on their browsing history. But when people are already anxious about affording eggs, that distinction probably doesn’t mean much.

Dynamic pricing isn’t new or necessarily nefarious. Harvard Business School will tell you it’s how digital platforms stay competitive. Airlines use it, hotels use it, Uber famously uses it. Companies argue that it helps balance supply and demand, maximizes profitability, and creates win-win scenarios.

But there’s a difference between paying surge pricing for a ride home from the bar and paying extra for groceries (food isn’t optional). So while the investigation doesn’t prove wrongdoing, it’s hardly shocking that the FTC — which has investigated data-driven pricing strategies by other companies — is reportedly asking questions. In an economy where everyone’s feeling squeezed, AI-driven price testing of kitchen essentials was bound to attract attention.

For its part, Instacart says the market misunderstands this particular initiative. “Much of what’s been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart,” a spokesperson for the company tells TechCrunch. “First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing – prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices. These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Like pretty much every other tech company in existence, Adobe has leaned heavily into AI over the past several years. The software firm has launched a number of different AI services since 2023, including Firefly — its AI-powered media-generation suite. Now, however, the company’s full-throated embrace of the technology may have led to trouble, as a new lawsuit claims it used pirated books to train one of its AI models.

A proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Elizabeth Lyon, an author from Oregon, claims that Adobe used pirated versions of numerous books — including her own — to train the company’s SlimLM program.

Adobe describes SlimLM as a small language model series that can be “optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices.” It states that SlimLM was pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B, a “deduplicated, multi-corpora, open-source dataset” released by Cerebras in June of 2023. Lyon, who has written a number of guidebooks for non-fiction writing, says that some of her works were included in a pretraining dataset that Adobe had used.

Lyon’s lawsuit, which was originally reported on by Reuters, says that her writing was included in a processed subset of a manipulated dataset that was the basis of Adobe’s program: “The SlimPajama dataset was created by copying and manipulating the RedPajama dataset (including copying Books3),” the lawsuit says. “Thus, because it is a derivative copy of the RedPajama dataset, SlimPajama contains the Books3 dataset, including the copyrighted works of Plaintiff and the Class members.”

“Books3” — a huge collection of 191,000 books that have been used to train GenAI systems — has been an ongoing source of legal trouble for the tech community. RedPajama has also been cited in a number of litigation cases. In September, a lawsuit against Apple claimed the company had used copyrighted material to train its Apple Intelligence model. The litigation mentioned the dataset and accused the tech company of copying protected works “without consent and without credit or compensation.” In October, a similar lawsuit against Salesforce also claimed the company had used RedPajama for training purposes.

Unfortunately for the tech industry, such lawsuits have, by now, become somewhat commonplace. AI algorithms are trained on massive datasets and, in some cases, those datasets have allegedly included pirated materials. In September, Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to a number of authors who had sued it and accused it of using pirated versions of their work to train its chatbot, Claude. The case was considered a potential turning point in the ongoing legal battles over copyrighted material in AI training data, of which there are many.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the next administrator of NASA. The private astronaut and founder of the Shift4 payments processing platform will now be in charge of an agency that faces great uncertainty under President Trump.

Isaacman’s confirmation comes a little over a year after Trump nominated him. It was a volatile year for Isaacman, though, as Trump pulled his nomination in June after becoming concerned about the billionaire’s “prior associations.” (Isaacman had previously donated to Democrats, something Trump was reportedly aware of when he first nominated the entrepreneur.)

That led to months of sniping between Trump’s camp and people more closely aligned with Isaacman, like SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who publicly attacked the credibility of acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy. Trump ultimately flipped in November and re-nominated Isaacman.

The billionaire will now oversee a trimmed-down space agency that Trump has tasked with returning to the moon. SpaceX has a contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface, though Duffy had threatened to revoke that contract, and encouraged Jeff Bezos’ rival company Blue Origin to try to beat Musk’s effort.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The president of the United States just barged into America’s living rooms like an angry, confused grandfather to tell us all that we are ungrateful whelps.

When a president asks for network time, it’s usually to announce something important. But tonight, Donald Trump did not give anything like a normal speech or address. He was clearly working from a prepared text, but it sounded like one he’d written—or dictated angrily—himself, because it was full of bizarre howlers that even Trump’s second-rate speech-writing shop would probably have avoided, such as his assertion that inflation when he took office was the worst it had been in 48 years. (Why did he pick 1977 as a benchmark? Who knows. But he’s wrong.) He read the speech quickly, his voice rising in frustration as he hurled one lie after another into the camera.

We could take apart Trump’s fake facts, as checkers and pundits will do in the next few days. But perhaps more important than false statements—which for Trump are par for the course—was his demeanor. Americans saw a president drenched in panic as he tried to bully an entire nation into admitting he’s doing a great job. For 20 minutes, he vented his hurt feelings without a molecule of empathy or awareness. Economic concerns? Shut up, you fools, the economy is doing fine. (And if it isn’t, it’s not his fault—it’s Joe Biden’s.) Foreign-policy jitters? Zip it, you wimps, America is strong and respected.

In effect, Trump took to the airwaves, pointed his finger, and said: Quiet, piggy.

I consider myself a connoisseur of Trump’s speeches. I’ve watched them and live-tweeted them for years because I think Americans need to see what kind of man sits in the Oval Office. But even by Trump’s standards, this was an unnerving display of fear. I can only imagine America’s enemies in Moscow and Beijing and Tehran smiling with pleasure as they watched a president losing his bearings, berating his own people, and demanding that they absolve him of any blame when things get worse.

His rant contained no news, other than an example of his contempt for the U.S. military, whose loyalty he thinks he can purchase with a onetime $1,776 bonus check. This is projection: Trump has shown his willingness to be bought off with gold bars and trinkets, and he may think that the men and women of the armed forces are people of equally low character.

This was not a holiday address from the leader of a great democracy to its citizens. This was a desperate tin-pot leader yelling into a microphone while cornered in his palace redoubt. The president has been unraveling for weeks, and his speech tonight, like Trump himself, was unworthy of America and its people.</div>

Last week, the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado made a daring escape from her home country to Norway, where she was honored as winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. The team that extracted her had several worries—including the risk that American forces in the Caribbean would strike the boats used in the operation, members told The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.

Luckily, Machado avoided F-16s and drones on her way to Oslo, but the outcome her rescuers feared would have been remarkable: the man who campaigned frantically to win the Nobel Peace Prize inadvertently killing the woman who did, as part of a likely illegal series of boat strikes that may climax with a land war in South America.

Yesterday, Trump—who has deemed himself the “peace president”—escalated his belligerence against Venezuela, announcing a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers and demanding that the government “return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.” This is difficult to parse, but the Trump aide Stephen Miller suggests that it refers to past nationalization of the petroleum industry. In any case, a blockade could be an act of war under international law.

This past Friday, Trump said the United States would launch land strikes within Latin America. “We knocked out 96 percent of the drugs coming in by water, and now we’re starting by land, and by land is a lot easier, and that’s going to start happening,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday. The 96 percent mark is unrealistic and backed by no evidence, as is the notion that land wars are easier than drone strikes at sea.

Congress has neither authorized nor been asked to authorize these actions. The White House has relied on the tortured argument that because it has deemed that U.S. troops are not in active danger, the law doesn’t apply. Nor is it clear what the strategic rationale for such a strike on sovereign countries would be—much less the legal justification. (The administration insists its boat strikes are legal, but officials have been vague about their legal arguments and experts disagree.) Trump has claimed that drug interdiction is a goal, and said Friday that strikes might hit countries other than Venezuela.

But he has also been moving to force Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro out of power, as White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair in an article published this week. Although Trump claims that Maduro is a drug kingpin, American intelligence assessments contradict him, and my Atlantic colleagues have reported that the administration’s real goal is to gain access to oil and rare earth minerals. This apparent drift toward a 19th-century-style imperialist war is notable for a president who ran in 2016 criticizing both parties’ embrace of foreign military interventions. (Trump has said for years, however, that the U.S. should have taken Iraq’s oil—whatever that means.)

In the places where Trump is not on the verge of starting a new war, some of the many conflicts he claims to have resolved stubbornly refuse to stop. On the border between Thailand and Cambodia, both countries continue to fight, part of hostilities that have killed at least two dozen people and forced half a million to flee. Although Trump announced a cease-fire this past Friday, both governments said no such agreement has been struck.

In Africa, fighting also persists between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a rebel group understood to be backed by neighboring Rwanda. In that case, Trump did manage to bring together the leaders of the DRC and Rwanda for a ceremony two weeks ago. The problem is that the peace hasn’t held; instead the rebel group has continued fighting. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described its actions as “a clear violation” of the cease-fire. A cease-fire in Gaza, achieved this fall, is also very tenuous. Israeli air strikes have continued sporadically, and Palestinian officials have said that at least 391 Palestinians have been killed since the agreement. The Israeli and U.S. governments sometimes question those figures, but Axios reports that the White House scolded the Israeli government for a strike over the weekend, which it said was a violation of the cease-fire.

Meanwhile, an end to the war in Ukraine, which Trump seems to want badly, remains elusive. On Monday, American officials said that the United States, Europe, and Ukraine have agreed to security guarantees for Ukraine, though it’s not clear whether Russia will accept the cease-fire plan. The larger problem is still land: As part of a deal, Trump is reportedly pressuring Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia has not managed to capture through its yearslong, grinding war of aggression involving frequent war crimes. For obvious reasons, that’s a nonstarter for Ukraine. But Russia—which knows that Trump likes and often caves to President Vladimir Putin—shows little interest in concessions.

There’s no shame in a president failing to resolve every conflict around the globe. Trump shouldn’t be expected to find solutions that have eluded previous leaders or bedeviled the world for decades—though he should be celebrated if he does; the Abraham Accords and the Gaza cease-fire are positive achievements. The problem is claiming to have resolved conflicts that aren’t over and announcing agreements that aren’t real. Trump doesn’t want to do the work, but he still wants the world to recognize his putative achievements with a Nobel Peace Prize. That honor seems out of reach barring some major developments, but at least he’s got the FIFA Peace Prize.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

In a quiet, almost empty part of Venice stands a Renaissance palazzo with an unusually large garden. The garden is invisible from the outside, blocked by a high brick wall that I recognized when I saw it. In The Aspern Papers, a novella serialized in The Atlantic in 1888, Henry James lets the narrator, a literary scholar whose name we never learn, describe the wall. “It was figured over with the patches that please a painter, repaired breaches, crumblings of plaster, extrusions of brick that had turned pink with time,” he writes. “It suddenly occurred to me that if it did belong to the house I had my pretext” …

I arrived in Venice with a similar goal: to get access to that same garden.

President Donald Trump’s prime-time address tonight included an Oprah-style You get a car! And you get a car! reveal for members of the U.S. military. Specifically, he said that he was giving troops a “war dividend,” a onetime bonus check pegged to a sum with deep patriotic significance: $1,776.

“The checks are already on the way,” Trump said during his address, promising them to more than 1.4 million troops.

The announcement was in keeping with the sort of grand gestures the president often favors. As the host of NBC’s The Apprentice, he savored dramatic twists and tense cliffhangers, and as a Manhattan developer, he reveled in emblazoning his name in big, bold (often gold) letters on his properties, a trend that has continued into his presidency. In his first term, Trump included his full name (“President Donald J. Trump”) just below the words “Economic Impact Payment” on stimulus checks, and his Treasury Department recently confirmed that a portrait of him—the image of him raising his fist following the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the words Fight. Fight. Fight.—may be featured on a commemorative $1 coin pegged to America’s 250th birthday next summer.

The $1,776 checks—which will go to every service member from the rank of private to colonel, or their equivalents—come at a moment when Trump’s relationship with the military is particularly complicated. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth—or secretary of war, as he prefers—prompted widespread ridicule when he summoned hundreds of commanders from around the world to Washington for a bellicose speech unveiling new physical-fitness standards for the military. Despite running as an “America First” isolationist, Trump seems to be inching ever closer to a war with Venezuela, as he and his team authorize military strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean. He said yesterday that the United States will conduct a “blockade” to stop sanctioned oil tankers from entering Venezuela. Critics have argued that the more than two dozen boat strikes, which have so far killed 95 people, are illegal. And six Democratic lawmakers, all of whom served in either the intelligence community or the military, said that they were hearing so much uncertainty and concern from the rank and file that they felt compelled to release a video reminding service members that they are required to refuse illegal orders. (In response, Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition.)

Trump supporters will almost certainly celebrate the bonuses as yet another sign of a commander in chief who appreciates the men and women of the military. But a more cynical interpretation is that the money, although welcome, represents an attempt by Trump to buy loyalty. The bonuses will cost roughly $2.4 billion based on the figures the president provided. The money will come out of the defense budget, but officials have not said what they will cut in order to pay for the checks. The Pentagon referred requests for comment to the White House.

Generals and admirals are notably excluded from receiving the bonuses. Although they occupy the highest pay grades, they often draw the disdain of the defense secretary, who has fired or forced out more than two dozen top officers over the past year.

Read: Pete Hegseth is seriously testing Trump’s ‘no scalps’ rule

Earlier today, the president met with the relatives of two members of the Iowa National Guard and an interpreter killed in Syria as they arrived at Dover Air Force Base, in Delaware, for a dignified-transfer ceremony.

A $1,776 bonus is roughly the same as one month of base pay for a new Army private, not counting allowances for housing and meals. The administration has already given troops a 3.8 percent pay raise as part of the Senate bill that passed today, which allots more than $900 billion for defense. That legislation also increases the amount of additional pay that members of the military receive when they are separated from their family for more than 30 days. And the bill bans transgender women from participating in women’s sports at military-service academies.

The Atlantic reported earlier today that Trump was considering the idea of $1,776 bonuses, but the president did not officially settle on the decision until just hours before his speech.</div>

Living in a fishbowl robs you of the ability to truly discover and become yourself. As such, public surveillance should be restricted to areas of high crime and critical infrastructure. Neither you nor the police are owed a 24/7 visual history of all locations in which a crime might occur.

I&#39;m sure the residents of his neighborhood can answer that question.

Brown university has plenty of cameras, it&#39;s just that the perp was wrapped up like a burrito, making it hard to see his face.

Ok, what car was he driving? Where did he go?

So strange to see you worrying about &quot;children&quot;, but embrace a dumb AR and thoroughly corrupt member of a real pedophile ring as your leader.

No, even the White House chief of staff has confirmed Clinton&#39;s not done anything worth mentioning. And to be honest, how is it the entire Republican machine spent 8 years running a smear campaign against him, and then another 15 against his wife, making up all sorts of allegations up to and including murder, and somehow missed him diddling kids and it not even being a secret because dozens of other major figures and multimillionaires would have seen him do it?

Answer: they didn&#39;t because it didn&#39;t happen.

whataboutism doesn&#39;t really work for the twice impeached rapy orange-faced felon, sorry.

MAGa&#39;s are screwing up 60+ years of good work in Science and Technology ...Nope. The NASA Admin&#39;s job is that of a salesman. To sell NASA and its agenda and its budget to the President, to Congress, and to the American people. ... It is surreal to me.It&#39;s more likely selective memory. A NASA admin being a political appointee and selected primarily on the political metric is hardly anything new. Even if a former engineer.

He also committed to instilling urgency at the space agency, citing China&#39;s space ambitions.Uh, just curious.

Get to Da Moon Base Choppa All Belongs to Us!  Aaaauungh!It&#39;s a pretty big moon.  Lotsa space.  Serious question; between China and the US, does it truly matter who gets (back) there first?

It&#39;s a pretty big moon.  Lotsa space.  Serious question; between China and the US, does it truly matter who gets (back) there first?  Absolutely critical turf?

It&#39;s a pretty big moon, but you likely want to go after the poles (especially the lunar south pole), because that&#39;s where the water is. Not only can you make beer out of it, but you can also turn it into rocket fuel.So you get there first, put down a manned base with a big ol&#39; fence around it, and claim it&#39;s yours.

And then it&#39;s just wash-rinse-repeat. You get into another arms race, the military-industrial complex will need to be fed, and the billionaire circlejerk keeps going.

Let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s an ideological dick measuring contest. If capitalism doesn&#39;t get there first, people might get the wrong idea.

NASA won&#39;t go for the poles. It will be boots on the ground ASAP, nothing fancy.

At the moment it&#39;s looking 50/50 who gets there first.

Boots on the ground already happened about 55 years ago, there is zero point in a moon mission to merely put boots on the ground.

As an aside, this documovie is awesome and everyone here should find the time to watch it at some point: you can get it on various streaming platforms, and it&#39;s also available on Blu-ray: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

What&#39;s important is what you do when you get there. The US raced to the moon the first time then just quit. China, at least as far as they&#39;ve announced, seems to be planning to go and actually do some stuff like set up a long term research base. The US was also planning to do some interesting long term stuff but has cancelled most of that in the interest of beating China.

The US can&#39;t let China have a moment.No, its letting them having all the easily accessible water. Everyone planning on a long term presence needs to plant a base near some ice.

If he&#39;s concerned with pork barrelling and working with Congress and also getting more funding he&#39;s absolutely working with the wrong party and admin.  Maybe the Trump admin is more in space funding favor of it but they are also bad at all of the above and won&#39;t be able to corral Congress, negotiate with Democrats and make effective legislation (all things Biden was able to do) and also not graft on top of it.

From what I&#39;ve read I think he has good intentions but the deal he had to cut to get what he wanted

I&#39;ve actually heard Isaacman is considered a &quot;not terrible&quot; choice within NASA itself. Phil Plait sounded fairly surprised and cautiously optimistic when writing about him earlier this year: https://badastronomy.beehiiv.c...  [beehiiv.com]

His nomination originally was apparently derailed because Musk supported him, and Trump finally got tired of Musk. So it wasn&#39;t due to merit. And much as I think Musk is awful, I don&#39;t see Musk supporting someone to be head of NASA as a disqualification, it seems to be the one agency Mus

ISIS attacks over the past week in Australia and Syria have led some to wonder whether the Islamist terrorist organization, once also known as the Islamic State, is making a comeback.

“Actually,” says Bruce Hoffman, “it never went away.”

Hoffman is a professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations. “We defeated the caliphate,” he told me on Tuesday, referring to the stretch of land—one-third of Syria and two-fifths of Iraq—that ISIS ruled from 2014–19, until a coalition of 90 nations crushed it militarily. But ISIS itself “reverted to its roots and has emerged as a highly capable international terrorist organization” that “still poses a threat to the security of Western countries.”

About 1,000 U.S. troops are still based in Syria, mainly to fight the group’s surviving remnants. So it shouldn’t be too surprising that ISIS militiamen killed two of them, as well as an American translator, in an ambush over the weekend.

Australia is a different case; ISIS has never mounted a political or military challenge to the existing order. But antisemitic incidents have soared in the two years since Hamas’ assault on Israel; the pace of incidents since then is five times as high as in the decade before the war in Gaza got underway. Some of these incidents have been theatrical (anti-Israel graffiti), but some have been deadly—for instance last year’s burning of a synagogue in Melbourne, an event that, like this week’s mass shooting on Bondi Beach, took place around the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.

This latest attack killed at least 15 people.

News outlets have reported that the two gunmen, a father and a son, were “inspired” by ISIS. But Hoffman suspects that the connection is more direct. The pair had recently spent time—and might have been trained—in the southern Philippines, a region he describes as a “hotbed” of ISIS activity.

The Australian people stepped up in response to the latest attack. A Syrian immigrant, the owner of a nearby fruit stand, tackled and disarmed one of the gunmen at great personal risk. More than 20,000 citizens lined up to donate blood for the dozens who were injured in the attack—most of them Jews gathered to celebrate the beginning of Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights. The Australian government also moved swiftly to tighten laws on firearms; the two shooters had bought their weapons legally.

It is hard to say how many ISIS adherents are still around and active. A “counterterrorism guide” published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence estimates between 8,800 and 13,100 (though the document doesn’t explain how it came to such precise figures). Hoffman thinks this number is too low, placing the figure somewhere between 13,000 and 20,000.

At the height of the caliphate, Hoffman says, ISIS had recruited 53,000 foreign fighters from more than 80 countries. Some were subsequently killed; many more likely deserted. But others simply moved. The ODNI fact sheet describes the organization as “a global enterprise, overseeing at least 15 branches and networks in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, as well as supporters worldwide.”

The burning of the Melbourne synagogue wasn’t even the most damaging assault by ISIS last year. In January 2024, two ISIS suicide bombers killed 84 Shiite Muslims who were attending a memorial service for Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s terrorist operations throughout the Middle East, on the fourth anniversary of his assassination. (ISIS is a radical Sunni Muslim group.) Two months later, agents of ISIS-K (the K denotes the Khorasan region, which overlaps parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran) planned and carried out a mass shooting at a concert hall in Moscow, killing 137 and injuring at least 100. (U.S. intelligence officials had warned the Kremlin of the impending attack, but Moscow ignored them.)

“Iran and Moscow are police states,” Hoffman said. “If ISIS can operate in police states, they can operate in Western countries”—as the attack on the open beach in Australia tragically demonstrated.

According to the ODNI document, “ISIS elements use ambushes, IED [improvised-explosive-device] attacks, kidnappings, military-style assaults, suicide operations, and targeted killings,” and the organization “encourages supporters worldwide to conduct operations in their own countries using readily available weapons.” The intelligence agency, however, adds that the group’s ability to train and deploy agents against civilian targets in Europe has been “significantly degraded during the past decade.” Certainly, its ability to mount centralized or coordinated attacks has sharply diminished.

Still, the global war on terrorism, like global terrorism itself, is far from over.

Discussions of race are everywhere and nowhere in 2025. On one hand, President Donald Trump is openly insulting Somali immigrants, describing entire nations as “shithole” countries, and insisting that the most persecuted class of humans are white South Africans. On the other, none of this is actually registering as anything other than Trump being Trump, and so when the Supreme Court agrees to revisit a foundational doctrine like birthright citizenship, too many of us shrug it off. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill about her recent Substack, “Is It Too Late,” in which she argued that it is not too late to save American ideals of democracy and equality, but it is assuredly too late to remain indifferent. Part of that conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity below.

Dahlia Lithwick: There is a very human propensity, especially in times of crisis, to normalize and rationalize and temporize. We comfort the comfortable, and we look for hope in norms and in institutions and in rationality. So many people have this perpetual hope that something’s going to come along and life is going to go back to 2010 or 2012. This hope says that with enough time, and even if it’s uncomfortable right now, someone else is going to come along, or some institution is going to come along, and put us in the DeLorean and we’re all going to go back. Can you talk about the ways in which American exceptionalism and the American normalization bias and the profound—just to talk about the Supreme Court as an example—American trust in institutions can get us to the point where it’s not that we don’t see the fire, we can’t even smell the smoke. You write, “everyone should be on full alert,” but you and I both know that not only are people not on full alert, I’m not even sure what could put them on full alert.

Sherrilyn Ifill: I think things are unraveling pretty fast and people will get on full alert. The only question is, when they get on full alert, will it be too late? That’s why I’m saying: “You might want to do that now.” I’ve been guilty of this as well: not ringing the alarm bell with sufficient urgency. This is something lawyers do all the time, because we’re used to finding the little interstices and figuring out how to move within these small spaces so that we can get where we want to go and so that we can make change. I was trained in that tradition—you find a way, you find a pathway, and all of that presumes the legitimacy of the framework.

I’m not a nihilist. I actually always do have hope. And I think one of the reasons I feel so clear, in this moment, is that I have no desire to return to 2010. I have no desire to return to the ’80s. I’ve been a civil rights lawyer for 35 years. The ’80s were a nightmare.

What are we returning to? I don’t have a dream time calling out to me. People will say, “When Obama was president.” I mean, really? Because most of the videos you’ve seen of police killing unarmed black men, most of that was in the second Obama administration. That was Eric Garner. That was Ferguson. That was Walter Scott running in that park. So if you’ve been doing the work that I’ve been doing, you’re always invested in the future.

I have excitement and hope in this time because as this whole thing begins to unravel, we have the opportunity to create something new. This is where the 14th Amendment is so helpful for me, because it’s one of the biggest moments of creating something absolutely new in this country, so I use it as inspiration, not only its very words and provisions and guarantees, but also to remind me that we have the right and the obligation to refound our country when it goes astray. That’s what those young kids in college during the Civil Rights Movement did. They did a version of refounding. So I don’t want to suggest that I don’t feel hope for the future. I do feel quite hopeful. But I also feel that pretending that all we need to do is just make some incremental changes to get us back to 2010 interferes with our ability to do that reset. What has been laid bare is that 2010 ain’t it.

We have some serious structural problems. As a litigator, I don’t know how anyone can purport to pretend that they know what the rules are at the Supreme Court anymore. We have a Supreme Court that not only has the power to say what the law is, pursuant to Chief Justice John Marshall and Marbury v. Madison, but they’ve now decided that they have the power to say what the facts are. That has never been part of our system of adjudication and litigation. Assigning factual findings to the Supreme Court? No, that is for the trial courts, for district courts. But we are now seeing a majority on the Supreme Court that regularly swats away the findings of the district court. That is the power of the district court. They are closest to the conflict. They can evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. They’re seeing the exhibits, the documents, all of it. It’s playing out in real time. It’s not theoretical for them. And now we have a Supreme Court that months later will swat away a two-week trial and the findings of fact over 160 pages by a district court. That’s real. That is real and structural. And it should not be dependent on the personnel of the court.

Last week was a startling and arresting moment for me in terms of the Trump v. Slaughter arguments about Humphrey’s Executor. Put aside originalism, that’s gone, there’s not even a pretense of text and history. But the idea that, “Well, you know, since agencies don’t look like they did 100 years ago, I guess we don’t have to think about them the same way.” It is so strange to see serious people pretending to be doing serious work in this serious place, when all pretense of intellectual seriousness has fallen away. Instead you have feelingsball and “How does executive power make me feel today?” There is no commitment to the principles that were laid out and in which people like you and I as institutionalists took a lot of solace. Part of what is so challenging about this moment is that by the time most Americans get around to the point that they can say the sentence “Amy Coney Barrett’s not going to save us,” or “Brett Kavanaugh is not going to save us,” it’s all going to be too late. It seems we are so committed to the principle that they are originalists, that they are textualists, that they care about a precedent, and so committed to the proposition that the U.S. Supreme Court is going to save us in the end.

The irony of it is that the U.S. Supreme Court got this reputation and the confidence of the American public after Brown. And that’s why, as much as this court is hollowing out Brown, they’ll never overturn it because that is how they became—how they got the reputation, certainly among Black people, for many decades, of being the people who come to your rescue. The shift started to happen with the Burger court in the 1980s.

So many of those who have the greatest platforms are still speaking and behaving in a way that suggests that this is something easily solved, or this is just how it goes, or we can just do this for a couple of years. But if you are watching the videos of people being chased by masked figures who claim to be federal agents, but we don’t know, and who are kidnapping people and throwing them in vans and doing this to American citizens and holding them? The danger is just there. It  is apparent. The more we treat it as though this is just Trumpism, this is Trump 2.0—all the little things that we say to tamp down the alarm are really profoundly problematic.

Many of those who have the greatest microphones frankly don’t know very much about race or racism or the history of it in this country. They want to be experts, so they play to their expertise. These are also the people who have said, “We talk about race too much. We talk about identity too much. We’re scaring people off with that. Everything’s not race.” We’ve made it seem illegitimate to talk about racism. It’s almost like you’re being soft, you’re being anti-intellectual, you’re not doing the rigorous work of politics if you’re talking about race.

In fact, race is threaded through every institutional structure of this country. And we have someone who is exploiting it every day. It’s not that I’m talking about race, it’s that he just stood up the other day and said, We want the Danes, the Swedes, and the Norwegians. We don’t want people from shithole countries. We’re being told that it’s illegitimate to keep talking about race when we’re confronting a tsunami of a movement that uses racism as its stalking horse. It is the lure that brought so many people into this movement. It’s important to help people understand that that’s the bait they’re using. The bait that says, “Yeah, I’m not sure that those people are qualified,” right? Yeah, all of that stuff that just lives in this country, that’s being used as the bait for this smash-and-grab, for this power grab. And I don’t think we’re doing this country any favors by steering people away from that realization.

            <h2>United Nations agrees to persist with multi-stakeholder internet governance</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/wsis_20_plus_resolved/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday reached consensus on a review of the world’s internet governance arrangements and preserved the current multi-stakeholder model that means governments are just one of many voices that debate the future of the internet.

Wednesday’s session caps a process that started in 2003, when the UN convened the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), a forum for discussing the role of technology in society.

The first WSIS process saw participating nations pledge “to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented information society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge.” It also saw participating nations agree to the multi-stakeholder internet governance arrangements that persist to this day, and which sees organizations like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the Internet Society (ISOC), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) each play a role.

Under WSIS, governments, academics, civil society groups, and other stakeholders all have a voice on matters related to the digital world. WSIS also links internet governance to the UN’s other goals around human rights, equitable development, and sustainability.

WSIS also led to the creation of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), a body to discuss public policy issues pertaining to the internet. In recent years, the IGF was the prime mover behind the first wave of international discussion on laws that govern AI.

The UN revisited WSIS in 2015, and left it largely unchanged but pledged to look at it again in 2025.

That process ended on Wednesday with approval of the WSIS+20 resolution.

The big change in WSIS+20 saw the UN decide to make the IGF a permanent body, and to fund it properly.

ICANN welcomed that decision as a “significant element” of WSIS+20, and giving the IGF a permanent mandate “is critical for the IGF to continue serving as the world’s most globally representative platform for dialogue on digital governance.”

The Technical Community Coalition for Multistakeholderism (TCCM), a group that represents technology businesses and governance organizations, also welcomed the WSIS+20 resolution, especially the IGF elements and the re-affirmation of the existing multi-stakeholder model.

TCCM and ICANN campaigned against another United Nations initiative – Global Digital Compact – on grounds that it could sideline the technical community from discussions about the internet. The version of the Compact adopted in 2024 acknowledged that techies deserve a seat at the table. WSIS+20 does the same.

Khaled Koubaa, a Mozilla Fellow who has served as an ICANN director and a senior public policy exec at both Meta and Google, hailed WSIS+20 as giving the UN the tools it needs to consider governance of agentic AI.

“We need a constitutional layer for the agentic Internet that connects technical architecture, accountability, safety, and inclusion,” he wrote on LinkedIn. “Otherwise, the gap between capability and legitimacy will widen, and trust will be replaced by improvisation.”

“WSIS+20 gives us a stronger platform to do this work without reinventing the wheel. It protects the space where multistakeholder problem solving can happen, and it reminds us that closing divides, protecting rights, and maintaining an open and interoperable Internet are not side quests. They are the main storyline.” ®

            <h2>Micron says memory shortages are here for the foreseeable future</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/micron_q1_2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Memory-maker Micron Technology has predicted that RAM shortages are here to stay, meaning higher prices for servers probably are, too.

As The Register has previously reported, memory-makers are shifting production to the high-bandwidth memory needed for AI applications, which they can sell for fat profits. That move means they’ve reduced production of other forms of memory even as the AI boom also creates demand for servers. The result is higher memory prices, leading major server-makers to warn that the prices they charge will have to rise by up to 15 percent.

In its Q1 2026 earnings announcement on Wednesday, Micron suggested this is the new normal.

“Over the last few months, our customers&#39; AI data center build-out plans have driven a sharp increase in demand forecast for memory and storage,” CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told investors. “We believe that the aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future.”

That’s not necessarily bad news for Micron, which won $13.64 billion of revenue for the quarter, a 56 percent jump from Q1 2025’s $8.7 billion. Net income leapt from last year’s $2 billion to $5.2 billion. Earnings per share reached $4.78, well beyond the expected $3.94. The company forecast Q2 revenue will reach $18.7 billion, which, if achieved would represent 133 percent year-over-year growth.

No wonder the company’s share price popped eight percent in after-hours trading.

Micron execs reported good progress at new fabs it’s currently building, which will start making memory in 2026 and 2027. Mehrotra said the company’s efforts to create HBM4 memory are also going well, with yields improving faster than was the case when Micron started production of HBM3 and increased volume of production likely from Q2.

But even with its manufacturing facilities firing on all cylinders, Micron sees more demand it may struggle to meet. Mehrotra said the increasing use of AI to produce videos will increase buyers’ hunger for solid-state disks. So will the shift from AI training to inferencing. The CEO also expects that manufacturers of smartphones and PCs will want to include more memory, to ensure AI workloads perform well on those devices.

More memory will, of course, increase the price of those machines, too, and help Micron to the 67 or 68 percent gross margin it predicts for its next quarter. ®

            <h2>ServiceNow unworried by Salesforce firing shots across its bow</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/servicenow_salesforce_itsm_retort/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October, Salesforce debuted Agentforce IT in a direct challenge to ServiceNow’s ITSM product, and analyst firm Forrester’s vice president and principal analyst Charles Betz rated it the “most credible threat” ServiceNow has ever faced.

“We’re not talking about models. We’re not talking about things that are commoditized,” Heath Ramsey, the company’s group vice president of outbound project management for the AI platform, told The Register.

“People are talking about workflow. We feel like we do it better. I know we do it better. We become a platform for work in the enterprise and we also become the AI control tower for work in the enterprise,” he added.

Ramsey said generative AI has opened customers&#39; eyes to using automation as a part of their business transformation in a way that the 21-year-old ServiceNow hasn’t seen before. By focusing on processes across a customer’s entire business rather than one function, Ramsey said ServiceNow is best positioned to show customers how to get value from AI.

“ROI means a lot of things to a lot of different people, and I think a portfolio of cost savings, productivity gains, all those different kinds of things is ultimately what&#39;s going to land,” he said. “We can come with the quantification of ‘Here&#39;s the number of agents that you have. Here&#39;s the volume of work that&#39;s done.’ The individual organization can say: ‘Well, it used to cost us X amount of dollars to do this, and now the agent is doing that.’ We actually have that in AI Control Tower, where you can see the value that comes from the AI infrastructure that we are providing.”

ServiceNow has also expanded its products&#39; capabilities through acquisitions.

Just this year it bought Logik ai to beef up its CRM platform, data catalog company Data.World, and identity access tool vendor Veza. Another big buy saw ServiceNow splurge $2.85 billion for Moveworks, to incorporate that company’s AI assistants and agentic reasoning into its platform.

This week, Bloomberg reported that ServiceNow is in talks to buy cybersecurity company Armis for $7 billion. ServiceNow would not comment on those reports.

Amid all those deals, one fear is that ServiceNow’s walled-garden platform becomes overrun with products that diverge from its roots, Forrester vice president and principal analyst Charles Betz told The Register this week.

“ServiceNow, historically, has avoided buying a portfolio of independent products. They are not like Computer Associates or HP back in the day,” he told us. “ServiceNow has been extremely architecturally disciplined. The big question with both Armis and Veza is, are they going to maintain those legacy code bases and start risking going down the road of the old software portfolio vendors, or are they going to actually reimplement on the Now platform?”

Going back to the company’s first acquisition of the business analytics firm Mirror 42 in 2013, ServiceNow has traditionally incorporated acquired technology into its own environment, Ramsey said.

“So it wasn&#39;t like trying to take an existing technology and bolting it on and doing all different kinds of unnatural things in order to be able to get it to all work together,” he said.

“That kind of approach has allowed us to not only acquire companies, but we build that into the code and the ability and the capabilities of the platform to ensure that our customers are able to get access to it very, very seamlessly, and that it all works together.”

When it comes to incorporating acquisitions, Ramsey looks at ServiceNow’s platform as possessing three layers. At the bottom is a data layer, with a workflow layer in the middle and a user experience layer riding on top,

Ramsey described Moveworks as “kind of an experience layer thing.”

“So we&#39;re looking at ‘How are we going to integrate these technologies to make the best experience layer possible?’” he said. “There&#39;s other acquisitions, like Veza, which is identity security, and that&#39;s going to be woven into the platform across these different layers, in terms of how we do our security and data and everything else.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Brussels-based electric bike company has officially closed its deal to be acquired by ReBirth Group Holding, which also owns cycling brands Peugeot, Gitane, and Solex. The transaction includes new, undisclosed funding from ReBirth as well as €15 million ($17.6 million) from existing shareholders. The funding will be used to restart production and deal with a backlog of spare parts, the companies say.

Rebirth is the parent of Re-cycles, the French manufacturer of traditional bicycles that took over responsibility for Cowboy’s e-bike assembly operations earlier this year. Cowboy was plagued by issues in 2025, including delayed deliveries and repairs, as well as a costly frame recall (caused by a previous manufacturing partner) that brought the company within weeks of bankruptcy.

Cowboy, and its in-house design, engineering, and software teams, will continue to operate independently from Brussels. But Cowboy founder and CEO Adrien Roose has left the company. “My hope is that this new partnership will make Cowboy more reliable for riders in the long term. To keep them on the road and supported in the best way possible,” said Roose in a press release.

With the deal done, priorities include the production of 1,500 new bikes in January to help clear the backlog of orders. Customers waiting on their e-bike will receive updated delivery timelines “in the coming weeks.” Lead times should be considerably reduced by Spring 2026.

The deal should also give Cowboy a greater presence in France by leveraging ReBirth’s 95 Oxygen and 10 Ovelo bike stores, in addition to its network of 500 independent bike dealers.

Longer term, we can expect to see Cowboy’s e-bike smarts come to ReBirth’s other brands. “Cowboy’s digital expertise and platform capabilities will also support innovation across other ReBirth brands, applying the same data-driven systems and tools that have defined Cowboy’s approach to connected mobility,” reads the press release.

“I would like to thank Cowboy’s founders for their vision, ambition, and the remarkable company they have built in a difficult market,” said Grégory Trébaol, CEO of ReBirth Group Holding. “This transaction opens a new chapter for Cowboy.”

Cowboy — like all bicycle makers — has suffered from the covid-era boom-bust cycle that wreaked havoc on the industry. A costly frame recall announced in May was nearly disastrous. Cowboy had to take on short-term financing in August just to keep the lights on. Fortunately, it managed to avoid bankruptcy unlike VanMoof and, just yesterday, Rad Power Bikes. Others boutique e-bike makers like Ampler and GoCycle managed to find buyers before the clock ran out.

With Cowboy acquired, the glory days of independent, direct-to-consumer, e-bike startups that injected excitement and innovation into the bicycle industry are now well and truly over.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI’s one step closer to making ChatGPT an ‘everything app’ that connects directly to Apple Music and DoorDash.

OpenAI’s one step closer to making ChatGPT an ‘everything app’ that connects directly to Apple Music and DoorDash.

On Wednesday evening, OpenAI launched an App Directory to browse all the tools currently available and opened its SDK for developers to build new interactive experiences that operate within the bot’s UI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said last month that “We are planning to build the obvious features that you would expect for a robust platform over time,” and opening an app store is certainly a huge step in that direction.

Another change is that OpenAI has renamed the “connectors” that helped users pull data from other services (like Google Drive or Dropbox) into ChatGPT, and is now calling those apps too. As a support page explains, chat connectors are now “apps with file search,” deep research connectors are now “apps with deep research,” and synced connectors are now “apps with sync.” It also mentions that apps may use information from Memory, if it’s enabled, and for Free, Plus, Go, and Pro ChatGPT users, OpenAI may use information to train its models if the user has “improve the model for everyone” enabled.

For something more interactive, however, you’d look for ChatGPT apps like the ones that launched in October for Spotify, Zillow, and other services, some of which are now available in more markets, like Spotify in ChatGPT, which now works “in the UK, Switzerland, and throughout the EU.” New additions include an Apple Music app, which can help all users find music or make playlists and manage subscribers’ music libraries from within the chatbot, and DoorDash, which can turn “recipe inspiration, meal planning, and weekly staples into an actionable shopping cart” in the same window.

The answer to how all this helps OpenAI turn its AI business into something profitable is one thing it hasn’t explained yet. The announcement says only “We’re exploring additional monetization options over time, including digital goods, and will share more as we learn from how developers and users build and engage.”

Sony and Tencent have reached a ‘confidential settlement,’ and Light of Motiram is no longer listed on Steam or the Epic Games Store.

In July, Sony sued Tencent to prevent the release of Light of Motiram, a game Sony alleged was a “slavish clone” of its popular Horizon series. But the legal battle is already over; the two companies have reached a “confidential settlement” and the case has been dismissed with prejudice, according to a court document filed on Wednesday.

Light of Motiram is also no longer listed on Steam and the Epic Games Store despite the game’s website showing links to listings on both stores as of this writing. A user on the game’s official subreddit also noticed the removal, pointing to a SteamDB link that says “this app has been retired and is no longer available on the Steam store.”

Light of Motiram was announced last year, and the aesthetics of its reveal trailer show a striking resemblance to Horizon the series, featuring lush landscapes, futuristic technology, and monstrous animal-like robots. In its lawsuit, Sony also alleged that Tencent used its “rip-off” of Horizon protagonist Aloy as the “centerpiece” of its marketing and promotional strategy.

“Tencent’s unlawful copying of the protected audiovisual elements of the Horizon games, as well as its deliberate adoption of a confusingly similar character mark, constitutes both copyright and trademark infringement that should be enjoined immediately to prevent irreparable harm to [Sony Interactive Entertainment] and the consuming public,” Sony said at the time.

“SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter,” Sean Durkin, head of communications for Tencent Americas, tells The Verge. “SIE and Tencent look forward to working together in the future.” Sony didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

            <h2>This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/17/1129259/omar-yaghi-chemist-nobel-prize-crystals-water-air/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Omar Yaghi was a quiet child, diligent, unlikely to roughhouse with his nine siblings. So when he was old enough, his parents tasked him with one of the family’s most vital chores: fetching water. Like most homes in his Palestinian neighborhood in Amman, Jordan, the Yaghis’ had no electricity or running water. At least once every two weeks, the city switched on local taps for a few hours so residents could fill their tanks. Young Omar helped top up the family supply. Decades later, he says he can’t remember once showing up late. The fear of leaving his parents, seven brothers, and two sisters parched kept him punctual.

Yaghi proved so dependable that his father put him in charge of monitoring how much the cattle destined for the family butcher shop ate and drank. The best-­quality cuts came from well-fed, hydrated animals—a challenge given that they were raised in arid desert.

Specially designed materials called metal-organic frameworks can pull water from the air like a sponge—and then give it back.

But at 10 years old, Yaghi learned of a different occupation. Hoping to avoid a rambunctious crowd at recess, he found the library doors in his school unbolted and sneaked in. Thumbing through a chemistry textbook, he saw an image he didn’t understand: little balls connected by sticks in fascinating shapes. Molecules. The building blocks of everything.

“I didn’t know what they were, but it captivated my attention,” Yaghi says. “I kept trying to figure out what they might be.”

That’s how he discovered chemistry—or maybe how chemistry discovered him. After coming to the United States and, eventually, a postdoctoral program at Harvard University, Yaghi devoted his career to finding ways to make entirely new and fascinating shapes for those little sticks and balls. In October 2025, he was one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.

When he first started working with MOFs, Yaghi thought they might be able to absorb climate-damaging carbon dioxide—or maybe hold hydrogen molecules, solving the thorny problem of storing that climate-friendly but hard-to-contain fuel. But then, in 2014, Yaghi’s team of researchers at UC Berkeley had an epiphany. The tiny pores in MOFs could be designed so the material would pull water molecules from the air around them, like a sponge—and then, with just a little heat, give back that water as if squeezed dry. Just one gram of a water-absorbing MOF has an internal surface area of roughly 7,000 square meters.

Yaghi wasn’t the first to try to pull potable water from the atmosphere. But his method could do it at lower levels of humidity than rivals—potentially shaking up a tiny, nascent industry that could be critical to humanity in the thirsty decades to come. Now the company he founded, called Atoco, is racing to demonstrate a pair of machines that Yaghi believes could produce clean, fresh, drinkable water virtually anywhere on Earth, without even hooking up to an energy supply.

That’s the goal Yaghi has been working toward for more than a decade now, with the rigid determination that he learned while doing chores in his father’s butcher shop.

“It was in that shop where I learned how to perfect things, how to have a work ethic,” he says. “I learned that a job is not done until it is well done. Don’t start a job unless you can finish it.”

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost. Desalination facilities either heat water to distill out the drinkable stuff or filter it with membranes the salt doesn’t pass through; both methods require a lot of energy and leave behind concentrated brine. Typically desal pumps send that brine back into the ocean, with devastating ecological effects.

I was talking to Atoco executives about carbon dioxide capture earlier this year when they mentioned the possibility of harvesting water from the atmosphere. Of course my mind immediately jumped to Star Wars, and Luke Skywalker working on his family’s moisture farm, using “vaporators” to pull water from the atmosphere of the arid planet Tatooine. (Other sci-fi fans’ minds might go to Dune, and the water-gathering technology of the Fremen.) Could this possibly be real?

It turns out people have been doing it for millennia. Archaeological evidence of water harvesting from fog dates back as far as 5000 BCE. The ancient Greeks harvested dew, and 500 years ago so did the Inca, using mesh nets and buckets under trees.

Today, harvesting water from the air is a business already worth billions of dollars, say industry analysts—and it’s on track to be worth billions more in the next five years. In part that’s because typical sources of fresh water are in crisis. Less snowfall in mountains during hotter winters means less meltwater in the spring, which means less water downstream. Droughts regularly break records. Rising seas seep into underground aquifers, already drained by farming and sprawling cities. Aging septic tanks leach bacteria into water, and cancer-causing “forever chemicals” are creating what the US Government Accountability Office last year said “may be the biggest water problem since lead.” That doesn’t even get to the emerging catastrophe from microplastics.

So lots of places are turning to atmospheric water harvesting. Watergen, an Israel-based company working on the tech, initially planned on deploying in the arid, poorer parts of the world. Instead, buyers in Europe and the United States have approached the company as a way to ensure a clean supply of water. And one of Watergen’s biggest markets is the wealthy United Arab Emirates. “When you say ‘water crisis,’ it’s not just the lack of water—it’s access to good-quality water,” says Anna Chernyavsky, Watergen’s vice president of marketing.

In other words, the technology “has evolved from lab prototypes to robust, field-deployable systems,” says Guihua Yu, a mechanical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. “There is still room to improve productivity and energy efficiency in the whole-system level, but so much progress has been steady and encouraging.”

MOFs are just the latest approach to the idea. The first generation of commercial tech depended on compressors and refrigerant chemicals—large-scale versions of the machine that keeps food cold and fresh in your kitchen. Both use electricity and a clot of pipes and exchangers to make cold by phase-shifting a chemical from gas to liquid and back; refrigerators try to limit condensation, and water generators basically try to enhance it.

That’s how Watergen’s tech works: using a compressor and a heat exchanger to wring water from air at humidity levels as low as 20%—Death Valley in the spring. “We’re talking about deserts,” Chernyavsky says. “Below 20%, you get nosebleeds.”

That still might not be good enough. “Refrigeration works pretty well when you are above a certain relative humidity,” says Sameer Rao, a mechanical engineer at the University of Utah who researches atmospheric water harvesting. “As the environment dries out, you go to lower relative humidities, and it becomes harder and harder. In some cases, it’s impossible for refrigeration-based systems to really work.”

So a second wave of technology has found a market. Companies like Source Global use desiccants—substances that absorb moisture from the air, like the silica packets found in vitamin bottles—to pull in moisture and then release it when heated. In theory, the benefit of desiccant-­based tech is that it could absorb water at lower humidity levels, and it uses less energy on the front end since it isn’t running a condenser system. Source Global claims its off-grid, solar-powered system is deployed in dozens of countries.

But both technologies still require a lot of energy, either to run the heat exchangers or to generate sufficient heat to release water from the desiccants. MOFs, Yaghi hopes, do not. Now Atoco is trying to prove it. Instead of using heat exchangers to bring the air temperature to dew point or desiccants to attract water from the atmosphere, a system can rely on specially designed MOFs to attract water molecules. Atoco’s prototype version uses an MOF that looks like baby powder, stuck to a surface like glass. The pores in the MOF naturally draw in water molecules but remain open, making it theoretically easy to discharge the water with no more heat than what comes from direct sunlight. Atoco’s industrial-scale design uses electricity to speed up the process, but the company is working on a second design that can operate completely off grid, without any energy input.

Yaghi’s Atoco isn’t the only contender seeking to use MOFs for water harvesting. A competitor, AirJoule, has introduced MOF-based atmospheric water generators in Texas and the UAE and is working with researchers at Arizona State University, planning to deploy more units in the coming months. The company started out trying to build more efficient air-­conditioning for electric buses operating on hot, humid city streets. But then founder Matt Jore heard about US government efforts to harvest water from air—and pivoted. The startup’s stock price has been a bit of a roller-­coaster, but Jore says the sheer size of the market should keep him in business. Take Maricopa County, encompassing Phoenix and its environs—it uses 1.2 billion gallons of water from its shrinking aquifer every day, and another 874 million gallons from surface sources like rivers.

“So, a couple of billion gallons a day, right?” Jore tells me. “You know how much influx is in the atmosphere every day? Twenty-five billion gallons.”

“Just the greater Phoenix area gets influx of about 25 billion gallons of water in the air,” he says. “If you can tap into it, that’s your source. And it’s not going away. It’s all around the world. We view the atmosphere as the world’s free pipeline.”

Besides AirJoule’s head start on Atoco, the companies also differ on where they get their MOFs. AirJoule’s system relies on an off-the-shelf version the company buys from the chemical giant BASF; Atoco aims to use Yaghi’s skill with designing the novel material to create bespoke MOFs for different applications and locations.

“Given the fact that we have the inventor of the whole class of materials, and we leverage the stuff that comes out of his lab at Berkeley—everything else equal, we have a good starting point to engineer maybe the best materials in the world,” says Magnus Bach, Atoco’s VP of business development.

Yaghi envisions a two-pronged product line. Industrial-scale water generators that run on electricity would be capable of producing thousands of liters per day on one end, while units that run on passive systems could operate in remote locations without power, just harnessing energy from the sun and ambient temperatures. In theory, these units could someday replace desalination and even entire municipal water supplies. The next round of field tests is scheduled for early 2026, in the Mojave Desert—one of the hottest, driest places on Earth.

“That’s my dream,” Yaghi says. “To give people water independence, so they’re not reliant on another party for their lives.”

Both Yaghi and Watergen’s Chernyavsky say they’re looking at more decentralized versions that could operate outside municipal utility systems. Home appliances, similar to rooftop solar panels and batteries, could allow households to generate their own water off grid.

That could be tricky, though, without economies of scale to bring down prices. “You have to produce, you have to cool, you have to filter—all in one place,” Chernyavsky says. “So to make it small is very, very challenging.”

Difficult as that may be, Yaghi’s childhood gave him a particular appreciation for the freedom to go off grid, to liberate the basic necessity of water from the whims of systems that dictate when and how people can access it.

“That’s really my dream,” he says. “To give people independence, water independence, so that they’re not reliant on another party for their livelihood or lives.”

Toward the end of one of our conversations, I asked Yaghi what he would tell the younger version of himself if he could. “Jordan is one of the worst countries in terms of the impact of water stress,” he said. “I would say, ‘Continue to be diligent and observant. It doesn’t really matter what you’re pursuing, as long as you’re passionate.’”

I pressed him for something more specific: “What do you think he’d say when you described this technology to him?”

Yaghi smiled: “I think young Omar would think you’re putting him on, that this is all fictitious and you’re trying to take something from him.” This reality, in other words, would be beyond young Omar’s wildest dreams.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
