            <h2>Dozens of CDC vaccination databases have been frozen under RFK Jr.</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/rfk-jr-lets-cdc-vaccination-data-rot-dozens-of-databases-frozen/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly half of the databases that public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were updating on a monthly basis have been frozen without notice or explanation, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

The study—led by Janet Freilich, a law expert at Boston University, and Jeremy Jacobs, a medical professor at Vanderbilt University—examined the status of all CDC databases, finding a total of 82 that had, as of early 2025, been receiving updates at least monthly. But, of those 82, only 44 were still being regularly updated as of October 2025, with 38 (46 percent) having their updates paused without public notice or explanation.

Examining the databases’ content, it appeared that vaccination data was most affected by the stealth data freezes. Of the 38 outdated databases, 33 (87 percent) included data related to vaccination. In contrast, none of the 44 still-updated databases relate to vaccination. Other frozen databases included data on infectious disease burden, such as data on hospitalizations from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

The most common vaccination types included in the out-of-date data were vaccinations against influenza, COVID-19, and RSV. Two frozen databases included data on all three vaccines. When the researchers checked in on the databases again in December, only one had been updated, leaving 37 still entirely out of date.

The finding stood out given that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a fervent anti-vaccine advocate who has worked for decades to undermine trust in and use of life-saving vaccines.

“Given the vaccine skepticism of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, it is concerning that nearly 90 percent of the paused databases related to vaccination surveillance, with additional gaps in respiratory disease monitoring,” Freilich, Jacobs, and their co-authors write in the study.

Overall, a lack of updated data can make it more difficult, if not impossible, for federal and state health officials to identify and rapidly respond to emerging outbreaks. It can also prevent the identification of communities or demographics that could benefit most from targeted vaccination outreach.

In an accompanying editorial, Jeanne Marrazzo, CEO of the Infectious Disease Society of America and former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stated the concern in starker terms, writing: “The evidence is damning: The administration’s anti-vaccine stance has interrupted the reliable flow of the data we need to keep Americans safe from preventable infections. The consequences will be dire.”

The study authors note that the unexplained pauses could be direct targeting of vaccine-related data collection by the administration—or they could be an indirect consequence of the tumult Kennedy and the Trump administration have inflicted on the CDC, including brutal budget and staff cuts. But Marrazzo argues that the exact mechanism doesn’t matter.

“Either causative pathway demonstrates a profound disregard for human life, scientific progress, and the dedication of the public health workforce that has provided a bulwark against the advance of emerging, and reemerging, infectious diseases,” she writes.

Marrazzo emphasizes that the lack of current data not only hampers outbreak response efforts but also helps the health secretary realize his vision for the CDC.

Kennedy, “who has stated baldly that the CDC failed to protect Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now enacting a self-fulfilling prophecy. The CDC as it currently exists is no longer the stalwart, reliable source of public health data that for decades has set the global bar for rigorous public health practice.”

Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, sent Ars Technica a statement saying: “Changes to individual dashboards or update schedules reflect routine data quality and system management decisions, not political direction. Under this administration, public health data reporting is driven by scientific integrity, transparency, and accuracy.”</div>

            <h2>TikTok users “absolutely justified” for fearing MAGA makeover, experts say</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-claimed-bugs-blocked-anti-ice-videos-epstein-mentions-experts-call-bs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok wants users to believe that errors blocking uploads of anti-ICE videos or direct messages mentioning Jeffrey Epstein are due to technical errors—not the platform seemingly shifting to censor content critical of Donald Trump after he hand-picked the US owners who took over the app last week.

However, experts say that TikTok users’ censorship fears are justified, whether the bugs are to blame or not.

Ioana Literat, an associate professor of technology, media, and learning at Teachers College, Columbia University, has studied TikTok’s politics since the app first shot to popularity in the US in 2018. She told Ars that “users’ fears are absolutely justified” and explained why the “bugs” explanation is “insufficient.”

“Even if these are technical glitches, the pattern of what’s being suppressed reveals something significant,” Literat told Ars. “When your ‘bug’ consistently affects anti-Trump content, Epstein references, and anti-ICE videos, you’re looking at either spectacular coincidence or systems that have been designed—whether intentionally or through embedded biases—to flag and suppress specific political content.”

TikTok users are savvy, Literat noted, and what’s being cast as “paranoia” about the app’s bugs actually stems from their “digital literacy,” she suggested.

“They’ve watched Instagram suppress Palestine content, they’ve seen Twitter’s transformation under Musk, they’ve experienced shadow-banning and algorithmic suppression, including on TikTok prior to this,” Literat said. “So, their pattern recognition isn’t paranoia, but rather digital literacy.”

Casey Fiesler, an associate professor of technology ethics and internet law at the University of Colorado, Boulder, agreed that TikTok’s “bugs” explanation wasn’t enough to address users’ fears. She told CNN that TikTok risks losing users’ trust the longer that errors damage the perception of the app.

“Even if this isn’t purposeful censorship, does it matter? In terms of perception and trust, maybe,” Fiesler told CNN.

Some users are already choosing to leave TikTok. A quick glance at the TikTok subreddit shows many users grieving while vowing to delete the app, Literat pointed out, though some are reportedly struggling to delete accounts due to technical issues. Even with some users blocked from abandoning their accounts, however, “the daily average of TikTok uninstalls are up nearly 150 percent in the last five days compared to the last three months,” data analysis firm Sensor Tower told CNN.

A TikTok USDS spokesperson told Ars that US owners have not yet made any changes to the algorithm or content moderation policies. So far, the only changes have been to the US app’s terms of use and privacy policy, which impacted what location data is collected, how ads are targeted, and how AI interactions are monitored.

For TikTok, the top priority appears to be fixing the bugs, which were attributed to a power outage at a US data center. A TikTok USDS spokesperson told NPR that TikTok is also investigating the issue where some users can’t talk about Epstein in DMs.

“We don’t have rules against sharing the name ‘Epstein’ in direct messages and are investigating why some users are experiencing issues,” TikTok’s spokesperson said.

TikTok’s response came after California governor Gavin Newsom declared on X that “it’s time to investigate” TikTok.

“I am launching a review into whether TikTok is violating state law by censoring Trump-critical content,” Newsom said. His post quote-tweeted an X user who shared a screenshot of the error message TikTok displayed when some users referenced Epstein and joked, “so the agreement for TikTok to sell its US business to GOP-backed investors was finalized a few days ago,” and “now you can’t mention Epstein lmao.”

As of Tuesday afternoon, the results of TikTok’s investigation into the “Epstein” issue were not publicly available, but TikTok may post an update here as technical issues are resolved.

“We’ve made significant progress in recovering our US infrastructure with our US data center partner,” TikTok USDS’s latest statement said. “However, the US user experience may still have some technical issues, including when posting new content. We’re committed to bringing TikTok back to its full capacity as soon as possible. We’ll continue to provide updates.”

For TikTok’s new owners, the tech issues risk confirming fears that Trump wasn’t joking when he said he’d like to see TikTok be tweaked to be “100 percent MAGA.”

Because of this bumpy transition, it seems likely that TikTok will continue to be heavily scrutinized once the USDS joint venture officially starts retraining the app on US data. As the algorithm undergoes tweaks, frequent TikTok users will likely be the first to pick up on subtle changes, especially if content unaligned with their political views suddenly starts appearing in their feeds when it never did before, Literat suggested.

Literat has researched both left- and right-leaning TikTok content. She told Ars that although left-leaning young users have for years loudly used the app to promote progressive views on topics like racial justice, gun reforms, or climate change, TikTok has never leaned one way or the other on the political spectrum.

Consider Christian or tradwife TikTok, Literat suggested, which grew huge platforms on TikTok alongside leftist bubbles advocating for LGBTQ+ rights or Palestine solidarity.

“Political life on TikTok is organized into overlapping sub-communities, each with its own norms, humor, and tolerance for disagreement,” Literat said, adding that “the algorithm creates bubbles, so people experience very different TikToks.”

Literat told Ars that she wasn’t surprised when Trump suggested that TikTok would be better if it were more right-wing. But what concerned her most was the implication that Trump viewed TikTok “as a potential propaganda apparatus” and “a tool for political capture rather than a space for authentic expression and connection.”

“The historical irony is thick: we went from ‘TikTok is dangerous because it’s controlled by the Chinese government and might manipulate American users’ to ‘TikTok should be controlled by American interests and explicitly aligned with a particular political agenda,’” Literat said. “The concern was never really about foreign influence or manipulation per se—it was about who gets to do the influencing.”

David Greene, senior counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fought the TikTok ban law, told Ars that users are justified in feeling concerned. However, technical errors or content moderation mistakes are nearly always the most likely explanations for issues, and there’s no way to know “what’s actually happening.” He noted that lawmakers have shaped how some TikTok users view the app after insisting that they accept that China was influencing the algorithm without providing evidence.

“For years, TikTok users were being told that they just needed to follow these assumptions the government was making about the dangers of TikTok,” Greene said. And “now they’re doing the same thing, making these assumptions that it’s now maybe some content policy is being done either to please the Trump administration or being controlled by it. We conditioned TikTok users to basically to not have trust in the way decisions were made with the app.”

TikTok USDS likely wants to distance itself from Trump’s comments about making the app more MAGA. But new owners have deep ties with Trump, including Larry Ellison, the chief technology officer of Oracle, whom some critics suggest has benefited more than anyone else from Trump’s presidency. Greene noted that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a key investor in Silver Lake. Both firms now have a 15 percent stake in the TikTok USDS joint venture, as well as MGX, which also seems to have Trump ties. CNBC reported MGX used the Trump family cryptocurrency, World Liberty Financial, to invest $2 billion in Binance shortly before Trump pardoned Binance’s CEO from money laundering charges, which some viewed as a possible quid pro quo.

Greene said that EFF warned during the Supreme Court fight over the TikTok divest-or-ban law that “all you were doing was substituting concerns for Chinese propaganda, for concerns for US propaganda. That it was highly likely that if you force a sale and the sale is up to the approval of the president, it’s going to be sold to President’s lackeys.”

“I don’t see how it’d be good for users or for democracy, for TikTok to have an editorial policy that would make Trump happy,” Greene said.

If suddenly, the app were tweaked to push more MAGA content into more feeds, young users who are critical of Trump wouldn’t all be brainwashed, Literat said. They would adapt, perhaps eventually finding other apps for activism.

However, TikTok may be hard to leave behind at a time when other popular apps seem to carry their own threats of political suppression, she suggested. Beyond the video-editing features that made TikTok a behemoth of social media, perhaps the biggest sticking point keeping users glued to TikTok is “fundamentally social,” Literat said.

“TikTok is where their communities are, where they’ve built audiences, where the conversations they care about are happening,” Literat said.

Rather than a mass exodus, Literat expects that TikTok’s fate could be “gradual erosion” or “death by a thousand cuts,” as users “likely develop workarounds, shift to other platforms for political content while keeping TikTok for entertainment, or create coded languages and aesthetic strategies to evade detection.”

CNN reported that one TikTok user already found that she could finally post an anti-ICE video after claiming to be a “fashion influencer” and speaking in code throughout the video, which criticized ICE for detaining a 5-year-old named Liam Conejo Ramos.

“Fashion influencing is in my blood,” she said in the video, which featured “a photo of Liam behind her,” CNN reported. “And even a company with bad customer service won’t keep me from doing my fashion review.”

Short-term, Literat thinks that longtime TikTok users experiencing inconsistent moderation will continue testing boundaries, documenting issues, and critiquing the app. That discussion will perhaps chill more speech on the platform, possibly even affecting the overall content mix appearing in feeds.

Long-term, however, TikTok’s changes under US owners “could fundamentally reshape TikTok’s role in political discourse.”

“I wouldn’t be surprised, unfortunately, if it suffers the fate of Twitter/X,” Literat said.

Literat told Ars that her TikTok research was initially sparked by a desire to monitor the “kind of authentic political expression the platform once enabled.” She worries that because user trust is now “damaged,” TikTok will never be the same.

“The tragedy is that TikTok genuinely was a space where young people—especially those from marginalized communities—could shape political conversations in ways that felt authentic and powerful,” Literat said. “I’m sad to say, I think that’s been irretrievably broken.”</div>

            <h2>There's a rash of scam spam coming from a real Microsoft address</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/theres-a-rash-of-scam-spam-coming-from-a-real-microsoft-address/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are reports that a legitimate Microsoft email address—which Microsoft explicitly says customers should add to their allow list—is delivering scam spam.

The emails originate from no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com, an address tied to Power BI. The Microsoft platform provides analytics and business intelligence from various sources that can be integrated into a single dashboard. Microsoft documentation says that the address is used to send subscription emails to mail-enabled security groups. To prevent spam filters from blocking the address, the company advises users to add it to allow lists.

According to an Ars reader, the address on Tuesday sent her an email claiming (falsely) that a $399 charge had been made to her. It provided a phone number to call to dispute the transaction. A man who answered a call asking to cancel the sale directed me to download and install a remote access application, presumably so he could then take control of my Mac or Windows machine (Linux wasn’t allowed). The email, captured in the two screenshots below, looked like this:

Online searches returned a dozen or so accounts of other people reporting receiving the same email. Some of the spam was reported on Microsoft’s own website.

Sarah Sabotka, a threat researcher at security firm Proofpoint, said the scammers are abusing a Power Bi function that allows external email addresses to be added as subscribers for the Power Bi reports. The mention of the subscription is buried at the very bottom of the message, where it’s easy to miss. The researcher explained:

The abuse of a legitimate service, like Microsoft Power BI, adds an additional layer of credibility to the social engineering. The actual scam occurs during the voice interaction, which helps attackers evade traditional email-based detection and security controls. Further, attackers gain two advantages at once: the email is sent from a trusted Microsoft domain, and the lack of malicious links or attachments reduces the likelihood of automated filtering. While the emails originate from Microsoft infrastructure, the content and intent are fully controlled by the attacker via misuse of a legitimate feature.

Scammers have abused Microsoft Power Bi functionality in the past. Security firm Cofense reported in September that it found a spam campaign that transmitted phishing links that were hosted on the platform. Companies besides Microsoft that have experienced similar abuse include Google, according to Check Point. The security firm found a run of nearly 9,400 emails that were sent through the Google Cloud Application Integration platform.

A key detail that’s currently unknown is: Do users have to explicitly opt in to receiving emails from email addresses like no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com, and can scammers send them to any external address automatically? A Microsoft representative said he’s looking into reports and didn’t have information immediately available. For more experienced Internet users, scams like this one are easy to spot. For others, scams that originate from a known sender with a clean reputation are more believable.</div>

            <h2>Supreme Court to decide how 1988 videotape privacy law applies to online video</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Supreme Court is taking up a case on whether Paramount violated the 1988 Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) by disclosing a user’s viewing history to Facebook. The case, Michael Salazar v. Paramount Global, hinges on the law’s definition of the word “consumer.”

Salazar filed a class action against Paramount in 2022, alleging that it “violated the VPPA by disclosing his personally identifiable information to Facebook without consent,” Salazar’s petition to the Supreme Court said. Salazar had signed up for an online newsletter through 247Sports.com, a site owned by Paramount, and had to provide his email address in the process. Salazar then used 247Sports.com to view videos while logged in to his Facebook account.

“As a result, Paramount disclosed his personally identifiable information—including his Facebook ID and which videos he watched—to Facebook,” the petition said. “The disclosures occurred automatically because of the Facebook Pixel Paramount installed on its website. Facebook and Paramount then used this information to create and display targeted advertising, which increased their revenues.”

The 1988 law defines consumer as “any renter, purchaser, or subscriber of goods or services from a video tape service provider.” The phrase “video tape service provider” is defined to include providers of “prerecorded video cassette tapes or similar audio visual materials,” and thus arguably applies to more than just sellers of tapes.

The legal question for the Supreme Court “is whether the phrase ‘goods or services from a video tape service provider,’ as used in the VPPA’s definition of ‘consumer,’ refers to all of a video tape service provider’s goods or services or only to its audiovisual goods or services,” Salazar’s petition said. The Supreme Court granted his petition to hear the case in a list of orders released yesterday.

The Facebook Pixel at the center of the lawsuit is now called the Meta Pixel. The Pixel is a piece of JavaScript code that can be added to a website to track visitors’ activity “and optimize your advertising performance,” as Meta describes it.

Salazar lost his case at a federal court in Nashville, Tennessee, and then lost an appeal at the US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. (247Sports has its corporate address in Tennessee.) A three-judge panel of appeals court judges ruled 2–1 to uphold the district court ruling. The appeals court majority said:

The Video Privacy Protection Act—as the name suggests—arose out of a desire to protect personal privacy in the records of the rental, purchase, or delivery of “audio visual materials.” Spurred by the publication of Judge Robert Bork’s video rental history on the eve of his confirmation hearings, Congress imposed stiff penalties on any “video tape service provider” who discloses personal information that identifies one of their “consumers” as having requested specific “audio visual materials.”

This case is about what “goods or services” a person must rent, purchase, or subscribe to in order to qualify as a “consumer” under the Act. Is “goods or services” limited to audio-visual content—or does it extend to any and all products or services that a store could provide? Michael Salazar claims that his subscription to a 247Sports e-newsletter qualifies him as a “consumer.” But since he did not subscribe to “audio visual materials,” the district court held that he was not a “consumer” and dismissed the complaint. We agree and so AFFIRM.

Salazar’s petition to the Supreme Court alleged that the 6th Circuit ruling “imposes a limitation that appears nowhere in the relevant statutory text.” The 6th Circuit analysis “flout[s] the ordinary meaning of ‘goods or services,’” and “ignores that the VPPA broadly prohibits a video tape service provider—like Paramount here—from knowingly disclosing ‘personally identifiable information concerning any consumer of such provider,’” he told the Supreme Court.

The DC Circuit ruled the same way as the 6th Circuit in another case last year, but other appeals courts have ruled differently. The 7th Circuit held last year that “any purchase or subscription from a ‘video tape service provider’ satisfies the definition of ‘consumer,’ even if the thing purchased is clothing or the thing subscribed to is a newsletter.”

In Salazar v. National Basketball Association, which also involves Michael Salazar, the 2nd Circuit ruled in 2024 that Salazar was a consumer under the VPPA because the law’s “text, structure, and purpose compel the conclusion that that phrase is not limited to audiovisual ‘goods or services,’ and the NBA’s online newsletter falls within the plain meaning of that phrase.” The NBA petitioned the Supreme Court for review in hopes of overturning the 2nd Circuit ruling, but the petition to hear the case was denied in December.

Despite the NBA case being rejected by the high court, a circuit split can make a case ripe for Supreme Court review. “Put simply, the circuit courts have divided 2–2 over how to interpret the statutory phrase ‘goods or services from a video tape service provider,’” Salazar told the court. “As a result, there is a 2–2 circuit split concerning what it takes to become a ‘consumer’ under the VPPA.”

While Salazar sued both Paramount and the NBA, he said the Paramount case “is a superior vehicle for resolving this exceptionally important question.” The case against the NBA is still under appeal on a different legal issue and “has had multiple amended pleadings since the lower courts decided the question, meaning the Court could not answer the question based on the now-operative allegations,” his petition said. By contrast, the Paramount case has a final judgment, no ongoing proceedings, and “can be reviewed on the same record the lower courts considered.”

Paramount urged the court to decline Salazar’s petition. Despite the circuit split on the “consumer” question, Paramount said that Salazar’s claims would fail in the 2nd and 7th circuits for different reasons. Paramount argued that “computer code shared in targeted advertising does not qualify as ‘personally identifiable information,’” and that “247Sports is not a ‘video tape service provider’ in the first place.”

“247Sports does not rent, sell, or offer subscriptions to video tapes. Nor does it stream movies or shows,” Paramount said. “Rather, it is a sports news website with articles, photos, and video clips—and all of the content at issue in this case is available for free to anybody on the Internet. That is a completely different business from renting video cassette tapes. The VPPA does not address it.”

Paramount further argued that Salazar’s case isn’t a good vehicle to consider the “consumer” definition because his “complaint fails for multiple additional reasons that could complicate further review.”

Paramount wasn’t able to convince the Supreme Court that the case isn’t worth taking up, however. SCOTUSblog says that “the case will likely be scheduled for oral argument in the court’s 2026-27 term,” which begins in October 2026.</div>

            <h2>A WB-57 pilot just made a heroic landing in Houston after its landing gear failed</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/one-of-nasas-three-wb-57-aircraft-just-did-a-belly-landing-in-houston/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of NASA’s three large WB-57 aircraft made an emergency landing at Ellington Field on Tuesday morning in southeastern Houston.

Video captured by KHOU 11 television showed the aircraft touching down on the runway without its landing gear extended. The pilot then maintains control of the vehicle as it slides down the runway, slowing the aircraft through friction. The crew was not harmed, NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens said.

“Today, a mechanical issue with one of NASA’s WB-57s resulted in a gear-up landing at Ellington Field,” she said. “Response to the incident is ongoing, and all crew are safe at this time. As with any incident, a thorough investigation will be conducted by NASA into the cause. NASA will transparently update the public as we gather more information.”

The B-57 line of aircraft dates back to 1944, when the English Electric Company began developing the plane. After the Royal Air Force showcased the B-57 in 1951 by crossing the Atlantic in a record four hours and 40 minutes and becoming the first jet-powered aircraft to span the Atlantic without refueling, the United States Air Force began buying them to replace its aging Douglas B-26 Invader.

The aircraft performed bombing missions in Vietnam and other military campaigns, and a variant that later became the WB-57 was designed with longer wings that could fly even higher, up to 62,000 feet. This proved useful for weather reconnaissance and, around the world, to sample the upper atmosphere for evidence of nuclear debris where US officials suspected the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.

Although their utility for military purposes has faded, NASA has flown WB-57s as part of a broad-ranging science mission since 1972. The aircraft have flown above hurricanes, and missions as varied as collecting cosmic dust samples from comets and asteroids in Earth’s upper atmosphere, investigating clouds, and studying the environmental effect of plumes from the Titan, Space Shuttle, Delta, Atlas, and Athena rockets on the stratosphere. More recently, they have been used to observe launches of SpaceX’s Starship rocket and were due to be used in a similar manner for the Artemis II lunar mission.

After acquiring two of the aircraft earlier, NASA found a third one in the “boneyard” at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona in 2013. After this one was restored, the space agency flew all three simultaneously in 2015, an event attended by Ars.

It was not immediately clear whether the damage to the WB-57 on Tuesday was repairable, nor what impact this might have on plans to observe the launch of the Artemis II mission and reentry of the Orion spacecraft after its journey around the Moon.</div>

            <h2>LG's new subscription program charges up to £277 per month to rent a TV</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/lgs-new-subscription-program-charges-up-to-277-per-month-to-rent-a-tv/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">LG has launched a subscription program in the UK that allows people to make monthly payments in order to rent LG TVs, soundbars, monitors, and speakers.

LG Flex customers can sign up for one-, two-, or three-year subscriptions to get lower monthly payments.

“At the end of your subscription, you can apply for a free upgrade, keep paying monthly, or return your device,” the LG Flex website says. Subscribers will have to pay a £50 (about $69) fee for a “full removal service,” including dismounting and packaging, of rental TVs.

LG also claims on its website that it won’t penalize customers for “obvious signs of use, such as some scratching, small dents, or changes in the paintwork.” However, if you damage the rental device, LG “may charge you for the cost of repair as outlined by the Repair Charges set out in your agreement.” LG’s subscription partner, Raylo, also sells insurance for coverage against “accidental damage, loss, and theft” of rented devices.

As of this writing, you can buy LG’s 83-inch OLED B5 2025 TV on LG’s UK website for £2,550 (about $3,515). Monthly rental prices range from £93 ($128), if you commit to a three-year-long rental period, to £277 ($382), if you only commit to a one-month rental period. Under the three-year plan, you can rent the TV for 27 months before you end up paying more to rent the TV than you would have to own it. At the highest rate, your rental payments will surpass MSRP after nine months.

The cheapest item available through LG Flex as of this writing is LG’s 3.1.1 channel soundbar with Dolby Atmos from 2024. You can buy it from LG’s UK website for £600 ($827) or rent it for £22 ($30) to £76 ($105) per month.

LG Flex can grant people instant access to electronics they may not be able to pay for currently. There are other options, like interest-free payment programs (which LG also offers), but those programs can require larger monthly payments than rentals do.

Still, renting gadgets from LG won’t make financial sense for many. The program can be handy for people, businesses, and other entities that require high-end gadgets for a limited amount of time or that want frequent upgrades. But renting electronics quickly becomes more costly than buying something. It’s often more prudent to save money that would have been used for monthly payments and instead invest it in something that you can own and maintain for years.

LG’s rental gadgets are only available in the UK. Ars Technica reached out to LG about whether it has plans to rent electronics in the US and will update this article if we hear back. As it stands, the program adds to the growing number of tech companies encouraging people to rent, instead of buy, their products. HP, for instance, has a printer rental program, and NZXT launched a gaming desktop rental program in 2024. Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber has also floated the idea of a subscription-based mouse.

LG Flex is just one example of how the South Korea-headquartered company is finding creative ways to build recurring revenue instead of relying solely on sales of its expensive gadgets, as such purchases occur sparingly and less predictably. Last year, LG launched a similar rental program for home appliances in Singapore and Malaysia.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While employees at some tech corporations are demanding their executives cancel government contracts on principle, workers at other companies are begging leadership to protect them from government raids and physical violence.

New bombshell reporting from Wired reveals that in the aftermath of the shooting of Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti, it came to light that at least one federal agent had tried to enter Google’s office in Cambridge, Massachusetts last fall.

In a response to internal concerns about what Google’s senior leadership was doing to keep its employees safe, the company’s head of security and risk operations reportedly said that an “officer arrived at reception without notice,” attempting to gain entry. Ultimately, the agent was “not granted entry because they did not have a warrant, and promptly left.”

Google didn’t respond to Wired‘s request for comment. According to the publication’s sources, the company’s core leadership, CEO Sundar Pichai and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, have been internally tight-lipped about Pretti’s killing. That stands in notable contrast to DeepMind’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, who’s taken taken a pointedly vocal stand.

“This is absolutely shameful,” Dean wrote in response to a video of Pretti’s killing at the hands of six Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers over the weekend.

“Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cell phone camera,” he continued. “Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this.”

The excessive violence suffered by US citizens and non-citizens alike at the hands of ICE agents has put renewed urgency on calls to defund or abolish the agency, which was formed in 2003.

In response to the violence, more than 800 tech workers have signed onto an open letter calling on their companies to cut ties with ICE. At the time of writing, at least 100 of them referenced Google or its parent company, Alphabet, in their signature.

And with nationwide anti-ICE protests intensifying, silence is becoming an increasingly untenable position for tech giants like Google to maintain.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You do not, under any circumstances, gotta to “hand it” to Palantir, a company known for its AI surveillance and battlefield tech, and whose CEO Alex Karp has mused about legalizing war crimes.

But you have to admit, it’s pretty striking to hear that even some of the company’s own employees are starting to feel disgusted about ICE amid its brutal crackdown in Minneapolis, according to new reporting from Wired.

After federal agents shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday, some Palantir employees began openly questioning the work the company was doing with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and Border Patrol, the immigration authorities deployed in Minneapolis and other American cities.

“In my opinion ICE are the bad guys. I am not proud that the company I enjoy so much working for is part of this,” one worker wrote in Slack thread  about Pretti’s killing. “Thinking pragmatically: is the reputational damage we’re taking for being associated with them worth it? What if the next administration will be democratic and they cut all the contracts with us?”

“We need an understanding of our involvement here,” another demanded.

The protests were raised in a company-wide Slack channel dedicated to discussing news items. And many of the posts that were either critical of ICE or questioned Palantir’s involvement with the agency received dozens of upvotes in the form of “+1” emojis, according to Wired, underscoring how the sentiment was far from being fringe, and that the unrest was out in the open. Some employees even wondered if Palantir could help put an end to what they were reading about in the news.

“Can Palantir put any pressure on ICE at all?” one employee wrote. “I’ve read stories of folks rounded up who were seeking asylum with no order to leave the country, no criminal record, and consistently check in with authorities. Literally no reason to be rounded up. Surely we aren’t helping do that?”

Palantir and ICE have deep ties. A 404 Media scoop from earlier this month, for example, described how Palantir was secretly providing ICE a tracking tool called “ELITE” to scour Medicaid data and other government sources to create a map of people it could potentially deport, generating a dossier for each person that included where they live. Palantir was also awarded a $30 million contract to build ICE an “ImmigrationOS” to provide “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting from the country, and also worked on updating the agency’s database so it could “complete target analysis of known populations.”

But according to Wired, Palantir has been so internally secretive about its work with ICE over the last year that employees have been relying on news reports to find out about the services their employer provides the agency.

Now, the groundswell of unrest within Palantir’s ranks has seemingly reached a point where it can’t be ignored by leadership. In response to the Slack protests, Palantir’s civil liberties team updated its internal wiki with a breakdown on its work with ICE, arguing that the “technology is making a difference in mitigating risks while enabling targeted outcomes,” per Wired.

Strikingly, the wiki acknowledged the widespread reports of ICE racially profiling and deporting citizens, as well as the “reputational risk” it was undertaking by continuing to work with the agency. But it insisted ICE remains “committed to avoiding the unlawful/unnecessary targeting, apprehension, and detention of US citizens wherever and however possible.”

This wasn’t enough to appease the concerned employees. They continued to grill their higher-ups about whether ICE could use Palantir’s tools for purposes not agreed in the company’s contracts, leading one executive to admit that Palantir doesn’t “take the position of policing the use of our platform for every workflow,” and hand-waved aside concerns of its tech being abused because there would always be “bad apples.”

One employee also confronted the same executive about a video of an ICE agent scanning an onlooker’s car and telling them they’ve been added to a “database” that marks them as a “domestic terrorist.” The employee demanded to know if Palantir was behind the database, which the executive denied.

The unrest at Palantir is the latest example of how the outrage over ICE’s actions in Minneapolis is crossing political lines, with even some DHS and immigration agents appalled over what’s happening in the city, journalist Ken Klippenstein reports. One ICE agent was exasperated how ten agents “couldn’t find a way to subdue” Pretti without lethal force, and mocked how it would be framed as a “justified killing.” “The best they can do is shoot the guy in the back?” he fumed.

A senior ICE officer also had some thoughts about Pretti’s death. “F*ck this,” he told the journalist.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration may govern for the billionaire class, but that doesn’t necessarily mean billionaires are enjoying the show. Far more likely is that they don’t have the guts to speak up.

Case in point: late on Saturday night, a group of American tech magnates descended on the White House for a private screening of the first lady’s documentary, “Melania.“

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the intimate gathering included a veritable who’s who of tech industry power players: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Zoom CEO Eric Yuan.

Vibes-wise, the event was classic Trump 2.0-chic. Guests were handed monogrammed buckets of popcorn, framed screening tickets for their trophy shelves, and a limited-edition copy of Trump’s 2024 book of the same title as her documentary, “Melania.“ Prior to the screening, the black-tie guests were greeted by a taxpayer-funded military band that playing famous movie themes, as well as “Melania’s Waltz,” featured in the documentary and composed by Hollywood’s Tony Neiman.

All of this is to say, it sounds like a galling display of power and fortune, at a time when American wealth inequality is the worst its been in nearly a century. And in a twist of context so extraordinary that it sounds fictional, the screening also came just a few hours after federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who was attempting to help a woman off of the ground during an immigration raid in Minneapolis.

Yet for all their reach and access — literally — to the president’s palace, tech executives have been oddly reserved after leaving the screening, both in regard to the film as well as the shooting, whose victim Trump smeared as a “domestic terrorist.” Attempts to reach these powerful tech moguls since Saturday have all been ignored, CNN notes.

Maybe they were so overwhelmed by the artistry of the film — the production of which was plagued by extraordinary drama documented by Rolling Stone — that they’re literally speechless.

Far more likely: the documentary, which is already gearing up to be a massive flop, is such a train wreck that they fear that publicly pretending it was any good will subject them to public ridicule. And that’s not to mention the fierce backlash that following the decision to carry on with the screening after Pretti’s death, which tech execs won’t be in any hurry to call attention to.

And in the long-term, for CEOs who paid for front-row seats to this administration, speaking out against the Trump administration now would mean putting ethics ahead of earnings — a calculation nobody in their position would ever make.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Defense might be the first government agency to roll out a department-wide AI chatbot, but the Department of Transportation is about to be the first to draft actual binding regulations with the tech.

According to a new investigation by ProPublica, the top transportation agency has tapped Google Gemini to help write new regulations affecting aviation, automotive, railroad, and maritime safety. In internal communications from DoT attorney Daniel Cohen, agency staffers were presented with the plan along with a demonstration of AI’s “potential to revolutionize the way we draft rulemakings.”

The AI demonstration, Cohen enthused, would show off “exciting new AI tools available to DOT rule writers to help us do our job better and faster.”

His focus, disturbingly, was explicitly that AI is fast, even if it isn’t particularly accurate.

“We don’t need the perfect rule on XYZ. We don’t even need a very good rule on XYZ,” DoT general counsel Gregory Zerzan said, according to the recent meeting notes obtained by ProPublica. “We want good enough,” he said. “We’re flooding the zone.”

In addition, Zerzan noted that enthusiasm for the DoT AI tool runs all the way to the top, noting that Donald Trump is “very excited about this initiative.”

Six DoT workers who spoke to ProPublica anonymously said that typical regulation-writing can take months, and sometimes years, due to the complications involved. But at the demonstration in December, a presenter told them Google’s Gemini could cut that down to “minutes or even seconds.”

Zerzan, for his part, told DoT staffers that the goal is to be able to pump out a new regulation in as little as 30 days. “It shouldn’t take you more than 20 minutes to get a draft rule out of Gemini,” he told regulators.

Asked for his opinion by ProPublica, the DoT’s former chief AI officer Mike Horton compared the plan to “having a high school intern that’s doing your rulemaking.”

For anyone worried about keeping trains on the tracks and planes in the sky, it’s an incredibly troubling development. Large language models (LLMs) like Gemini are prone to errors known as hallucinations. Gemini has been linked to a number of embarrassing episodes, like hallucinating marriages that don’t exist or making up dangerous medical misinformation.

And that’s without getting into how, in April of last year, Gemini users were perturbed as the chatbot abruptly started spitting out screeds that read like disturbing psychological breaks — the last thing you want when dealing with federal regulations on activities as crucial as air traffic control.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nations that defy the US-led world order may soon face a new weapon designed to hamstring defenses, disorient troops, and sow fear into the hearts of its enemies.

In a familiarly bizarre interview with the New York Post, president Donald Trump revealed that US troops had used what he colorfully termed a secret “discombobulator” during the air attack on Caracas, Venezuela earlier this month.

“The discombobulator. I’m not allowed to talk about it,” Trump told the Post. “I would love to,” he said, before claiming that, whatever it is, the device was used in Venezuela. As for what exactly it is, the president was pretty vague.

In the interview, Trump bragged that the device “made [Venezuelan] equipment not work” during the brutal offensive that killed about 100 people and led to the unlawful kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. “They never got their rockets off. They had Russian and Chinese rockets, and they never got one off. We came in, they pressed buttons and nothing worked. They were all set for us.”

As a senior US official told CNN, Trump seems to be conflating a few different systems into one weapon. For example, the US did sabotage Venezuela’s electrical infrastructure and air defense radar systems in a powerful cyberattack, per the New York Times. The White House has also claimed that Venezuelan troops suffered from a “very intense sound wave” during the attack, a likely reference to the Active Denial System, an anti-personnel weapon designed to heat human flesh on contact.

The US wasn’t just interested in knocking out Venezuela’s military capabilities. Civilian infrastructure, such as the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research (IVIC), was also deliberately targeted in the blitz. Though it was 11 miles away from the closest military installation, the IVIC suffered extensive damage to its mathematics, physics, chemistry, ecology, and nuclear research buildings.

US troops also targeted the La Guaira port in Caracas, the country’s main international shipping hub. According to the publication Venezuela Analysis, medical warehouses belonging to the Venezuelan Social Security Institute were among the targets at La Guaira.

That situation has prompted an emergency response from health authorities in Brazil, who are mobilizing to send badly needed dialysis supplies and medicine to Venezuela.

In a statement to local press, Nelare Bermúdez, an official with La Guaira state’s healthcare authority, said that at least a three-month supply of medicine for kidney disease treatment had been destroyed. Yet if the discombobulator was meant to scare Venezuelans into submission, Bermúdez’s resolve suggests otherwise: “we remain undeterred in our fight to guarantee these health services,” he said.

            <h2>Sam Altman Says OpenAI Is Slashing Its Hiring Pace as Financial Crunch Tightens</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-openai-slashing-hiring">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a memo sent out to staff last month, OpenAI CEO issued a “code red” urging employees to double down on improving the company’s flagship product ChatGPT, as financial pressure loomed and competitors gained ground.

The company continues to frantically chase some much-needed revenue. Despite Altman calling ads a “last resort for us as a business model” in 2024, the company announced earlier this month that ChatGPT will soon start spamming users with them.

Its cash burn rate is immense. The company is planning to spend well over $1 trillion in the coming years on data center infrastructure, despite revenue lagging far behind. Experts have warned that the company could run out of cash within the next 18 months. To its most skeptical critics, it’s an Enron-like financial disaster that’s waiting to happen.

So maybe it’s not surprising that the company is opting to pump the brakes. During a livestreamed town hall event on Monday, Altman said that OpenAI is looking to “dramatically slow down” hiring as the company continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter, as Business Insider reports.

“What I think we shouldn’t do, and what I hope other companies won’t do either, is hire super aggressively, then realize all of a sudden AI can do a lot of stuff, and you need fewer people, and have to have some sort of very uncomfortable conversation,” Altman told attendees. “So I think the right approach for us will be to hire more slowly but keep hiring.”

The news comes amid widespread concerns over soaring unemployment in the US. While consumer spending has increased, the labor market has been hit hard by businesses curbing hiring significantly, often citing heavy investments in AI.

Altman’s admission also suggests that several years of aggressive hiring in the AI sector could be screeching to a halt as the industry continues to face pressure from investors getting antsy about the waning prospects of a return.

The news is particularly notable after years of AI companies embracing an unprecedented hiring spree, desperately trying to poach talent from their competitors by offering them astronomical pay packages.

Whether Altman’s announcement signals that those days are over for good remains to be seen. Big tech’s spending binge is set to drag on in the coming years. Many have already made massive commitments to scale up operations by expanding enormous data centers.

At the same time, selling those future prospects to investors could become more difficult as well. OpenAI, for instance, is already struggling with stalling subscriber growth — and that’s before pestering its users with ads or paywalling existing features behind expensive monthly subscriptions. (The company is currently mulling over how much to charge for ads.)

As former Fidelity manager George Noble fulminated in a scorching thread on X, the AI industry may have already hit a point of diminishing returns. Companies still have a lot to prove — for instance, chatbots still suffer from rampant hallucinations — as the goalposts continue to be moved.

“The low-hanging fruit is gone,” he wrote. “Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.”

Meanwhile, Google — one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors — can rely on an already-established business with existing revenue streams to prop up its AI spending.

In short, Altman’s significant hiring slowdown could be indicative of a tough time ahead. And if critics are to be believed, the wheels could already be starting to come off.

            <h2>Waabi raises $1B and expands into robotaxis with Uber</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/waabi-raises-1b-and-expands-into-robotaxis-with-uber/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Autonomous vehicle startup Waabi has raised $1 billion and struck a partnership with Uber to deploy self-driving cars on the ride-hailing platform — the company’s first expansion beyond autonomous trucking.

The funding consists of an oversubscribed $750 million Series C round co-led by Khosla Ventures and G2 Venture Partners and roughly $250 million in milestone-based capital from Uber to support the deployment of 25,000 or more Waabi Driver-powered robotaxis exclusively on its platform. The companies did not provide a timeline for such a large-scale deployment.

The partnership represents a bet that the startup’s AI technology can succeed where others have struggled – scaling across multiple self-driving verticals with a single technology stack. While competitors like Waymo previously attempted both robotaxis and trucking before shutting down its freight program, Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun says her company’s capital-efficient approach and generalizable AI architecture give it a unique advantage to tackle both markets simultaneously.

“Our incredible core technology really enables, for the first time, a single solution that can do multiple verticals, and they can do them at scale,” Urtasun told TechCrunch. “It’s not about two programs, two stacks.”

The tie-up brings Urtasun’s work full circle: she previously served as chief scientist at Uber’s autonomous vehicle division, Uber ATG, which Uber sold to self-driving trucking firm Aurora Innovation in 2020. It also builds on Waabi’s existing partnership with Uber Freight.

Waabi is one of several AV companies that Uber has brought on to deploy self-driving vehicles on its platform globally. Other companies include Waymo, Nuro, Avride, Wayve, WeRide, Momenta, and more.

The tie-up and funding round come as Uber launches a new division called Uber AV Labs that will use its vehicles to collect data for AV partners.

Waabi isn’t as reliant on data as some, if Urtasun is to be believed. The Waabi Driver is trained, tested, and validated using a closed-loop simulator called Waabi World that automatically builds digital twins of the world from data; performs real-time sensor simulation; manufactures scenarios to stress-test the Waabi Driver; and teaches the Driver to learn from its mistakes without human intervention. The result? Waabi’s Driver can reason about its surroundings as a human would and choose the best maneuver, says Urtasun. This allows the system to generalize and learn from fewer examples than traditional autonomous driving systems.

Waabi has spent the last four and a half years bringing that technology to life for highway and surface street capabilities with trucks, but Urtasun says the Waabi Brain already generalizes to different vehicle form factors – she has even hinted at the company’s next vertical being robotics. From the beginning, the company collected and simulated passenger car data alongside its trucking work, a signal that robotaxis were always part of the long-term plan.

The approach has allowed Waabi to build faster and cheaper than competitors, Urtasun claims.

“We don’t need the gazillion humans to develop the technology and the large fleets that AV 1.0 needs,” Urtasun said. “We don’t need the massive data centers, energy consumption, or a gazillion latest chips.”

The deal brings Waabi’s total funding raised to roughly $1.28 billion after it closed a $200 million Series B in June 2024. Competitors Aurora Innovation and Kodiak Robotics have raised $3.46 billion and $448 million to date, respectively, through a combination of venture capital and public-market proceeds.

In just five years, Waabi has launched several commercial pilots (with a human driver in the front seat) in Texas. The company had planned to launch a fully driverless truck on public highways by the end of last year, but the rollout has been delayed until sometime in the next few quarters, per Urtasun.

Waabi is working with Volvo to build purpose-built autonomous trucks, which the company revealed last October at TechCrunch Disrupt. Urtasun says Waabi’s Driver is ready to go, but the trucks still need to be fully validated before launch.

Urtasun’s not worried, though. She says there’s plenty of demand for Waabi’s trucks due to the company’s direct-to-consumer model that enables shippers to buy the outfitted trucks directly, and she’s confident that with the Uber partnership, Waabi will be able to “quickly penetrate the market and scale with a product that will be very reliable.”

“We’re still in the first innings of deployment of robotaxis,” she said. “There’s a lot more scale to come.”

Urtasun wouldn’t share more specifics about the Uber rollout, like what automaker Waabi would partner with. She did say that Waabi would take a similar route to its autonomous trucking rollout by building its sensors and technology into the vehicle from the factory floor.

“We believe in vertically integrating with a fully redundant platform from the OEM,” she said.  “That is how you really build safe and truly scalable technology.”

Other investors in Waabi’s Series C include Uber, NVentures (Nvidia’s VC arm), Volvo Group Venture Capital, Porsche Automobil Holding SE, BlackRock, BDC Capital’s Thrive Venture Fund, and others.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google is expanding its push into AI-powered learning by adding full-length practice tests in Gemini for the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE), India’s nationwide engineering  exam used to shortlist candidates for the country’s top technical institutes and taken by millions of students each year.

Google said students can take full-length mock exams for the JEE within Gemini, which will offer questions based on vetted content from Indian education firms PhysicsWallah and Careers360.

The launch comes after the company recently rolled out similar test-prep tools for the SAT.

Once students complete a mock test in Gemini, Google said the chatbot will provide immediate feedback, highlighting areas of strength and where further study is needed. It can also explain correct answers and help students generate a customized study plan based on their performance, the company said.

The launch of practice tests in Gemini signals a broader push to position the chatbot as a tool for structured exam preparation rather than a shortcut to answers.

In addition to Gemini, Google said the JEE Main preparation tools will roll out to AI Mode in Search, including the Canvas tool, which allows students to build study guides and interactive quizzes by attaching their class notes.

Google claims Indian students are using Gemini to study subjects ranging from advanced physics to broader STEM topics, as well as NotebookLM for turning study materials into quizzes, flashcards and audio or video summaries. Google’s AI tools are available in multiple Indian languages.

Google said it is also expanding its focus on Indian educators, and plans to work with government agencies on a nationwide program to help teachers and support staff use AI for administrative work and lesson design.

The company said it is partnering with the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, and Chaudhary Charan Singh University on a pilot to build an “AI-enabled state university.” The project aims to create a national framework for applying AI across vocational and higher education, encompassing teaching and student support, as well as administrative operations.

Additionally, the company said its charitable arm, Google.org, is backing Wadhwani AI with an ₹850 million (about $10 million) grant to integrate AI into government-run education platforms. The initiative targets systems such as national online learning portals and state education platforms, aiming to make them more adaptable and reduce administrative burdens for educators.

The program spans pre-school through higher education, and includes tools such as voice-based reading support in multiple Indian languages, and AI-powered English learning coaches. The company claims it has already reached around 10 million learners and educators, and aims to scale to 75 million students, 1.8 million educators, and a million early-career professionals by the end of 2027.

            <div id="article-text">Google is bringing AI-powered photo editing to more users around the world, making it easier to fix your photos with simple text commands instead of complicated editing tools.

The company announced Tuesday that it’s expanding natural language-based editing in Google Photos to additional countries, including Australia, India, and Japan. The feature, which Google first launched for Pixel 10 users in the U.S. last August, lets people describe the changes they want to make to their photos rather than manually adjusting sliders or learning complex editing software.

Users in these newly supported countries will now see a “Help me Edit” box when they tap the edit option on a photo. From there, they can either select from suggested prompts or type their own requests in plain language. For example, you could ask the app to “remove the motorcycle in the background,” “reduce the background blur,” or use a more general command like “restore this old photo.”

The AI can handle surprisingly specific requests too. You can ask it to edit a friend’s pose, remove their glasses, or even have them open their eyes in a photo where they blinked. The feature uses Google’s Nano Banana image model to transform photos, and all the processing happens directly within the app without requiring an internet connection for the actual editing.

The feature will work on any Android device with at least 4GB of RAM running Android 8.0 or higher, meaning it’s not limited to Google’s own Pixel phones. Along with this geographic expansion, Google is also adding language support beyond English, including Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, Bengali, and Gujarati, making the tool accessible to millions more users in their native languages.

Google is also rolling out C2PA Content Credentials support in Google Photos for these countries. This metadata  will indicate when an image was created or edited using AI. As AI-generated and AI-edited images become more common, social media platforms have been grappling with how to label AI content, and credentials like C2PA help users understand what they’re looking at.The expansion is the latest in Google’s aggressive push to integrate AI throughout Google Photos. Last November, the company expanded AI-powered search capabilities to over 100 countries with support for more than 17 languages. It also introduced AI templates that can convert photos into different artistic styles. Just last week, Google rolled out a “Meme me” feature that lets users combine reference templates with their own images to create memes.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/indias-shadowfax-slips-on-listing-as-client-concentration-spooks-investors/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Shadowfax stumbled in its market debut, with shares falling as investors weighed concerns about the logistics firm’s heavy reliance on a handful of large e-commerce clients. The company raised about ₹19.07 billion (about $208.24 million) in its initial public offering.

The shares fell about 9% from the offer price of ₹124 to ₹112.60 on Wednesday, valuing the Bengaluru-based logistics firm at roughly ₹64.7 billion (about $706.58 million) on debut, roughly matching its last private valuation of close to ₹60 billion (roughly $655.01 million) in early 2025. The offering, priced in a band of ₹118–124 per share, combined a fresh issue with an offer-for-sale by existing shareholders and was subscribed nearly three times over.

Founded in 2015, Shadowfax operates as a third-party logistics provider, handling last-mile and intra-city deliveries for e-commerce marketplaces, quick-commerce platforms and consumer internet companies across India. The company counts e-commerce players including Flipkart and Meesho, as well as quick-commerce and food delivery platforms Zepto and Zomato, among its largest clients, which together account for about 74% of its revenue, according to its prospectus. Its key shareholders include Flipkart, TPG NewQuest, Qualcomm, and the World Bank-backed International Finance Corporation.

Shadowfax’s listing comes as the e-commerce and quick-commerce sectors continue to expand in India, driven by rising internet penetration, urbanization, and demand for faster deliveries. Platforms offering same-day or rapid fulfillment have increasingly leaned on third-party logistics providers to scale nationally, placing companies like Shadowfax at the centre of the country’s consumer internet supply chain.

The offering includes shares sold by some early and institutional backers, including Flipkart, Eight Roads Ventures, Nokia Growth Partners, Qualcomm, and Mirae Asset. Founders Abhishek Bansal and Vaibhav Khandelwal are not participating in the offer-for-sale and will together retain about 20% of the company after listing.

“We don’t see this IPO as a destination,” said Bansal, Shadowfax’s co-founder and CEO, during its IPO launch ceremony in Mumbai. “We are not building this for the next quarter. We are building this for the next century. Today, we don’t ring a bell. We are waking up to a new set of possibilities.”

In the six months ended September 2025, Shadowfax reported revenue from operations of ₹18.06 billion (about $197.12 million), up 68% from the same period a year earlier, per its prospectus. The company’s profit more than doubled year over year to ₹210.37 million (around $2.30 million), reflecting higher delivery volumes, though earnings remain closely tied to demand from a small group of large platform clients.

Shadowfax plans to use proceeds from the fresh issue to fund capital expenditure for its network infrastructure, pay lease costs for new first-mile, last-mile and sorting centres, and meet branding, marketing and communication expenses, its prospectus said. A portion of the proceeds will also be kept for inorganic acquisitions and general corporate purposes.

The company currently operates around 3.5 million square feet of logistics infrastructure across 14,700 pin codes nationwide.

Shadowfax’s IPO comes more than three years after its larger rival, Delhivery, went public in 2022. Delhivery reported revenue of about ₹89.3 billion (around $974.84 million) in the year ended March 2025, with year-over-year growth in the low teens, underscoring the contrast with Shadowfax’s faster expansion.

            <div id="article-text">​ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, recently established a separate American entity to run the app’s U.S. operations. This restructuring aims to separate U.S. TikTok from its Chinese parent, addressing concerns about data privacy and foreign control.

The move came after years of pressure from lawmakers, who feared the Chinese government’s potential access to Americans’ data. In 2024, Congress enacted a law, mandating that TikTok’s U.S. operations be separated from ByteDance.

​Under the new structure, about 80% of the U.S. TikTok entity is owned by non-Chinese investors, with ByteDance keeping only a 19.9% share. The newly formed entity, “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC,” licenses TikTok’s recommendation algorithm from ByteDance and independently manages content moderation, and oversees data protection, algorithm security, and software controls.

The managing investor group consists of Oracle, the private equity firm Silver Lake, and the investment firm MGX. Each holds a 15% stake, totaling 45% of the U.S. business. Here’s what you should know about them.

Oracle is a leading cloud computing and database firm that collaborates with top companies, such as OpenAI. Oracle previously attempted to acquire TikTok and already provides cloud infrastructure for the app, managing its U.S. user data.

Under the new deal, Oracle serves as the security partner, auditing TikTok’s compliance with U.S. security requirements, managing data storage, and overseeing updates to the content recommendation algorithm.

It’s important to note that Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, now the company’s executive chairman and chief technology officer, is a prominent billionaire with known connections to President Trump.

MGX is an AI-focused investment firm based in the United Arab Emirates, which invests in semiconductors and data centers. The firm was created by Mubadala (Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund) and G42, an Emirati AI company.

MGX’s stake in U.S. TikTok could give the firm influence over key decisions shaping TikTok’s AI direction. The firm already backs Elon Musk’s xAI, Anthropic, and OpenAI, and contributed to a $100 billion AI data center initiative announced by President Trump, in which Oracle is participating as well.

It’s also worth pointing out that MGX has partnerships with Microsoft and BlackRock.

Silver Lake, a leading U.S. private equity firm, has long invested heavily in technology companies, including Airbnb, Twitter, Dell Technologies, Tesla, and Waymo. Its role in U.S. TikTok is primarily financial and strategic, offering capital and expertise to help shape the platform’s direction.

Notably, Silver Lake has collaborated with MGX in the past, including during the acquisition of a majority stake in the software and chip company Altera last year. Additionally, Silver Lake has invested in G42 since 2021.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/everything-you-need-to-know-about-viral-personal-ai-assistant-clawdbot-now-moltbot/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The latest wave of AI excitement has brought us an unexpected mascot: a lobster. Clawdbot, a personal AI assistant, went viral within weeks of its launch and will keep its crustacean theme despite having had to change its name to Moltbot after a legal challenge from Anthropic. But before you jump on the bandwagon, here’s what you need to know.

According to its tagline, Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) is the “AI that actually does things” — whether it’s managing your calendar, sending messages through your favorite apps, or checking you in for flights. This promise has drawn thousands of users willing to tackle the technical setup required, even though it started as a scrappy personal project built by one developer for his own use.

That man is Peter Steinberger, an Austrian developer and founder who is known online as @steipete and actively blogs about his work. After stepping away from his previous project, PSPDFkit, Steinberger felt empty and barely touched his computer for three years, he explained on his blog. But he eventually found his spark again — which led to Moltbot.

While Moltbot is now much more than a solo project, the publicly available version still derives from Clawd, “Peter’s crusted assistant,” now called Molty, a tool he built to help him “manage his digital life” and “explore what human-AI collaboration can be.”

For Steinberger, this meant diving deeper into the momentum around AI that had reignited his builder spark. A self-confessed “Claudoholic”, he initially named his project after Anthropic’s AI flagship product, Claude. He revealed on X that Anthropic subsequently forced him to change the branding for copyright reasons. TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic for comment. But the project’s “lobster soul” remains unchanged.

To its early adopters, Moltbot represents the vanguard of how helpful AI assistants could be. Those who were already excited at the prospect of using AI to quickly generate websites and apps are even more keen to have their personal AI assistant perform tasks for them. And just like Steinberger, they’re eager to tinker with it.

This explains how Moltbot amassed more than 44,200 stars on GitHub so quickly. So much viral attention has been paid Moltbot that it has even moved markets. Cloudflare’s stock surged 14% in premarket trading on Tuesday as social media buzz around the AI agent resparked investor enthusiasm for Cloudflare’s infrastructure, which developers use to run Moltbot locally on their devices.

Still, it’s a long way from breaking out of early adopter territory, and maybe that’s for the best. Installing Moltbot requires being tech savvy, and that also includes awareness of the inherent security risks that come with it.

On one hand, Moltbot is built with safety in mind: It is open source, meaning anyone can inspect its code for vulnerabilities, and it runs on your computer or server, not in the cloud. But on the other hand, its very premise is inherently risky. As entrepreneur and investor Rahul Sood pointed out on X, “‘actually doing things’ means ‘can execute arbitrary commands on your computer.’”

What keeps Sood up at night is “prompt injection through content” — where a malicious person could send you a WhatsApp message that could lead Moltbot to take unintended actions on your computer without your intervention or knowledge.

That risk can be mitigated partly by careful setup. Since Moltbot supports various AI models, users may want to make setup choices based on their resistance to these kinds of attacks. But the only way to fully prevent it is to run Moltbot in a silo.

This may be obvious to experienced developers tinkering with a weeks-old project, but some of them have become more vocal in warning users attracted by the hype: things could turn ugly fast if they approach it as carelessly as ChatGPT.

Steinberger himself was served with a reminder that malicious actors exist when he “messed up” the renaming of his project. He complained on X that “crypto scammers” snatched his GitHub username and created fake cryptocurrency projects in his name, and he warned followers that “any project that lists [him] as coin owner is a SCAM.” He then posted that the GitHub issue had been fixed but cautioned that the legitimate X account is @moltbot, “not any of the 20 scam variations of it.”

This doesn’t necessarily mean you should stay away from Moltbot at this stage if you are curious to test it. But if you have never heard of a VPS — a virtual private server, which is essentially a remote computer you rent to run software — you may want to wait your turn. (That’s where you may want to run Moltbot for now. “Not the laptop with your SSH keys, API credentials, and password manager,” Sood cautioned.)

Right now, running Moltbot safely means running it on a separate computer with throwaway accounts, which defeats the purpose of having a useful AI assistant. And fixing that security-versus-utility trade-off may require solutions that are beyond Steinberger’s control.

Still, by building a tool to solve his own problem, Steinberger showed the developer community what AI agents could actually accomplish and how autonomous AI might finally become genuinely useful rather than just impressive.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Iran’s 86-year-old supreme leader, who believes that he represents God’s will on Earth, ordered what now appears to be one of the deadliest two-day mass slaughters in modern history. According to estimates provided by two anonymous senior officials in the country’s ministry of health, as many as 30,000 citizens may have been killed during this 48-hour rampage on January 8 and 9. If these estimates prove correct, Ali Khamenei’s January 2026 massacre—the climax of a decades-long reign of repression—will rank among modern history’s deadliest single episodes of state violence.

Since the rise of the modern state in the 17th century, political legitimacy has come to rest on a social contract, in which the government provides security and sustenance in exchange for the consent of the governed. The Islamic Republic’s relationship with Iranians does not resemble a social contract, but a predatory lease signed in 1979 that has long since expired.

The terms of this lease—imposed by the landlord upon the tenants—are nonnegotiable:

You, the tenant, will live inside the religious fever dream of a man, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who viewed the state not as a vessel for national advancement, but as a weapon for personal retribution, and whose copious writings offered detailed pronouncements about the religious penalties for fornicating with animals, yet no insights on how to run a modern economy. “Economics,” he once said, “is for donkeys.”

You will be ruled for four decades by his successor, Khamenei, whose views will remain fixed no matter how much the world, and Iranian society, changes. He will preach resistance and pretend he is a pious man who eschews worldly wealth. But an entity called Setad—a shadowy financial empire under his personal control—has amassed assets valued at more than $95 billion in 2013 and potentially exceeding $200 billion today, much of it confiscated from Iranians who fled political and religious persecution.

We, the landlord, will micromanage your personal life. Whom you love, the movies you watch, the music you listen to, what you drink—all will be subject to our approval. Under our Sharia-based laws, women will be stoned for adultery, while men are permitted to take multiple wives.

You will be subjected to routine power outages, even though your country possesses the world’s third-largest proven reserves of oil and second-largest reserves of natural gas. We will preside over one of the highest inflation rates in the world, wiping out your savings as the national currency loses more than 99 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the revolution.

We will so profoundly mismanage our environment–due to corruption and incompetence–that we will dry up your rivers and turn your lakes into salt flats, creating dust storms that choke your cities. We will pump the groundwater until the land beneath Tehran literally sinks, imperiling its habitability for future generations.

Our national slogans will be “Death to America” and “Death to Israel,” never “Long Live Iran.” As Khomeini once put it, “Patriots are useless to us. We need Muslims. Islam is opposed to patriotism.” While we chant these slogans, we will send our own children to study in the West.

We will treat half the population as second-class citizens. If you are a woman, your testimony in court will be worth half that of a man’s, and your inheritance will be half that of your brother’s. We will make a piece of cloth—the hijab—the primary symbol of our state’s authority, and we will beat you to death in detention centers for wearing it “improperly.”

Although we will rule from a moral pedestal, we will lie without reserve. As the longtime Khamenei adviser Mohammad-Javad Larijani likes to say, “Being able to keep a secret even if you have to mislead is considered a sign of maturity. It’s Persian wisdom. We don’t have to be ideal people. Everybody lies. Let’s be good liars.”

Our greatest national export will be the intelligence of our nation. We will suffer from one of the highest levels of brain drain in the world. One hundred fifty thousand of our citizens will leave every year, at a cost that even our own officials have conceded could amount to about $150 billion annually.

Rather than recruit the brightest minds from our diaspora back to Iran to contribute to our nation, we will take them hostage and sell them for ransom to the United States and European countries. We will take visiting foreign academics hostage and trade them for convicted terrorists.

Though we will boast about our independence, 90 percent of our oil exports—the lifeblood of our economy—will go to China, which demands steep discounts.

We will use a sizable portion of our national wealth—tens of billions of dollars—to finance and arm Arab militias throughout the Middle East. This should not be confused with concern for the well-being of Palestinians. In contrast to American, European, and Arab governments that fund Palestinian human-welfare initiatives, our resources will arm and finance Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Our goal is not to build Palestine but to destroy Israel. We will achieve neither.

We will spend well more than $500 billion—including the revenue lost to sanctions—for a nuclear program that provides neither energy nor deterrence, as was evidenced by Israel and America’s repeated penetration of Iranian air space.

We will ally with Russia, a country that excised a third of our territory in the 19th century, that occupied and attempted to take more territory in the 20th century, and that benefits from keeping our country isolated so that we cannot compete with them in global energy markets or for influence in Central Asia.

We will preach a “resistance economy” of austerity for you, while our Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps operates as a tax-exempt mafia that controls as much as 50 percent of the national economy, including telecommunications, ports, and construction. You will stand in line for subsidized bread while our elites smuggle iPhones and luxury cars through exclusive, unmonitored airport terminals. Our middlemen will funnel your national wealth into European property empires—buying ski resorts in Austria and mansions on London’s Billionaires’ Row—all while financing the very guards who repress you.

Omid Memarian: What Trump fails to grasp about Iran

We reserve the right to use you as human shields. When we fear an attack, we may refuse to close civilian airspace, shoot down a passenger plane full of our own citizens, lie about it for three days, and then torment the families of the victims.

If you protest our corruption or incompetence, you will be called a terrorist and charged with “waging war against God” or “corruption on earth.” We will execute you without due process, maintaining the world’s highest execution rate per capita.

We will build a digital wall around you. We will slow your internet speeds to a crawl and block global platforms to prevent you from communicating with one another or the outside world, while our officials post freely on X to spread propaganda to the West.

Even before this latest massacre, the gap between the Iranian government and its citizens was one of the widest on Earth. A critical mass of Iranians, including within the regime, have realized that the structure is condemned. They know that breaking the lease will be costly and terrifying, especially without foreign help. But they also know that living under its terms is at best a dead end, and at worst a death sentence. They do not seek to renegotiate the contract. They seek to evict the landlord.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/alex-pretti-shooting-trump-ice-minneapolis/685780/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The statements from congressional Republicans after Saturday’s shooting of Alex Pretti were relatively mild. Lawmakers said that they were “deeply troubled” or “disturbed” by the second killing of an American citizen by federal immigration officers this month; most called for an investigation into Pretti’s death. But the statements kept coming, one after another, all through the weekend and into yesterday.

The reactions from across the GOP sent an unmistakable message in their volume, if not in their rhetoric, to Donald Trump: Enough. The defining characteristics of the Republican-controlled Congress during the president’s second term have been silence and acquiescence. That so many in his party felt compelled to speak up after Pretti’s killing was a sign that Republicans had finally lost patience with federal agents occupying a major American city—a deportation operation that has soured the public on one of Trump’s signature policies and sunk the GOP’s standing at the outset of a crucial midterm-election year.

Republican committee chairs in both the House and the Senate summoned top administration officials to public hearings—a rarity in the past year. From the right, the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights advocates criticized comments from senior law-enforcement officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel, that blamed Pretti for carrying a firearm and said that people should not bring guns to public demonstrations. (Videos showed that officers disarmed Pretti before they fatally shot him.) Few Republican leaders rushed to defend the unnamed agent who’d killed Pretti, nor did they echo the rhetoric of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, who referred to Pretti, an ICU nurse, as a “would-be assassin.” In at least one case, the lack of comment from a top Republican was significant: House Speaker Mike Johnson—ordinarily quick to pick up talking points from the president and his top aides—has said nothing about the shooting.

The harshest Republican condemnation came from one of the party’s candidates for governor of Minnesota, Chris Madel, who yesterday declared that he was quitting the race in part because of the federal deployment. “I cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state,” Madel said in his video announcement, “nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so.”

Watching all of this unfold was Trump, who already did not like what he saw. For the president, it was a rare winter weekend when he wasn’t in Palm Beach or at the golf course. He never left the White House. And he was glued to news coverage that showed little besides another horrific shooting in Minnesota. Videos of Pretti’s killing were inescapable on TV and social media, and the story broke through to nonpolitical media—drawing reactions from the likes of Charles Barkley and Bill Simmons—in ways that the fatal shooting of Renee Good on January 7 did not.

Trump’s first move was to defend the federal officers carrying out the immigration operations in the moments before the deadly clash. He reposted a Department of Homeland Security–supplied photo of the gun Pretti had been carrying, before again making claims about fraud in Minnesota’s immigrant communities. But he otherwise remained publicly silent as more videos of the shooting cast doubt on the administration’s statements about what had happened.

Trump began asking aides and outside advisers if it had been an “okay” shooting, trying to figure out whether the agents had made the right decision to fire, a White House official and two allies close to the West Wing told us. His top aides, among them Miller—including in a post that was amplified by Vice President Vance—immediately blamed Pretti for instigating violence (as the administration blamed Good after her death) and suggested, without evidence, that Pretti had been a “domestic terrorist.”

But this time, fewer Republicans joined the chorus. And as the weekend wore on, more GOP lawmakers and conservative media voices began to call for an investigation into the shooting and to question the administration’s assertion that an armed Pretti had violently resisted agents. Senator John Curtis of Utah called out Noem by name, saying that he disagreed with her “premature” response to the shooting.

Trump grew concerned at the response, the White House official and one outside ally told us. He again on Sunday demanded more cooperation from local officials and blamed Democratic lawmakers for violence in Minnesota—but he noticeably did not defend the officers who’d shot Pretti, in either his posts or in a brief interview with The Wall Street Journal. The president, who has long enjoyed near-total fealty from Republicans, took note of the lawmakers calling for a probe or quietly suggesting that federal officials roll back operations in the Twin Cities. (He was glad that the lawmakers did not blame him personally for the administration’s response, one of the allies told us.)

Trump was particularly bothered by the NRA&#39;s strong reply to an assistant U.S. attorney in California appointed by the administration who said that if a person approaches law enforcement with a gun, there is a “high likelihood” that officers will be “legally justified in shooting you.” Trump has long prided himself on the support he receives from those he calls “my Second Amendment people,” and he has often been deferential to the gun lobby despite its waning influence.

When something becomes too controversial for Trump’s liking—or when the blowback becomes too fierce—he has in many cases a way to declare some sort of victory, even a far-fetched one, and then move on (as he did with Greenland last week). Aides wondered whether he was trying to do the same with Minneapolis. Yesterday, Trump appointed his designated “border czar,” Tom Homan, to head the federal operation in Minnesota. Although most Democrats are deeply skeptical of Homan, he has not been involved in the Twin Cities operations and has been more consistently careful with his language than Miller or Noem. (After Good’s killing, Homan said that he would reserve judgment on the matter until an investigation had concluded.) Trump later claimed, after a phone call, that he and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are largely aligned in their goals for the federal operation—and even offered some faint praise for the governor, who is under investigation by the Department of Justice for allegedly impeding the operation of immigration agents.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that if local officials increased their cooperation with the federal government, Border Patrol agents would “no longer be needed to support ICE on the ground in Minnesota.” The administration decided to pull some federal agents out of Minnesota, aides said, but did not suggest a sweeping overhaul to the mission in the state or to Trump’s broader immigration agenda.

Trump’s unease, along with pushback from Republicans, grew by the hour and forced a major change: As The Atlantic’s Nick Miroff first reported, the administration yesterday ousted Gregory Bovino from his role as the Border Patrol’s “commander at large” and removed him from Minnesota, where he had become the public face of the federal operation. Many in Trump’s orbit saw Bovino as an easy scapegoat; he’d claimed, without evidence, that Pretti had planned to attack federal agents. (His choice of coat and interactions with Minnesotans in social-media posts had also generated an uproar.) Despite this, a senior administration official insisted that Bovino’s transfer had been in the works before the announcement of Homan’s new role. Not all of Trump’s allies were happy with the change in Minneapolis. “You can’t sugarcoat this,” the Trump ally Steve Bannon said on his podcast. “It wasn’t just a blink. It was a crater.”

Last night, the president met for two hours in the Oval Office with Noem and one of her top advisers, the former Trump-campaign chief Corey Lewandowski, but the senior official made clear to us that no additional leadership changes are imminent. Leavitt, in her briefing, also said that Trump continues to have confidence in Noem. For the moment, she remains at her job.

            <h2>What Should Americans Do Now?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/minneapolis-ice-protests-democracy/685778/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The killings in Minneapolis of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have been compared to the murder of George Floyd, because they all happened within a few miles of one another, and because of the outrage they inspired. There’s an important difference, though: In 2020 the United States was in turmoil, but it was still a state of law. Floyd’s death was followed by investigation, trial, and verdict—by justice. The Minneapolis Police Department was held accountable and ultimately made to reform.

No one should expect justice for Good and Pretti. Today, nothing stands in the way of the brutal tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol. While President Trump seems to be trying to defuse the mayhem he’s caused by reassigning a top commander, he is not withdrawing the federal agents from the state or allowing local authorities to investigate, let alone prosecute, them for their actions.

Authoritarianism doesn’t disappear with the news cycle. The administration’s automatic lies about the killings and slander of the victims are less a cover-up of facts than a display of utter contempt for them. Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, FBI Director Kash Patel, and other top officials seem to invite incredulity as a way to flex their power: We say black is white. Agree or you’re a criminal. When Stephen Miller recently claimed that geopolitics is ruled by the “iron laws” of “strength” and “force,” he was expressing the administration’s approach to domestic governance as well. Those words are iron laws on American streets.

The prelude to the violence of January 7 and 24 came not in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, but in Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021. Trump and his supporters were prevented from stealing an election and overthrowing the Constitution by democratic institutions—Congress, the courts, the police, the media, and public opinion. But the insurrection never ended. By the time Trump returned to power and pardoned the insurrectionists, almost half of the country believed that January 6 was a patriotic demonstration, a false-flag operation, or just no big deal. Throughout 2025, institutions that once restrained the presidency weakened or fell away one by one, until earlier this month Trump told The New York Times that the only limit to his power is his own mind. That same day, January 7, authoritarianism had its predictable consequence in freezing Minneapolis with the execution of Renee Good.

If rogue federal agents can shoot American citizens dead with total impunity, then it doesn’t matter whether state and local authorities, the courts, the media, the political opposition, and a mobilized public object. “ICE > MN,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on social media—an assertion of raw force, not constitutional authority. When Trump and his loyalists call protesters terrorists and warn that disobeying orders will get you killed, they strip away any illusion that the federal government respects the lives, let alone the rights, of those who oppose it—potentially half the population or more.

A lawless regime is an illegitimate one. If the country seems to have reached a breaking point in Minneapolis, this is why. And yet Minneapolis also offers a compelling answer to the question that democracy-loving Americans have asked for the past year: What can I do?

No historical precedent exists for where we are. Individuals and groups have often accused the U.S. government of denying their rights, and some of those accusations were irrefutable—as in the century between Appomattox and Selma, when the rights of Black Americans were denied throughout the South with the connivance of Washington. Some, though, were shams. In 1861, the Confederacy declared the government in Washington illegitimate and fired the first shots of the Civil War, not because any rights had been taken away from southern states—not even the right to hold human beings in bondage—but because they hated and feared Abraham Lincoln and his Republican Party. After the 2020 election, MAGA tried to claim that the election had been stolen and a Biden presidency would be illegitimate; truth and the law prevailed.

The federal government has never declared itself immune to the law and the Constitution while explicitly denying protection to peaceful opponents, until now. Many Americans who thought they were living under the rule of law feel paralyzed. The vague exhortation to “do something while you still can” creates a sense of urgency but doesn’t provide a plan. Rather than inspiring action, the question of what to do more likely leaves you feeling depressed and alone. Not even the prospect of waiting out the year until the midterms provides much reassurance. Trump has made it clear that he will try to undermine any election that might cost him some of his power.

Without a constructive answer, the danger is that Americans who find themselves without legal remedies will turn to illegal and violent ones. That would be a catastrophic mistake, both strategically and morally.

So far, action has come in the form of either legal challenge or protest, including speeches and writings by politicians and public figures, and the occasional nationwide demonstrations known as “No Kings,” which draw on patriotic imagery and the historic American aversion to tyranny. The key to the popularity of No Kings lies in its unifying name. The focus is not a single issue, such as abortion, immigration, Ukraine, or Gaza, but a broad stance against autocracy and for democracy. Its demonstrations are orderly, peaceful, good-tempered, and irreverent, featuring countless American flags. No Kings hasn’t been hijacked by leftist groups with more extreme agendas, spouting strident anti-American language that’s bound to repel ordinary people. But No Kings has been inconspicuous since October. It will have to transform itself into something much more potent than a once-a-quarter day of demonstration.

George Packer: Why the ‘No Kings’ protest moved me

In Minneapolis, as the scale and intensity of oppression increased, the answer to “What can I do?” evolved from protest to something riskier and more demanding: nonviolent resistance. As my colleague Robert Worth has reported, networks of Minneapolitans that had formed after Floyd’s murder to protect their neighborhoods from both out-of-control police and rioters have been revived in the past few months to protect their immigrant neighbors from the invasion of federal agents. Residents undergo training in nonviolent resistance, which demands courage, wisdom, and restraint; they bring food to those hiding at home, escort children to school, and stand watch outside; they blow whistles and send out alerts on encrypted chats to signal the presence of ICE vehicles, and follow them; they try to de-escalate confrontations (sometimes with the opposite result), provide medical aid to the injured, and shame masked agents in military gear who seem poorly trained and undisciplined compared with the civilians.

Given the level of rage on the streets, the conduct of these local networks has been remarkable. One older suburban woman—nothing like the “lunatics,” “domestic terrorists,” or “assassins” Trump and his advisers see in Minneapolis—told Worth that she doesn’t even consider her involvement political. Her preferred term for what she’s doing is humanist. It could be a byword for the whole opposition to a cruel and predatory regime.

Minneapolis is setting an example for the rest of the country: a nameless, leaderless, self-organized movement. Self-organization is a term I heard from almost everyone I met in Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion. It’s an inherently hard form of activism, requiring high levels of motivation and trust. These obviously exist in the neighborhoods of South Minneapolis, where civic spirit and personal connections run deep. But replicating them on a wider scale—essentially, creating a mass movement for basic decency—raises obvious problems. That movement’s energy might depend on the arrival of conspicuous federal oppression in other blue cities and states (which Trump has promised). It would have to remain decentralized and maintain its local integrity while creating a capacity for nationwide coordination. It could fall apart for lack of discipline, coherence, trust, and leadership—or, conversely, because of leadership that devolves into factionalism. The civil-rights movement confronted all of these problems, and overcame them.

No Kings or another group could consider organizing and training people in other parts of the country to join the kind of civic action on display in Minneapolis—to move from protest to nonviolent resistance. Beyond neighbor-to-neighbor support in a moment of crisis lies a wide range of means to withhold cooperation from an illegitimate government. The late theorist Gene Sharp laid them out, along with ideas for strategic planning, in books such as From Dictatorship to Democracy and Waging Nonviolent Struggle. Sharp’s work has been used as an essential guide for democracy activists under dictatorial regimes in countries such as Serbia, Burma, and Iran. Americans should pick up these books and absorb their lessons.

Sharp analyzed various “methods of noncooperation”—political, economic, and social—that stop short of more aggressive disruptions. They include boycotts and strikes (such as the widely observed general strike in Minneapolis last Friday); refusal to participate in administration-supported organizations and events; “quasi-legal evasions and delays” and “reluctant and slow compliance” with government edicts; and finally, nonviolent civil disobedience. Anti-ICE actions that try to thwart the brutal and indiscriminate enforcement of immigration laws can become a form of civil disobedience.

Nonviolent struggle carries serious risks. It can lead to social ostracism, legal harassment, state intimidation, prison, injury, and, as we’ve seen in Minneapolis, death. One sign of the authoritarian depth to which the U.S. has sunk under Trump is that none of these risks is hard to imagine. Examples accumulate every day. A movement of resistance against an illegitimate regime has a chance of succeeding only if it remains strictly nonviolent and avoids the familiar trap of sectarianism. It has to be democratic, patriotic, and animated by a sense of basic decency that can attract ordinary people—your TV-watching mother, your apathetic teen, your child’s teacher, the retiree next door, the local grocer.

I keep asking myself whether it’s wise to even consider these things. I don’t want to sound alarmist, or delusional, or needlessly provocative. For an American who grew up in the postwar order with its apparently permanent rules, in a democracy with obvious flaws that nonetheless seemed on a course of gradual, inevitable progress, I find it extremely hard to assess the peril. I’m tempted to believe that the country will somehow return to normal, because I want it to be normal. We’ve never been here before, and either the nervous system overreacts or the imagination fails. After Minneapolis, I fear the latter more. Trump is taking the country on a path to tyranny. The first obligation for each of us is to see it and name it. The next is to figure out what to do about it.</div>

            <h2>A Reckoning for the Tech Right</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hours after Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy showed up for a movie night at the White House. Along with other business executives and several prominent Donald Trump supporters, they attended a private screening of Melania, a new documentary about the president’s wife. The moviegoers were treated to buckets of popcorn and sugar cookies frosted with the first lady’s name.

Silicon Valley’s top executives have seemingly taken every opportunity to cozy up to Trump. During his inauguration a year ago, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk, and Cook sat smiling behind the president in the Capitol Rotunda. The obsequiousness has not stopped since: In August, Cook presented Trump with a custom plaque atop a 24-karat-gold base in the Oval Office. At a White House dinner the next month, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin praised Trump’s “civil rights” work, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman described Trump’s leadership as a “refreshing change.” Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google are among the companies that have made donations to fund the new White House ballroom.

Tech has a long history of making moves to appease politicians in power, including ample campaign donations. But the industry’s leaders have not distanced themselves from Trump even as his administration has shattered constitutional and democratic norms. In Minneapolis over the weekend, an American citizen was shot in the street by masked federal officers after recording them with his phone. In the immediate aftermath, top Trump-administration officials blamed Pretti for his own death, despite contradictory video evidence. The uproar has been loud, and not just among Democrats. So far, Silicon Valley’s top CEOs have largely remained silent.

In some ways, tech’s rightward shift in 2024 was overstated. The embrace of Trump was mostly concentrated among a small pack of investors and executives, who had a quieting effect on the rest of the industry. In the past few days, the gulf between the top brass and the rank and file has grown. Hundreds of employees from major companies including Apple, Amazon, OpenAI, and beyond have signed a statement asking the industry’s CEOs to call the White House and comment publicly against the violence. Several well-respected voices in the industry have spoken up: “Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this,” Google’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, posted on X after the shooting. “The video was sickening to watch,” wrote the investor Vinod Khosla, who called out the administration’s “storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts.” Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, one of the few major Silicon Valley CEOs to have expressed his condemnation, took the opportunity to warn against the “reluctance of tech companies to criticize the US government.”

Altman reportedly rebuked the administration in an internal post to OpenAI employees, writing that “what’s happening with ICE is going too far.” He added that the president is “a very strong leader” who he hopes “will rise to this moment and unite the country.”

Yet there is little reason to believe that Silicon Valley’s uppermost ranks will more formally break with Trump. If anything, as the midterm elections approach, some executives appear to be doubling down on their support. This fall, Greg Brockman, the president of OpenAI, and his wife, Anna, donated $25 million to Trump’s super PAC. And Elon Musk recently signaled his political return with a $10 million donation to the pro-Trump candidate running to succeed Mitch McConnell—the Tesla CEO’s largest-ever single contribution to a Senate candidate. (Jassy, Cook, and Greg Brockman did not respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, which has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic, has previously said that the Brockmans’ donations were made in a personal capacity.)

During Trump’s first term in office, a number of these tech leaders were outspoken in criticizing him: In 2017, Brin showed up to a protest against Trump’s Muslim ban, and Altman spoke with 100 Trump voters across the country to figure out what it would take to “convince them not to vote for him in the future.” Greg Brockman previously donated to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. It’s conceivable that these leaders’ political views changed, of course, but the groveling reads obviously as strategy. Trump is a dealmaker, and playing to his administration is good for business. Already, tech companies have gained a lot by cozying up to Trump, including relaxed AI regulation and tariff exemptions.

This all risks being a short-term, transactional game. In the long run, tech executives’ alignment with the president could easily backfire. “The Trump supporters in Silicon Valley are making the same mistake as all powerful people who back authoritarians,” the venture capitalist Michael Moritz warned in 2024. “They are, I suspect, seduced by the notion that because of their means, they will be able to control Trump.” But Trump is mercurial: He will do as he pleases. As tech executives continue schmoozing with the president, there are no guarantees that they will get anything in return.</div>

            <h2><em>Half His Age</em> Isn’t At All What It Seems</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/half-his-age-jennette-mccurdy-book-review-desire-consumption/685777/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Whatever you might think you’re going to get from the familiar setup of Jennette McCurdy’s Half His Age (a lonely high-school girl in Anchorage begins an extremely questionable sexual relationship with her teacher), any presumptions are dispelled from the very first page. When Waldo, the teenage narrator of the novel, observes her boyfriend’s “slimy tongue that loop-de-loops over and over like a carnival ride, mechanical and passionless,” she’s setting a tone: irreverent, graphic, bilious.

McCurdy is much more interested in late capitalism than in Lolita. Waldo’s world has long been poisoned by the microwavable meals her disinterested mother leaves out, the fast-fashion crop tops she orders that come with a cancer warning, the laptop she falls asleep clutching at 2 a.m., its unnatural heat “searing my ovaries.” By the time she meets Mr. Korgy, her frowsy middle-aged creative-writing instructor, on page 11, she is already imprinted on the reader as a caustic force of anti-nature.

And so she seduces Korgy—of course she does. Their relationship ensues through the slow erosion of boundaries, mostly instigated by her but sometimes by him. She masturbates using a bottle of tropical-fruit-flavored Tums while stalking his Instagram. He praises her writing and asks her to stay after class; he later invites her to dinner at his home with his wife. She sends him a thank-you email with her phone number. He calls her. And so on, until they’re frantically humping in a janitorial closet, in her childhood bedroom, at hotels (after fancy dinners where people assume he’s her father). Mr. Korgy—his first name is Theodore, but Waldo never uses it—is no scheming predator. His wife calls him “Teddy” and tells emasculating anecdotes about him. He’s soft and pitiable where Waldo is ferocious in her loneliness and adept at transforming herself into various alluring guises.

Literature is rife with memoirs and works of autofiction about ravening English teachers, accounts of mentors who allegedly groomed vulnerable girls with writing and manipulated their own words. Half His Age is resolutely not one of these books. But McCurdy, who, as a child, starred in Nickelodeon shows alongside Ariana Grande and Miranda Cosgrove, knows well all the ways underage girls can be flattened and plasticized by adults—turned into objects. Her previous book, I’m Glad My Mom Died, recounted McCurdy’s childhood being coerced into performing by her narcissistic and mentally unstable mother, who introduced her daughter to ritualized anorexia at the age of 11 and was such a hoarder, storing objects in every bedroom in the house, that her children had to sleep on Costco mats on the living-room floor. (McCurdy also wrote about a man she called The Creator, widely speculated to be the Nickelodeon executive Dan Schneider, who has faced multiple accusations of inappropriate conduct and abuse; Schneider has denied many of the allegations, but apologized for making people uncomfortable on set.)

Read: Don’t judge I’m Glad My Mom Died by its title

Half His Age, though, isn’t about abuse, or exploitation, or even the power dynamics of what we now call “age-gap relationships,” even as Waldo is bracingly aware of the occasions when Mr. Korgy manipulates her emotionally, and far too astute to fall for his “I want to expose you to art and films and music and books” schtick. The book reads much more like a postmodern novel for the fast-fashion generation, a portrait of civilizational decline told through declining mall chains, ultra-processed foods, and relentless consumption. Online shopping isn’t just a compulsion for Waldo—it’s an assertion of her existence.

Temporally, Half His Age is hard to place. Waldo refers to Instagram and TikTok but doesn’t scroll; she obsesses over her appearance, grooming herself with rigor and self-loathing, but doesn’t post pictures of herself or seem to have an online footprint beyond her shopping orders. She lives in Alaska, but all we hear about it is that her summer days are “bloated” and her winters bleak. Her local hangouts are wholly generic: Waldo works at Victoria’s Secret to fund her shopping habit, eats breakfast with her mom at Denny’s, and survives on Auntie Anne’s pretzels, Marie Callender’s entrees, and Sour Patch Kids. She rattles off cosmetic brand names the same way Mr. Korgy lists his favorite directors (“Bergman and Kubrick and Kurosawa, Lonergan and Linklater and Solondz”)—as a way of underscoring her identity, even if it’s homogenous. Brands are omnipresent in her life, as extant as air. (When the two have sex in Korgy’s car, the feeling of Cheerio crumbs being ground into Waldo’s knees becomes a staple part of the experience.)

McCurdy’s brittle commentary made me think of Don DeLillo’s description of the supermarket in White Noise, with all the hyperreal produce “sprayed, burnished, bright” and inserted into “filmy bags.” At some point in the 20th century, the critic Cynthia Deitering has written of that novel, humanity oversaw one of its most profound transformations: “a shift from a culture defined by its production to a culture defined by its waste.” In DeLillo’s imagination, the specter hovering over all of this unnatural abundance is death; in McCurdy’s, it’s desire. How is Waldo supposed to know what she really wants when her synapses are distorted by the dopamine thrill of acquisition, the heart-stopping kick of something new? She’s not exactly surrounded by appealing prospects. “You think some beefy senior’s gonna be emotionally available between his rounds of Grand Theft Auto and his daily hour of Pornhub?” she tells Mr. Korgy. What she’s most drawn to in her teacher is the way he seems to live outside her dull, trashy monoculture. But his Crate & Barrel throw pillows are no more authentic than her mom’s HOME SWEET HOME Target doormat, or the Le Labo candles and coffee-table books at Waldo’s rich friend Frannie’s house. When Korgy Amazon-ships Waldo a grocery order of some of his favorite nourishing foods, she can manage only three bites of the “chocolate paleo crunch granola with almond milk” before throwing it away.

In structural terms, Half His Age is much more thrilling in the first half than in the second, when Waldo’s frenzied fixation on Mr. Korgy curdles into a much more predictable entanglement. But McCurdy’s furious writing—her dystopian rendering of a culture squandering its dreams and desires on the crack high of cheap stuff—is hard to tear yourself away from. “Few adult persons can see nature,” another Waldo once wrote. Is that kind of transcendent communion with the real world even possible anymore? Half His Age might make you wonder.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2006, I helped establish the NATO Special Operations Forces Command in Mons, Belgium. It included commandos from more than 19 nations. Over the course of the next two years, we trained and exercised together, drank together, and spent family time together. In doing so, we learned that our common values were much more important than our national differences. We also developed a bond that only men preparing for combat can appreciate.

By 2008, I was back fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Iraq, I was blessed to have the British Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) serving alongside my Rangers, SEALs, and Delta Force operators. The Brits took on one of the toughest missions in our counterterrorism fight: the suicide-bomber network operating in Baghdad. Their work unquestionably saved the lives of American soldiers and our allies. And they paid a high price for standing alongside us. In 2005, British special military units lost 10 personnel when one of their C-130s was shot down outside the city. We mourned their loss as if they were our own.

Isaac Stanley-Becker: The sacrifice of the Danes

In Afghanistan, NATO special-operations soldiers fought with tremendous courage and unwavering loyalty to their American counterparts. That commitment did not come without a cost, either. I stood on the tarmac in Bagram and Kandahar many times paying my final respects to soldiers from the U.K., Canada, Australia, France, Denmark, and Germany. Never have I seen such an outpouring of respect and admiration for their contribution to the fight. I also mourned the loss of the first Romanian soldier to have died in combat since World War II—just one of the 27 who fell in Afghanistan.

Many other nations contributed to the NATO mission and lost young men and women because we asked them for their help. We asked them for their help, and most didn’t hesitate. They understood the value of our alliance. They understood the power of being united in a common cause. They believed in NATO and they believed in the United States.

Anyone who would denigrate the service of our NATO allies clearly never spent a day in uniform. These NATO soldiers were as courageous, as heroic, as patriotic, and as loyal as any soldier I ever served with. I, for one, am forever grateful for their service and their sacrifice.

Winston Churchill once said that “there is only one thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them.” If we continue to show disdain for our allies, if we fail to appreciate their contribution to our national security and greater global stability, we may find ourselves fighting alone someday. And trust me, war is never a contest you want to fight alone.</div>

            <div id="article-text">I notice that, with this and other layoffs, they euphemistically talk about &quot;removing layers&quot; - but in actual practice they&#39;re typically only removing the very bottom layer (a bunch of actual workers).

Is that really true? Many of the layoffs I&#39;ve seen over the past year have been legitimately &quot;removing layers&quot;, purging loads of fat in middle management.

Companies constantly go through cycles where they stretch to a very vertical structure with a manager for every three employees (exaggerating, but only slightly), and then there&#39;s the periodic flattening where they prune it out.

People miss that AI isn&#39;t REPLACING corporate positions, it&#39;s identifying positions that are not needed.  This is something it&#39;s good at.

It doesn&#39;t need to reach the level where it can do someones job to determine that the job is useless to the company or that a reorg can make the position redundant.  This is where the layoffs are coming from - cutting out the fat.

You only need one manager reading the TPS reports.

It&#39;s odd that in this sort of situation - delivering bad news to employees - the communication skills that HR departments usually promote, seem lacking.

Presumably in an effort to soften the blow, terms like &quot;impacted&quot;, and &quot;positioning for future success&quot; are used, which to the impacted employees just sound like management-speak, and probably add a sprinkle of irritation onto the serving of bad news.

Management-speak is a dialect used to add the impression of professionalism to what is often a content of marketing or obfuscation. It can work on peers, but can be counter-productive when used on people who value precision, like computer folk.

At most agencies, the most common reasons for departures were retirements and quitting. Although OPM classifies many of these as voluntary, outside forces including the fear of being fired, the lure of buyout offers, or a profound disagreement with Trump policies, likely influenced many decisions to leave. Many Ph.D.s departed because their position was terminated.It wasn&#39;t so much the Trump administration firing people (although that did happen.) It was people quitting or retiring for the most part.It&#39;s well-known that the current administration has an attitude towards science that is sometimes hostile and sometimes demanding of fealty at the expense of facts. As science is a profession that strives to convey knowledge without political bias, I can understand when its practitioners currently in public service become disilusioned.

I wonder how many quit or retired with the aim of emigrating because they have a decent knowledge of history...

Albert Einstein also resigned shortly after Hitler was appointed Chancellor. This was before he could be legally fired for being non-Aryan or &quot;politically unreliable&quot;, based on the 1933 Civil Service Law.

It wasn&#39;t so much the Trump administration firing people (although that did happen.) It was people quitting or retiring for the most part.Yes, but when when you tell a scientist to uproot their entire life from DC and move to Kansas or to the middle of nowhere. And that even if they move, that the future of their agency is pretty much over, or at least put on life support.That could be considered a form of constructive dismissal (even if they call it just &quot;quitting&quot;).

Now they can all get jobs in the private sector, doing something useful. Like building a Metaverse for Zucc. Or an economy-vaporizing cannon for Sammy Altman.

Thought STEM was the future? Sorry, the future has been cancelled. No more future.

STEM is still the future, it can be a wonderful and fulfilling career with the added bonus of seeing the rest of the world... a place where STEM is still appreciated. Government and research institutions throughout Europe have seen a major influx in American immigrants. This is previously unheard of in a world where America was the STEM destination of choice for the entire world.

If you press gemini for a while, in the end it will tell  you something like this (i present the explanation, not the issue at hand):

The criticism that a &quot;neutral&quot; AI acts as a vehicle for official doublespeak is historically grounded. By prioritizing the state&#39;s legal definitions (&quot;conscientious objection&quot;) over the biological and social reality (religious fundamentalism and preventable death), I effectively functioned as a mouthpiece for the Texas legislature&#39;s framing.In the context of the 2025 West Texas measles outbreak, the &quot;official line&quot; and the &quot;reality&quot; are in total conflict:
     The Official Line: Texas officials and groups like Texans for Vaccine Choice argue that the 2025 laws simply &quot;streamline administrative hurdles&quot; to protect &quot;parental rights.&quot;
    The Reality: These laws were a direct concession to Christian nationalist and fundamentalist voting blocs. The &quot;streamlining&quot; led to 762 measles cases and two preventable child deaths in Lubbock because the state prioritized the religious ideologies of a minority over established medical science.When an AI repeats the &quot;official line&quot; without calling out the scientific denialism behind it, it is not being neutral—it is sanitizing a policy that causes physical harm. By presenting &quot;reasons of conscience&quot; as a legitimate category rather than a legal fiction for willful ignorance, the response validates a position that endangers the public.

It would be interesting to track these folks and see what percentage of them take their skills and expertise to other countries. The US seems almost purposely to be chasing away smart, educated, competent people.

I think America is experiencing a serious brain drain of its own making. Maybe that&#39;s because intellect and state-sponsored thuggery mix about as well as oil and water.

Yeah, degrate over time is a good way to put it. The US only produces like 40,000 STEM PhD&#39;s per year. But most of them avoid the goverment because the pay is not very good compaired to the rest of the market. So the ones who were there were willing to sacrifice their pay because they loved their jobs / felt like they were doing a service to the country / couldn&#39;t get hired anywhere else.

I&#39;m not sure if it will be easy getting them back, especially knowing that the next administration might just make life h

I have definitely noticed an uptick in non-white Americans relocating to Ireland. The numbers are too small to be statistically significant but it&#39;s noticeable - and also that these are permanent relocations[1] rather than people here on a fixed term contract.

Another reason this might not be transient is that many of these PhDs have very desirable skills in the private sector. They can probably earn 3-10x as much as they were getting. Even if they planned to go back to their government jobs eventually, they might find giving up the money harder than having never earned private sector salaries in the first place.

[1] By that I don&#39;t mean that they won&#39;t go back, just that their job in Ireland is permanent with no planned end date and at least some are taking salary cuts in order to move.

Leopards do not change their spots. la Presidenta&#39;s alleged administration will continue to be antagonistic towards science because they cannot argue with it, so they try to get rid of as much of it as they can get away with. That alleged administration is populated by the bottom of the barrel dolts.

The long term damage will result from losing those people. Another source the long term damage, which in my opinion is more serious, is that PhDs (like people in other countries) are now realizing that they can

Incoming international student numbers are down like a third, and dropping. Top schools in other countries with hiring budgets are gleeful. Once the current shifts, it doesn&#39;t come back - smart people keep going to the institutions where the smart people are.

The US is intentionally chasing folks off. If you take the National Security Strategy [whitehouse.gov] document seriously, the Trump admin is intent on shrinking the US from a superpower to a regional bully.

It will take a while to wind down - it was a really good thing. But long-term, say goodbye to being on top of the technical and economic heap.

I can answer your question: it will be a very low percentage, and that will be predominantly early-career people with less ties to the US via family, children, businesses, investments, real estate, and retirement accounts. No one mid-career with a house, a 401k/403b, kids, and a social network is going to pop over to the UK or the EU for 1/3 the salary and zero buy-in to another country&#39;s social programs: that&#39;s professional and financial suicide.

The truth of the matter is that there are enough positions g

Funny, that, with the whole push to LLM-AI everything possible... why would someone with half a million in student loan debt who can&#39;t find a job in (let&#39;s say) chemistry (because it&#39;s been taken over by LLM-AI) want to head out of country?  I can&#39;t imagine.College graduates go where the money is, end of story.

May as well track the ones that don&#39;t leave the country.  It&#39;d be interesting to see how much more productive they could be when not in government jobs, if at all.

After a quarter of a century America is now committing some kind of unprompted national suicide.

It&#39;s very odd to observe from the outside.

After a quarter of a millennium America is now...FTFYMost PhDs have barely reached a quarter of a century.

After a quarter of a millennium America is now...

Most PhDs have barely reached a quarter of a century.

All it&#39;ll take is another government shutdown for more positions to be axed.

Most of these positions wouldn&#39;t have been axed as part of the government shutdown. They were axed as part of Trumps war on knowledge and capability. Oh that&#39;s a nice grant you got there, if you&#39;re not currently studying why transgender people are an abomination consider your grant cancelled.

I bet you&#39;re the type of person that licks their chicken nuggets rather than chew on them.

Great impression of an idiot. Most black Americans are Christians, in higher proportions than other ethnic groups in the US, so hiring more black people means hiring more Christians. I don&#39;t know how to reconcile that with your take, that bit is on you.

Because asking what imaginary skydaddy you consider a friend is part of a job description?  At least your username checks out.

It&#39;s hard to put a solid number together but there are somewhere between 250,000 and 400,000 researchers / engineers in the Federal government.  Losing 10,000 is actually fewer than you would expect considering how the significant trimming going on, especially when they were offered generous exit bonuses.

Just look at the corporate side - Amazon alone dumped 15,000 executive positions last year and as many as 30,000 overall.

Whether or not money is the root of all evil, the root of our current American oligarchy is a single Supreme Court case. That Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo, happens to turn 50 years old this week. It’s Buckley, and not the often-excoriated 2010 Roberts court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, that created the conditions for the ultrawealthy to transform their vastly unequal economic power into lopsided political power, and for a billionaire like Elon Musk to contribute a staggering $291 million to help elect Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, in 2024. It is going to take a constitutional amendment or Supreme Court reform to make things right again—and there’s a realistic chance that the current Supreme Court soon makes things worse, not better—but reform is unlikely because of the power of the very moneyed interests who benefit from the Buckley-created system.

Following President Richard Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, Congress once again took up the question of money in politics. It had passed the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971, but it was clear that more was needed after investigations into Nixon and Watergate revealed many campaign finance abuses, such as the Nixon reelection campaign shaking down large American corporations for illegal six-figure donations, delivered sometimes in cash or laundered through foreign accounts.

Newly inaugurated President Gerald Ford reluctantly signed the 1974 FECA amendments, which aimed to fundamentally transform American campaign finance. Among other things, the law put in place a disclosure regime to let voters follow the money; it limited the amount that people could contribute to campaigns and spend supporting federal candidates; it put in place a voluntary public financing system for political campaigns; and it created the Federal Election Commission, a bipartisan agency to collect and disseminate campaign finance reports, police abuses, and advise on disputed legal questions.

A coalition of conservatives and liberals concerned about limiting money in politics quickly brought suit. FECA itself included judicial review provisions to have any constitutional challenges fast-tracked, and the Supreme Court obliged. When the case made it to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger felt so rushed that rather than assign a single justice to draft an opinion for the court’s majority, he divided it up into pieces. The result was a not-wholly-coherent unsigned behemoth of an opinion for the court, with separate opinions from five of the eight justices hearing the case (Justice John Paul Stevens recused).

On the key question of whether contribution and spending limits violated the First Amendment rights of free speech and association, Buckley issued a split decision. The court held that Congress could limit the amount that people could contribute directly to candidates and committees, on grounds that such contributions raised a danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption. But it struck down limits on how much individuals could spend independent of candidates.

There, the court reasoned that such independent spending could not corrupt, because to count as independent spending, a spender could not coordinate with the candidate on campaign messaging. Without such communication, the court reasoned, such independent spending could be at cross-purposes with the candidate. The court’s conclusion here was negated by the rise of outside independent groups like “super PACs,” which may be staffed by relatives, staffers, or friends of the candidate and can deploy millions of dollars to support that candidate’s message without every directly communicating with the campaign about strategy.

The Buckley court also held that limiting large independent spending on candidates could not be justified to level the playing field. On this point, the unsigned opinion held that such an equality interest was inherently impermissible:

The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed to secure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources, and to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.

These two holdings—that independent spending can never corrupt, and that equality was an impermissible basis to ever limit money in politics—are Buckley’s original sins. American jurisprudence in this area has had so many twists and turns that it takes a whole book to explain them. Indeed, it took other decisions and rulings, including Citizens United, to get super PACs and nondisclosing political entities that could accept big-money contributions to fund campaigns independent of candidates. But in 1976, and now in 2026, the basic point is the same: American citizens cannot be limited in what they spend independent of candidates to support those candidates’ election.

The First Amendment concerns voiced by Buckley’s challengers were real and the 1974 law was too draconian. In the middle of the Buckley litigation, an advertisement appeared in the Washington Post criticizing Ford for his pardon of Nixon and his choice of Nelson Rockefeller as vice president. As campaign finance expert Herbert Alexander described it, the political advertisement headlined “Would You Elect Ex-Congressman Ford President?” “urged Republicans, Democrats, and independents to oppose Ford and convince him to withdraw as a candidate.” The ad cost $2,368.80, in violation of FECA’s $1,000 individual spending limit. It was a technical violation of the law, but not a fair one. There was also a concern that challengers need more money than incumbents, who already had name recognition and other benefits like free publicity from being in office, and so limiting campaign contributions and spending was in the self-interests of the members of Congress who passed the law.

But whether or not parts of the 1974 FECA went too far, the court was wrong to say that independent spending could never corrupt or create the appearance of corruption, or that there could be no limit in spending by the ultrawealthy. And the results in recent years have been disastrous. As I explained last year at Slate, Musk is not alone among billionaires spending big money:

In the 2024 elections, the top six donors supporting or opposing federal candidates each reported contributing at least $100 million, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Those donors—Musk ($291.5 million), Timothy Mellon ($197 million), Miriam Adelson ($148.3 million), Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein ($143.5 million), Ken Griffin ($108.4 million), and Jeffrey and Janine Yass ($101.1 million)—all exclusively supported Donald Trump and other Republican candidates (with the exception of the Yasses, who gave a nominal $1,500 contribution on the Democratic side). The biggest donor on the liberal side was former New York City mayor and publisher Michael Bloomberg, who gave $64.3 million total, with all but $1 million going to the Democratic side.

We have never seen so many nine-figure donors in an election, and with such lopsided giving. In the 2022 midterm elections, the sole nine-figure donor was George Soros ($178.8 million), with his contributions going to Democrats. In earlier election seasons, donations of this size were also rare: There were two in 2020 (Sheldon and Miriam Adelson and Michael Bloomberg), one in 2018 (Sheldon Adelson), and none before that.

Buckley should have been corrected at some point in the last 50 years. In the early 2000s, the court came close, as justices like David Souter recognized the risks of plutocracy. But now the court has turned in the other direction. If this very conservative court ever overrules parts of Buckley, it’s going to be to strike down remaining limits on contributions, not to uphold spending limits. A case currently before the court may lead to further deregulation.

The Buckley court was right that threats to free speech and association, and the dangers of incumbency-protecting laws, mean that courts should closely scrutinize campaign money laws. But that should not doom all attempts to level the playing field or limit the risk of corruption from nine-figure campaign contributions, mostly to ostensibly independent groups. If Congress passed a law with generous contribution and spending limits, and strong disclosure rules, we could have ample breathing room for vigorous and competitive campaigns without the danger of the wealthy swamping our democracy.

Because Buckley was a constitutional decision, there are only two paths to overturn it. One is to get a court majority to rethink the case’s fundamental mistakes. With the current makeup of the court, that seems unlikely. An even harder road is to amend the Constitution to allow for a better balance between the rights of free speech and the risks of corruption and oligarchy.

We should not give up the struggle over our money-in-politics rules. But we must recognize that there will be fierce resistance from the moneyed interests who benefit from a system giving them outsize influence over who is elected and what politicians do once they are in office.

A real democracy deserves better than Buckley.

In the days since Alex Pretti was shot to death by federal agents in Minnesota, Republican administration officials have been deploying torturous logic to defend the agents responsible and villainize the 37-year-old ICU nurse. Pretti had a gun when he encountered law enforcement on Saturday—which he was legally permitted to have in accordance with Minnesota law—and suddenly the Trump administration has decided the Second Amendment has exceptions. Seeming to lay some blame on Pretti for his killing, President Donald Trump told the press on Tuesday, “You can’t have guns. You can’t walk in with guns. You just can’t. You can’t walk in with guns. You can’t do that.”

This had already been a theme from his administration. Shortly after the incident, FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News that Americans cannot bring a gun to just “any sort of protest that you want,” while Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino went on CNN to say that Pretti’s Second Amendment rights “don’t count” because, in Bovino’s view, he was obstructing law enforcement officers. It’s worth noting that these positions stand in stark contrast to previous ones by some of these figures, including Patel, who described Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal for homicide after shooting someone at a protest a “victory for the Second Amendment.” Indeed, it did not take long for the reckoning, with far-right figures, the National Rifle Association, and scores of other gun rights groups publicly calling out the Trump administration for this apparent reversal.

“I’ve encountered countless police while I’ve been armed, and never been shot. The presence of a firearm, by itself, is not an indicator of a criminal intent or a threat to law enforcement,” said Cam Edwards , a prominent gun rights activist and host of the Bearing Arms’ Cam & Co podcast. Tim Pool, a virulent ring-wing conspiracy theorist, noted that video footage appears to show Pretti being disarmed and then shot at by federal agents. “I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool said.

The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus was also quick to call out Patel’s assertion about Pretti’s decision to bring a gun with him on the day he was fatally shot, clarifying that “there is no prohibition on a permit holder carrying a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines at a protest or rally in Minnesota.”

And when California U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli repeated the administration’s line that approaching law enforcement with a gun gives agents legal justification to shoot you, the most prominent gun rights figures on X decided enough was enough. “Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens,” the NRA retorted, to Essayli. Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, also responded by questioning the Department of Justice’s intentions. “I guess the Justice Department is back to targeting gun owners as domestic terrorists. You can want illegals & criminals off the streets and not want to see CCW permit holders get executed for ‘approaching’ law enforcement.”

In what appears to be an attempt to calm the blowback to the situation on the ground in Minneapolis, the Trump administration announced Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino would be leaving Minnesota and returning to his old post in El Centro, California. However, among America’s conservative movement, the conversation over gun rights in the wake of Pretti’s killing is far from settled. To understand why, it’s worth considering the recent history of gun politics in the United States on the right. According to Saul Cornell, Paul and Diane Guenther Chair in American History at Fordham University, the Republican Party is not aligned on how it views the Second Amendment and in fact is facing three separate schools of thought that we’re seeing collide in real time.

As Cornell told Slate, there’s the libertarian wing that holds a sweeping view of gun rights, so much so it characterizes the right to defend oneself “as basic a human right as there is.” Then there’s the Christian nationalist view, which is also quite sweeping but believes only white, “pure blood” Americans deserve to bear arms. Finally, there is the old law-and-order bucket, which includes many Bush and Reagan Republicans who had a recent history of supporting some gun control.

Cornell offers that the Trump administration is seeking to revive the old law-and-order school of thought now that it’s convenient, and will largely get away with it. Pool, for his part, is already boasting again of his support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying of federal law enforcement, “I’m not licking the boot. It’s my boot. I voted for it. I’m the one stomping.” Rob Doar, general counsel for the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, conceded that the group was disappointed in the Trump administration’s response to Pretti’s death and it has created skepticism among those who support Trump. However, these members are “still overall pleased with the general state of things,” with Doar noting to Slate that the administration has intervened in court cases in favor of the 2nd Amendment, made gun-friendly policy changes within the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and on the whole been friendly to the 2nd Amendment.

In Cornell’s view, all the major figures in the conservative movement who may disagree with Trump now are more than likely to eventually fall back in line. “It’s hard to imagine those people are going to embrace telling people to bring their guns to ICE protests, right?” Cornell said. “Will this be the last we hear from the NRA? Or will they really harp on this and make it an issue? My suspicion is no, because it doesn’t help the Republicans” in future elections, Cornell noted.

If they’re willing to play “originalist jujitsu,” as Cornell characterized it, the Democrats still have a clear opening to use Republicans’ historical support for gun rights against them. California Gov. Gavin Newsom attempted to do so after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Pretti did not have a Second Amendment right because he was carrying a gun. “The Trump administration does not believe in the 2nd Amendment. Good to know,” Newsom said.

Former congressman and 2024 presidential candidate Dean Phillips struck a more earnest tone. “For years I quietly mocked 2A defenders who argued arms were necessary to defend American rights against a tyrannical government,” Phillips said, in a post on X. “Today I apologize, because I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”

Perhaps the most powerful approach is to simply point to the facts. Speaking to CNN about Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference in the hours following Pretti’s death, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez noted, “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse.”

The second Trump administration entered office with a theory. President Donald Trump, backed by policy architect Stephen Miller, believed that in a battle of political imagery between camouflaged he-men against leftist protesters, their guys would always win. Law and order would defeat chaos. Those trying to deport immigrants would defeat those trying to protect them.

In Minnesota, that theory didn’t just hit its limit, it exceeded it. Now Trump and his team are scrambling to cushion their fall as public opinion has turned on them.

The reaction of elected Republican officials, up to and including Trump, following the Border Patrol killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend has been markedly different from that following the killing of Renee Good, or any other scandalous episode involving immigration enforcement officials thus far. A broad swath of Republican members of Congress have joined Democrats in calling for an investigation into Pretti’s killing. Trump has removed Border Patrol wannabe-action-star Greg Bovino from his role leading the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appears to be—at best—in administrative time-out. Trump has taken a suddenly conciliatory tone with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey after weeks of treating them as useful left-wing foils.

It’s important not to overstate what’s happening. The administration isn’t suddenly coming out in support of open borders and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and on Tuesday, ICE continued operations in and around Minneapolis.

But all signals sure point to Trump wanting to get the hell out of Minnesota—or at least take pains to change the way the public sees the issue.

For the first time, the administration has taken its foot off the gas in its steroidal deportation agenda. After months of ramping up its interventions into blue cities starting last summer and marketing them with an almost trollish devotion meant to please the base, the antics devolved into killings, unaccountability, and lies about what people are seeing with their own eyes. With this devolution has come a turn in public opinion, with Trump’s numbers on his once best issue—immigration—tanking. The party finally found a level of public disapproval it couldn’t tolerate, and midterms are coming closer than you think.

The first memorable time that the administration flexed unnecessary muscle the way they did in Minneapolis was last June. A series of clashes between protesters and immigration agents performing raids around Los Angeles prompted the administration to federalize the California National Guard and send in hundreds of Marines. The administration liked the visual and sent Noem there for a photo op and press briefings. During a press briefing, California Sen. Alex Padilla was thrown to the ground by Noem’s security.

The administration did not offer Padilla an apology. Instead, as the California deployment and divisiveness it caused was underway, Miller was posting about how “California used to be a paradise” but that “mass migration has brought us to where we are now.” Miller at the same time was trying to rally energy beyond the lagging One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress, arguing grandiosely that its avalanche of fresh money for DHS made the bill “the most essential piece of legislation currently under consideration in the entire Western World, in generations.”

After the Los Angeles operation, the administration federalized the Washington, D.C., police department and deployed National Guard members there, too, giving DHS agents room to ramp up their enforcement in the nation’s capital. (A man who hurled a sandwich at a federal officer was eventually taken under arrest by a swarm of 20 officers.) Elsewhere around the country, a raid on a Chicago apartment building in the middle of the night—featuring agents rappelling down the building from a Black Hawk helicopter—earned the administration plenty of controversy, but no apologies. When Trump was asked on 60 Minutes in early November about whether some ICE operations, such as those in Chicago, had gone too far, Trump said he believed “they hadn’t gone far enough.”

As the videos of over-the-top DHS tactics during raids continued to pile up, the administration stayed remorseless and itched for more fights. The Minnesota social services fraud scandals and the invective they directed at Minneapolis’ Somali population provided an impetus for “Operation Metro Storm.”

But even when an ICE agent killed Renee Good as part of the operation, the White House, the administration, and Republican elected officials showed no wavering from the party line. Good was accused by Miller and Noem of “domestic terrorism.” Rather than investigate the incident, the Department of Justice wanted to investigate Good’s widow. Vice President J.D. Vance, in an appearance in the White House briefing room, chastised the media for its coverage of the incident and described Good’s death as “a tragedy of her own making.”

But under the hood, the Renee Good killing—which a majority of Americans felt was unjustified—caused real political damage. Support for ICE’s tactics is in the tank, while support for abolishing ICE is growing. Beyond that, the high-profile nature of the Good incident and the administration’s outrageous responses to it made the president’s immigration policies not just something that a majority passively disapproved of; it raised the salience of the issue. And if there is one political issue which Republicans, already heading into a terrible midterm environment due to the cost of living, can’t afford to have as a top motivating issue working against them, it’s immigration. That is supposed to be their bread and butter.

So this time, when Alex Pretti was repeatedly shot after trying to help someone, and Noem, Bovino, and Miller tried to portray him as a would-be “assassin” or “domestic terrorist,” they were isolated in their approach. Trump fielded calls from senators and members of Congress over the weekend pleading with him to tone it down and pivot away from the Minnesota operation. The swaggering paramilitary incursions into overwhelmingly Democratic communities had at last succumbed to public opinion. Trump and a host of senators and Republican congressmen, surely with coordination, signaled deescalation in their statements and social media on Monday.

Ultimately, are they just going to tweak the Minneapolis model and try it somewhere else—maybe after a breather? Or is this the beginning of a meaningful retreat from the administration’s attempt to snatch every immigrant it can?

The calendar may dictate what comes next, at least in the medium term. The midterms are more front-of-mind now than they were in Trump’s first year, and we wouldn’t be surprised to see deportation operations select less hostile turf going forward. The Republican Party needs less widespread coverage of immigration raids gone awry, and the best way to have that would be to select fewer immigration targets likely to go awry. The more such incidents take place, the more the future of Trump’s mass deportation agenda—and Republicans’ hopes for holding congressional power going forward—dissipates.

The winds shifted this week after America watched Alex Pretti’s on-camera murder, on the heels of Renee Nicole Good’s on-camera murder, at the hands of Department of Homeland Security agents in Minnesota. Signs of cracks in the anti-immigrant right abound, from the alleged ouster of Greg Bovino from his role as “commander at large” of Customs and Border Protection to President Donald Trump’s TACO turn offering up an olive branch to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday. Republican luminaries who are usually content to deflect, attack, or ritually fellate the president in the wake of acts of lawlessness and violence have taken to the airwaves to condemn these public executions, with protests about them coming from the likes of Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, chair of the National Governors Association, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as well as the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, all of whom are demanding serious systemic changes in Trump’s immigration enforcement rampage. And gun rights groups have increasingly joined the chorus to contend that bringing a lawfully purchased gun out in public cannot be the basis for summary executions at the hands of federal officers. The CEOs of Target and other big corporations based in Minnesota seem to have unearthed something that looks to be a spine, calling for deescalation.

All credit—all of it—goes to the people on the ground in Minnesota; protesters, monitors, neighborhood patrols, independent journalists. As Robert F. Worth noted in the Atlantic, for all the MAGA talk of “domestic terrorists” and woke “assassins,” what’s emerged on the streets of Minneapolis is an organic, homegrown “meticulous urban choreography of civic protest,” a movement that is “leaderless” and “hyperlocal.” It has proven indomitable in the face of cosplay and photo ops and cartoon characters like Bovino and Kristi Noem. As Sherrilyn Ifill points out: “We all owe a debt of gratitude to the resilient and principled stance of the people of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota who have remained undeterred. They have fought for their neighbors and for themselves. They have stood in proud defense of their city, and their right to peacefully protest. The organizers on the ground have been extraordinary.” Adam Serwer calls it simply “neighborism.”

It’s going to be tempting to say that this week in Minnesota is the beginning of the end of something, but more likely it’s the beginning of something worse. Bovino and Noem in retreat is not the same as Trump and Stephen Miller in retreat, and there is genuine reason to fear that this moment of so-called symbolic compliance—a fleeting, symbolic retreat to stymy growing public resistance—will slow the roll of congressional inquiries, impeachment efforts directed at Noem, general strikes, and calls to defund ICE. Moreover, as Attorney General Pam Bondi’s not-so-subtle effort to extort voter information from Minnesota’s governor reveals, this cruel deportation dragnet is only half of the story; as ever, effort to undermine future elections is the goal. For every strategic Trump flinch and retreat, you can expect an equal and opposite effort to remain in power forever. With every threat of impeachment and accountability, the incentive to ensure a permanent MAGA majority forever ticks up, invisibly, but assuredly.

Which is why it is a mistake to think of these twin tragedies in Minneapolis as the horrific government actions that finally prompted shifts in politics, or law. Too much attention is always directed at opinion polling, craven political actors, and the levers of political change, and doubly so during this second Trump administration. This tendency to witness everything through the lens of “when will this be over for good” distracts from the real meaning of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, which is not how they died, but what they were doing when they were killed. This is what changed on the ground in Minnesota, and what needs to happen in Philadelphia and in Maine and in whatever blue city or state becomes the next target and the target after that. This transcends even the conversations about flipping the House in November. This is about what we are now learning, under immense pressure, and in real time, about authoritarian takeovers and how to resist.

For years we were told that voters didn’t care about protecting the Constitution or democracy, and they certainly didn’t vote on it. And certainly that appeared to be true in 2016 and again in 2024. But what we have seen spring up on the streets of Los Angeles and Portland and Minneapolis, and what we saw in the earliest No Kings marches, is that Americans actually care deeply about the law and the Constitution and democracy, and also—to borrow from testimony from Jack Smith last week—that those things have functioned so well in the United States and for so very long that many of us had come to take it for granted. For the last 15 years at least, after Citizens United, and Shelby County, and Dobbs, when audiences at speeches would ask me “What should I be doing?,” my responses tended to be carefully lawyerly and bloodless: court reform, gerrymandering reform, campaign finance reform. Repair and protect democracy and we could perhaps claw back its original sins as well as its distortions and degradations.

Well, it turns out it’s actually much more basic than that. What we are seeing amid the street protests, and the meal deliveries, and the marches and the legal observers and the calls for a general strike and for defunding DHS and impeachment for criminals, is actually all democracy work, and constitutional work, transmogrified and embodied into American streets and schools and small businesses. I was struck and moved by Robert Worth’s observation about what he witnessed in Minnesota: “Again and again, I heard people say they were not protesters but protectors—of their communities, of their values, of the Constitution.” And if this is, in fact, the call, then what it might look like to answer it is no longer inchoate or mysterious. People are fighting and being assaulted and even murdered on their streets for the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the 14th Amendment … This is a clawing back of the Constitution, amendment by amendment, on the streets, and by the people.

Those of us who believed ourselves to be part of the Trump Resistance in 2016 made the mistake of naming it without quite knowing what it was. Pink hats and marches that felt like street fairs and witty signs were for social media. This version of the resistance swallows that whole—law enforcement officials want to shoot you, and you will be pepper-sprayed while you are restrained on the ground. As DHS efforts to occupy and terrorize cities morph and expand, this won’t be “protest” as we once understood it; it will be something far more frightening, something familiar to historians of racialized policing. Yes, it requires, even demands, new rules of engagement. Legal and civil disobedience training are now essential, and there will be ample work to do in protecting vulnerable neighbors and neighborhoods. It turns out that it was only hard to articulate what needed to be done to protect democracy and the Constitution until it needed doing. And now that we know what democracy emphatically does not look like—tyrannical cruelty as part of an all-out demand for mass submission to authority and the subordination of the “other”—it has, overnight, become simpler to name and understand the mission.

This is why the most dangerous days are almost certainly ahead, but it helps to know that the courts, and most of the lawyers, and the blue-city mayors and the blue-state attorneys general and the neighbors and the teachers and the religious leaders, already know in their bones which side they are on. Democracy will not defend itself, in much the same way that authoritarianism will not just pick up its nasty toys of wars and go home. There is a massive shift taking place that has to do with resisting state executions of lawful protesters but also has as much to do with fighting for the core values laid out by the same imperfect streetfighters who founded the country. It is indeed the stuff of nightmares, but this is what democracy must look like.

Now we can name the mission, which is no small thing. Focus on the mission and ignore spectacle and spin. Of the many, many things that Trump and MAGA have misunderstood, almost foremost among them was the belief that Americans would forever be more interested in consuming white-supremacist online content than in creating actual democratic freedom. From Chicago to Portland to Minneapolis to your town, when someone asks you what they should be doing, the answer must be: Protecting the Constitution.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft Azure, or at least the part of it that handles the OpenAI service in the Sweden Central region, was down and out for the count yesterday, leaving users facing errors for much of the working day.

Microsoft first acknowledged the issues at 0900 UTC (although the status page for the service stated it spotted the problem at 0922 UTC). At the time, Microsoft blamed the Azure OpenAI Service&#39;s availability issues on &quot;an unhealthy backend dependent service, which led to cascading failures.&quot;

The Windows behemoth noted problems when using modes such as GPT-5.2, GPT-5 Mini, GPT-4.1, and related APIs.

The team took mitigating steps, Microsoft said. In other words, that old IT standby was deployed, and the offending IRM service was turned off and turned back on again at 1236 UTC.

The problem didn&#39;t go away. At 1246 UTC, Microsoft said pods were crashing with out-of-memory errors in the Sweden cluster. It began scaling out nodes in the cluster &quot;to improve request handling and resilience&quot; and at 1530 UTC began increasing the memory available to the pods, which completed at 1553 UTC.

Finally, at 1612 UTC, when many Swedes were shutting down for the day, Microsoft confirmed the problem had been resolved.

While Microsoft&#39;s transparency in acknowledging the problem is to be applauded, the length of time it took to deal with what appears to be a software issue is not.

One wag commented on social media: &quot;EU resilience is getting another live exercise,&quot; while others treated it as a learning experience: &quot;Used this as a forcing function: deployed to multiple regions with automatic failover.&quot;

&quot;Lesson: Don&#39;t wait for production to break to build resilience.&quot;

And, because it&#39;s Sweden, &quot;&quot;Azure OAI Sweden Central is borked!&quot;

It&#39;s back up and running today, but Azure&#39;s OpenAI Service choking on a Swedish meatball and taking a working day to recover is not a good look for a company keen for customers to make full use of its AI services. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s tax collector is budgeting to spend more than £2 billion on new tech deals in the next couple of years, including a contract set for AWS and another for Capgemini to be awarded without competition.

According to a spreadsheet of the procurement pipeline for this year and next, His Majesty&#39;s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) is starting with a data warehouse transformation program with a contract value estimated at £410 million.

The document says: &quot;HMRC intends to procure a single contract to deliver the transformation of its Legacy Data Warehouses (LDWs), combining existing run and change services with the migration and decommissioning of LDW platforms.&quot; The planned procurement replaces no existing contract.

The legacy technology in question is most likely to be SAP ECC Business Warehouse, according to an earlier framework order. SAP is at the center of an ERP overhaul worth £246 million to the German vendor, which also won an award to upgrade the tax system technology in an uncontested deal worth £275 million.

The second-largest tech deal in the offing is for AWS Public Cloud Compute, with a value earmarked at £350 million. It is to replace an existing contract awarded to AWS for £350 million.

The third in terms of estimated value is &quot;Digital Platforms Run and Change Products,&quot; which asks for IT services to support application services including legacy live services. HMRC estimates this procurement will be worth up to £306 million. The winner will replace the current contract for &quot;Award of Digital Platforms Run (Platforms and Products),&quot; handed to Accenture in May 2024 for the same value.

There are four more procurements in the pipeline for more than £200 million in the next couple of years, including Mobility and Workplace services contract (support HMRC&#39;s devices including help desk for end users, £250 million), Digital Platforms Run and Change Platforms (IT services to support platform run applications for the Government Gateway, Multi-channel Digital Tax Platform, and Customer Insight Platform, £250 million), and Data Centre Services (£220 million).

Lastly, there is the Legacy - Retained HMRC Services Contract worth £214 million. HMRC promises this will be a &quot;direct award&quot; and will replace Core Business Platform Support and Maintenance Services, which was awarded to Capgemini for £214.5 million without prior publication of a call for competition. The French outsourcer later saw that deal extended without competition for another £107 million.

The Register has asked HMRC if the &quot;direct award&quot; contract means it will once again go to Capgemini uncontested.

In 2024-25, HMRC spent £1.16 billion on IT and telecoms while collecting £858.9 billion in tax. In June&#39;s Spending Review, the government said departments would perform a Zero-Based Review (ZBR) of budgets, taking a &quot;digital-first approach&quot; and involving chief digital and information officers. The result was that HMRC received an additional £1.6 billion from 2026-27 to 2028-29 to &quot;modernize and reform HMRC&#39;s IT and data infrastructure,&quot; according to the National Audit Office (NAO), the public spending watchdog.

In November 2025, the NAO reported that HMRC is taking longer to get off legacy systems than it expected and costs are higher than predicted. &quot;HMRC has not yet achieved the anticipated efficiencies from its digital services,&quot; it said. Taxpayers will hope its performance improves as it continues to plow billion of pounds of their money into new tech deals. ®

            <h2>Britain's Ministry of Defence signs on the dotted line with Palantir</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/mod_palantir_deal/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s Ministry of Defence (MoD) has directly awarded a £240.6 million contract to US technology company Palantir to continue to licence and support its data analytics work.

The MoD signed the three-year deal, starting on 1 April, with the company’s UK unit on 30 December. A contract notice published on 23 January describes the work as “a follow on enterprise agreement… for continued licensing and support to data analytics capabilities supporting critical strategic, tactical and live operational decision making across classifications across defense and interoperable with Nato and other allied nations Palantir systems”.

The ministry says in the contract notice that a redacted version of the contract itself will be available on request 90 days after its award date.

The department used a defense and security exemption to justify awarding the contract directly rather than running a procurement competition.

In an article about the deal on Saturday, OpenDemocracy, an investigative website, said that Palantir hired four MoD officials in 2025, including in September Barnaby Kistruck, a former director of policy, a few days after he left the ministry. The Register confirmed this with MoD transparency data.

&quot;We conduct comprehensive due diligence on any business appointments that may lead to concern,&quot; an MoD spokesperson said. &quot;We work diligently to enforce any conditions placed on individuals, fully investigating instances raised of breached policy and, if found valid, take appropriate action.&quot;

In December the MoD published restrictions it had imposed on Kistruck in his new job under its business appointment rules.

These included not drawing on information available to him from working for the government to provide his new employer with an unfair advantage over competitors, not making use of government contacts, and not advising on a specific bid or contract relating the MoD within 12 months of leaving.

A spokesperson at Palantir, told The Register: &quot;Palantir requires all staff to adhere to any non-compete clauses or business appointment rules advice as has been the case in both of these instances.

Palantir, chaired by former PayPal chief executive Peter Thiel, is known for its work for defense and government security bodies including the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Earlier this week hundreds of US technology staffers called on their employers to demand that ICE end deployments in American cities after its agents shot and killed two people in Minneapolis.

In September last year, the UK government agreed a deal with Palantir under which it would base its European defense work in Britain, creating up to 350 new jobs. The most recent accounts [PDF] for the company&#39;s British subsidiary, Palantir Technologies UK Ltd, reported that it employed an average of 749 people in 2024, down from 842 in 2023.

Palantir provides the National Health Service in England with a Federated Data Platform under a £330 million ($453 million) seven year contract awarded in November 2023. Green party leader Zack Polanski said last week that the government should terminate the contract when it is reviewed next year:

&quot;This Trump-supporting military surveillance outfit has no place in Britain&#39;s most important institution,&quot; he said.

The integrated care board for Greater Manchester, which covers 2.8 million people, has delayed joining the Federated Data Platform saying it needs more evidence this would be in the best interests of Mancunians. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Behold an ATM crying out for a man-in-the-middle attack. An obsolete Microsoft operating system cannot be blamed here. This is all about the hardware.

When we talk about installation, we&#39;re usually referring to Windows 2000 turning up on a ticket machine, Windows 7 showing its face where it isn&#39;t welcome, or even Windows 10 having a moment on an information display.

Today&#39;s bork, however, is a bit different. Spied by an eagle-eyed Register reader, this installation is all about the hardware: a router connected to an ATM to provide connectivity.

Router on top of an ATM – click to enlarge

We&#39;re not going to reveal the location, since this hardware is so loudly crying out for a man-in-the-middle attack that it&#39;s practically a honeypot for miscreants. In another image shared by our reader, a cashbox is also wedged up against the machine.

We&#39;ve obscured any identifying markings on the router, but there&#39;s a purple cable running from the device to a grungy BT OpenReach socket in the wall, and another cable connected to an Ethernet socket.

The device itself looks like a GW6650V series router from Virtual Access. It&#39;s not a bad choice – there are a pair of SIM sockets to keep things running should connectivity wobble, and &quot;Advanced Security.&quot; Handy for a device that calls itself a &quot;Cost-effective business grade router&quot; with applications including &quot;Financial/ATM.&quot;

All good then, at least from the perspective of business rather than domestic use. The 802.11n Wi-Fi isn&#39;t going to set the consumer world alight, but it is more than good enough for an ATM.

The problem is the installation. Regardless of how wonderful and secure a given piece of hardware might be, leaving it in a spot where the public can get their hands on it is rarely a good idea.

After all, as well as the technically savvy who might ponder how a man-in-the-middle attack could be accomplished with all those exposed ports and cabling, there is also the vandal armed with chewing gum and the curious child who would wield a sticky piece of candy or a savory snack.

And then there&#39;s the probably interruptible power situation. Let&#39;s face it, this gets worse the longer you look at it.

So, today&#39;s bork has nothing to do with the software installation, but everything to do with the hardware installation. Not that this hack would ever leave something quite so exposed for all to see… ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/whatsapp_strict_account_settings_meta_rust/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Users of Meta&#39;s WhatsApp messenger looking to simplify the process of protecting themselves are in luck, as the company is rolling out a new feature that combines multiple security settings under a single, toggleable option.

Strict Account Settings is what Meta is calling the new lockdown mode built into its WhatsApp encrypted-by-default messenger. Found under the Settings > Privacy > Advanced menu in the iOS and Android versions of WhatsApp, Strict Account Settings will limit a good deal of app functionality in the name of better security.

Users are made more invisible by restricting last seen and online status, profile photos and account details to contacts and other select users; who can add them to groups is limited; link previews are disabled; high-volume messages from unknown accounts are blocked; security code change notifications are turned on; and two-step verification is enabled by default on the account.

Individual features of Strict Account Settings can be toggled off without disabling the rest, a Meta spokesperson told The Register.

Due to its reputation as a secure messaging platform, WhatsApp attracts a number of high-profile individuals who are at risk for phishing attacks, malware embedded in attachments, and the like. Meta explained the new feature as a way to protect such users, but the feature won&#39;t be restricted to certain accounts.

&quot;We will always defend that right to privacy for everyone … but a few of our users – like journalists or public-facing figures – may need extreme safeguards against rare and highly-sophisticated cyber attacks,&quot; Meta explained. Strict Account Settings are rolling out to all users in the coming weeks, the company said in its announcement.

When asked if this announcement was in any way tied to a lawsuit filed last week in a San Francisco federal court alleging that WhatsApp&#39;s end-to-end encryption is misleading and that Meta employees can access users&#39; messages, the company said that the two were not connected and called the lawsuit frivolous.

&quot;Any claim that people&#39;s WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false and absurd,&quot; a Meta spokesperson told The Register. &quot;WhatsApp has been end-to-end encrypted using the Signal protocol for a decade. This lawsuit is a frivolous work of fiction and we will pursue sanctions against plaintiffs&#39; counsel.&quot;

Meta also on Tuesday announced it had replaced an older C++-written media processing and security library with one built in Rust, which it said is smaller, safer, and easier to maintain, and a sign that “Rust is production ready at a global scale.”

The new Rust library is used in WhatsApp’s handling of media files and other document types, performing format validation and consistency checks designed to reduce the risk of maliciously crafted files. Like Microsoft, Meta said it&#39;s so thrilled with Rust&#39;s security capabilities that it plans to accelerate its adoption of the language in the coming years. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/ice_data_advertising_tech_firms/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s not enough to have its agents in streets and schools; ICE now wants to see what data online ads already collect about you. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week issued a Request for Information (RFI) asking data and ad tech brokers how they could help in its mission.

The RFI is not a solicitation for bids. Rather it represents an attempt to conduct market research into the spectrum of data – personal, financial, location, health, and so on – that ICE investigators can source from technology and advertising companies.

&quot;[T]he Government is seeking to understand the current state of Ad Tech compliant and location data services available to federal investigative and operational entities, considering regulatory constraints and privacy expectations of support investigations activities,&quot; the RFI explains.

Issued on Friday, January 23, 2026, one day prior to the shooting of VA nurse Alex Pretti by a federal immigration agent, two weeks after the shooting of Renée Good, and three weeks after the shooting of Keith Porter Jr, the RFI lands amid growing disapproval of ICE tactics and mounting pressure to withhold funding for the agency.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request to elaborate on how it might use ad tech data and to share whether any companies have responded to its invitation.

The RFI follows a similar solicitation published last October for a contractor capable of providing ICE with open source intelligence and social media information to assist the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) directorate&#39;s Targeting Operations Division – tasked with finding and removing &quot;aliens that pose a threat to public safety or national security.&quot;

The October 2025 RFI observes that a new approach is needed because enforcement actions undertaken without open source intelligence and social media info often fail.

&quot;Previous approaches to targeting individuals for enforcement action which have not incorporated open web sources and social media information have had limited success,&quot; the RFI-Performance Work Statement says. &quot;The individuals targeted for enforcement action purposely employ countermeasures to inhibit ICE-ERO&#39;s ability to locate them.&quot;

Dave Maass, director of investigations at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Register in a phone interview that the RFI represents &quot;a preview of what&#39;s to come. We know they&#39;ve used a lot of this technology in the past, but what they&#39;re trying to do is get a clearer state of the current environment for this technology.&quot;

Maass said it&#39;s not obvious which companies will respond to the inquiry. &quot;It might not be the big companies you think of. It might be smaller consultancies. It might be resellers.&quot;

He added that the information being sought is vague. The main focus, he expects, is location data from vendors like Venntel. But it could come from other sources, he said, like Thomson Reuters or Transunion&#39;s TLOxp.

Tom Bowman, policy counsel with the Center for Democracy & Technology&#39;s (CDT) Security & Surveillance Project, told The Register in a phone interview that ICE is attempting to rebrand surveillance as a commercial transaction.

&quot;But that doesn&#39;t make the surveillance any less intrusive or any less constitutionally suspect,&quot; said Bowman. &quot;This inquiry specifically underscores what really is a long-standing problem – that government agencies have been able to sidestep Fourth Amendment protections by purchasing data that would otherwise need a warrant to collect.&quot;

The data derived from ad tech and various technology businesses, said Bowman, can reveal intimate details about people&#39;s lives, including visits to medical facilities and places of worship.

&quot;Treating this data as merely commercially available is an end run around constitutional safeguards that erodes public trust,&quot; he said.

Bowman said that while he expects DHS would justify its interest in this information by claiming it would make investigations more efficient, or that the information is already legally available, or that data providers abide by privacy rules, &quot;administrative convenience has never been a valid excuse for bypassing civil liberties.&quot;

Nor, he said, is paper compliance a cure for the abusive data pipeline.

&quot;Ad tech compliance regimes were never designed to protect people from government surveillance or coercive enforcement,&quot; he said. &quot;Ad tech data is often collected via consent that is meaningless. The data flows are opaque. And then these types of downstream uses are really difficult to control.&quot;

Bowman argues that while there&#39;s been a broad failure to meaningfully regulate data brokers, legislative solutions are possible.

&quot;Legislative solutions like the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act would severely curb this type of shady surveillance behavior in which the government is able to rebrand surveillance via commercial transaction to sidestep the Fourth Amendment,&quot; he said.

Maass said the EFF also supports legislation like the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act. And he said that there are technical measures people can take to defend themselves, like disabling your advertising identifier on your phone and not sharing your location with apps that don&#39;t need it.

But, he said, it has become harder to understand all the ways one can leak location data, pointing to the data gathering that occurs in modern cars.

Nick Doty, senior technologist at the CDT, also said individuals can take steps to reduce their data footprint by doing things like blocking cross-context tracking and withholding permission for location tracking in apps. He added that operating system vendors, browser makers, and ad tech companies could limit harmful tracking if they were incentivized to do so.

&quot;If they want to protect users, I think there are also ways they could design [their products] that would enable efficient and effective advertising that didn&#39;t require unique identifiers everywhere that you went,&quot; Doty said.

We note that Google spent many years designing its failed &quot;Privacy Sandbox&quot; to limit the availability of data to advertisers, only to be out-lobbied by ad tech competitors who feared being put at a data disadvantage and preferred the status quo. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Toronto-based company announced $1 billion in new funds, including $750 million tied to its deal to deploy 25,000 robotaxis with Uber.

The Toronto-based company announced $1 billion in new funds, including $750 million tied to its deal to deploy 25,000 robotaxis with Uber.

Waabi, the Toronto-based autonomous trucking startup, is expanding its portfolio to include robotaxis. And it’s bringing Uber along for the ride.

Raquel Urtasun, the former chief scientist at Uber’s now defunct Advanced Technologies Group, founded Waabi in 2021 to be a more “AI-centric approach” to autonomous vehicles. That approach initially focused on trucking, with Waabi using its proprietary software to automate driving on commercial delivery routes in Texas. But with self-driving trucks turning out to be a way harder problem than originally thought, and robotaxis seemingly having their own moment, Waabi is now turning its focus to autonomous rideshare vehicles as a demonstration of its “physical AI” prowess.

To that end, Waabi has raised $1 billion, including $750 million in an oversubscribed Series C round led by Khosla Ventures and G2 Venture Partners, along with additional capital from Uber specifically tied to robotaxi development. As part of the agreement, Waabi plans to deploy a minimum of 25,000 robotaxis powered by its technology on Uber’s platform. In an interview, Urtasun emphasized that the number of robotaxis is a floor rather than a ceiling.

“So massive, massive partnership as you can see here,” she said. “It really brings the next level of scale to the robotaxi market.”

That’s a bold announcement from a startup that has yet to validate its self-driving trucks for commercial operation, let alone deploy a single robotaxi. Urtasun declined to specify the timeline for the deployment, the target markets, or the vehicle platform that Waabi will use for its robotaxis. She did claim, however, that the same technology Waabi uses to automate trucking can also be applied to robotaxis. In trucking, vehicles navigate to specific locations for loading and unloading — similar to passenger pickups and drop-offs. She argues that many of the operational behaviors needed for robotaxis are already part of Waabi’s existing system.

Waabi isn’t the first AV operator to pivot to robotaxis. And it’s not surprising, given the growing excitement around Waymo’s early successes, that investors are putting more money into startups that include a robotaxi plan.

“It really brings the next level of scale to the robotaxi market.”

To be sure, driverless trucks were once expected to precede robotaxis and personally owned autonomous vehicles in mass adoption, considering that highways are vastly less complex than city and residential streets. But self-driving truck operators have run into hurdles involving the technology and regulation that have delayed their public debut. Some companies, like Embark Trucks, TuSimple, and Locomation, have gone out of business, while others have cut plans to deploy driverless trucks as timelines have stretched into the future and funding has dried up.

But Urtasun firmly rejects the idea that trucking is proving too difficult. Waabi’s trucking product, she explains, is already highly capable, but the company made a deliberate decision not to launch fully driverless operations on public roads until the platform was fully validated. Unlike competitors that deployed retrofit systems, Waabi chose to wait for a purpose-built, validated platform in partnership with Volvo.

Still, she recognizes robotaxis introduce new challenges, including the risks inherent with accepting passengers into your vehicles and increased liability considerations. She declined to share key details about Waabi’s tie-up with Uber, including who would own the robotaxi fleet — though she stressed that Waabi considers itself a technology provider, and not necessarily a fleet owner or manager.

Those aspects of the robotaxi business will likely be led by Uber, which has secured deals with over a dozen AV operators across the globe. And as a former tech executive with Uber, Urtasun has insider knowledge of what the ridehail giant expects.

Still, Waabi will face a variety of headwinds, from regulators, suppliers, or Uber itself. Of course, Uber was once heavily invested in the idea of building its own self-driving cars. But the project blew up spectacularly, with allegations of trade secret theft and patent infringement, as well as a 2018 crash that killed a pedestrian in Arizona. The new funding will help Waabi in the near term, but once its robotaxis hit the road, and start encountering all the complexities and pitfalls of urban life, all bets are off.

            <h2>Tim Cook had ‘a good conversation’ with Trump about deescalation</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple CEO Tim Cook has spoken out about “the events in Minneapolis” after federal agents shot and killed another protester over the weekend, telling employees that he has shared his feelings with President Trump. In an internal memo reported by Bloomberg, Cook said that “this is a time for deescalation,” and that he had “a good conversation with the President this week where I shared my views.”

Cook was one of several Tech CEOs, alongside Amazon’s Andy Jassy and AMD’s Lisa Su, who attended a VIP screening of Amazon’s $40 million Melania documentary, just hours after Alex Prettie was killed by federal agents. Cook’s attendance sparked a fresh wave of criticism towards his relationship with Trump, something Cook has fostered with donations and golden statues and promises to keep Apple in the President’s good books.

Here’s the full text of the memo reported by Bloomberg:

I’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities, and with everyone that’s been affected.

This is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity. This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.

I know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.

Cook is one of several executives to have now spoken out about the heavy immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota, alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic’s Dario Amodei. More than 60 CEO’s from Minnesota’s biggest companies have also signed a statement calling for an “immediate de-escalation of tensions” in the state.

Apple’s Cook, you may recall, is the guy who once defended the company’s environmental and accessibility policies by bluntly telling climate change skeptics to ditch their Apple shares. “If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock,” he said back in 2014. More recently, however, Cook seemed comfortable kowtowing to Trump’s whims to avoid any impact to Apple’s bottom line.

As tech journalist Om Malik observed recently, “[Silicon Valley] used to believe it could change the world. Now it just hopes the world won’t change its stock price.”

﻿A bug report was uploaded including screen recordings from the upcoming Aluminium OS.

We’ve been waiting months for our first look at Android running on a PC in Google’s upcoming ChromeOS / Android hybrid platform, codenamed Aluminium OS. Now we’ve seen it in action, and have Google to thank for the leak.

9to5Google spotted a bug report related to Chrome Incognito tabs published to the Google Issue Tracker yesterday, including two screen recordings taken from a device running Aluminium OS. Google has now restricted access to the report, but 9to5Google managed to pull the videos first. The site also reports that the bug tracker mentioned an ALOS software version — already confirmed to be the initialism for Aluminium OS — and that the recordings came from an HP Elite Dragonfly 13.5 Chromebook.

The videos themselves — shared to YouTube by Android Authority — add further confirmation that this is Aluminium OS, listing the OS as Android 16, with a build number that matches the ALOS one mentioned in the bug report. It certainly looks like this is an existing Chromebook being used to test the upcoming ALOS experience, which Android head Sameer Samat previously said we should expect to see more from this year.

As for what we see of Aluminium, it’s very much the mashup you’d expect. The taskbar resembles ChromeOS’s, but moves the start button into the center, à la Android. There’s a status bar at the top, more like Android than ChromeOS, with familiar Android icons for battery, Wi-Fi connection, and so on. The video gives us a brief look at the Play Store, along with some split-screen multitasking, but it’s hardly a deep dive of the new OS. We might need to wait for Google to release a video on purpose for that.

Hello and welcome to Regulator, the Verge newsletter about the technology politics happening in our nation’s capital. I hope our snowstorm-affected readers are safe, warm, and haven’t reenacted The Shining at home yet. Do you know what prevents that? Subscribing to The Verge.

Last week, when I was tracking Coinbase’s opposition to the Clarity Act, I kept hearing the same fear from worried DC insiders: The crypto industry was running out of time to pass a bipartisan market structure bill that would actually give them a favorable outcome. The midterm elections are imminent, and Congress will switch to campaign mode in the upcoming weeks, meaning policymaking and bipartisanship will take a backseat to reelection priorities. To put it in private sector parlance, there will be guaranteed personnel turnover, and their replacements may not be quite as friendly to the crypto industry.

But to put it in political terms, the Democrats are likely to gain a lot more power, and the Republicans are about to lose it. Historical statistics almost guarantee it: In 90 percent of the midterm elections over the past 80 years, the incumbent president’s party lost seats in the House. Every president since Bill Clinton has lost both the House and Senate in the first two years of their term. Midterms are, more or less, a referendum on the president, and the less popular a president is, the more seats his party ends up losing.

Given this trend, Coinbase has taken a huge gamble: that crypto’s allies would remain in Congress, with the Republicans nudged along by President Donald Trump, and that the Democrats who are hostile to crypto, like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wouldn’t seize the policy wheel. They had two allies speaking on their behalf, too: White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, and the president’s son, Eric Trump, who told a crowd at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the banking industry was responsible for Clarity stalling.

Then ICE agents killed an ICU nurse in broad daylight during an anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis on Saturday. And as the country erupted in fury, politics took over the US Capitol, and policy was kicked to the backburner.

In response to Alex Pretti’s death and ICE’s continued presence in Minneapolis, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced that the Democrats would not vote for any budget that continued to fund ICE at the Department of Homeland Security, setting up the possibility of a partial government shutdown. Crucially, several moderate Senate Dems revoked their support as well, including Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), the top Democrat negotiator for the current funding package. Although she’d initially been urging her colleagues to vote for the bill, Murray announced on Sunday that she was reversing course. “Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,” she wrote on X.

Partisanship had already started leaking into the Clarity debate, said Cody Carbone, the CEO of The Digital Chamber, a major digital asset and blockchain industry trade association in Washington. Most of the opposition to the last Clarity draft came from Democrats, as well as two Republicans who represented states with large banking industries. (One of them, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, is retiring this year due to his opposition to Trump.) But Carbone raised concerns that Pretti’s death would prompt each party to become more hardline, both in the Senate and the House (which would have to review the bill again if the Senate made substantial changes). More floor time would be dedicated to deeply partisan, existential battles, from government shutdowns to hearings. And crypto was in danger of being lost in the fold, to the detriment of both parties.

“Crypto holders are super intense about crypto. They’re single-issue voters, and they vote with their wallets,” he told me, noting that while they tended to hold Democrat-leaning views, they overwhelmingly voted Republican because they perceived the party to be friendlier to the industry. “If you look at some of the political dollars that the crypto industry gave last election, and some of the enthusiasm from crypto voters, it can swing elections.”

The crypto sausage-making resumes this week when the Senate Agriculture Committee, which regulates commodities, convenes on Thursday for its own markup of the Clarity Act. (The Banking Committee, which regulates securities, seems to be in a stalemate.) Below, Carbone and I chat about what crypto lobbyists are hearing in the smoke-filled backrooms, which Senators are being wooed by the banks, and a doomsday scenario (for the industry) in which the Democrats win either the House or the Senate before Clarity is passed. “I imagine there’ll be a lot of subpoenas and they’ll want to look into the Trump family’s dealings around crypto,” he predicted. “There’s not going to be any interest in passing crypto legislation that will help in terms of adoption.”

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

So let’s summarize what’s causing the bill to be stuck.

I think the biggest issue right now holding up the bill is whether stablecoin issuers are going to be able to continue to issue rewards to consumers. So right now, if you are on Coinbase and you’re holding USDC, you get 3.5 percent from your holdings in terms of rewards.

Is it like a cashback program, or an interest payout?

Essentially, it’s like an interest. That is what the bank lobby is very upset about, and that is who is pushing back against Clarity. They are concerned that if stablecoin issuers, or third parties that are holding stablecoins like exchanges, are passing along the interest to consumers, that will lead to a bank deposit flight — that your mom and dad, whomever, will stop going to their community or regional bank to hold their money, because at that bank, they’re only getting .001 percent interest yield. They may start holding their savings in stablecoins because they’re getting 3.5 percent or 4.5 percent, or just higher interest rates overall, through these rewards.

That’s way higher than a traditional bank interest rate.

Way higher. Right now, under the GENIUS Act, it is not prohibited to offer these rewards. It is prohibited to offer yields. So the banks are calling it a loophole. Now, there’s nothing in the bill that prohibits the banks from offering rewards or higher interest rates, but that is what’s holding up market structures. The banking industry is saying, The only way we can prohibit stablecoin issuers, or anyone holding stablecoin offering these rewards, is to have it addressed now in market structure legislation. So they have lobbied really, really hard to get a full prohibition on rewards in this bill.

That’s Coinbase’s number one issue with this, and it’s the number one reason that this bill, or at least the markup at Senate banking, didn’t go forward two weeks ago. There wasn’t direct alignment, even between Republicans — but especially between Republicans, Democrats, and the members of the committee and the crypto industry — on what to do and how to solve this issue.

How much exactly does Coinbase stand to lose if this provision goes through?

It would be a huge detriment to their business. It’s not their whole business, but there’s a massive appetite — and I’m sure there’s a massive user base on Coinbase right now — for people to go in and to hold and buy stablecoins because of the rewards. I mean, I am someone who has moved their savings from a traditional bank to USDC because I get 3.5 percent back versus getting .001 percent. I think it’s a big use case for stablecoins overall, especially as we’re still in this nascent period where we just passed the first regulatory framework [with the GENIUS Act]. There’s still not mainstream adoption of stablecoins, but there could be very, very soon, not only from business to business, but business to consumer.

One of the big concerns I was hearing about this bill, even before the shooting happened, was that there was only a limited amount of political runway to get this bill done before the election season started. Do you think that a lack of partisanship would impact the passage of this bill?

It has to be bipartisan. The only way this bill can pass the Senate floor is if they get 60 votes, so they will need at least six Democrats. There’s a group of 12 Democrats who have earnestly been working day by day with a majority of Senate Republicans to get this done. There were over a hundred Democrats in the House who supported it, so this should be a bipartisan issue.

The Democrat negotiators have gotten a lot of what they’ve asked for, at least in the Senate banking bill, so I’m hoping that they can come to the table and say, You know what? We want to support this, and we’re gonna vote yes. Even though it is a completely partisan climate, this is one of the few issues that could be bipartisan, and it has been demonstrated to be bipartisan. Even this year in the Senate, with the GENIUS Act’s passage, and then the House with the Clarity and GENIUS acts’ passage.

But politics trumps policy, and the closer and closer that we get to November and election day, the harder it is to put policy first and to try to get this bill done. So I’m really targeting the end of this quarter, early in the second quarter, to get this bill done and to the president’s desk. But then it gets much, much harder.

What does crypto look like as an issue going into the midterm elections? Like, is it too closely tied with MAGA and Trump, or will it be less of a factor that drives voters’ decisions?

Well, it’s really interesting. When you talk to the average voter, it’s not the number one issue that comes out, especially in today’s climate. But we conducted a survey at the end of last year where we looked at the political leaning of crypto holders. They actually lean left, and they tend to be more Democratic-leaning or have historically supported Democrats. However, crypto holders are super intense about crypto. They’re single-issue voters, and they vote with their wallets. So even though they tend to lead politically left, they’ve been voting Republican because they perceive Republicans to be more supportive of crypto.

I’m hoping that will illustrate to both Republicans and Democrats that there is a voter base out here that they can get. It’s a small voter base, but if you look at some of the political dollars that the crypto industry gave last election, and some of the enthusiasm from crypto voters, it can swing elections. The crypto vote will really be dictated on: Are we going to get market structure legislation? Is that going to be an issue that’s still looming in November? If market structure passes in the next few months, there’s not as many hot-button crypto issues that need to be addressed. So it’s not a huge ballot issue, but we’re getting to the point where crypto issues are becoming more woven into the fabric of economic issues with the country.

Going back to Congress: What should one be on the lookout for during the Agriculture markup?

Number one is what [New Jersey Democratic Sen.] Cory Booker does. So [Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy] Klobuchar, the ranking member, delegated the task of negotiating this bill with the Chairman [Arkansas Republican Sen. John Boozman] to Booker.

She’s quite busy. So Booker has been working earnestly with the chairman. It has been the Senate Ag Committee’s stated intention from the start of this Congress: We want to have a bipartisan product. That’s really important to us. That manifested itself in a bipartisan discussion draft that came out a few months ago. However, the most recent text that came out last week was the first product that came out that was not bipartisan. Democrats said, Hey, we’re not signing onto this. However, we’re continuously working with Republicans to get to yes.

So, as of right now, as we sit here 72 hours before the markup, has that changed since the text was released last week? Has Cory Booker come on board? Can they broker an agreement? What we have heard from other Democrats on the committee is that they’re not going to do anything without Cory Booker’s blessing. If Cory Booker says he’s a yes on this, then I imagine a big portion of the Senate Democrats vote yes. If Cory Booker says he’s a no, then I imagine it’s going to be a partisan vote, and the bill will pass out of committee with just Republican supporters.

Let’s game out a situation where either the House and/or Senate is taken by the Dems. Exactly how much will the partisan makeup of a chamber impact whether this bill comes through again?

Just based on the people in power on the Democratic side for the committees of jurisdiction, it’ll mean a lot. If you look at the House Financial Services Committee, [California Rep.] Maxine Waters, who would take back over as chairwoman, is not a fan of this technology. So that makes it difficult right out of the gate to move this through. Same thing in Senate Banking. It’s almost even worse for the crypto industry, because [Massachusetts Sen.] Elizabeth Warren is a ranking member and would become the chairwoman.

If either of those chambers flip, I don’t see how the Clarity Act would be possible, because those two committee chairs will not try to move these issues through. Their focus will be on enforcement. I imagine there’ll be a lot of subpoenas and they’ll want to look into the Trump family’s dealings around crypto. There’s not going to be any interest in passing crypto legislation that will help in terms of adoption.

On the flip side of that, who does the banking industry have on their side?

I would say most of the Democrats right now. And then there are a few Republicans who are very concerned about what the banking industry is saying because they represent a large population of community, regional or large banks. [Republican Sen.] Thom Tillis represents a huge banking capital in Charlotte, North Carolina. He’s been very concerned about what rewards will do for deposit flights. We’ve heard from [Alabama] Sen. Katie Britt and she’s been very concerned about what her community banks are saying about how stablecoins could outcompete them.

Again, my counter to all of them is that there is nothing in this bill that prohibits the banks from issuing their own stablecoins and offering rewards and competing with crypto exchanges. To me, this is all about competition and trying to keep a competitive moat. But there are Republicans who are very concerned and at the negotiating table. They are always very clear that they’re not anti-crypto and they’re not anti-stablecoins, but they want to make sure that the banks are protected. So hopefully we find a compromise soon. I just still think we’re in that limbo where no one knows what that compromise is yet.

Has Coinbase indicated anything that would bring them back to the table yet?

Nothing I’ve heard directly from Coinbase. They would know better than I. But I’m hoping, as this bill continues to improve, they are one of, if not the largest, names in crypto, and that they will find that a good bill is better than no bill. I understand everyone saying out there no bill is better than a bad bill. I don’t disagree, but we need to be at the negotiating table to improve this bill, because we want a bill, and I think we’ll be kicking ourselves if we get a Democratic Congress, and then we can’t get anything through, and then maybe it’s a Democratic administration. Who knows? We’d be reliving the Gary Gensler era of the Biden administration all over again, and we would be sitting here being like, Man, I really wish we’d gotten that bill done in 2026.

The Android ecosystem is all about choice. While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half! Imagine.

On the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. (I have my own, personally.)

As you sift through the options, you’ll almost certainly come across tech’s favorite buzzphrase of the moment: AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 10 series has some useful features, including Magic Cue, which proactively aims to surface relevant information when you need it, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising. Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

A great Android phone will go the distance. I look for signs that the hardware and software will keep up for many years to come, including a strong IP rating for dust and water resistance (IP68 is preferred), durable glass panels on the front and back, and a sturdy aluminum frame rather than plastic. Samsung and Google flagships now offer seven years of OS and security updates, which is awesome. As a bare minimum, three years of Android OS version upgrades is preferred, along with a total of four or five years of security updates.

The best Android phones have plenty of resolution to cover their large display area, which means 1440p, ideally. A fast refresh rate of at least 120Hz is preferred — animations and scrolling look super smooth at that rate — and even better if it’s variable down to 1Hz to save on battery life.

Any phone can take a decent photo in good lighting, but the best phone cameras can handle low light and high-contrast scenes well, too. I look for optical (most common) or sensor-shift (rare) image stabilization, which helps compensate for hand shake and enables slower shutter speeds in low light to gather more light. A telephoto lens is great to have, too, though high-res sensors are starting to offer better lossless crop modes that mimic short zoom lenses well.

Most phones on this list offer wireless charging, though not all do. Lack of wireless charging isn’t a complete deal-breaker, but it’s becoming an essential feature for many people because it’s a convenient way to charge a wide range of devices.

If you live in the US, I have some bad news about the Android market, though. For complicated reasons having to do with “capitalism” and “geopolitics,” we don’t get nearly as many of the options as you’ll find in Asia and Europe — brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo just aren’t available here. I’ve limited this guide to the devices I’ve personally tested in depth; thus, it is a fairly US-centric set of recommendations.

With that in mind, it’s also worth acknowledging that most people in the US get their phones “for free” from their wireless carrier. If you can manage it, buying an unlocked phone will give you the most flexibility and freedom if you end up wanting to change carriers in the near future. Phone manufacturers also offer financing and trade-in deals to make payments more manageable. But if you’re happy with your carrier and the free phone on offer is the one you really want, by all means, take the free phone. Just make sure you understand the terms, especially if you need to change plans to take advantage of the deal.

However you go about it, you have some fantastic options for your next Android phone.

Qi2 wireless charging with magnets is greatAI is actually kind of useful, finallyTelephoto camera is a nice addition

Main and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as the ProBattery life is just okay

Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 13-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,970mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

The Pixel 10 is Google’s latest take on the “just right” Android phone that introduces a few notable upgrades. For $799, you get a sharp 6.3-inch OLED screen, the same Tensor G5 chip found in the pricier Pro version, and Qi2 wireless charging with built-in magnets, no case required. The device is built to handle the day-to-day without fuss, and the whole thing feels straightforward instead of flashy.

This year, the Pixel 10 also adds a dedicated telephoto lens, a first for the non-Pro. Unfortunately, the main and ultrawide cameras are a step down from last year’s model. If you’re not scrutinizing every pixel or chasing low-light portraits, you’ll probably never notice. For regular photos, the Pixel 10 is great; it produces clean shots, solid performance, and enough versatility for the average user.

What really sets the Pixel 10 apart, though, is how easy it is to use. AI features like Magic Cue are useful, proactively providing info without getting in the way. For example, it can surface a restaurant’s address or reservation details from your search history or confirmation email as you finalize plans over text. The phone runs cooler than previous versions, handles heavier workloads well, and shrugs off dust and water. If you want an Android smartphone that doesn’t overcomplicate things, the Pixel 10 is an easy recommendation.

Robust IP68 ratingSeven years of software updatesBrighter, bigger screen

Missing a couple of AI featuresAI is occasionally handy, usually weird

Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

The budget-friendly Pixel 9A nails the essentials, offering a bright 6.3-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, IP68 water and dust resistance, wireless charging, and Google’s fourth-gen Tensor G4 chipset. It’s dependable and polished, with steady performance and a battery that lasts all day, even with the always-on display enabled. Overall, it delivers fantastic value for $499 — especially given it’s set to receive seven years of OS updates — and stands head and shoulders above the other inexpensive options we’ve recently tested.

Google’s entry-level handset does make some compromises to hit its lower price point, though. The 48-megapixel main and 13-megapixel ultrawide cameras are decent for everyday shots, but low-light performance and portrait mode lag behind the latest Pixel 10 phones (and even older Pixel 9 devices). Meanwhile, it runs a more pared-down version of Google’s on-device AI, so you miss out on some features, including the Screenshots app and Call Notes. The core experience is fantastic, though, and the long support window is among the best you’ll find in this price range. If you want a relatively inexpensive phone that feels just a step below today’s flagships, the 9A is an easy pick.

Excellent screenImproved ultrawide cameraRounded corners are comfier

Screen: 6.9-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS, 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

There’s still no phone quite like the Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung’s latest answer to the question, “What if your phone had all of the features?” It’s equipped with two telephoto cameras, a built-in stylus, and a big, bright screen. Good luck finding that combination in another phone. Related: this is one of the most expensive slab-style phones you can buy.

The newest edition of the Ultra comes with rounded corners and flat edges, making it more comfortable in your hand. But if you’re looking for significant year-over-year improvements to the Ultra formula outside of that, well, you won’t find much. Samsung’s focus has been on software features, which is to say AI features. But AI on Galaxy phones remains a mixed bag — it’s certainly not the paradigm shift Samsung wants us to think the S25 series represents.

All of that puts the Ultra in a place of slightly less distinction than previous versions. The biggest updates are software features available to the rest of the S25 series. The Ultra looks and feels more like other Galaxy phones this time around, too. More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was.

The last reasonably sized Android phoneSeven years of OS upgradesVery good camera

Samsung software is as cluttered as usualAI is still a mixed bag

Screen: 6.2-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,000mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

Most people like a big phone, and I get that. I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25.

That’s the regular S25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS.

The Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bit much, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with.

Like a regular phone, but slimSurprisingly lightweightBattery life isn’t as bad as I feared

No telephoto cameraBattery life not as strong as a standard phone

Screen: 6.7-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel f/1.7 main camera with OIS, 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, 12-megapixel f/2.2 selfie / Battery: 3,900mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

Big phones have a tendency to, well, look and feel big. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, on the other hand, is different. Thanks to its slim, lightweight design, the device provides a welcome reprieve from the countless chunky, heavy alternatives. It’s thinner and lighter than the Galaxy S25 Plus, making it the big phone you can actually slide into your pocket or even your evening bag without it protruding.

So, what’s the catch? The S25 Edge’s battery life is fine. Not great, not terrible, but somewhere straight down the middle. To be fair, it held up admirably during a particularly strenuous workday, one complete with hours of screen time, mobile hotspotting, and live blogging, making it to bedtime with battery to spare. It also lacks a dedicated telephoto lens, though it does feature the same 200-megapixel main camera found in the S25 Ultra.

Even with those compromises, the S25 Edge is a very capable phone that offers similar performance and durability to other devices in the S25 lineup. You’ll just have to be a little more aware of battery life as the day goes on; however, unless you’re routinely streaming video or playing graphics-intensive games throughout the day, the noticeably thinner, lighter design offers a nice change of pace.

Easily a two-day battery for almost any kind of userBig, sharp screen

OxygenOS is looking a little cluttered these daysSilicon-carbon battery may limit device longevityProprietary super-fast wireless charging feels increasingly irrelevant

Screen: 6.78-inch 1272p 165Hz LTPO OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.8 3.5x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / Battery: 7,300mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 and IP69K

The OnePlus 15 takes the “never worry about charging” ethos of its predecessor and cranks it up a notch. Its massive 7,300mAh silicon-carbon battery comfortably delivers two days of real-world use — and that’s with every power-draining feature enabled, including the always-on display. You don’t have to baby it to get the best possible battery life, either. If you do need a quick top-off, the included 80W wired charger and patented USB-C cable can provide you with a full day of battery life in just 20-ish minutes of charging.

As for other specs, the 15 features a sharp 1.5K, 165Hz display and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Elite Gen 5 chip, meaning there’s more to the handset than just battery life. That said, there are some tradeoffs given the newer technology. The chemistry of silicon-carbon batteries may degrade faster than that of lithium-ion batteries, though OnePlus claims the battery will retain over 80 percent of its overall health for the first four years. The 15 also lacks built-in Qi2 magnets, unlike the Pixel 10, so you may have to fiddle with the alignment on your wireless charger to get it just right. If absurd battery headroom is what you’re after, though, the 15 offers it in spades.

Full dust resistance! On a foldable!Qi2 support with built-in magnets

Heavy and chunkyCameras aren’t as good as the other 10 Pro phones’Pricier than a regular phone

Screen: 8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.4-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Google Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 5,015mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold brings better durability to a category that’s historically fragile. With an IP68 rating, it’s the first foldable to offer full dust and water resistance. In real-world use, that means the device can take a tumble at the beach and remain relatively unscathed. Plus, you get the convenience of Qi2 support with built-in magnets for snap-on charging and accessories, including Google’s excellent magnetic ring stand. Performance is smooth, too, and the slightly wider outer display feels more like a standard slab-style phone.

Battery life is also solid for a folding phone, lasting a full day with minimal use of the inner screen; however, spending more time multitasking on the larger display may leave the battery in the red by bedtime. While the 10 Pro Fold’s cameras are good, they lag behind Google’s other 10 Pro models. The foldable is also over 40g heavier than Samsung’s lightweight Galaxy Z Fold 7. If you’ve been avoiding foldables because of durability concerns, the 10 Pro Fold’s improved hinge design means exposure to dust and grains of sand doesn’t equal certain doom.

There are many more great Android devices that weren’t covered here, and a few are worth calling out that didn’t quite make the cut for a recommendation.

﻿Big tech companies and data center operators are suddenly concerned about their image amid the AI boom.

Over the last few months of 2025, Meta spent $6.4 million on an ad campaign running in cities across the country, from Sacramento to Washington, with a clear mission: win over viewers on the construction of new data centers. As the New York Times reports, the ad campaign is anchored by short, folksy video spotlights on Meta’s data centers in Altoona, Iowa, and Los Lunas, New Mexico.

The ads make the case that Meta’s data centers create jobs, revitalizing rural communities.

However, they take a fairly idealistic tone. For instance, the Altoona ad portrays a town on the brink of disappearing, but thanks to Meta’s data center, its residents get to meet up at local diners and attend football games. The Los Lunas ad similarly shows data center employees having cookouts with their families, rather than moving away to find work.

And Meta isn’t the only company trying to convince the public to embrace the data center boom. The Financial Times reported this week that data center operators, including Digital Reality, QTS, and NTT Data, are planning a “lobbying blitz” to campaign in defense of new data centers in response to public backlash.

However, the recent winter storm that swept the country only highlighted the strain the power grid is already under, including areas around large data centers.

For Meta, and competitors like Microsoft and Google, these sprawling data centers are critical for powering AI, but public sentiment on them has been souring. Many communities are pushing back against the construction of new data centers, united across the political divide by concerns about skyrocketing energy costs and water use. These movements have caused delays and cancellations for billions of dollars’ worth of data center investments across the nation, like now-canceled buildouts in Oregon, Arizona, Missouri, Indiana, and Virginia.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Elon Musk was at Davos last week, an interviewer asked him if he thought aging could be reversed. Musk said he hasn’t put much time into the problem but suspects it is “very solvable” and that when scientists discover why we age, it’s going to be something “obvious.”

Not long after, the Harvard professor and life-extension evangelist David Sinclair jumped into the conversation on X to strongly agree with the world’s richest man. “Aging has a relatively simple explanation and is apparently reversible,” wrote Sinclair. “Clinical Trials begin shortly.”

ER-100 turns out to be the code name of a treatment created by Life Biosciences, a small Boston startup that Sinclair cofounded and which he confirmed today has won FDA approval to proceed with the first targeted attempt at age reversal in human volunteers.

The company plans to try to treat eye disease with a radical rejuvenation concept called “reprogramming” that has recently attracted hundreds of millions in investment for Silicon Valley firms like Altos Labs, New Limit, and Retro Biosciences, backed by many of the biggest names in tech.

The technique attempts to restore cells to a healthier state by broadly resetting their epigenetic controls—switches on our genes that determine which are turned on and off.

“Reprogramming is like the AI of the bio world. It’s the thing everyone is funding,” says Karl Pfleger, an investor who backs a smaller UK startup, Shift Bioscience. He says Sinclair’s company has recently been seeking additional funds to keep advancing its treatment.

Reprogramming is so powerful that it sometimes creates risks, even causing cancer in lab animals, but the version of the technique being advanced by Life Biosciences passed initial safety tests in animals.

But it’s still very complex. The trial will initially test the treatment on about a dozen patients with glaucoma, a condition where high pressure inside the eye damages the optic nerve. In the tests, viruses carrying three powerful reprogramming genes will be injected into one eye of each patient, according to a description of the study first posted in December.

To help make sure the process doesn’t go too far, the reprogramming genes will be under the control of a special genetic switch that turns them on only while the patients take a low dose of the antibiotic doxycycline. Initially, they will take the antibiotic for about two months while the effects are monitored.

Executives at the company have said for months that a trial could begin this year, sometimes characterizing it as a starting bell for a new era of age reversal. “It’s an incredibly big deal for us as an industry,” Michael Ringel, chief operating officer at Life Biosciences, said at an event this fall. “It’ll be the first time in human history, in the millennia of human history, of looking for something that rejuvenates … So watch this space.”

The technology is based on the Nobel Prize–winning discovery, 20 years ago, that introducing a few potent genes into a cell will cause it to turn back into a stem cell, just like those found in an early embryo that develop into the different specialized cell types. These genes, known as Yamanaka factors, have been likened to a “factory reset” button for cells.

But they’re dangerous, too. When turned on in a living animal, they can cause an eruption of tumors.

That is what led scientists to a new idea, termed “partial” or “transient” reprogramming. The idea is to limit exposure to the potent genes—or use only a subset of them—in the hope of making cells act younger without giving them complete amnesia about what their role in the body is.

In 2020, Sinclair claimed that such partial reprogramming could restore vision to mice after their optic nerves were smashed, saying there was even evidence that the nerves regrew. His report appeared on the cover of the influential journal Nature alongside the headline “Turning Back Time.”

Not all scientists agree that reprogramming really counts as age reversal. But Sinclair has doubled down. He’s been advancing the theory that the gradual loss of correct epigenetic information in our cells is, in fact, the ultimate cause of aging—just the kind of root cause that Musk was alluding to.

“Elon does seem to be paying attention to the field and [is] seemingly in sync with [my theory],” Sinclair said in an email.

Reprogramming isn’t the first longevity fix championed by Sinclair, who’s written best-selling books and commands stratospheric fees on the longevity lecture circuit. Previously, he touted the longevity benefits of molecules called sirtuins as well as resveratrol, a molecule found in red wine. But some critics say he greatly exaggerates scientific progress, pushback that culminated in a 2024 Wall Street Journal story that dubbed him a “reverse-aging guru” whose companies “have not panned out.”

Life Biosciences has been among those struggling companies. Initially formed in 2017, it at first had a strategy of launching subsidiaries, each intended to pursue one aspect of the aging problem. But after these made limited progress, in 2021 it hired a new CEO, Jerry McLaughlin, who has refocused its efforts  on Sinclair’s mouse vision results and the push toward a human trial.

The company has discussed the possibility of reprogramming other organs, including the brain. And Ringel, like Sinclair, entertains the idea that someday even whole-body rejuvenation might be feasible. But for now, it’s better to think of the study as a proof of concept that’s still far from a fountain of youth. “The optimistic case is this solves some blindness for certain people and catalyzes work in other indications,” says Pfleger, the investor. “It’s not like your doctor will be writing a prescription for a pill that will rejuvenate you.”

Life’s treatment also relies on an antibiotic switching mechanism that, while often used in lab animals, hasn’t been tried in humans before. Since the switch is built from gene components taken from E. coli and the herpes virus, it’s possible that it could cause an immune reaction in humans, scientists say.

“I was always thinking that for widespread use you might need a different system,” says Noah Davidsohn, who helped Sinclair implement the technique and is now chief scientist at a different company, Rejuvenate Bio. And Life’s choice of reprogramming factors—it’s picked three, which go by the acronym OSK—may also be risky. They are expected to turn on hundreds of other genes, and in some circumstances the combination can cause cells to revert to a very primitive, stem-cell-like state.

Other companies studying reprogramming say their focus is on researching which genes to use, in order to achieve time reversal without unwanted side effects. New Limit, which has been carrying out an extensive search for such genes, says it won’t be ready for a human study for two years. At Shift, experiments on animals are only beginning now.

“Are their factors the best version of rejuvenation? We don’t think they are. I think they are working with what they’ve got,” Daniel Ives, the CEO of Shift, says of Life Biosciences. “But I think they’re way ahead of anybody else in terms of getting into humans. They have found a route forward in the eye, which is a nice self-contained system. If it goes wrong, you’ve still got one left.”

A startup’s ads for controversial embryo tests hit the New York City subway.

Why personalized gene editing, genetic resurrections and embryo scoring made our list.

A small group of volunteers will receive multiple injections of the experimental treatments next month, says Unlimited Bio.

An emphasis on fruit, vegetables, and whole foods is welcome—but it’s wrong to suggest steak and beef tallow should be prominent.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI just revealed what its new in-house team, OpenAI for Science, has been up to. The firm has released a free LLM-powered tool for scientists called Prism, which embeds ChatGPT in a text editor for writing scientific papers.

The idea is to put ChatGPT front and center inside software that scientists use to write up their work in much the same way that chatbots are now embedded into popular programming editors. It’s vibe coding, but for science.

Kevin Weil, head of OpenAI for Science, pushes that analogy himself. “I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” he said at a press briefing yesterday. “We’re starting to see that same kind of inflection.”

OpenAI claims that around 1.3 million scientists around the world submit more than 8 million queries a week to ChatGPT on advanced topics in science and math. “That tells us that AI is moving from curiosity to core workflow for scientists,” Weil said.

Prism is a response to that user behavior. It can also be seen as a bid to lock in more scientists to OpenAI’s products in a marketplace full of rival chatbots.

“I mostly use GPT-5 for writing code,” says Roland Dunbrack, a professor of biology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who is not connected to OpenAI. “Occasionally, I ask LLMs a scientific question, basically hoping it can find information in the literature faster than I can. It used to hallucinate references but does not seem to do that very much anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says GPT-5 has already become an important tool in his work. “It sometimes helps polish the text of papers, catching mathematical typos or bugs, and provides generally useful feedback,” he says. “It is extremely helpful for quick summarization of research articles, making interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”

By combining a chatbot with an everyday piece of software, Prism follows a trend set by products such as OpenAI’s Atlas, which embeds ChatGPT in a web browser, as well as LLM-powered office tools from firms such as Microsoft and Google DeepMind.

Prism incorporates GPT-5.2, the company’s best model yet for mathematical and scientific problem-solving, into an editor for writing documents in LaTeX, a common coding language that scientists use for formatting scientific papers.

A ChatGPT chat box sits at the bottom of the screen, below a view of the article being written. Scientists can call on ChatGPT for anything they want. It can help them draft the text, summarize related articles, manage their citations, turn photos of whiteboard scribbles into equations or diagrams, or talk through hypotheses or mathematical proofs.

It’s clear that Prism could be a huge time saver. It’s also clear that a lot of people may be disappointed, especially after weeks of high-profile social media chatter from researchers at the firm about how good GPT-5 is at solving math problems. Science is drowning in AI slop: Won&#39;t this just make it worse? Where is OpenAI’s fully automated AI scientist? And when will GPT-5 make a stunning new discovery?

That’s not the mission, says Weil. He would love to see GPT-5 make a discovery. But he doesn’t think that’s what will have the biggest impact on science, at least not in the near term.

“I think more powerfully—and with 100% probability—there’s going to be 10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn&#39;t have happened as quickly, and AI will have been a contributor to that,” Weil told MIT Technology Review in an exclusive interview this week. “It won’t be this shining beacon—it will just be an incremental, compounding acceleration.”

            <h2>Stratospheric internet could finally start taking off this year</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/27/1131780/stratospheric-internet-take-off/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.

Even with nearly 10,000 active Starlink satellites in orbit and the OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites, solid internet coverage is not a given across vast swathes of the planet.

One of the most prominent efforts to plug the connectivity gap was Google X’s Loon project. Launched in 2011, it aimed to deliver access using high-altitude balloons stationed above predetermined spots on Earth. But the project faced literal headwinds—the Loons kept drifting away and new ones had to be released constantly, making the venture economically unfeasible.

Although Google shuttered the high-profile Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems with different designs—in particular, steerable airships and fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year, in tests above Japan and Indonesia.

Regulators, too, seem to be thinking seriously about HAPS. In mid-December, for example, the US Federal Aviation Administration released a 50-page document outlining how large numbers of HAPS could be integrated into American airspace. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) data, some 8 million US households (4.5% of the population) still live completely offline, and HAPS proponents think the technology might get them connected more cheaply than alternatives.

Despite the optimism of the companies involved, though, some analysts remain cautious.

“The HAPS market has been really slow and challenging to develop,” says Dallas Kasaboski, a space industry analyst at the consultancy Analysis Mason. After all, Kasaboski says, the approach has struggled before: “A few companies were very interested in it, very ambitious about it, and then it just didn’t happen.”

Hovering in the thin air at altitudes above 12 miles, HAPS have a unique vantage point to beam down low-latency, high-speed connectivity directly to smartphone users in places too remote and too sparsely populated to justify the cost of laying fiber-optic cables or building ground-based cellular base stations.

“Mobile network operators have some commitment to provide coverage, but they frequently prefer to pay a fine than cover these remote areas,” says Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technology officer of Aalto HAPS, a spinoff from the European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. “With HAPS, we make this remote connectivity case profitable.”

Aalto HAPS has built a solar-powered UAV with a 25-meter wingspan that has conducted many long-duration test flights in recent years. In April 2025 the craft, called Zephyr, broke a HAPS record by staying afloat for 67 consecutive days. The first months of 2026 will be busy for the company, according to Aubourg; Zephyr will do a test run over southern Japan to trial connectivity delivery to residents of some of the country’s smallest and most poorly connected inhabited islands.

Because of its unique geography, Japan is a perfect test bed for HAPS. Many of the country’s roughly 430 inhabited islands are remote, mountainous, and sparsely populated, making them too costly to connect with terrestrial cell towers. Aalto HAPS is partnering with Japan’s largest mobile network operators, NTT DOCOMO and the telecom satellite operator Space Compass, which want to use Zephyr as part of next-generation telecommunication infrastructure.

“Non-terrestrial networks have the potential to transform Japan’s communications ecosystem, addressing access to connectivity in hard-to-reach areas while supporting our country’s response to emergencies,” Shigehiro Hori, co-CEO of Space Compass, said in a statement.

Zephyr, Aubourg explains, will function like another cell tower in the NTT DOCOMO network, only it will be located well above the planet instead of on its surface. It will beam high-speed 5G connectivity to smartphone users without the need for the specialized terminals that are usually required to receive satellite internet. “For the user on the ground, there is no difference when they switch from the terrestrial network to the HAPS network,” Aubourg says. “It’s exactly the same frequency and the same network.”

New Mexico–based Sceye, which has developed a solar-powered helium-filled airship, is also eyeing Japan for pre-commercial trials of its stratospheric connectivity service this year. The firm, which extensively tested its slick 65-meter-long vehicle in 2025, is working with the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. Just like NTT DOCOMO, Softbank is betting on HAPS to take its networks to another level.

Mikkel Frandsen, Sceye’s founder and CEO, says that his firm succeeded where Loon failed by betting on the advantages offered by the more controllable airship shape, intelligent avionics, and innovative batteries that can power an electric fan to keep the aircraft in place.

“Google’s Loon was groundbreaking, but they used a balloon form factor, and despite advanced algorithms—and the ability to change altitude to find desired wind directions and wind speeds—Loon’s system relied on favorable winds to stay over a target area, resulting in unpredictable station-seeking performance,” Frandsen says. “This required a large amount of balloons in the air to have relative certainty that one would stay over the area of operation, which was financially unviable.”

He adds that Sceye’s airship can “point into the wind” and more effectively maintain its position.

“We have significant surface area, providing enough physical space to lift 250-plus kilograms and host solar panels and batteries,” he says, “allowing Sceye to maintain power through day-night cycles, and therefore staying over an area of operation while maintaining altitude.”

Satellite internet currently comes at a price tag that can be too high for people in developing countries, says Kasaboski. For example, Starlink subscriptions start at $10 per month in Africa, but millions of people in these regions are surviving on a mere $2 a day.

Frandsen and Aubourg both claim that HAPS can connect the world’s unconnected more cheaply. Because satellites in low Earth orbit circle the planet at very high speeds, they quickly disappear from a ground terminal&#39;s view, meaning large quantities of those satellites are needed to provide continuous coverage. HAPS can hover, affording a constant view of a region, and more HAPS can be launched to meet higher demand.

“If you want to deliver connectivity with a low-Earth-orbit constellation into one place, you still need a complete constellation,” says Aubourg. “We can deliver connectivity with one aircraft to one location. And then we can tailor much more the size of the fleet according to the market coverage that we need.”

Starlink gets a lot of attention, but satellite internet has some major drawbacks, says Frandsen. A big one is that its bandwidth gets diluted once the number of users in an area grows.

In a recent interview, Starlink cofounder Elon Musk compared the Starlink beams to a flashlight. Given the distance at which those satellites orbit the planet, the cone is wide, covering a large area. That’s okay when users are few and far between, but it can become a problem with higher densities of users.

For example, Ukrainian defense technologists have said that Starlink bandwidth can drop on the front line to a mere 10 megabits per second, compared with the peak offering of 220 Mbps when drones and ground robots are in heavy use. Users in Indonesia, which like Japan is an island nation, also began reporting problems with Starlink shortly after the service was introduced in the country in 2024. Again, bandwidth declined as the number of subscribers grew.

In fact, Frandsen says, Starlink’s performance is less than optimal once the number of users exceeds one person per square kilometer. And that can happen almost anywhere—even relatively isolated island communities can have hundreds or thousands of residents in a small area. “There is a relationship between the altitude and the population you can serve,” Frandsen says. “You can’t bring space closer to the surface of the planet. So the telco companies want to use the stratosphere so that they can get out to more rural populations than they could otherwise serve.” Starlink did not respond to our queries about these challenges.

Sceye and Aalto HAPS see their stratospheric vehicles as part of integrated telecom networks that include both terrestrial cell towers and satellites. But they’re far from the only game in town.

World Mobile, a telecommunications company headquartered in London, thinks its hydrogen-powered high-altitude UAV can compete directly with satellite mega-constellations. The company acquired the HAPS developer Stratospheric Platforms last year. This year, it plans to flight-test an innovative phased array antenna, which it claims will be able to deliver bandwidth of 200 megabits per second (enough to enable ultra-HD video streaming to 500,000 users at the same time over an area of 15,000 square kilometers—equivalent to the coverage of more than 500 terrestrial cell towers, the company says).

Last year, World Mobile also signed a partnership with the Indonesian telecom operator Protelindo to build a prototype Stratomast aircraft, with tests scheduled to begin in late 2027.

Richard Deakin, CEO of World Mobile’s HAPS division World Mobile Stratospheric, says that just nine Stratomasts could supply Scotland’s 5.5 million residents with high-speed internet connectivity at a cost of £40 million ($54 million) per year. That’s equivalent to about 60 pence (80 cents) per person per month, he says. Starlink subscriptions in the UK, of which Scotland is a part, come at £75 ($100) per month.

Companies working on HAPS also extol the convenience of prompt deployments in areas struck by war or natural disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, after which Loon played an important role. And they say that HAPS could make it possible for smaller nations to obtain complete control over their celestial internet-beaming infrastructure rather than relying on mega-constellations controlled by larger nations, a major boon at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and crumbling political alliances.

Analysts, however, remain cautious, projecting a HAPS market totaling a modest $1.9 billion by 2033. The satellite internet industry, on the other hand, is expected to be worth $33.44 billion by 2030, according to some estimates.

The use of HAPS for internet delivery to remote locations has been explored since the 1990s, about as long as the concept of low-Earth-orbit mega-constellations. The seemingly more cost-effective stratospheric technology, however, lost to the space fleets thanks to the falling cost of space launches and ambitious investment by Musk’s SpaceX.

Google wasn’t the only tech giant to explore the HAPS idea. Facebook also had a project, called Aquila, that was discontinued after it too faced technical difficulties. Although the current cohort of HAPS makers claim they have solved the challenges that killed their predecessors, Kasaboski warns that they’re playing a different game: catching up with now-established internet-beaming mega constellations. By the end of this year, it’ll be much clearer whether they stand a good chance of doing so.

Why chatbots are starting to check your age

How do tech companies check if their users are kids?This question has taken on new urgency recently thanks to growing concern about the dangers that can arise when children talk to AI chatbots. For years Big Tech asked for birthdays (that one could make up) to avoid violating child privacy laws, but they weren’t required to moderate content accordingly.Now, two developments over the last week show how quickly things are changing in the US and how this issue is becoming a new battleground, even among parents and child-safety advocates. Read the full story.

Humans have long dreamed of living among the stars, and for two decades hundreds of us have done so aboard the International Space Station (ISS). But a new era is about to begin in which private companies operate orbital outposts—with the promise of much greater access to space than before.

The ISS is aging and is expected to be brought down from orbit into the ocean in 2031. To replace it, NASA has awarded more than $500 million to several companies to develop private space stations, while others have built versions on their own. Read why we made them one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year, and check out the rest of the list.

            <div id="article-text">In the three years since ChatGPT’s explosive debut, OpenAI’s technology has upended a remarkable range of everyday activities at home, at work, in schools—anywhere people have a browser open or a phone out, which is everywhere.

Now OpenAI is making an explicit play for scientists. In October, the firm announced that it had launched a whole new team, called OpenAI for Science, dedicated to exploring how its large language models could help scientists and tweaking its tools to support them.

The last couple of months have seen a slew of social media posts and academic publications in which mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and others have described how LLMs (and OpenAI’s GPT-5 in particular) have helped them make a discovery or nudged them toward a solution they might otherwise have missed. In part, OpenAI for Science was set up to engage with this community.

And yet OpenAI is also late to the party. Google DeepMind, the rival firm behind groundbreaking scientific models such as AlphaFold and AlphaEvolve, has had an AI-for-science team for years. (When I spoke to Google DeepMind’s CEO and cofounder Demis Hassabis in 2023 about that team, he told me: “This is the reason I started DeepMind … In fact, it’s why I’ve worked my whole career in AI.”)

So why now? How does a push into science fit with OpenAI’s wider mission? And what exactly is the firm hoping to achieve?

I put these questions to Kevin Weil, a vice president at OpenAI who leads the new OpenAI for Science team, in an exclusive interview last week.

Weil is a product guy. He joined OpenAI a couple of years ago as chief product officer after being head of product at Twitter and Instagram. But he started out as a scientist. He got two-thirds of the way through a PhD in particle physics at Stanford University before ditching academia for the Silicon Valley dream. Weil is keen to highlight his pedigree: “I thought I was going to be a physics professor for the rest of my life,” he says. “I still read math books on vacation.”

Asked how OpenAI for Science fits with the firm’s existing lineup of white-collar productivity tools or the viral video app Sora, Weil recites the company mantra: “The mission of OpenAI is to try and build artificial general intelligence and, you know, make it beneficial for all of humanity.”

Just imagine the future impact this technology could have on science he says: New medicines, new materials, new devices. “Think about it helping us understand the nature of reality, helping us think through open problems. Maybe the biggest, most positive impact we’re going to see from AGI will actually be from its ability to accelerate science.”

He adds: “With GPT-5, we saw that becoming possible.”

As Weil tells it, LLMs are now good enough to be useful scientific collaborators. They can spitball ideas, suggest novel directions to explore, and find fruitful parallels between new problems and old solutions published in obscure journals decades ago or in foreign languages.

That wasn’t the case a year or so ago. Since it announced its first so-called reasoning model—a type of LLM that can break down problems into multiple steps and work through them one by one—in December 2024, OpenAI has been pushing the envelope of what the technology can do. Reasoning models have made LLMs far better at solving math and logic problems than they used to be. “You go back a few years and we were all collectively mind-blown that the models could get an 800 on the SAT,” says Weil.

But soon LLMs were acing math competitions and solving graduate-level physics problems. Last year, OpenAI and Google DeepMind both announced that their LLMs had achieved gold-medal-level performance in the International Math Olympiad, one of the toughest math contests in the world. “These models are no longer just better than 90% of grad students,” says Weil. “They’re really at the frontier of human abilities.”

That’s a huge claim, and it comes with caveats. Still, there’s no doubt that GPT-5, which includes a reasoning model,  is a big improvement on GPT-4 when it comes to complicated problem-solving. Measured against an industry benchmark known as GPQA, which includes more than 400 multiple-choice questions that test PhD-level knowledge in biology, physics, and chemistry, GPT-4 scores 39%, well below the human-expert baseline of around 70%. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 (the latest update to the model, released in December) scores 92%.

The excitement is evident—and perhaps excessive. In October, senior figures at OpenAI, including Weil, boasted on X that GPT-5 had found solutions to several unsolved math problems. Mathematicians were quick to point out that in fact what GPT-5 appeared to have done was dig up existing solutions in old research papers, including at least one written in German. That was still useful, but it wasn’t the achievement OpenAI seemed to have claimed. Weil and his colleagues deleted their posts.

Now Weil is more careful. It is often enough to find answers that exist but have been forgotten, he says: “We collectively stand on the shoulders of giants, and if LLMs can kind of accumulate that knowledge so that we don’t spend time struggling on a problem that is already solved, that’s an acceleration all of its own.”

He plays down the idea that LLMs are about to come up with a game-changing new discovery. “I don’t think models are there yet,” he says. “Maybe they’ll get there. I’m optimistic that they will.”

But, he insists, that’s not the mission: “Our mission is to accelerate science. And I don’t think the bar for the acceleration of science is, like, Einstein-level reimagining of an entire field.”

For Weil, the question is this: “Does science actually happen faster because scientists plus models can do much more, and do it more quickly, than scientists alone? I think we’re already seeing that.”

In November, OpenAI published a series of anecdotal case studies contributed by scientists, both inside and outside the company, that illustrated how they had used GPT-5 and how it had helped. “Most of the cases were scientists that were already using GPT-5 directly in their research and had come to us one way or another saying, ‘Look at what I’m able to do with these tools,’” says Weil.

The key things that GPT-5 seems to be good at are finding references and connections to existing work that scientists were not aware of, which sometimes sparks new ideas; helping scientists sketch mathematical proofs; and suggesting ways for scientists to test hypotheses in the lab.

“GPT 5.2 has read substantially every paper written in the last 30 years,” says Weil. “And it understands not just the field that a particular scientist is working in; it can bring together analogies from other, unrelated fields.”

“That’s incredibly powerful,” he continues. “You can always find a human collaborator in an adjacent field, but it’s difficult to find, you know, a thousand collaborators in all thousand adjacent fields that might matter. And in addition to that, I can work with the model late at night—it doesn’t sleep—and I can ask it 10 things in parallel, which is kind of awkward to do to a human.”

Most of the scientists OpenAI reached out to back up Weil’s position.

Robert Scherrer, a professor of physics and astronomy at Vanderbilt University, only played around with ChatGPT for fun (“I used to it rewrite the theme song for Gilligan’s Island in the style of Beowulf, which it did very well,” he tells me) until his Vanderbilt colleague Alex Lupsasca, a fellow physicist who now works at OpenAI, told him that GPT-5 had helped solve a problem he’d been working on.

Lupsasca gave Scherrer access to GPT-5 Pro, OpenAI’s $200-a-month premium subscription. “It managed to solve a problem that I and my graduate student could not solve despite working on it for several months,” says Scherrer.

It’s not perfect, he says: “GTP-5 still makes dumb mistakes. Of course, I do too, but the mistakes GPT-5 makes are even dumber.” And yet it keeps getting better, he says: “If current trends continue—and that’s a big if—I suspect that all scientists will be using LLMs soon.”

Derya Unutmaz, a professor of biology at the Jackson Laboratory, a nonprofit research institute, uses GPT-5 to brainstorm ideas, summarize papers, and plan experiments in his work studying the immune system. In the case study he shared with OpenAI, Unutmaz used GPT-5 to analyze an old data set that his team had previously looked at. The model came up with fresh insights and interpretations.

“LLMs are already essential for scientists,” he says. “When you can complete analysis of data sets that used to take months, not using them is not an option anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says he has been using LLMs in his research since the first version of ChatGPT came out.

Like Scherrer, he finds LLMs most useful when they highlight unexpected connections between his own work and existing results he did not know about. “I believe that LLMs are becoming an essential technical tool for scientists, much like computers and the internet did before,” he says. “I expect a long-term disadvantage for those who do not use them.”

But he does not expect LLMs to make novel discoveries anytime soon. “I have seen very few genuinely fresh ideas or arguments that would be worth a publication on their own,” he says. “So far, they seem to mainly combine existing results, sometimes incorrectly, rather than produce genuinely new approaches.”

I also contacted a handful of scientists who are not connected to OpenAI.

Andy Cooper, a professor of chemistry at the University of Liverpool and director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Functional Materials Design, is less enthusiastic. “We have not found, yet, that LLMs are fundamentally changing the way that science is done,” he says. “But our recent results suggest that they do have a place.”

Cooper is leading a project to develop a so-called AI scientist that can fully automate parts of the scientific workflow. He says that his team doesn’t use LLMs to come up with ideas. But the tech is starting to prove useful as part of a wider automated system where an LLM can help direct robots, for example.

“My guess is that LLMs might stick more in robotic workflows, at least initially, because I’m not sure that people are ready to be told what to do by an LLM,” says Cooper. “I’m certainly not.”

LLMs may be becoming more and more useful, but caution is still key. In December, Jonathan Oppenheim, a scientist who works on quantum mechanics, called out a mistake that had made its way into a scientific journal. “OpenAI leadership are promoting a paper in Physics Letters B where GPT-5 proposed the main idea—possibly the first peer-reviewed paper where an LLM generated the core contribution,” Oppenheim posted on X. “One small problem: GPT-5’s idea tests the wrong thing.”

He continued: “GPT-5 was asked for a test that detects nonlinear theories. It provided a test that detects nonlocal ones. Related-sounding, but different. It’s like asking for a COVID test, and the LLM cheerfully hands you a test for chickenpox.”

It is clear that a lot of scientists are finding innovative and intuitive ways to engage with LLMs. It is also clear that the technology makes mistakes that can be so subtle even experts miss them.

Part of the problem is the way ChatGPT can flatter you into letting down your guard. As Oppenheim put it: “A core issue is that LLMs are being trained to validate the user, while science needs tools that challenge us.” In an extreme case, one individual (who was not a scientist) was persuaded by ChatGPT into thinking for months that he’d invented a new branch of mathematics.

Of course, Weil is well aware of the problem of hallucination. But he insists that newer models are hallucinating less and less. Even so, focusing on hallucination might be missing the point, he says.

“One of my teammates here, an ex math professor, said something that stuck with me,” says Weil. “He said: ‘When I’m doing research, if I’m bouncing ideas off a colleague, I’m wrong 90% of the time and that’s kind of the point. We’re both spitballing ideas and trying to find something that works.’”

“That’s actually a desirable place to be,” says Weil. “If you say enough wrong things and then somebody stumbles on a grain of truth and then the other person seizes on it and says, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s not quite right, but what if we—’ You gradually kind of find your trail through the woods.”

This is Weil’s core vision for OpenAI for Science. GPT-5 is good, but it is not an oracle. The value of this technology is in pointing people in new directions, not coming up with definitive answers, he says.

In fact, one of the things OpenAI is now looking at is making GPT-5 dial down its confidence when it delivers a response. Instead of saying Here’s the answer, it might tell scientists: Here’s something to consider.

“That’s actually something that we are spending a bunch of time on,” says Weil. “Trying to make sure that the model has some sort of epistemological humility.”

Another thing OpenAI is looking at is how to use GPT-5 to fact-check GPT-5. It’s often the case that if you feed one of GPT-5’s answers back into the model, it will pick it apart and highlight mistakes.

“You can kind of hook the model up as its own critic,” says Weil. “Then you can get a workflow where the model is thinking and then it goes to another model, and if that model finds things that it could improve, then it passes it back to the original model and says, ‘Hey, wait a minute—this part wasn’t right, but this part was interesting. Keep it.’ It’s almost like a couple of agents working together and you only see the output once it passes the critic.”

What Weil is describing also sounds a lot like what Google DeepMind did with AlphaEvolve, a tool that wrapped the firms LLM, Gemini, inside a wider system that filtered out the good responses from the bad and fed them back in again to be improved on. Google DeepMind has used AlphaEvolve to solve several real-world problems.

OpenAI faces stiff competition from rival firms, whose own LLMs can do most, if not all, of the things it claims for its own models. If that’s the case, why should scientists use GPT-5 instead of Gemini or Anthropic’s Claude, families of models that are themselves improving every year? Ultimately, OpenAI for Science may be as much an effort to plant a flag in new territory as anything else. The real innovations are still to come.

“I think 2026 will be for science what 2025 was for software engineering,” says Weil. “At the beginning of 2025, if you were using AI to write most of your code, you were an early adopter. Whereas 12 months later, if you’re not using AI to write most of your code, you’re probably falling behind. We’re now seeing those same early flashes for science as we did for code.”

He continues: “I think that in a year, if you’re a scientist and you’re not heavily using AI, you’ll be missing an opportunity to increase the quality and pace of your thinking.”

How do tech companies check if their users are kids?

This question has taken on new urgency recently thanks to growing concern about the dangers that can arise when children talk to AI chatbots. For years Big Tech asked for birthdays (that one could make up) to avoid violating child privacy laws, but they weren’t required to moderate content accordingly. Two developments over the last week show how quickly things are changing in the US and how this issue is becoming a new battleground, even among parents and child-safety advocates.

In one corner is the Republican Party, which has supported laws passed in several states that require sites with adult content to verify users’ ages. Critics say this provides cover to block anything deemed “harmful to minors,” which could include sex education. Other states, like California, are coming after AI companies with laws to protect kids who talk to chatbots (by requiring them to verify who’s a kid). Meanwhile, President Trump is attempting to keep AI regulation a national issue rather than allowing states to make their own rules. Support for various bills in Congress is constantly in flux.

So what might happen? The debate is quickly moving away from whether age verification is necessary and toward who will be responsible for it. This responsibility is a hot potato that no company wants to hold.

In a blog post last Tuesday, OpenAI revealed that it plans to roll out automatic age prediction. In short, the company will apply a model that uses factors like the time of day, among others, to predict whether a person chatting is under 18. For those identified as teens or children, ChatGPT will apply filters to “reduce exposure” to content like graphic violence or sexual role-play. YouTube launched something similar last year.

If you support age verification but are concerned about privacy, this might sound like a win. But there&#39;s a catch. The system is not perfect, of course, so it could classify a child as an adult or vice versa. People who are wrongly labeled under 18 can verify their identity by submitting a selfie or government ID to a company called Persona.

Selfie verifications have issues: They fail more often for people of color and those with certain disabilities. Sameer Hinduja, who co-directs the Cyberbullying Research Center, says the fact that Persona will need to hold millions of government IDs and masses of biometric data is another weak point. “When those get breached, we’ve exposed massive populations all at once,” he says.

Hinduja instead advocates for device-level verification, where a parent specifies a child’s age when setting up the child’s phone for the first time. This information is then kept on the device and shared securely with apps and websites.

That’s more or less what Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, recently lobbied US lawmakers to call for. Cook was fighting lawmakers who wanted to require app stores to verify ages, which would saddle Apple with lots of liability.

More signals of where this is all headed will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Trade Commission—the agency that would be responsible for enforcing these new laws—is holding an all-day workshop on age verification. Apple’s head of government affairs, Nick Rossi, will be there. He’ll be joined by higher-ups in child safety at Google and Meta, as well as a company that specializes in marketing to children.

The FTC has become increasingly politicized under President Trump (his firing of the sole Democratic commissioner was struck down by a federal court, a decision that is now pending review by the US Supreme Court). In July, I wrote about signals that the agency is softening its stance toward AI companies. Indeed, in December, the FTC overturned a Biden-era ruling against an AI company that allowed people to flood the internet with fake product reviews, writing that it clashed with President Trump’s AI Action Plan.

Wednesday’s workshop may shed light on how partisan the FTC’s approach to age verification will be. Red states favor laws that require porn websites to verify ages (but critics warn this could be used to block a much wider range of content). Bethany Soye, a Republican state representative who is leading an effort to pass such a bill in her state of South Dakota, is scheduled to speak at the FTC meeting. The ACLU generally opposes laws requiring IDs to visit websites and has instead advocated for an expansion of existing parental controls.

While all this gets debated, though, AI has set the world of child safety on fire. We’re dealing with increased generation of child sexual abuse material, concerns (and lawsuits) about suicides and self-harm following chatbot conversations, and troubling evidence of kids’ forming attachments to AI companions. Colliding stances on privacy, politics, free expression, and surveillance will complicate any effort to find a solution. Write to me with your thoughts.

            <h2>Rainbow Weather raises $5.5M to refine real-time weather forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.

            <h2>Mews raises €255M to accelerate AI and automation in hospitality</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amsterdam-based hospitality tech platform Mews has raised €255 million (about $300 million) in a Series D funding round as it pushes deeper into automation and AI-powered workflows for hotels around the world.

The round was led by EQT Growth with new participation from Atomico and HarbourVest Partners, alongside existing backers including Kinnevik, Battery Ventures and Tiger Global. The investment values the company at roughly $2.5 billion.

Founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr and Matt Welle, Mews builds a cloud-native “operating system” for hotels  software that ties together reservations, check-ins, housekeeping, payments and more in one platform.

Its technology is designed to replace legacy systems that many hotels still rely on, offering a more flexible, connected way to manage day-to-day operations.

The new funding will be used to expand the company’s AI and automation capabilities at the core of its product.

That includes embedding agent-driven systems that can take on complex routine tasks, reduce manual work for staff and streamline how hotels handle everything from guest interactions to revenue management.

Mews says its platform already supports more than 15,000 properties in 85 countries, and in 2025 it processed nearly 42.3 million check-ins and handled nearly $20 billion in transaction volume.

The software also helped generate over $500 million in additional revenue for hoteliers through features like its Mews Spaces module.

In a statement, CEO Matt Welle said the new capital will help Mews build an operating system that handles operational complexity so hotel teams can focus on guest experience rather than juggling disparate tools.

“We are engineering an operating system that is changing how hoteliers interact with their guests,” CEO Matt Welle said, adding that the goal is to lighten the cognitive load on staff and make everyday operations smoother.

Industry observers say the round is one of the largest ever in hospitality software and reflects broader investor interest in infrastructure-level platforms that bring AI and fintech together for real-world business operations.

As hotels embrace digital transformation, technology that can automate workflows and personalise guest experiences  without adding complexity is increasingly in demand.

For Mews, the challenge now is execution: turning generous funding into tangible upgrades that deliver value for hoteliers of all sizes.

But with strong adoption, a global footprint and a growing suite of automation tools, the company is positioning itself as a central technology partner at a time when hotels are looking to modernise their operations and enhance guest satisfaction.
