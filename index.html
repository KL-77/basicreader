            <h2>Trump FCC investigates The View, reportedly says "fake news" will be punished</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-fcc-investigates-the-view-reportedly-says-fake-news-will-be-punished/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Communications Commission is reportedly investigating ABC’s The View in what FCC Democrat Anna Gomez called an attempt to intimidate critics of the Trump administration.

“Let’s be clear on what this is. This is government intimidation, not a legitimate investigation,” Gomez said in a statement Friday night. “Like many other so-called ‘investigations’ before it, the FCC will announce an investigation but never carry one out, reach a conclusion, or take any meaningful action. The real purpose is to weaponize the FCC’s regulatory authority to intimidate perceived critics of this administration and chill protected speech.”

The FCC hasn’t announced the investigation but previously gave several indications that it would occur sooner or later. After pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in September that it would be “worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether The View and some of these other programs” are violating the agency’s equal-time rule. The Carr FCC followed that up in January by issuing a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the bona fide news exemption to the equal-time rule.

Fox News reported Friday that the FCC is launching an investigation into The View “amid the agency’s crackdown on equal time for political candidates.” A source at the FCC told Fox that the probe was triggered by the show’s interview with Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico.

“Fake news is not getting a free pass anymore,” Fox News quoted its FCC source as saying. Fox said its source indicated that ABC would have to provide “equal airtime for Republican candidates on the ballot like incumbent Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn and his primary rivals,” and for “Ahmad Hassan, the little-known candidate running against Talarico and [US Rep. Jasmine] Crockett in the Democratic primary.”

President Trump posted a link to the Fox News story on his Truth Social account. The investigation was also confirmed by Reuters, which reported on Saturday that a source said the FCC opened a probe into whether the “daytime talk show violated equal time rules for interviews with political candidates after an appearance by a Democratic Texas Senate candidate.”

We contacted the FCC today and will update this article if it provides any information on the reported investigation.

In July, a White House spokesperson called The View co-host Joy Behar an “irrelevant loser” after she said Trump was jealous of former President Barack Obama. Trump has frequently called on the FCC to revoke licenses from ABC and other networks. The FCC issues licenses to individual broadcast stations, not national news networks, but many affiliated stations are owned and operated by the network.

Although the FCC is classified as an independent agency under US law, Carr has declared that the FCC is no longer independent from the White House and made it clear he takes orders from Trump. While former FCC chairs Jessica Rosenworcel and Ajit Pai rejected Trump’s calls to revoke broadcast licenses from news organizations that Trump dislikes, Carr has repeatedly threatened station licenses on Trump’s behalf. During the Kimmel controversy, Carr said that stations could face fines or license revocations if they continued to run Kimmel’s show.

Gomez, the only Democratic commissioner on the FCC, urged “broadcasters and their parent networks to stand strong against these unfounded attacks and continue exercising their constitutional rights without fear or favor.” She said that despite the pressure the FCC is exerting with its equal-time rule, “the First Amendment protects the right of daytime and late-night programs to cover newsworthy issues and express viewpoints without government interference.”

As for The View, Fox News said it was told by its source that ABC owner Disney “never made an equal-time filing to the FCC regarding Talarico’s recent appearance, which would implicitly indicate to the FCC that Disney believes The View is bona fide news and would be exempt from the policy.”

The equal-time rule, formally known as the Equal Opportunities Rule, generally requires that stations giving time to one political candidate must provide comparable time and placement to an opposing candidate if an opposing candidate makes a request. The rule has an exemption for candidate appearances on bona fide news programs, and entertainment talk shows have generally been treated as bona fide news programs for this purpose.

The FCC Media Bureau’s January 21 public notice to broadcast TV stations said that despite a 2006 decision in which the FCC exempted The Tonight Show with Jay Leno from the rule, current entertainment shows may not qualify for that exemption. “Importantly, the FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” the notice said.

The Media Bureau’s January 21 notice said the equal-time rule applies to broadcast TV stations because they “have been given access to a valuable public resource (namely, spectrum),” and that compliance with “these requirements is central to a broadcast licensee’s obligation to operate in the public interest.”

The FCC notice got this detail wrong, according to Harold Feld, a longtime telecom attorney who is senior VP of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. The equal-time rule actually applies to cable channels, too, he wrote in a January 29 blog post.

“Yes, contrary to what a number of people think, including, annoyingly, the Media Bureau which gets this wrong in its recent order, this is not a ‘public interest obligation’ for using spectrum,” Feld wrote. “It’s a conditional right of access (like leased access for cable) that members of Congress gave themselves (and other candidates) because they recognized the power of mass media to shape elections.” The US law applies both to broadcast stations using public spectrum and “community antenna television,” the old name for cable TV, Feld pointed out.

This doesn’t actually mean that people can file FCC complaints against the Fox News cable channel, though, Feld wrote. This is because the FCC “has consistently interpreted Section 315(c) since it was added as applying only to ‘local origination cablecasting,’ meaning locally originated programming and not the national cable channels that cable operators distribute as part of their bundle,” he wrote.

In any case, Feld said the Media Bureau’s “guidance ignores all of the other precedent that creates settled law as to how the FCC evaluates eligibility for an exemption on which broadcast shows have relied.” While the FCC cited its Jay Leno decision, Feld said the Leno ruling was “merely one of a long line of FCC decisions expanding the definition of ‘news interview’ and ‘news show.’”

The FCC started loosening its definitions of news shows and news interviews in the mid-1980s, Feld wrote. “In what many consider a landmark decision in 1984, the FCC held that the Phil Donahue Show—a daytime interview show—qualified as a bona fide news show and that interviews on the show were bona fide news interviews if they met the same criteria as those on traditional news shows,” he wrote. “The FCC rapidly broadened the range of shows to include mixed entertainment/news programs such as Good Morning America, Sally Jessy Raphael (much more ‘tabloid’ style), and Howard Stern (back when he was a ‘shock jock’ on broadcast).”

The long line of FCC decisions indicated that “the fact that a program included segments designed solely for entertainment did not automatically disqualify an appearance by a candidate from the exemption provided (a) the candidate was selected by the show for ‘newsworthiness;’ (b) the show was regularly scheduled (and therefore not a campaign event); and (c) the show controlled the interview questions and editing,” Feld wrote.

Feld said the FCC public notice indicates that under the current leadership, even traditional news shows might not be given the bona fide exemption if the FCC determines the show is “designed to ‘advance the candidacy’ of a particular individual.” If Carr punishes ABC or another network, the target might be able to prove in court that the FCC overstepped its authority. But as seen in the Kimmel episode, Carr doesn’t need to take any official action to cause a problem for a media company.

“As is often the case, the fact that a broadcaster would ultimately win if it ever got to court matters less than the pain selective enforcement causes,” Feld wrote.</div>

            <h2>Discord faces backlash over age checks after data breach exposed 70,000 IDs</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-faces-backlash-over-age-checks-after-data-breach-exposed-70000-ids/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Discord is facing backlash after announcing that all users will soon be required to verify ages to access adult content by sharing video selfies or uploading government IDs.

According to Discord, it’s relying on AI technology that verifies age on the user’s device, either by evaluating a user’s facial structure or by comparing a selfie to a government ID. Although government IDs will be checked off-device, the selfie data will never leave the user’s device, Discord emphasized. Both forms of data will be promptly deleted after the user’s age is estimated.

In a blog, Discord confirmed that “a phased global rollout” would begin in “early March,” at which point all users globally would be defaulted to “teen-appropriate” experiences.

To unblur sensitive media or access age-restricted channels, the majority of users will likely have to undergo Discord’s age estimation process. Most users will only need to verify their ages once, Discord said, but some users “may be asked to use multiple methods, if more information is needed to assign an age group,” the blog said.

On social media, alarmed Discord users protested the move, doubting whether Discord could be trusted with their most sensitive information after Discord age verification data was recently breached. In October, hackers stole government IDs of 70,000 Discord users from a third-party service that Discord previously trusted to verify ages in the United Kingdom and Australia.

At that time, Discord told users that the hackers were hoping to use the stolen data to “extort a financial ransom from Discord.” In October, Ars Senior Security Editor Dan Goodin joined others warning that “the best advice for people who have submitted IDs to Discord or any other service is to assume they have been or soon will be stolen by hackers and put up for sale or used in extortion scams.”

For bad actors, Discord will likely only become a bigger target as more sensitive information is collected worldwide, users now fear.

It’s no surprise then that hundreds of Discord users on Reddit slammed the decision to expand age verification globally shortly after The Verge broke the news. On a PC gaming subreddit discussing alternative apps for gamers, one user wrote, “Hell, Discord has already had one ID breach, why the fuck would anyone verify on it after that?”

“This is how Discord dies,” another user declared. “Seriously, uploading any kind of government ID to a 3rd party company is just asking for identity theft on a global scale.”

Many users seem just as sketched out about sharing face scans. On the Discord app subreddit, some users vowed to never submit selfies or IDs, fearing that breaches may be inevitable and suspecting Discord of downplaying privacy risks while allowing data harvesting.

Discord’s system is supposed to make sure that only users have access to their age-check data, which Discord said would never leave their phones.

The company is hoping to convince users that it has tightened security after the breach by partnering with k-ID, an increasingly popular age-check service provider that’s also used by social platforms from Meta and Snap.

However, self-described Discord users on Reddit aren’t so sure, with some going the extra step of picking apart k-ID’s privacy policy to understand exactly how age is verified without data ever leaving the device.

“The wording is pretty unclear and inconsistent even if you dig down to the k-ID privacy policy,” one Redditor speculated. “Seems that ID scans are uploaded to k-ID servers, they delete them, but they also mention using ‘trusted 3rd parties’ for verification, who may or may not delete it.” That user seemingly gave up on finding reassurances in either company’s privacy policies, noting that “everywhere along the chain it reads like ‘we don’t collect your data, we forward it to someone else… .’”

Discord did not immediately respond to Ars’ requests to comment directly on how age checks work without data leaving the device.

To better understand user concerns, Ars reviewed the privacy policies, noting that k-ID said its “facial age estimation” tool is provided by a Swiss company called Privately.

“We don’t actually see any faces that are processed via this solution,” k-ID’s policy said.

That part does seem vague, since Privately isn’t explicitly included in the “we” in that statement. Similarly, further down, the policy more clearly states that “neither k-ID nor its service providers collect any biometric information from users when they interact with the solution. k-ID only receives and stores the outcome of the age check process.” In that section, “service providers” seems to refer to partners like Discord, which integrate k-ID’s age checks, rather than third parties like Privately that actually conduct the age check.

Asked for comment, a k-ID spokesperson told Ars that “the Facial Age Estimation technology runs entirely on the user’s device in real time when they are performing the verification. That means there is no video or image transmitted, and the estimation happens locally. The only data to leave the device is a pass/fail of the age threshold which is what Discord receives (and some performance metrics that contain no personal data).”

K-ID’s spokesperson told Ars that no third parties store personal data shared during age checks.

“k-ID, does not receive personal data from Discord when performing age-assurance,” k-ID’s spokesperson said. “This is an intentional design choice grounded in data protection and data minimisation principles. There is no storage of personal data by k-ID or any third parties, regardless of the age assurance method used.”

Turning to Privately’s website, that offers a little more information on how on-device age estimation works, while providing likely more reassurances that data won’t leave devices.

Privately’s services were designed to minimize data collection and prioritize anonymity to comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, Privately noted. “No user biometric or personal data is captured or transmitted,” Privately’s website said, while bragging that “our secret sauce is our ability to run very performant models on the user device or user browser to implement a privacy-centric solution.”

The company’s privacy policy offers slightly more detail, noting that the company avoids relying on the cloud while running AI models on local devices.

“Our technology is built using on-device edge-AI that facilitates data minimization so as to maximise user privacy and data protection,” the privacy policy said. “The machine learning based technology that we use (for age estimation and safeguarding) processes user’s data on their own devices, thereby avoiding the need for us or for our partners to export user’s personal data onto any form of cloud services.”

Additionally, the policy said, “our technology solutions are built to operate mostly on user devices and to avoid sending any of the user’s personal data to any form of cloud service. For this we use specially adapted machine learning models that can be either deployed or downloaded on the user’s device. This avoids the need to transmit and retain user data outside the user device in order to provide the service.”

Finally, Privately explained that it also employs a “double blind” implementation to avoid knowing the origin of age estimation requests. That supposedly ensures that Privately only knows the result of age checks and cannot connect the result to a user on a specific platform.

Some Discord users may never be asked to verify their ages, even if they try to access age-restricted content. Savannah Badalich, Discord’s global head of product policy, told The Verge that Discord “is also rolling out an age inference model that analyzes metadata, like the types of games a user plays, their activity on Discord, and behavioral signals like signs of working hours or the amount of time they spend on Discord.”

“If we have a high confidence that they are an adult, they will not have to go through the other age verification flows,” Badalich said.

Badalich confirmed that Discord is bracing for some users to leave Discord over the update but suggested that “we’ll find other ways to bring users back.”

On Reddit, Discord users complained that age verification is easy to bypass, forcing adults to share sensitive information without keeping kids away from harmful content. In Australia, where Discord’s policy first rolled out, some kids claimed that Discord never even tried to estimate their ages, while others found it easy to trick k-ID by using AI videos or altering their appearances to look older. A teen girl relied on fake eyelashes to do the trick, while one 13-year-old boy was estimated to be over 30 years old after scrunching his face to seem more wrinkled.

Badalich told The Verge that Discord doesn’t expect the tools to work perfectly but acts quickly to block workarounds, like teens using Death Stranding‘s photo mode to skirt age gates. However, questions remain about the accuracy of Discord’s age estimation model in assessing minors’ ages, in particular.

It may be noteworthy that Privately only claims that its technology is “proven to be accurate to within 1.3 years, for 18-20-year-old faces, regardless of a customer’s gender or ethnicity.” But experts told Ars last year that flawed age-verification technology still frequently struggles to distinguish minors from adults, especially when differentiating between a 17- and 18-year-old, for example.

Perhaps notably, Discord’s prior scandal occurred after hackers stole government IDs that users shared as part of the appeal process in order to fix an incorrect age estimation. Appeals could remain the most vulnerable part of this process, The Verge’s report indicated. Badalich confirmed that a third-party vendor would be reviewing appeals, with the only reassurance for users seemingly that IDs shared during appeals “are deleted quickly—in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.”

On Reddit, Discord fans awaiting big changes remain upset. A disgruntled Discord user suggested that “corporations like Facebook and Discord, will implement easily passable, cheapest possible, bare minimum under the law verification, to cover their ass from a lawsuit,” while forcing users to trust that their age-check data is secure.

Another user joked that she’d be more willing to trust that selfies never leave a user’s device if Discord were “willing to pay millions to every user” whose “scan does leave a device.”

            <div id="article-text">At the end of January, Washington, DC, saw an extremely unusual event. The MAHA Institute, which was set up to advocate for some of the most profoundly unscientific ideas of our time, hosted leaders of the best-funded scientific organization on the planet, the National Institutes of Health. Instead of a hostile reception, however, Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the NIH, was greeted as a hero by the audience, receiving a partial standing ovation when he rose to speak.

Over the ensuing five hours, the NIH leadership and MAHA Institute moderators found many areas of common ground: anger over pandemic-era decisions, a focus on the failures of the health care system, the idea that we might eat our way out of some health issues, the sense that science had lost people’s trust, and so on. And Bhattacharya and others clearly shaped their messages to resonate with their audience.

The reason? MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is likely to be one of the only political constituencies supporting Bhattacharya’s main project, which he called a “second scientific revolution.”

In practical terms, Bhattacharya’s plan for implementing this revolution includes some good ideas that fall far short of a revolution. But his motivation for the whole thing seems to be lingering anger over the pandemic response—something his revolution wouldn’t address. And his desire to shoehorn it into the radical disruption of scientific research pursued by the Trump administration led to all sorts of inconsistencies between his claims and reality.

If this whole narrative seems long, complicated, and confusing, it’s probably a good preview of what we can expect from the NIH over the next few years.

Despite the attendance of several senior NIH staff (including the directors of the National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) and Bhattacharya himself, this was clearly a MAHA event. One of the MAHA Institute’s VPs introduced the event as being about the “reclaimation” of a “discredited” NIH that had “gradually given up its integrity.”

“This was not a reclamation that involved people like Anthony Fauci,” she went on to say. “It was a reclamation of ordinary Americans, men and women who wanted our nation to excel in science rather than weaponize it.”

Things got a bit strange. Moderators from the MAHA Institute asked questions about whether COVID vaccines could cause cancer and raised the possibility of a lab leak favorably. An audience member asked why alternative treatments aren’t being researched. A speaker who proudly announced that he and his family had never received a COVID vaccine was roundly applauded. Fifteen minutes of the afternoon were devoted to a novelist seeking funding for a satirical film about the pandemic that portrayed Anthony Fauci as an egomaniacal lightweight, vaccines as a sort of placebo, and Bhattacharya as the hero of the story.

The organizers also had some idea of who might give all of this a hostile review, as reporters from Nature and Science said they were denied entry.

In short, this was not an event you’d go to if you were interested in making serious improvements to the scientific method. But that’s exactly how Bhattacharya treated it, spending the afternoon not only justifying the changes he’s made within the NIH but also arguing that we’re in need of a second scientific revolution—and he’s just the guy to bring it about.

Here’s an extensive section of his introduction to the idea:

I want to launch the second scientific revolution.

Why this grandiose vision? The first scientific revolution you have… very broadly speaking, you had high ecclesiastical authority deciding what was true or false on physical, scientific reality. And the first scientific revolution basically took… the truth-making power out of the hands of high ecclesiastical authority for deciding physical truth. We can leave aside spiritual—that is a different thing—physical truth and put it in the hands of people with telescopes. It democratized science fundamentally, it took the hands of power to decide what’s true out of the hands of authority and put it in the hands of ridiculous geniuses and regular people.

The second scientific revolution, then, is very similar. The COVID crisis, if it was anything, was the crisis of high scientific authority geting to decide not just a scientific truth like “plexiglass is going to protect us from COVID” or something, but also essentially spiritual truth. How should we treat our neighbor? Well, we treat our neighbor as a mere biohazzard.

The second scientific revolution, then, is the replication revolution. Rather than using the metrics of how many papers are we publishing as a metric for success, instead, what we’ll look at as a metric for successful scientific idea is ‘do you have an idea where other people [who are] looking at the same idea tend to find the same thing as you?’ It is not just narrow replication of one paper or one idea. It’s a really broad science. It includes, for instance, reproduction. So if two scientists disagree, that often leads to constructive ways forward in science—deciding, well there some new ideas that may come out of that disagreement

That section, which came early in his first talk of the day, hit on themes that would resurface throughout the afternoon: These people are angry about how the pandemic was handled, they’re trying to use that anger to fuel fundamental change in how science is done in the US, and their plan for change has nearly nothing to do with the issues that made them angry in the first place. In view of this, laying everything out for the MAHA crowd actually does make sense. They’re a suddenly powerful political constituency that also wants to see fundamental change in the scientific establishment, and they are completely unbothered by any lack of intellectual coherence.

The problem Bhattacharya believes he identified in the COVID response has nothing to do with replication problems. Even if better-replicated studies ultimately serve as a more effective guide to scientific truth, it would do little to change the fact that COVID restrictions were policy decisions largely made before relevant studies could even be completed, much less replicated. That’s a serious incoherence that needs to be acknowledged up front.

But that incoherence doesn’t prevent some of Bhattacharya’s ideas on replication and research priorities from being good. If they were all he was trying to accomplish, he could be a net positive.

Although he is a health economist, Bhattacharya correctly recognized something many people outside science don’t: Replication rarely comes from simply repeating the same set of experiments twice. Instead, many forms of replication happen by poking at the same underlying problem from multiple directions—looking in different populations, trying slightly different approaches, and so on. And if two approaches give different answers, it doesn’t mean that either of them is wrong. Instead, the differences could be informative, revealing something fundamental about how the system operates, as Bhattacharya noted.

He is also correct that simply changing the NIH to allow it to fund more replicative work probably won’t make a difference on its own. Instead, the culture of science needs to change so that replication can lead to publications that are valued for prestige, job security, and promotions—something that will only come slowly. He is also interested in attaching similar value to publishing negative results, like failed hypotheses or problems that people can’t address with existing technologies.

Bhattacharya also spent some time discussing the fact that NIH grants have become very risk-averse, an issue frequently discussed by scientists themselves. This aversion is largely derived from the NIH’s desire to ensure that every grant will produce some useful results—something the agency values as a way to demonstrate to Congress that its budget is being spent productively. But it leaves little space for exploratory science or experiments that may not work for technical reasons. Bhattacharya hopes to change that by converting some five-year grants to a two-plus-three structure, where the first two years fund exploratory work that must prove successful for the remaining three years to be funded.

I’m skeptical that this would be as useful as Bhattacharya hopes. Researchers who already have reason to believe the “exploratory” portion will work are likely to apply, and others may find ways to frame results from the exploratory phase as a success. Still, it seems worthwhile to try to fund some riskier research.

There was also talk of providing greater support for young researchers, another longstanding issue. Bhattacharya also wants to ensure that the advances driven by NIH-funded research are more accessible to the public and not limited to those who can afford excessively expensive treatments—again, a positive idea. But he did not share a concrete plan for addressing these issues.

All of this is to say that Bhattacharya has some ideas that may be positive for the NIH and science more generally, even if they fall far short of starting a second scientific revolution. But they’re embedded in a perspective that’s intellectually incoherent and seems to demand far more than tinkering around the edges of reproducibility. And the power to implement his ideas comes from two entities—the MAHA movement and the Trump administration—that are already driving changes that go far beyond what Bhattacharya says he wants to achieve. Those changes will certainly harm science.

There are many potential problems with deciding that pandemic-era policy decisions necessitate a scientific revolution. The most significant is that the decisions, again, were fundamentally policy decisions, meaning they were value-driven as much as fact-driven. Bhattacharya is clearly aware of that, complaining repeatedly that his concerns were moral in nature. He also claimed that “during the pandemic, what we found was that the engines of science were used for social control” and that “the lockdowns were so far at odds with human liberty.”

He may be upset that, in his view, scientists intrude upon spiritual truth and personal liberty when recommending policy, but that has nothing to do with how science operates. It’s unclear how changing how scientists prioritize reproducibility would prevent policy decisions he doesn’t like. That disconnect means that even when Bhattacharya is aiming at worthwhile scientific goals, he’s doing so accidentally rather than in a way that will produce useful results.

This is all based on a key belief of Bhattacharya and his allies: that they were right about both the science of the pandemic and the ethical implications of pandemic policies. The latter is highly debatable, and many people would disagree with them about how to navigate the trade-offs between preserving human lives and maximizing personal freedoms.

But there are also many indications that these people are wrong about the science. Bhattacharya acknowledged the existence of long COVID but doesn’t seem to have wrestled with what his preferred policy—encouraging rapid infection among low-risk individuals—might have meant for long COVID incidence, especially given that vaccines appear to reduce the risk of developing it.

Matthew Memoli, acting NIH Director prior to Bhattacharya and currently its principal deputy director, shares Bhattacharya’s view that he was right, saying, “I’m not trying to toot my own horn, but if you read the email I sent [about pandemic policy], everything I said actually has come true. It’s shocking how accurate it was.”

Yet he also proudly proclaimed, “I knew I wasn’t getting vaccinated, and my wife wasn’t, kids weren’t. Knowing what I do about RNA viruses, this is never going to work. It’s not a strategy for this kind [of virus].” And yet the benefits of COVID vaccinations for preventing serious illness have been found in study after study—it is, ironically, science that has been reproduced.

A critical aspect of the original scientific revolution was the recognition that people have to deal with facts that are incompatible with their prior beliefs. It’s probably not a great idea to have a second scientific revolution led by people who appear to be struggling with a key feature of the first.

Anger over Biden-era policies makes Bhattacharya and his allies natural partners of the Trump administration and is almost certainly the reason these people were placed in charge of the NIH. But it also puts them in an odd position with reality, since they have to defend policies that clearly damage science. “You hear, ‘Oh well this project’s been cut, this funding’s been cut,’” Bhattacharya said. “Well, there hasn’t been funding cut.”

A few days after Bhattacharya made this statement, Senator Bernie Sanders released data showing that many areas of research have indeed seen funding cuts.

Bhattacharya also acknowledged that the US suffers from large health disparities between different racial groups. Yet grants funding studies of those disparities were cut during DOGE’s purge of projects it labeled as “DEI.” Bhattacharya was happy to view that funding as being ideologically motivated. But as lawsuits have revealed, nobody at the NIH ever evaluated whether that was the case; Matthew Memoli, one of the other speakers, simply forwarded on the list of grants identified by DOGE with instructions that they be canceled.

Bhattacharya also did his best to portray the NIH staff as being enthused about the changes he’s making, presenting the staff as being liberated from a formerly oppressive leadership. “The staff there, they worked for many decades under a pretty tight regime,” he told the audience. “They were controlled, and now we were trying to empower them to come to us with their ideas.”

But he is well aware of the dissatisfaction expressed by NIH workers in the Bethesda Declaration (he met with them, after all), as well as the fact that one of the leaders of that effort has since filed for whistleblower protection after being placed on administrative leave due to her advocacy.

Bhattacharya effectively denied both that people had suffered real-world consequences in their jobs and funding and that the decision to sideline them was political. Yet he repeatedly implied that he and his allies suffered due to political decisions because… people left him off some email chains.

“No one was interested in my opinion about anything,” he told the audience. “You weren’t on the emails anymore.”

And he implied this sort of “suppression” was widespread. “I’ve seen Matt [Memoli] poke his head up and say that he was against the COVID vaccine mandates—in the old NIH, that was an act of courage,” Battacharya said. “I recognized it as an act of courage because you weren’t allowed to contradict the leader for fear that you were going to get suppressed.” As he acknowledged, though, Memoli suffered no consequences for contradicting “the leader.”

Bhattacharya and his allies continue to argue that it’s a serious problem that they suffered no consequences for voicing ideas they believe were politically disfavored; yet they are perfectly comfortable with people suffering real consequences due to politics. Again, it’s not clear how this sort of intellectual incoherence can rally scientists around any cause, much less a revolution.

Given that politics has left Bhattacharya in charge of the largest scientific funding agency on the planet, it may not matter how the scientific community views his project. And it’s those politics that are likely at the center of Bhattacharya’s decision to give the MAHA Institute an entire afternoon of his time. It’s founded specifically to advance the aims of his boss, Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and represents a group that has become an important component of Trump’s coalition. As such, they represent a constituency that can provide critical political support for what Bhattacharya hopes to accomplish.

Unfortunately, they’re also very keen on profoundly unscientific ideas, such as the idea that ivermectin might treat cancer or that vaccines aren’t thoroughly tested. The speakers did their best not to say anything that might offend their hosts, in one example spending several minutes to gently tell a moderator why there’s no plausible reason to think ivermectin would treat cancer. They also made some supportive gestures where possible. Despite the continued flow of misinformation from his boss, Bhattacharya said, “It’s been really great to be part of administration to work for Secretary Kennedy for instance, whose only focus is to make America healthy.”

He also made the point of naming “vaccine injury” as a medical concern he suggested was often ignored by the scientific community, lumping it in with chronic Lyme disease and long COVID. Several of the speakers noted positive aspects of vaccines, such as their ability to prevent cancers or protect against dementia. Oddly, though, none of these mentions included the fact that vaccines are highly effective at blocking or limiting the impact of the pathogens they’re designed to protect against.

When pressed on some of MAHA’s odder ideas, NIH leadership responded with accurate statements on topics such as plausible biological mechanisms and the timing of disease progression. But the mere fact that they had to answer these questions highlights the challenges NIH leadership faces: Their primary political backing comes from people who have limited respect for the scientific process. Pandering to them, though, will ultimately undercut any support they might achieve from the scientific community.

Managing that tension while starting a scientific revolution would be challenging on its own. But as the day’s talks made clear, the challenges are likely to be compounded by the lack of intellectual coherence behind the whole project. As much as it would be good to see the scientific community place greater value on reproducibility, these aren’t the right guys to make that happen.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Steven Spielberg directed two of the best alien films of all time: E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Now he’s going back to those roots, as it were, with his latest blockbuster film, Disclosure Day. A full-length trailer aired during the Super Bowl LX broadcast last night.

Per the (deliberately vague) official premise: “If you found out we weren’t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to 7 billion people. We are coming close to… Disclosure Day.”

The trailer doesn’t tell us much more than the logline. It opens with a newscast announcing the pending public release of “government material long shrouded in secrecy.” We see a shot of a man standing in the middle of a crop circle that definitely wasn’t made by humans. A little girl encounters a seemingly sentient deer in her bedroom as a voiceover wonders whether there could be “others.” And what’s with putting electrodes on people’s temples so that their eyes change color? We’ll find out in June.

David Koepp, who has worked with Spielberg on numerous projects (including Jurassic Park and War of the Worlds), wrote the screenplay. Emily Blunt stars as a TV meteorologist in Kansas City. Her co-stars include Josh O’Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, Elizabeth Marvel, Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Michael Gaston, and Mckenna Bridger. Professional wrestlers Chavo Guerrero Jr., Lance Archer, and Brian Cage will also appear.

Disclosure Day hits theaters on June 12, 2026.

And for those eagerly awaiting the May 22, 2026, release of The Mandalorian and Grogu, we give you this 30-second glimpse of our favorite bounty hunter and his ward in a sled pulled by Tauntauns. We still don’t have much information about that plot either, but at least it’s a known property thanks to the hit TV series. Plus, we get a suitably sonorous voiceover by none other than Sam Elliott: “Sometimes we choose our path, other times the path chooses us. Through it all, we keep pushing forward, driven by a deeper purpose, guided by an unseen force. The journey never gets any easier; the bond just gets harder to break. This is the way.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ferrari has published images of the interior of its forthcoming electric vehicle, which it designed with LoveFrom, the new firm of former Apple star Jony Ive and another legendary designer, Marc Newson. The Italian sports and racing car maker is taking a careful approach to revealing details about its first battery EV, signaling a depth of thought that goes well beyond simply swapping a V12, transmission, and fuel tank out for batteries and electric motors. Indeed, the interior of the new car—called the Ferrari Luce—bears little family resemblance to any recent Ferrari.

Instead, LoveFrom appears to have channeled Ferrari interiors from the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s, with a retro simplicity that combines clear round gauges with brushed aluminum. Forget the capacitive panels that so frustrated me in the Ferrari 296—here, there are physical buttons and rocker switches that seem free of the crash protection surrounds that Mini was forced to use.

The steering wheel now resembles the iconic “Nardi” wheel that has graced so many older Ferraris. But here, the horn buttons have been integrated into the spokes, and multifunction pods hang off the horizontal spokes, allowing Ferrari to keep its “hands on the wheel” approach to ergonomics. Made from entirely CNC-milled recycled aluminum, the Luce’s wheel weighs 400 g less than Ferrari’s usual steering wheel.

The binnacle that houses the main instrument display is actually two overlapping OLED screens. The analogue dials are displayed by the rear-most of the two, appearing through cutouts as if they were traditional dials from Veglia, Smiths, or Jaeger (or the clock on your iPhone). The infotainment screen is on a ball joint that allows it to be oriented toward the driver or passenger as necessary, an interesting feature that other automakers would do well to study (and perhaps copy).

And Corning’s latest “Fusion5” glass has been used for the key (which also incorporates e-ink) and the shifter section of the center console, where “lasers were used to make tiny holes in the glass half the width of a human hair to deposit the ink for the graphics with the perfect level of uniformity.”

We learned other details last year when we went to Maranello in Italy. At the front axle, the car sports a pair of 140 hp (105 kW) electric motors, one for each wheel. At the rear, there are more powerful 415 hp (310 kW) motors for each wheel, each with its own inverter; in total, peak output is 1,113 hp (830 kW). That’s powered by a 122 kWh battery pack, capable of giving the Luce a 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) time of 2.5 seconds and a top speed of 192 mph (310 km/h).

Clever electronics will control the chassis dynamics via fast-reacting coilover spool dampers, and the sound will be amplified from pickups in the drivetrain, similar to how an electric guitar uses pickups to amplify the vibration of its strings.

Now we wait until May, when Ferrari will finally show off the exterior.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/report-imminent-apple-hardware-updates-include-macbook-pro-ipads-and-iphone-17e/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s 2026 has already brought us the AirTag 2 and a new Creator Studio app subscription aimed at independent content creators, but nothing so far for the company’s main product families.

That could change soon, according to reporting from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. New versions of Apple’s low-end iPhone, the basic iPad and iPad Air, and the higher-end MacBook Pros are said to be coming “imminently,” “soon,” and “shortly,” respectively, ahead of planned updates later in the year for the iPad mini, Studio Display, and other Mac models.

Here’s what we think we know about the hardware that’s coming.

Apple is apparently planning to launch an updated iPhone 17e, a new version of its basic iPhone. The phone is said to include an A19 chip similar to the one in the regular iPhone 17, and it will also add MagSafe charging. Though the iPhone 17e will likely stick to the basic one-lens camera system and the notched, Dynamic Island-less screen, it will also launch at the same $599 price as the current 16e, which counts as good news given current AI-driven RAM and storage shortages.

This would be a change in how Apple approaches its lower-end iPhone. The old iPhone SE was updated pretty sporadically, with at least a couple of years between each of its updates. The iPhone 16e was introduced just last year.

The biggest question is whether the 17e will continue to exist alongside the older but arguably superior iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, which start at just $100 more than the current iPhone 16e and include a dual-lens camera system and the Dynamic Island. Having four different iPhone models available in the same $600-to-$800 price range is confusing at best.

This one’s easy: The M4 Pro and M4 Max versions of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros will be replaced by M5 Pro and M5 Max versions.

We’ve been expecting new MacBook Pros for a while now, ever since the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro launched in the fall without higher-end M5 Pro and M5 Max models. Shipping estimates for the current M4 Pro- and M4 Max-based MacBook Pros have been lengthening lately, which is sometimes a sign that manufacturing is winding down ahead of a new model.

Though larger updates to the MacBook Pro are said to be in development at Apple, including models with OLED display panels and possibly touchscreens, the M5 versions will largely stick to the same designs Apple has been using since it introduced the M1 Pro and M1 Max MacBook Pros in late 2021.

Gurman says new Mac Studio models are also in the works, as are Mac minis, an update for the Studio Display, and the long-rumored “low-cost MacBook” that Apple is said to be planning to fill a gap in its laptop lineup. Apple has sold the old M1 MacBook Air through Walmart in the US for as low as $599 in recent years, an experiment that has apparently convinced the company that there’s room in its laptop lineup for a computer that comes in well below the $999 baseline it has used for most of its laptops over the last two decades.

Apple’s next iPad upgrades will also apparently be of the “change the processor and not much else” variety. But this will still be a relatively big deal for the basic $349 iPad, which Gurman says is stepping away from the current Apple A16 chip to an Apple A18, first seen in the iPhone 16 series in late 2024.

We can’t say for sure how much faster the A18 will be than the A16—Apple sometimes uses versions of its chips with extra CPU or GPU cores disabled for the low-end iPad—but the chip will still add Apple Intelligence support to the low-end iPad for the first time. The A16 iPad stood out among Apple’s 2025 hardware releases as one of the few that did not support Apple Intelligence. If the A18 iPad supports it, that also suggests that the iPad will come with 8GB of RAM for the first time, which will be useful for multitaskers even if you don’t care about the current slate of Apple Intelligence features or the pending “more intelligent Siri.”

The report also says Apple is preparing an iPad Air update that uses an M4 processor instead of the current M3. The M4 iPad Pro launched nearly two years ago (alongside an M2-based iPad Air), so an M4 iPad Air will hardly break any speed records. But a new chip will keep the tablet feeling reasonably fresh while we wait for a version with an updated design or a better screen.

Gurman says the iPad mini will also get an update at some point this year—among other improvements, it will allegedly switch to an OLED display panel. But it sounds like Apple is planning to launch it later in the year, sometime after the A18 iPad and the M4 iPad Air.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Sun unleashes a torrent of charged particles. Some of them slam into the Earth’s atmosphere, triggering breathtaking auroras in the night sky.

But for equipment that’s orbiting our planet in outer space, solar weather can quickly turn into a major headache. The particles have been shown to wreak havoc on the on-board electronics of satellites, endangering their mission and longevity.

As part of an effort to bring the study and testing of the phenomenon in-house, SpaceX is now developing its own particle accelerator in Florida. The planned facility is a cyclotron, which can accelerate individual protons to near the speed of light, allowing them to study how radiation affects their spacecraft, including its broadband-beaming Starlink satellites.

SpaceX’s VP of Starlink, Michael Nicolls, confirmed the news in a tweet last week, announcing that the company is “hiring elite engineers at our new 230 [Meta-electronvolt] cyclotron facility in Florida, where we are bringing single-event radiation testing in house to accelerate development across all SpaceX vehicles.” (Meta-electronvolts, or MeV, are a commonly-used unit to measure the amount of kinetic energy that a single particle can gain.)

Put simply, cyclotrons use a magnetic field to bend the path of charged particles into a circular shape, allowing them to be accelerated to high energies. The idea is to blast these particles at certain materials to simulate the effects of space radiation here on Earth.

Job pages posted to ZipRecruiter suggest the goal is to study how computer chips react to a bombardment of highly energetic particles.

“This proton particle accelerator will be used to screen and characterize electronics across all of our vehicles and platforms, unlocking unprecedented agility for chip and [Printed Circuit Board Assembly] level performance characterization that will be critical as we build and scale our AI constellations and deep space exploration vehicles,” reads a posting for an Electronics Test Engineer.

“As a member of our fast-paced Radiation Effects team, you will be responsible for ensuring avionics hardware performance across our fleet of vehicles (Dragon, Falcon, Starship, Lunar Human Landing System, etc.) and satellites (Starlink, Starshield) through some of the harshest and varied radiation environments imaginable,” the job posting reads.

At 230 MeV, SpaceX’s cyclotron would be quite powerful — but with less than the juice than the 590 MeV Ring Cyclotron at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, which is considered the most powerful in the world by beam power. (CERN’s Large Hadron Collider is not a cyclotron, but a different type of particle accelerator called a synchrotron.)

SpaceX’s Starlink satellites have already had to endure the damaging effects of space weather, particularly during solar storms. These bursts of electromagnetic activity in orbit have been found to shorten the lifespans of Starlink satellites, causing them to de-orbit much sooner than expected.

Beyond orbit, conditions get even more extreme. Well past the protective boundaries of the Earth’s atmosphere, which extends thousands of miles beyond our planet’s surface, spacecraft are exposed to the full brunt of space radiation — a major challenge for missions into deep space, crewed or uncrewed.

While the risks to electronics are considerable, scientists are still studying the effects of space radiation on the human body as well. Astronauts are exposed to 2.6 times as much radiation on the surface of the Moon, for instance, as they would be when spending the same amount of time on board the International Space Station.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just over a year ago, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made it abundantly clear he was not interested in visiting the Moon.

In January 2025, the height of his bromance with president Donald Trump, he tweeted that the “Moon is a distraction,” asserting instead that “we’re going straight to Mars.”

He has lambasted NASA’s efforts to return to the lunar surface, accusing its Artemis program of being “extremely inefficient as it is a jobs-maximizing program, not a results-maximizing program.”

For many years now, Musk has made it his number one goal to establish a city on Mars, using 1,000 of the company’s Starship rockets in an interstellar colonization effort that was supposed to kick off back in 2024.

Having completely missed that goal, the mercurial entrepreneur appears to have had a major change of heart, contradicting his earlier statements by arguing that the plan is now to go to the Moon and build a city there after all.

As it turns out, the Moon is far easier to settle than Mars, a plan that will likely prove a much easier pill to swallow for his investors — yet another instance of Musk significantly moving the goalposts after years of bluster and hype.

“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than ten years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” he tweeted on Sunday.

The richest man in the world’s colony on the Moon has become priority number one, since the “overriding priority” is to secure the “future of civilization” — and getting to the Moon, which is many orders of magnitude closer to us than Mars, is “faster.”

The timing of the admission is particularly noteworthy. Following the space company acquiring Musk’s CSAM-distributing AI startup xAI earlier this month, the goal is to go public at an eye-watering and record-breaking valuation of $1.25 trillion.

It’s unclear whether Musk’s abrupt reversal was in any way related to potential investor pressure ahead of the IPO, but given his enormous personal interest in going all-in on Mars — the Moon be damned — it’s a tectonic shift in priorities.

SpaceX’s role in NASA’s return to the surface of the Moon remains unclear. The space agency initially tapped Musk’s company’s Starship to deliver astronauts to the lunar South Pole from orbit. In October, however, NASA officials suggested the agency may opt for SpaceX’s competitor, Blue Origin instead, given ongoing technical issues hampering Starship’s development.

NASA’s Artemis 3 mission, the first planned crewed Moon landing in over half a century, is currently scheduled for 2028, but whether SpaceX can get Starship functional by then remains unknown.

The company has yet to successfully launch the mammoth rocket to space and then successfully land, let alone demonstrate in-orbit refueling capabilities, which will be critical for Starship to visit the Moon and eventually Mars.

In his latest tweet, Musk said that SpaceX hadn’t given up on Mars, but won’t start work on plans for a city there for another “five to seven years.”

Even on his social media platform X, which largely functions as an echo chamber of his most vocal supporters, his latest missive fell on flat ears.

“You could actually use some of those obscene billions of dollars of money to improve life here on Earth,” reads one reply, which received over 200 likes. “You know, reclaim desserts [sic] since you seem to love inhabitable places so much.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Artificial intelligence has taken the medical device industry by storm — even adding a layer of complexity to the operating room that’s resulting in patients being hurt, some health professionals claim.

As Reuters reports, the TruDi Navigation System by device maker Acclarent was designed to treat chronic sinusitis, inflammation of the nasal sinuses, by inserting a tiny balloon to enlarge the sinus cavity openings.

But ever since the company added AI to the device, the US Food and Drug Administration has received at least unconfirmed 100 reports of malfunctions and adverse events, including at least ten instances of patients being injured.

While it’s still unclear what role AI played in these instances, the resulting injuries can be grim, from the punctured base of a patient’s skull to cerebrospinal fluid leaking from one another’s nose, per the reports.

Two victims who say they’ve experienced strokes following their sinuplasties involving the TruDi Navigation System have since sued the device’s maker, Acclarent, which has since been acquired by Integra LifeSciences. The plaintiff in one of the cases, Erin Ralph, accused the company of having the device mislead surgeon Marc Dean during a 2022 procedure, causing him to injure a carotid artery, leading to a blood clot and eventually a stroke.

The AI is used in the TruDi Navigation System to confirm the position of the devices inside the patient’s head.

“The product was arguably safer before integrating changes in the software to incorporate artificial intelligence than after the software modifications were implemented,” one of these suits alleges, as quoted by Reuters.

The second lawsuit was filed by Donna Fernihough, whose carotid artery allegedly “blew,” causing blood to spray “all over,” and resulting in her experiencing a stroke the same day.

Acclarent “knew or should have known that the purported artificial intelligence caused or exacerbated the tendency of the integrated navigation system product to be inconsistent, inaccurate, and unreliable,” Fernihough’s case alleges.

The suit also accused Acclarent of lowering “its safety standards to rush the new technology to market” and setting “as a goal only 80 percent accuracy for some of this new technology before integrating it into the TruDi Navigation System.”

Integra LifeSciences pushed back, telling Reuters that “there is no credible evidence to show any causal connection between the TruDi Navigation System, AI technology, and any alleged injuries.” Acclarent denied allegations in both suits, which are still ongoing.

Nonetheless, these instances illustrate how the operating room is quickly being overtaken by AI, a trend that started long before the advent of large language models (LLMs) like the ones powering ChatGPT. For instance, machine-learning algorithms have been used to screen for diseases like cancer in medical scans for decades.

We’ve already seen reports of AI-powered medical instruments falling victim to the known shortcomings of the tech. For instance, a recent study found that two-thirds of more than 12,000 patients identified as having heart failure by an AI-enhanced stethoscope didn’t actually have heart failure.

We’ve also seen LLM-based chatbots designed to give medical advice to real-world patients experience widespread hallucinations. Experts also warn that doctors are losing the ability to identify cancer in scans due to the reliance on AI-powered detectors.

Whether regulatory oversight is there to ensure patients don’t get hurt by AI medical devices remains a subject of heated debate. Devices using AI don’t even have to be used in clinical trials before being approved by the FDA. Instead, many device makers point to previously authorized devices before adding AI to them, according to Reuters.

Worse yet, the Trump administration’s enormous cuts to the FDA’s budget have led to dozens of AI scientists being laid off or encouraged to leave, adding plenty of pressure to those who remain.

“If you don’t have the resources, things are more likely to be missed,” a former device reviewer told Reuters.

Meanwhile, the FDA has doubled down on the tech, outsourcing oversight duties to LLMs to “fuel innovation” and accelerate drug approvals.

Most recently, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Mehmet “Doctor Oz” Oz gloated over “robots” that can do anything from performing ultrasounds on pregnant women and “wands” that can determine “whether the child’s OK or not.”

“And frankly, I don’t have to see the image,” he said. “I just have to know if the image is good enough to tell me the child doesn’t have a problem.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.

According to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.

“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”

Five hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.

“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.

The subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.

“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.

As DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.

“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”

When uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.

When Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.

“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”

“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”

Credit where it’s due, though: Google delayed handing over Jon’s data long enough for the ACLU to challenge the subpoena on his behalf, though it didn’t explain why. Of course, that meant DHS agents still tracked down his address some other way — part of a growing trend of federal agencies surveilling and harassing random people who haven’t even been arrested, let alone convicted of a crime.

            <div id="article-text">Health professionals have long had to deal with patients who inadvisably shoved a whole range of foreign objects up their behinds, often requiring medical intervention to retrieve them.

It’s a surprisingly common issue. According to a 2023 study, there are around 4,000 cases a year of both male and female individuals visiting emergency departments for what the researchers euphemistically termed “rectal foreign bodies.”

Now, in a twist to the age-old story that even the writing room of “Grey’s Anatomy” couldn’t have come up with, a man in France was rushed to the operating room after staffers at the Rangueil Hospital in Toulouse found out he had shoved a 37mm brass-and-copper “collectible shell” that was used by the Imperial German Army during World War 1 up his rectum.

As Agence France-Presse reports, officials had to call in a bomb disposal team and evacuate the hospital after the man was admitted over the weekend. Firefighters were called in as well to “ensure fire protection during the bomb disposal team’s intervention.”

Fortunately, emergency teams later confirmed that the “explosive device has been neutralized,” ending the unusual incident.

The unnamed man is 24 years old and could be facing legal action for handling “category A munitions,” an officer told the Daily Mail.

Beyond being found inside people’s rectums, around 1.5 billion shells were fired during World War 1, according to the Military Times. The ordnances are still being collected to this day.

Amazingly, it’s somehow not the first time a Frenchman has been rushed to the hospital after shoving a shell up his behind. In late 2022, an 88-year-old stuck a World War 1 artillery shell in his rectum; surgeons at a hospital in Toulon, France, were forced to make an incision in his abdomen to retrieve the ancient relic.

The discovery was understandably a major surprise at the time.

“An apple, a mango, or even a can of shaving foam, we are used to finding unusual objects inserted where they shouldn’t be,” one ER doctor told French newspaper Var-Matin. “But a shell? Never!”

In an even more potentially dangerous ploy, a man in England managed to lodge a two-inch wide World War 2 anti-tank shell where the Sun don’t shine, forcing a hospital in Gloucester to also call in a bomb disposal team.

The man told officials at the time that he allegedly “slipped and fell” on the ordnance.

            <div id="article-text">Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs have become an enormously popular way to lose weight. And with generic, much cheaper versions of the medications on the horizon, their use could soon grow even further.

But apart from being a clinically proven way to shed pounds — at least temporarily — along with a whole constellation of other health benefits, the drugs also turn out to be a major strain on the environment.

As detailed in a new paper published in the journal Nature Sustainability, researchers from the University of Melbourne investigated how the process of producing peptides — short chains of amino acids that aren’t just used for GLP-1 agonists, but plenty of other drugs and treatments as well — releases huge amounts of organic solvents and other plastic byproducts that don’t break down on their own in nature.

Fortunately, the researchers say they’ve come up with a much more environmentally friendly procedure that could make producing peptide-based treatments far more sustainable in the long-run.

So far, they’ve been manufactured using a technique called “solid phase peptide synthesis,” or SPPS, which anchors the first amino acid building block to a synthetic resin, such as polystyrene beads. Toxic solvents — including dimethylformamide, a component of paint strippers — are then used to add each amino acid one by one, which can then leak into the water supply.

The scale of the issue is considerable. As the lead author of the Nature Sustainability paper and University of Melbourne chemistry professor John Wade wrote in a piece about his research, the annual production of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight loss drugs such as Ozempic, is currently generating upwards of 123 million pounds of toxic solvent waste. And that’s just one of more than 80 peptide-based drugs on the market.

The materials involved are also expensive and difficult to get rid of, thanks to tight environmental regulations.

“Why are we still making life-saving medicines using chemical processes that produce mountains of toxic waste, and could water — the cleanest and most familiar solvent of all — offer a way out?” Wade asked rhetorically.

In response, the researcher and his colleagues came up with a water-based solution to synthesize peptides. By pairing amino acids with specific salts, they found they could overcome limitations associated with SPPS, allowing them to dissolve them in water “at high concentrations while remaining fully functional.”

An activating agent combined with a biodegradable material could allow for “efficient peptide synthesis entirely in water,” the professor argued.

It remains to be seen whether the process can be scaled up industrially, but given the wide proliferation of GLP-1 agonists, it’s critical to investigate ways of making manufacturing processes more sustainable.

“What began as a shared concern among three long-time international collaborators has become an exciting technology with the potential to reshape how some of the most important medicines of our time are made,” Wade wrote. “Cleanly, responsibly and ready for the future.”

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI on Monday announced it’s beginning to test ads in the U.S. for users on its Free and Go subscription tiers.

The newer Go plan is a low-cost subscription at $8 per month in the U.S. and was introduced globally in mid-January.

Subscribers to OpenAI’s paid plans, including its Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers, will not see ads, the company said.

OpenAI sought to address concerns about how ads might affect the user experience, stating in a blog post: “Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you, and we keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers. Our goal is for ads to support broader access to more powerful ChatGPT features while maintaining the trust people place in ChatGPT for important and personal tasks.”

The move, which the company announced last month, drew ridicule in a series of Super Bowl ads that ran on Sunday from a top rival, Anthropic.

In its TV commercials, Anthropic poked fun at the idea that some AI companies, like OpenAI, would soon include advertising by showing how poorly integrated ads could disrupt the consumer experience. This was portrayed on screen by glassy-eyed actors playing AI chatbots, who would deliver their advice alongside a poorly targeted ad.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman got extremely testy about the jabs, calling the ads “dishonest” and Anthropic an “authoritarian company.”

Consumers have so far resisted the idea of ads in AI responses. OpenAI faced a backlash late last year when it tested app suggestions that looked like unwanted ads. Still, the AI company needs to generate revenue from its popular chatbot to cover the costs of developing its technology and growing the business.

While understandable, critics fear that ads could influence ChatGPT’s answers. OpenAI denies this in its announcement, saying that ads will be optimized based on “what’s most helpful to you.” The company says ads will also always be clearly labeled as sponsored and separated from the organic content.

In tests, OpenAI has tried matching ads to users based on the subject of their conversations, past chats, and previous ad interactions. For instance, users researching recipes might see ads for grocery delivery services or meal kits, the company says. OpenAI said advertisers won’t have access to user data, only aggregate information about ad performance, like views and clicks.

Users will also be able to view their history of interactions with ads and clear it at any time. Plus, OpenAI said users can dismiss ads, share feedback, view why they were shown an ad, and manage ad personalization settings.

Ads won’t be shown to users under 18, nor will they be placed near sensitive or regulated topics like health, politics, or mental health.

            <h2>Lidar-maker Ouster buys vision company StereoLabs as sensor consolidation continues</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/lidar-maker-ouster-buys-vision-company-stereolabs-as-sensor-consolidation-continues/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lidar-maker Ouster has acquired StereoLabs, a company that makes vision-based perception systems for robotics and industrial applications, for a combination of $35 million and 1.8 million shares.

The deal is the latest in a march towards consolidation among perception sensor suppliers. Just last month, MicroVision bought the lidar assets of the buzzy-but-now-bankrupt Luminar for $33 million. Ouster itself has played the M&A game a fair amount, too. In 2022, the company merged with rival player Velodyne. The year before that, it bought lidar startup Sense Photonics.

This consolidation is happening right as companies and investors rush to build businesses around “physical AI” — a broad term that encompasses everything from humanoid robotics and drones to self-driving cars and automated systems in warehouses. Even more obscure suppliers are raising big funding rounds as these technologies develop. Some startups are even trying to spin up entirely new sensor modalities.

Ouster cofounder and CEO Angus Pacala told TechCrunch in an interview that he had been eyeing StereoLabs for years. He said he sees lidar as “the core component of safety-critical, capable systems,” but that he wanted to “move up the stack.”

The “obvious additional sensors” to start working with in addition to lidar, Pacala said, are cameras. Pacala said 15-year-old StereoLabs is “best in class” on the hardware side, but he was especially drawn to how the company has been getting the most out of those cameras by being “incredibly savvy in adopting the cutting edge of AI models and edge compute.”

In particular, Pacala highlighted StereoLabs’ development of a foundational AI model that can determine depth of objects from stereo cameras.

“It was a no brainer for us to go out and approach them and basically pitch this vision of working with us to become a unified sensing and perception platform — a tier one [supplier] for these advanced physical AI systems,” Pacala said.

Despite the focus on integration, Ouster said StereoLabs will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary.

And while the hype has been feverish, Pacala said he didn’t buy StereoLabs simply because of the attention and money being thrown at physical AI. In fact, he committed maybe the gravest sin one can during a hype cycle: he poured some cold water on the buzz, especially around humanoid robotics.

“The business model here is not to just sell the fervor, it’s to actually make working systems that are certified, that are safe, that are really solving customer problems,” he said. “There’s going to be a little bit of disillusionment in physical AI as it turns out that it’s much longer time to market for all these humanoids.”

Pacala isn’t the only one trying to take a realistic view. In a recent interview with TechCrunch, MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos said the sensor industry is “ripe for consolidation” because he believes there isn’t enough revenue to support all the current competition.

“You’re going to get consolidation, or you’re going to get kind of a weeding out of the industry as people fall to the wayside,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Musicboard, an app for music discovery and recommendations, has been struggling, according to its users. Over the past several months, users said the app experienced outages, the website went offline, and the Android app disappeared from the Play Store.

This has concerned its devoted, if small, user base. (The app has been downloaded around 462,000 times to date, according to market intelligence provider Appfigures.) On Reddit, users have been recommending alternatives and offering each other support as they wait for any update.

While it’s not surprising for an app to shut down, when there’s still an active user base, apps typically provide some sort of communication from their operators. But Musicboard users say they haven’t heard anything, leaving them to reach out to the press for help getting in touch with someone, if only to let them export their data.

Some users organized an unofficial “Help Save Musicboard” initiative to bring more attention to the matter. The group is led by the Musicboard user known as Lavarini and run by volunteers.

TechCrunch contacted Musicboard to help these users get some answers and was provided a short statement. However, the statement didn’t explain the longer-term issues and dismissed the outages as “temporary downtime.”

The statement, shared from the Musicboard team email address and signed simply as “Musicboard,” said the following:

App is not shut down. The servers had temporary downtime, which has now been quickly fixed. And we’re working together with the Google Play team to get the app back up there. The app wouldn’t shut down without a respectful timeline for the users and official communication. App is staying live.

The founders of Musicboard, Johannes Vermandois and Erik Heimer, have been involved with other projects. Their AI app, Frank AI, was set to be acquired by a company called Freedom Holdings, Inc., but the potential acquirer terminated its letter of intent in September 2024. Dreamsands, Inc., the company that publishes Frank AI on the App Store, also operates another app, Helm, an AI therapist.

Over email, Lavarini says the users’ efforts to help save the app will continue.

The Help Save Musicboard initiative “aims to support awareness and discussion around the long-term sustainability of the indie app Musicboard and its community,” Lavarini wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There appears to be no stopping legal AI startup Harvey’s skyrocketing growth, with VCs continuously throwing money at it. The company is reportedly in talks to raise another $200 million at an $11 billion valuation led by Sequoia and Singapore’s GIC, sources told Forbes.

If the deal closes, Harvey’s valuation would jump by $3 billion in a matter of months. In December the company confirmed it had raised $160 million at an $8 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz last fall. (Harvey declined to comment on its potential new raise.)

Back in June, it announced a $300 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins and Coatue. A few months before that, in February 2025, it gobbled up a Sequoia-led $300 million Series D at a $3 billion valuation.

The startup, which offers an LLM AI for law firms, hit an annual recurring revenue rate of $190 million by the end of 2025, founder CEO Winston Weinberg shared on LinkedIn. That was up from a $100 million ARR in August (depending on what the company means by ARR), so that’s nearly double the contracted revenue in less than six months.

How has it become one of the breakout winners of AI enterprise applications? Weinberg recently told TechCrunch’s editor-in-chief Connie Loizos an incredible story of how the company originally claimed the hearts of Silicon Valley’s powerhouse VCs.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprise resource planning software company Workday announced Monday that chief executive Carl Eschenbach was stepping down and leaving the company’s board, effective immediately. Workday co-founder and former CEO Aneel Bhusri will return as CEO.

Eschenbach joined Workday in December 2022 as co-CEO alongside Bhusri and had been operating as the company’s sole CEO since February 2024. Bhusri, who had led the company since 2009 — sometimes as co-CEO, sometimes as sole CEO — has been serving as the company’s executive chairman since 2024.

Workday confirmed to TechCrunch that Bhusri is returning to the role permanently, as opposed to taking the helm during a search for a replacement.

Workday says it made this leadership change to focus on its next chapter, which, unsurprisingly, is AI.

“We’re now entering one of the most pivotal moments in our history,” Bhusri said in the company’s press release Monday. “AI is a bigger transformation than SaaS — and it will define the next generation of market leaders. I’m energized to return as CEO, working alongside our presidents Gerrit Kazmaier and Rob Enslin, and I’m excited about the opportunity in front of us.”

Last February, Workday laid off 8.5% of its headcount, or 1,750 people, with Eschenbach stating at the time that the company needed a new approach to labor in the age of AI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lyft launched teen accounts on Monday, a product that allows minors as young as 13 to hail a ride without an adult in 200 U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and New York.

The official launch comes two weeks after Lyft CEO David Risher announced on X plans to open the ride-hailing service to teenagers.

Like its rival Uber, which also offers teen accounts, the new Lyft service comes with a number of guardrails. Only a parent or guardian can create a teen account, according to Lyft. Drivers who are matched with these underage passengers must meet additional criteria and pass yearly background checks. Teens can also bring guests along for the ride, as long as the parent has given permission, according to Lyft.

Lyft has also baked in features like PIN verification, audio recording, and real-time tracking to allow parents to see where their teen is during their ride. Parents who want to sign up their teen can go to the app, select their profile at the bottom right of the screen, then tap “Lyft Teen.” From here, parents can enter the teen’s contact info and add a shared payment method to cover teen rides. Once confirmed, the teen will receive a text message with a unique sign-up link.

Lyft is playing catch-up with Uber and even Waymo, which offers teen accounts in its robotaxi service area in Phoenix. Uber tested teen accounts as early as 2017 but didn’t roll out a commercial product until spring 2024 in more than a dozen cities in the U.S. and Canada. Uber has since added numerous other U.S. markets, as well as dozens of other countries. Last year, Uber started testing out teen accounts in several cities in India, as well.

Lyft’s new teen account is one of numerous new products and expansions that Risher has introduced at the company since he took the CEO spot. Lyft has made a handful of autonomous vehicle partnerships, including with May Mobility, Austrian manufacturer Benteler, and Holon, Tensor Auto, and autonomy provider Mobileye.

The company has also pushed into Europe with its $197 million acquisition of German multi-mobility app Freenow from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility. The acquisition opened up the European market to Lyft for the first time.

Last night, during Super Bowl halftime, I watched a mustachioed entertainer put on a show that celebrated working-class values, the pleasures of a good party, and the virtues of marriage, with a side serving of grievance against elites. This wasn’t Bad Bunny’s performance—it was the alternative performance put on by Turning Point USA, led by Kid Rock. Despite the best efforts of the organizers to stoke controversy, I couldn’t help but notice how much overlap there was between its message and the one the Puerto Rican superstar delivered in Santa Clara.

As my colleague Spencer Kornhaber writes, Bad Bunny’s show was unifying rather than divisive, but it did have a political message: that working hard, playing hard, and loving America aren’t values that belong to any political group or linguistic heritage. Although Turning Point’s show was intended to offer a radical contrast, the many thematic convergences only strengthened that argument.

Above all, the Turning Point show was boring and dour. It kicked off with a distorted-electric-guitar rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” a Jimi Hendrix pastiche shorn of all the irony and pathos of the famous version at Woodstock. Brantley Gilbert played “Real American,” a bland piece of nu-metal/country patriotic kitsch, and “Dirt Road Anthem,” a paean to drunk driving. Gabby Barrett, a former American Idol third-place winner, sang a kiss-off to a cheater and then a love song to “one of the good ones.”

More overtly political, at least in theory, was Lee Brice’s “Drinking Class.” “I’m a member of a blue-collar crowd / They can never, no, they can’t keep us down,” he sang. “Monday through Friday, man, we bust our backs.” This is a common sentiment in contemporary country music, but it is not, despite what Brice might believe, unique to white conservatives. The New York Times  wrote that Bad Bunny “was summoning a Latin heritage across generations, one that recognized hard work—cane-cutting, electric-grid repairs—alongside the good times workers sweated to earn.”

These kinds of echoes were all over the two shows. Kid Rock extolled marriage, singing, “You can always put a diamond on her hand / ’til you can’t,” and Charlie Kirk, the assassinated founder of Turning Point, was heard encouraging marriage in an old audio clip; Bad Bunny actually hosted a real wedding during the middle of his performance. Both shows used “real” instruments as signifiers of authenticity—workmanlike performances on guitars and drum kits for the Turning Point set (except from Kid Rock, who appeared to be lip-synching his 1999 hit “Bawitdaba”); a brass salsa band and the characteristic Puerto Rican cuatro during Bad Bunny’s.

“We fly that red, white, blue, high, waving all across the land,” Gilbert sang. Bad Bunny flew that red, white, and blue too, along with flags from Puerto Rico and other countries in North and South America, declaring, “God Bless America.” The fact that the patriotism he displayed was more complicated and nuanced that Gilbert’s does not make it any less genuine. Bad Bunny even danced atop a pickup truck, a visual that would have worked perfectly for any of the Turning Point performers if they hadn’t been playing on a darkened, austere soundstage.

Each show also had its complaints about mistreatment by elites, but not all grievances are equally legitimate. During “El Apagón,” Bad Bunny performed atop imitation power poles topped with sparking transformers—a symbol of Puerto Rico’s fragile power grid, and of the political corruption and imperial neglect that let it get that way. But while the Jumbotron behind Bad Bunny at Levi’s Stadium declared The only thing more powerful than hate is love, Brice delivered swipes at liberals and trans people in a new song called “Country Nowadays,” which nonetheless complained that “because I have my morals and my small-town point of view / You assume that you don’t like me means that I don’t like you too.” Could that be because of your lyrics?

This unearned sense of grievance is what animated the backlash to Bad Bunny’s performance and inspired Turning Point’s alternative show. Right-wing pundits charged that Bad Bunny’s message would be divisive (it wasn’t) or that he was an immigrant (he’s not). President Trump ranted about the show on Truth Social, writing that it was “absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America,” adding that “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting.” Laura Loomer was more straightforward in her condemnation: “This isn’t White enough for me,” she posted on X.

If the people participating in the Bad Bunny backlash slowed down and looked a little closer, they might find that they actually have a great many values in common with him. (Well, maybe not Loomer. Some Bad Bunny critics are just bigoted.) This might provide the grounds for just the sort of understanding and reconciliation that Brice claims to want. Other Americans will notice, however, how familiar and relatable Bad Bunny’s ethos was, even if they couldn’t understand his Spanish-language lyrics.

Almost as important as the message of Bad Bunny’s show was the exuberance with which he conveyed it: Living these American values could be joyful, he suggested. It was, as Spencer wrote, a performance “rooted in the good old-fashioned pleasure principle.” Meanwhile, the Turning Point musicians sang about having a good time, but they didn’t appear to be having a good time. If right-wing leaders wonder why MAGA has struggled to overtake the country’s cultural establishment, they might start with the very different ways the two shows framed shared values.</div>

            <div id="article-text">You won’t find this in Cortina d’Ampezzo over the next few weeks, but for several decades of the Olympics’ history, the contest awarded medals not just for sport but for art too.

In the Summer Games from 1912 to 1948, musicians, painters, and plenty of other aesthetes went brain-to-brain in events such as lyric poetry and chamber music. “Town planning” was even contested one year under the umbrella of the architecture competition.

Lest you think the arts’ inclusion odd—one wonders what muscles need stretching before going for gold in watercolor—the submissions had to be at least about sports.

The Olympic committee ought to bring these events back. Well, maybe not town planning—but add trivia to the mix instead. Organizers can throw in a few sports questions for good measure, but with trivia, if you’re not working up a sweat thinking, you’re not doing it right.

And by the way, did you know that humans have a bone that does not connect to any other? We think of the skeleton as pretty contiguous, but in the middle of the neck, the hyoid bone, which supports the base of the tongue, is articulated only distantly to the rest of the skeleton by muscles and ligaments. It is, as scientists call it, a “floating bone.”

Because it’s not readily attachable, the hyoid is often left off of model skeletons. High-end ones hang it with string or wire.

You know how to select a good avocado (squeeze) or watermelon (slap); now, next time you’re skeleton shopping, you’ll be able to pick a winner.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Super Bowl has become a game of such monumental excess that it poses a test within a test: Which NFL team can screen out the lavish absurdities, the gorging on celebrity and commerce, the insipid questions about favorite flavors and foods, and avoid becoming warped and overwearied before the ball is even kicked off? This year, that team was the Seattle Seahawks, a defensive-minded, unshowy bunch who had no use for indulgences as they defeated the New England Patriots, 29–13.

The Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold, who broke the game open in the fourth quarter with a 16-yard scoring pass to A. J. Barner to bring the lead to 19–0, is a onetime bust, playing on his fourth team in four years. Six of his fellow starters on the 53-man squad had been considered so untalented in high school that the national ranking service Rivals had not even bothered rating them. Twenty members of the team were undrafted free agents, eight of whom signed just this season. They were players accustomed to digging success “out of the mud,” as the receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba told me last week—an attitude that helped them ignore the spectacle around them.

The cheapest seat in Santa Clara, California’s, Levi Stadium was listed on StubHub for more than $4,000. VIPs in the luxury suites were offered a specially concocted $180 LX Hammer Burger, a grotesquerie of beef shank, mirepoix demi-glace, and blue-cheese fondue poured over brioche buns, with an enormous steak bone sticking out of the top. Was the bone a souvenir, to be taken home and dried on the mantel? Or was it to be fed to the hounds at the hearth? Or maybe it was meant to be tossed in the air like a boomerang at the military jets that did the pregame flyover, led by the enormous B-1 Lancer, a supersonic bomber aptly nicknamed “The Bone.” Lighter fare included $40 Dungeness-crab nachos layered over hand-cut potato chips. A can of domestic beer, to wash it down, cost $17.50.

For the week leading up to the game, the San Francisco Bay Area was overlit, ear-splitting, and teeming with corporate pop-ups, including an Abercrombie & Fitch fashion show and a concert featuring Green Day and Counting Crows at Pier 29. A team had to have “stamina” to deal with it, find a way to play well amid the scale and spectacle, the Patriots’ coach, Mike Vrabel, said in a press conference after the game, water-eyed with disappointment. Smith-Njigba estimated that the number of his family and friends who came to town and needed tickets was “in the teens.” At the Intercontinental Hotel in San Francisco, fleets of black Escalades lined the block to pick up “brand ambassadors” who’d come to town to hawk Bud Light, State Farm, UberEats. A promotional robot-dog was stationed by the front door, immobile yet menacing, stopping pedestrians in their tracks. Cardi B, said to be dating Stefon Diggs, a Patriots receiver, visited the Intercontinental on Saturday and encountered a different robot—this one a full humanoid—at the door. She gave it a lap dance in front of passersby, who captured the scene with cellphones as the robot accidentally toppled onto her.

Every day the press corps descended on both teams with pestering questions, some of which were obvious plants to promote products. “What’s your favorite color of Gatorade?” someone asked the Patriots’ 23-year-old quarterback, Drake Maye, a kid-faced North Carolinian who was finishing only his second year in the NFL. He replied that he liked “the purple one.” Somebody else asked him if he liked dorilocos, a Mexican street food. Maye asked, “What’s those? Is it spicy? I like Doritos.”

It must have all been a little overwhelming for an adored phenom such as Maye, who would have been the youngest man ever to win a Super Bowl, had he not given up two interceptions and been sacked six times by a tremendous Seahawks defense that nicknamed itself “The Dark Side.” Maye has attained folk-hero status in Boston for his combination of on-field flair and off-field charm, as has his wife and middle-school sweetheart, Ann Michael, nicknamed the “Queen of the North.” Her TikTok cooking videos have attracted hundreds of thousands of viewers and are high comedy for their contrast with the previous football couple to rule New England, the legendarily clean-eating, well-clad Tom Brady and his beauteous supermodel ex-wife, Gisele Bundchen. Ann Michael makes spaghetti with jarred sauce and appears on camera with a shiny forehead and damp hair. Her game-day bean-dip recipe with Bush’s Baked Beans includes half a cup of Coca-Cola; the video for it got 1.5 million views. When she baked jalapeño-and-cheddar sourdough bread, she said, “Okay. Okay. It’s a little dense.” One viewer wrote in response, “Gisele never believed in letting us eat any bread.”

Years before he joined the Seahawks, Darnold had been that popular—for a minute. Drafted out of the University of Southern California by the New York Jets, in 2018, he was considered the future of the franchise. Dealing with the hectoring racket of New York fans may well have prepared him to withstand the noise of the Super Bowl. He threw an interception on the first play of his career. As he struggled through predictable rookie unevenness and adjustments, the New York press and fans were merciless. One tabloid called Darnold “an anxiety-riddled, shell-shocked, panic-stricken mess.” The Jets’ management lost faith in him too quickly, and he was traded to the Carolina Panthers in 2021, then went to the Minnesota Vikings, then to the San Francisco 49ers, before landing in Seattle.

The son of a medical-gas plumber who worked night shifts, Darnold just kept laboring at his craft. “I learned,” he told reporters last week. “I learned a ton from the mistakes that I made early on in my career.” By the end of this season, he was so respected by the Seahawks for his pure doggedness, he was practically their mascot. “He’s a really cool case study,” the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator, Klint Kubiak, told me. In the team’s final press conference before the game, the receiver Cooper Kupp wore an I Love Sam Darnold T-shirt. “Find me another player, another quarterback specifically, who’s had the start of a career like he has,” Kupp said. “To be counted out like he’s had, and be able to come back and do what he has done.”

Darnold was emblematic of a team perspective that “when bad things happen, good things happen, you gotta use that to be a world champ,” Smith-Njigba said to reporters after the game. “You gotta believe you’re a world champ before you’re a world champ.” As the Seahawks hoisted the trophy on the field, amid the gigantism and confetti cannons and surfeit on display, a sense of perspective seemed to have been restored.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hurry, hurry, hurry! Everybody, to the bunker! It is halftime at the Super Bowl, and what is happening on the field is un-American in a way I won’t specify!

Isn’t Bad Bunny an American artist? Don’t millions of people love his music? Didn’t he just win the Album of the Year Grammy? No time, no time! We must get into the bunker quickly for the All-American halftime!

Is the president going to watch with us? What kind of a question is that! Imagine the president not watching the Turning Point USA All-American Halftime Show, streaming live on the Turning Point channel on YouTube (but not X.com, due to last-minute technical difficulties) on or around 8 p.m. ET, during the Super Bowl. If there’s one thing we know about President Donald J. Trump, it’s that what’s good enough for his devoted fans is exactly what he likes best himself, and he absolutely will not just tune in to the Super Bowl and watch the actual halftime show. Don’t worry—he is right there with us, fiddling with YouTube as we are!

Shh! Here comes Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, with a special welcome message about “this halftime show that the War Department is proud to support!” Hey, Pete threw a football! God, he’s cool. Cool isn’t being comfortable in your own skin. Cool is making your whole family watch … a guy in a backward baseball cap, red sneakers, and skinny jeans play the national anthem on the electric guitar in what appears to be a sealed bunker.

Heck yeah! Now we’re talking! One thing I always think about the Super Bowl halftime show is, This could be indoors. And this is the most indoors anyone has ever looked. Is this live from the mines of Moria? Is this the president’s new, extra-secure vault under the East Wing? Either way, you can tell it’s cool because, again, the cap is backward.

What do you mean Bad Bunny just fell through a roof, there was a wedding, and Pedro Pascal is there? Who cares? In the bunker, Lee Brice, the singer of the 2014 hit(?) “The Drinking Class,” is debuting a special new song with lyrics about how hard it is to be country in this country nowadays!

What is America nowadays? Let the lyrics from this wondrous patriot extravaganza (not to be confused with the Super Bowl itself, a Patriot blowout) explain it to you! “Old Glory’s on a can. / And everything’s made in the U.S.A. / Hand on your heart when the song gets played.” What do Americans want? “To catch my fish, drive my truck, drink my beer / and not wake up to all this stuff I don’t want to hear.” America is a man who cheated on you getting cheated on himself! Whereas a good American man is “a phone call to his parents. He’s a Bible by the bed.” America is an ill-advised rap breakdown: “I sit back and think about them good ol’ days. The way we were raised and our southern ways.” That’s my country!

Yes, I know. I know Bad Bunny is a U.S. citizen. You know what I’m trying to say. He’s Puerto Rican. Yes, I know Puerto Rico is part of America. But. You know. You know what I’m saying. A real American artist would speak English. Or at the very least, recently translated German. Like the DHS X account.

This isn’t a dog whistle. That’s my smoke alarm. I’m burning the nachos! No, Nachos are all-American. Yeah, I’m pretty sure. Well, the way I make them, they are. Have some salsa. Yes, it’s mild.

It’s nice to be here, watching this all-American halftime show, with all the real Americans. You know we outnumber the people watching the other show? Yeah. Five million to 135 million. (It helps if we don’t count all of them as people.)

Come down, come down, where it’s nice and dark and safe, and hear Kid Rock perform not once, but twice! Don’t worry: This concludes with a memorial of Charlie Kirk, so if anyone criticizes it online, that person will be removed from their position, drawn, and quartered!

So. For, confusingly, even more minutes than halftime lasts, please enjoy only what is safe to enjoy! No one will bang down your door for watching this! No agents of the state will yank you out of a stadium for bopping along to this! Play this as loud in your car as you’d like!

Now put your hands together for: Kid Rock, again and again! Forever! Singing “Bawitdaba”! Or, well, jumping around while it plays! Far more important that the performer not be, well, you know—you know—than that the performance be complete, outdoors, or live. Mr. Rock is jumping around the stage in shorts! He is wearing a hat! Did Bad Bunny wear a cool hat like Mr. Rock? Did Bad Bunny also frequently adjust the hat?

No, no, no, no, no! Do not answer that! Don’t you dare Google it!

We must not see how the rest of the country is living. We must not allow ourselves to suspect that they are America too.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a Wednesday evening in mid-June, Ralph Coolman, a small-business owner and accomplished athlete, set out to run a 5K in Ventura, California. He quit after a mile, and spent the next few days afflicted by nausea, indigestion, and exhaustion. His wife, Erika, a nurse and an athlete herself, figured he had the flu. But on Saturday morning, Ralph began breathing rapidly. She rushed him to an urgent-care center, where a doctor put him on oxygen and sent him to the emergency room. Four or five hours after he arrived, Ralph was dead of a heart attack at the age of 62. Shortly after, Community Memorial Hospital told Erika his care would cost roughly $270,000.

“We always had insurance—always,” Erika told me. But when Ralph got sick, she was in the process of changing jobs. Erika initially did not opt to cover Ralph on the COBRA plan she was using as a stopgap, because he was going to purchase individual coverage. She later changed her mind and sent a check in to cover his premium. The insurer “ended up adding two months on for me” instead of adding her husband, she told me. “I didn’t find out until it was too late.” Ralph was uninsured when he died, thanks to the complexity of the American insurance system. That left his family on the hook for an enormous bill they couldn’t begin to understand, again thanks to the complexity of the American health-care system.

While grieving, Erika had to put together her husband’s memorial service, try to keep his business afloat, and handle the mundane bureaucracy of death: legal certificates, beneficiaries, account issues, estate management. “Ralph thought he was invincible,” Erika told me. “He didn’t make any preparations.” Matt Rosenberg, Erika’s brother-in-law, added, “It’s really hard to see paperwork through tears.”

After Erika tried and failed to appeal the COBRA issue, she was inclined to pay the hospital what she could “and be done with it,” Rosenberg told me. “I was like, no, no, no. That’s what they count on—people making big decisions in confusing moments. Send me everything. I will deal with it. We’re not going to be those people. I’m not scared of a fight.”

The Coolman family had experienced a sudden trauma and ended up enmeshed in what Chad Maisel of Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive think tank, and Neale Mahoney, an economist at Stanford, call “the annoyance economy” in a new study: “the steady grind of small hassles that eat away at our time, patience, and wallets,” turning simple interactions into “fraught ordeals, leaving people feeling overwhelmed, ignored, or jerked around.”

To be sure, consumers have never had an easier time spending their money. You can choose from among millions of films on your iPhone in an instant, buy a plane ticket to Bali in minutes, get a restaurant meal delivered in an hour, and have a full house’s worth of furniture placed in your home in a few days. Yet businesses have also embedded countless frictions into the consumer experience. You might expect such hassles in health care, but they’re everywhere. We live in a world of “total bureaucracy,” as the anthropologist David Graeber put it. Our grandparents bought goods and services outright, but we purchase subscriptions and rentals and insurance coverage and contracts, handling rebates and intermediaries and applications and enrollment periods. As of 2018, the country had 826,537,000 consumer-arbitration agreements in force, one study found. And that’s an undercount.

“Companies have worked really hard to make it easy for you” to spend, Lindsay Owens, the executive director of Groundwork, told me. “Of course, when it comes to trying to get out of a purchase or out of a subscription, the same design choices are flipped and reversed.” She likened digital consumer platforms to Las Vegas casinos. Designers create colorful playgrounds with flashing lights and free drinks and chandeliers and mirrors and water features, where gamblers never know what time it is and never see a path to the exit.

The American government doesn’t help the situation. Washington wraps essential programs in red tape, forcing millions of people who have lost a job, lost their insurance coverage, developed a disability, given birth to a child, gotten divorced, or slid into poverty to pay a tithe in paperwork before accessing aid. The government shuns universal, direct services and opts for subsidies, grants, credits, and loan guarantees. It works through nonprofits and contractors and subgovernments, so people rarely know what is on offer and who is actually providing it. Washington underinvests in agile digital systems. (Why on earth does part of the Social Security website have business hours?) It declines to provide the automatic services many other wealthy countries do, such as free tax preparation. It shifts the work of public administration onto the public, creating “time taxes,” as I call them, everywhere.

Moreover, the government allows or even encourages private businesses to entrap customers in bureaucratic mazes. As Graeber argued, Washington “provides the legal framework” and “the elaborate mechanisms of enforcement.” The American government lets insurers deny necessary medical procedures, just as it lets hospitals make up prices and hide them from patients. It lets employers foist extortionate contract terms on workers. It lets airlines and gyms and multilevel marketing companies and landlords and time-share businesses and auto companies and banks and telecoms swindle their customers with fine print.

Maisel and Mahoney decided to try to count the hours lost to this “total bureaucracy” and tally up the annual cost to the public: $8 billion for robocalls, $25 billion for phone scams, $22 billion for phone calls (just phone calls!) with insurance administrators, $90 billion for junk fees, $19 billion for medical waiting times, $2 billion for governmental wait times. The annoyance economy saps American families of $165 billion a year, they estimated. And that’s an undercount.

Rosenberg, who works in marketing consulting, was determined to get his sister-in-law’s bill down. He was willing to spend his time negotiating. He asked the hospital for an itemized bill. The hospital offered the Coolmans a discount, knocking the total down to a little less than $200,000. Rosenberg asked for the itemized bill again. The hospital sent him a document with proprietary procedure codes, “meaning I couldn’t look them up anywhere. They only existed inside the hospital’s computer.”

The family kept trying to speak with a human being in the billing office. “The person we were supposed to be talking to kept ignoring us,” Erika said. “At one point, she admitted that she wasn’t taking care of us, and blamed it on the fact that they had gotten new computers five months before.” Eventually, Community Memorial provided Rosenberg with a “complicated form filled with boxes for codes and procedures and costs and patient information and hospital information and all kinds of things that no human being can understand.”

Rosenberg fed the document into Claude, an AI system, and asked it to figure out what Medicare would have paid for his brother-in-law’s care, while also flagging any confusing or questionable codes. After some back-and-forth with the chatbot, Rosenberg realized that the hospital might have over- and double-billed the family. Medicare likely would have reimbursed the hospital $28,675 for the services Ralph actually received. Claude helped Rosenberg write a stern letter, calling Community Memorial’s pricing practices “unconscionable” and noting that it had marked up certain tests by 2,300 percent. In the end, Erika Coolman and Community Memorial agreed on a total of $32,000. (The hospital declined to comment.)

The AI system equalized the asymmetries between institution and individual, Rosenberg told me. “Claude could search the Medicare rules and regulations in a way that I could have, I guess, but it would have been time-consuming, tedious, and I probably would have given up.” Others have used Claude and ChatGPT to help them negotiate with their internet providers, write letters to airlines, understand employment contracts, and slash through the fine print on retail deals.

Yet powerful institutions are adopting AI too, pushing those asymmetries right back up again and creating new ways for companies to screw over the public. Consumers are shuffled to chatbots instead of human agents. AI algorithms track customers and present them with different prices and contract terms. “Algorithms could make life easier,” Owens said. “But it is dizzying to think about the additional shifts coming.”

The only solution is for the government to do its job. It should require companies to act transparently. And it should protect consumers from extractive administrative practices. Granted, voters rarely make it to the polls or switch their political affiliation to support click-to-cancel rules and arcane insurance regulations. But restrictions on robocalls and hidden fees are among the most popular policy proposals out there, on a bipartisan basis; two-thirds of Americans think that Congress should address these time-wasting, income-sapping frustrations.

This winter, Erika started getting a new round of bills from providers involved in Ralph’s care. “That wasn’t good,” she said. Now the family is just refusing to pay.</div>

            <h2>Does America Really Want to Pick a Fight With Greenland?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/02/greenlanders-are-ready-fight/685931/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Greenlanders own a lot of guns: more than 35,000 long rifles, on an island of 56,000 people. Everyone I met there in January knew how to hunt. And more than one person made clear to me that they were ready to stand their ground against a possible American invasion.

“I have 10 hunting rifles,” Finn told me when I visited his home in Nuuk. (He asked me to withhold his full name because “taking credit for things is not the Greenland way.”)  “I am a decent shot,” he added, “but not as good as my friends, who can hit a seal in the water at 200 meters, from a moving boat.”

Nuuk, a city of no more than 20,000 people, is serviced by one of very few runways in a wilderness more than three times the size of Texas. Finn was born there, to a Danish father and an Inuit mother. “You must know,” he told me—after we’d sat for an hour or so over tea and salted musk ox, and he had come to trust that I was not one of the “other” Americans—“that I will defend my home.”

The “other” Americans had also been to visit. In early 2025, right-wing influencers roamed downtown Nuuk, handing out $100 bills to children and telling them to pose for cameras while wearing free MAGA swag. I, too, encountered a group of children—on a climb up the tallest hill (in Ohio we would call it a mountain) overlooking the capital. Four kids scampered past. “We don’t like Trump!” they said on hearing my accent.

Looking down on the airfield below, I was struck by the forbidding topography. Steep, snow-covered mountains flanked the icy fjords. The word that came to mind was desolate. Jacob Kaarsbo, one of my climbing companions, was a former Danish intelligence officer and an expert on Greenland’s defense.

“There are only a handful of runways that we have to defend,” he told me. “And in the north,” he added, “there are villages where the next living soul is 1,000 miles away.” Danish special forces maintain a presence in those wild expanses. Monthslong expeditions known as Sirius Patrol rely on sled-dog teams, and serve to remind any interloper that Greenland is not for the taking.

President Trump recently mocked the sled-dog teams. But in the frozen North, the only vehicles that can operate reliably are sleds pulled by dogs. People have tried using machines, but the cold turns oil to sludge, and when machines fall through ice, they can’t be pulled out. If a sled breaks through, it floats long enough to be recovered. If dogs and men fall through, they pull themselves out, drag their sleds onto thicker ice, and carry on.

Two hours north of the capital sits a fishing village accessible only by boat. We left Nuuk’s port before sunrise, and once we were in the fjord, we navigated past slabs of ice until we reached the settlement. Most of Greenland’s inhabitants live in towns like this: a one-room schoolhouse, a chapel, a lone medic equipped to treat only minor injuries. Anyone with a serious health issue has to be evacuated to Nuuk by boat. As we approached the dock, a small hunting party was casting off.

The village may be one of the most isolated in the world. But even there, people asked me: “What does America want?” By their reckoning, Greenlanders already provided everything the United States could want. “Is it true,” one of the villagers asked, “that your president has a ‘psychological need’ to own us?” Some in the village wanted to believe that Trump had never said this, that the reports were fake.

Throughout the settlement, I noticed animal carcasses nailed to the sides of homes. Most were small game—birds and hares—but I also saw a quartered reindeer. This was the local method of refrigeration, and the villagers survived on subsistence hunting. I found myself thinking about the gun culture back home—performative, based on a myth of self-sufficiency. In this Greenlandic village, gun ownership was rooted in the requirements of an unforgiving environment. Walking back to the boat, I saw a blood trail that led up from the dock. The hunting party had been successful.

Trump’s posture toward Greenland has had a very real impact on the people who live there. Three nights before my visit, the power failed in Nuuk. One woman I spoke with was convinced that the Americans were coming. Many of her friends thought the same. “Venezuela,” she said. “The first thing the Americans did was cut the power.” The next morning, calls to the mental-health crisis line in Nuuk spiked.

Part of me wondered whether this was an overreaction. Then Orla Joelsen, a local guide, showed me a building that sat mostly empty in the center of town.

“It is waiting,” Joelsen said, “for the Americans.”

The U.S. government has long maintained a minimal presence in Nuuk: one permanent consular representative and a handful of other staff. That has been more than enough for as long as anyone can remember. Now the U.S. has leased this new building, which it has yet to occupy, and which covers tens of thousands of square feet, with enough office space for more than 100 people. To the locals, the facility looms as the likely headquarters for a coming occupation.

The Greenlanders I met will not submit easily. They seemed ready to fight, and more than capable. Greenlandic and Danish authorities were also preparing. Warships from Denmark arrived at the harbor during my visit. My guide told me that until recently, he had never seen guards at the port, where heavily armed Danish soldiers now checked vehicles entering and leaving. “It is not because of the Russians,” Joelsen said. “It is because of the Americans.”

In late January, the Greenlandic government posted an alert advising all residents to prepare to “fend for yourself for five days if a crisis arises.” The notice included recommendations on stockpiling medicine, batteries, and fuel, as well as tips on surviving without power or water. Similar circulars have been issued before, in anticipation of major storms and other natural events. But this one included something new: “Consider access to hunting weapons.” That was a call to arms.

“The more people who can fend for themselves and help others, the stronger we stand as a society,” the alert added. “Do what you can and help those around you. Fortunately, we are good at that.”

In Nuuk, stores were running low on ammunition, not because people were afraid of one another, nor because they needed that much ammo to hunt. “The bullets are for the Americans,” one local told me, “if they come.” He assured me that the government was working to replenish the depleted ammunition supply.

The Greenlanders I met were warm and welcoming, but not without a fierce pride. Their ancestors had carved a civilization out of the ice with tools made from whalebone and meteorite fragments. They’d hewn garments from cured whale intestine, sealskin, and thick polar-bear fur—still the warmest insulation on Earth. Today’s Greenlanders are prepared to defend what they have built here.

“If we are pushed,” Finn told me, “we are ready to die.”

That’s a fight America has no reason to pick. It’s also one that America could lose.</div>

First of all, why would it give better results? Agents do not have the capacity to understand how one part of the code interacts with another.

Also, I&#39;m guessing it would have taken 32 weeks with one single agent. Probably not interesting to anyone willing to foot the bill.

Congratulations on reimplementing the wheel with a new set of bugs and security issues, useless tools, and no support, all while wasting time, money, and energy.

For architectures that lack working hardware, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to take an existing front-end like gcc or clang and just generate a back-end for the targeted hardware?

When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claudeâ(TM)s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files.Not only was Claude trained on a lot of different C compilers, including the entirety of GCC, it still needed a golden model in order to finish.If I claimed I had written my own C compiler from scratch and then this came out in an interview, I don&#39;t think I would be hired.

There are a few because it&#39;s a profitable market. They tend to identify as women though because women typically don&#39;t want to read romance novels written by men.

I listen to schlock military sci-fi series on Audible (guilty pleasure) and was worried that the author might stoop to releasing AI-generated slop, but so far it&#39;s been good. I do suspect some of it may be AI-assisted but it&#39;s really hard to tell. I am worried that these kinds of serials are going to be gutted with third-rate prose sooner or later. I wonder what it will mean to us as a culture when we are just consuming statistically probable constellations of words for entertainment, despite the fact that

How will people be able to tell that it&#39;s AI generated?  In particular, before they buy it.I suppose readers can blacklist authors&#39; names once they notice, although whitelisting will probably work better in the long run.

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any requirement that a publisher disclose the use of AI tools. You just have to trust them. For now, at least, it should be easy to tell that something is AI-generated because it gets repetitive and inconsistent. However, if you use it as a tool just for filling in pre-planned blocks of text and with careful editing, I bet you could &quot;write&quot; something formulaic in record time and not have to disclose anything to your readers.

At least Audible has a good return policy, so if you find some

> Google assured it would not commercialize a product under the same name -- then filed a trademark application in Tonga

I guess a trademark beats &#39;assurance&#39; ?That summary was gibberish, probably because the original article was hard to understand.  But if I understand it correctly, the article appeared to say that Google used the phrase &quot;Google Flow&quot; as a product name in 2025, and assured Autodesk that they would never change it to just &quot;Flow&quot; (without the &quot;Google&quot; part), then dropped the &quot;Google&quot; and applied for a trademark — first in Tonga, then in the U.S.It took a fair amount of effort to extract that detail from the article, and unless I missed something subtle, the article didn&#39;t clearly specify whether Autodesk&#39;s trademark is on &quot;Flow&quot; or &quot;Autodesk Flow&quot;, nor whether Google&#39;s trademark is on &quot;Flow&quot; or &quot;Google Flow&quot;.  I guess folks could do the trademark search if they&#39;re curious, but I would have expected those details to be much more clearly spelled out in the article.As for me, I just wanted to understand why Autodesk asked Google for assurance that they would not commercialize a product called &quot;Flow&quot; if Google had not already released such a product.  The &quot;Google Flow&quot; versus &quot;Flow&quot; detail was critical to understanding the summary, and should have been right up at the top of the article, too, but instead was buried in a quote from Autodesk&#39;s lawyers.  My guess is that the original article&#39;s authors didn&#39;t fully understand the lawyers&#39; claim, and as a result, the article was just one editor quote trim away from making no sense at all.My newswriting prof would have run away screaming.

A search on the UK&#39;s Intellectual Property Office trademark database shows 714 registrations of the word &quot;flow&quot; between 1st January 2020 and 9th February 2026, but those are for specific logo designs, not the word &quot;flow&quot;.

There&#39;s also an absolutely wonderful animated movie called Flow [wikipedia.org].  Seems like Google really doesn&#39;t care about trademarks and confusing people.

Trademarks, especially those for common words like Flow will typically only be granted for a narrow scope of protection.Yes, always true.
Trademarks are based on both their distinctiveness and secondary meanings acquired through use. The more generic or descriptive the term the less likely they&#39;ll be found to be valid. Words with no prior meaning (Kodak, Xerox, etc) have the strongest protections. Not quite as good but still strong are combinations or allusions to other things (WordPerfect, Netflix, Comic-Con) and they tend to get into nasty legal fights (&quot;Sand Diego Comic-Con&quot; owning &quot;Comic-Con&quot;, fighting against &quot;Salt Lake

They&#39;re desperate for loans that they won&#39;t have to pay back.

Bonds typically have an interest payment associated with them. I suspect even at 100 years, the interest rate will be so high Google will pay the bonds face value at least once every 20 years, if not more frequently.

This looks like desperation to me. If I were an investor I&#39;d be looking at it as evidence Google&#39;s about to seriously decline and maybe pull out of them in general.

I suspect even at 100 years, the interest rate will be so high Google will pay the bonds face value at least once every 20 years, if not more frequently.Yes, but you have to factor in inflation. Well, really, you should look at the cost of money. Given that few companies survive 100 years, this would appear to be a risky &quot;investment&quot; that is unlikely to return real value in the long term, unless the interest rates are very high.

... I&#39;ll consider buying one when there&#39;s less than 20 years left to maturity.

If tech stocks and crypto isn&#39;t risky enough for you. Pick up some century bonds ahead of a massive market correction, potentially the largest one in living memory. The volatile inflation rate and geopolitical instability is an added bonus to the lifetime of excitement and drama a 100-year bond can bring you.

Yep, Alphabet will be around in 100 years, yes? You have to be smoking pretty good weed to believe that.

Bonds have priority in liquidation. It doesn&#39;t matter if Google is still here. The first people to get paid if things go south are the bond holders, not the stock holders.

At liquidation, each bond holder will receive one obsolete Nvidia GPU for every $1,000 in bond face value.

Considering that those few companies that make a profit with AI actually don&#39;t need &quot;state of the art&quot; GPUs... that may be a fair deal.

Bonds have priority in liquidation.Priority above shareholders, but below secured creditors, the IRS, etc..

Priority above shareholders, but below secured creditors, the IRS, etc..

I mean, if they pay a vig like you pay your local loanshark, then this would be a cool deal.

That&#39;s the most compelling evidence I&#39;ve seen so far, that AI insiders really think their businesses are bubbles. Maybe it really isn&#39;t a bubble, but if you think that, you&#39;re going against Google&#39;s analysis of the situation.

The bankruptcy idea is a bad one.  That is, if your company sells bonds because they think it is going bankrupt, that just makes it worse.  You have more debtors and that means stock holders get nothing.

It does however make a lot of sense to take out long term loans if you believe interest rates are really low and inflation/interest rates are going to sky rocket..

Better to sell a bond at 4% today, rather than having to pay 20% a decade from now.

Current Fed effective interest rate is a bit under 4%.  Lowest

Several US “100-year” style bonds did go bust, usually because the issuer collapsed long before the century was up.

The pattern is boringly consistent: railroads, municipalities, and a few grand infrastructure dreams that assumed the future would politely cooperate.

The classic failures were railroad bonds in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Railroads loved ultra-long maturities because they matched the lifespan of tracks and bridges.

Investors loved them because “America is growing forever”.

When railroads went bankrupt, bondholders were wiped out or forced into deep restructurings decades before maturity.The bonds did not reach year 100, they died with the issuer.

Municipal century bonds also failed. Cities like Detroit issued very long-dated bonds in the early 1900s. Detroit’s 2013 bankruptcy showed the flaw in the idea that cities are immortal.Holders of long-dated Detroit paper took severe haircuts.Again, the bonds existed on paper, but the promise of 100 years was fiction.

Public utility bonds failed too.Electric, gas, and water companies issued ultra-long bonds assuming stable monopolies.When regulation changed, companies collapsed or were reorganised, and the bonds defaulted or were converted at a loss.

The lesson history teaches very clearly is that a 100-year bond is not about maturity, it is a bet on institutional survival.

In the US, corporations and cities routinely die before a century passes.

Governments with monetary sovereignty USUALLY don’t but there ARE exceptions.

Imperial Russia, bonds repudiated after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, investors got nothing despite full monetary sovereignty before collapse.

Germany, Weimar-era hyperinflation destroyed bond value after WWI, later Reich debt was restructured or written down after WWII.

Austria-Hungary, imperial sovereign bonds died with the empire in 1918, successor states refused to honour joint debt.

China, imperial and republican bonds were repudiated after 1949 by the PRC, continuity of the state was rejected.

Argentina, repeated sovereign defaults and restructurings since 2001 show monetary sovereignty does not prevent long-dated bond losses.

Google really missed an opportunity to sell a 10^100-year bond.  What were they thinking??

Once upon a time, the Bank of England sold bonds that *never* matured.  The whole point of owning them was to have a stream of interest income that would continue in perpetuity.  They were called &quot;consols.&quot;  The US government sold consols for a while too.  While they never matured, they could be called in and repaid at the issuers option, and they all have been.

In 100 years, will any of us be here? Much less, a corporation?

Imagine, if you will, a 100-year bond sold by Standard Oil in 1900.  Wikipedia says Standard Oil was split into 39 successor entities.  In 2000, which of them pays it back?

A lot can happen in 100 years.  If you pay actual money for this bond, you will richly deserve all of it happening to you.

To mitigate tort liability and preserve financial partnerships.

Reducing legal exposure and looking good for their business partners.

Once they went corporate, it was only a matter of time.

after death there are no more issues to solve also, what&#39;s your point?

Because they want to collect all your ID data.

Most probably you are correct. I just killed my discord profiles.

None of that tawdry barrier stuff for you! Discord needs you NOW!

My answer (even in the form of a question) doesn&#39;t seem to be addressed in the existing replies, so I decided to tack it directly on the FP question (with the belief that it will appear near the bottom of the FP threads). However I am in partial agreement with the legal liability, targeted advertising, and abuse of privacy answers.

However my answer is more atmospheric. I think the tone of Discord has always been too contentious and discordant, and I&#39;m being perhaps too polite to think that they have done th

Because some significant countries, like UK and Australia, have started requiring age verification z it&#39;s probably easier to do it globally, since there are more countries in line to enable age checks soon.

Because in numerous states (and nations in the case of Europe) there is a legal requirement to heavily restrict what people under 18 can see on social networks (if indeed under 18s are allowed to participate.) These laws have been extensively covered on Slashdot.

Right now there&#39;s no easy way to detect ages online, so Roblox, Discord, et al, are rolling out age verification systems that rely upon associating real world IDs with accounts. This is a terrible thing for privacy - which may even be the intent behind the laws in the first place.

What might be better would be having HTTP headers that mark content as child-safe (with child safe content losing some S.230 protections), and letting parents install web browsers that can use the flag. People who want S.230 protections need do nothing, parents who want to have some control over content without literally sitting next to their kid whenever they visit Wikipedia can set the flag appropriately on a supporting browser with password protection to prevent the kids from reverting it.

That&#39;d ensure the checking is anonymous and would deal with the concerns of most parents about dubious content on the Internet.

But... what they want is actually to get rid of anonyminity.

They know what you typed, they know what you look like, and now they know where you live.

They know what you typed, they know what you look like, and now they know where you live....so be good for goodness sake...?

They know what you typed, they know what you look like, and now they know where you live.

Because they&#39;re looking to go public and they want to manage issues that their auditors flagged potentially limiting.

People who say &quot;profit??&quot; should be permanently put in the teenage bracket.

Yeah, those damn kids and their giant UIDs.

Yeah, those damn kids and their giant UIDs.I know, right?

To the contrary: they have demonstrated they&#39;re not teenagers.  Kids don&#39;t use old memes as those are &quot;uncool&quot;, and underpants gnomes are something that came out 28 years ago.

Some service have found funny to impose a phone number verification to register. I did not make an account there. That is not negotiable. This why i don&#39;t use chat GPT.

If Discord becomes too annoying to use without an ID i will get out of it. Helen Lovejoys be damned.

Also internet phones like google voice and if you are willing to spend small payments a site I have used in the past textverified.com to great success.

Using a phone number linked to your Google account probably gives them more info than your normal phone number.

I am more willing to give up anonymity for some service than others. If it is personal communication via the phone (e.g. Whatsapp), all authorities know who is using the phone anyway, so the phone number attachment to an app on the phone is more acceptable to me.

But for pure internet social platform, sorry. We don&#39;t need permanent record for people who buy beer or porn in a physical shop. Same for online activities. Those people who claim they want to &quot;protect children&quot; can create an anonymous age certif

They can censor my Discord experience. All I do on it do tabletop RPGs, as long as I can voice chat I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll care.

For people that do care. There are alternatives to Discord and they&#39;re going to go there. Hopefully Discord has a good idea of how many users they will have to give up for this, and have hopefully crunched the numbers before deciding if it was worth adding these restrictions.

Your kids donâ(TM)t need to do the verification if they arenâ(TM)t adults.  Kids can continue to use at the appropriate teen and below level without verification.Any other non problems to solve?

I think Roblox is facing the opposite problem:  They are under pressure to make sure adults don&#39;t impersonate kids.

>Also no way am I letting my kids scan their faces or upload IP to random companies just to use their services.

No face?  No problem, Discord will treat you like a teenager and keep you from seeing material they deem inappropriate for teens.

For the last couple years, the male subset of my children&#39;s church youth group used Discord for coordinating activities, and I learned about my daughter&#39;s activity plans via email.  As of last month, both subsets are moving to WhatsApp.  I&#39;m not sure if this particular change is &quot;too little, too late&quot; to have kept them, or if indeed it drives some of the youth and their parents away faster.

What&#39;s your church group posting about that it&#39;s likely to be flagged as an age-restricted community??

In all seriousness, my guess would be that this makes Discord more appealing to groups like you describe.  If Discord ends up with the reputation of a place where kids can get access all sorts of inappropriate content, I imagine parents being skeptical of letting their kids make an account at all.  With age restrictions/verification in place some of those fears may be mitigated (even with all the typical caveats that it may turn out to be ineffective security theater).

Here&#39;s tradeoff I would accept, although may would understandably find it unacceptable:

I pay a notary public the usual fee - way under $10 where I live - to sign a statement saying that Discord user [my username] was born on or before a specified date [18 years ago, 21 years ago, whatever].

Yes, the notary will have records that are accessible by court order, but it&#39;s unlikely that those records will be online/hackable.
  Discord won&#39;t have anything more than the notary&#39;s name and licensing information.

My financial institution, a credit unit, does notary services for free. Just sayin ;) Something worth looking into!

Discord should offer a product to IT consulting firms and to large organizations:

Offer their technology, for the consulting firms and organizations to host and manage themselves.

This pushes many of the management and legal-compliance headaches to the IT firms and large organizations, while providing large sources of continuing, stable revenue.

Discord is about 10 years old now, so it canâ(TM)t quite come up yet that it would have accounts in use for 16 years. Still leaves the question about would this policy apply in such a case? If it does, that seems like it might imply Discord is treating the account as being used by someone other than the original owner. Which also raises questions.

The goal of the leaks is to encourage people to demand the government issue them with a Digital ID instead.

Discord won&#39;t be. Some random vendor they use will be.

They&#39;re outsourcing the verification process to third party vendors. In fact, they already do:

This will happen, and Discord will try to cover it up, and they&#39;ll try to deny it, and they&#39;ll try to minimize it -- just like they did a few months ago: ID photos of 70,000 users may have been leaked, Discord says  [bbc.com].  And then it&#39;ll happen again, and again, and again, because who&#39;s going to stop them?That happened with a vendor they contracted customer support to. Discord is happy to point out that none of their systems were compromised. (This is, sadly, very common: a lot of companies &quot;don&#39;t store personal data&quot; but instead contract with third parties to do it for them. And, you should also note, no one seems to know who this &quot;third party vendor&quot; is. Likely

I&#39;ve talked with officials in the USA for almost 20 years now and their eyes glaze over.  They don&#39;t understand any of it and won&#39;t put in the mental effort unless YOU complain to them!  They need to be motivated; even if they like the sound of your ideas it&#39;s too much effort to bother. It&#39;s complex sounding computer junk and math to them.

Government can easily give you a free online digital ID.

They must also provide a 2nd ID that only verifies your age without your identity.  I always suggested a photo of y

We have a youth team (teenagers) where we use Discord for coordination.  Managing the server has lots of good options, and it has excellent features for sharing the content we need to share (it&#39;s a robotics team) but like most of these services it supports private messages, and that&#39;s a major problem.  We have policies in place that bans one-on-one messaging between adults and youth on the team.  That&#39;s the best we can do.

But I don&#39;t think 95% of parents have any idea what other servers their kids might hav

Sadly, I don&#39;t think this is the case. Certainly it will be for those of us *here*, because we&#39;re generally old enough to remember life before these hyper-centralized services, and savvy enough to use alternatives.

However, Discord has critical mass. It&#39;ll be hard to any individual user to leave because unless they can migrate their entire friend group, they&#39;ll be missing out on everything that group does. And given how tech illiterate or plain lazy most users are, they&#39;ll likely just take the path of least

Just one more &#39;we need your personal data because &quot;think of the children&quot;&#39; ploy that all the sheep will mindlessly comply with.

I personally hate discord for other reasons, but there are all kinds of places that refer you to their discord server for help or support. The need for an ID always pissed me off, but now needing a REALID is goning to impact that even more...I avoid dealing with entities via Discord, that includes buying or supporting.

70 hour weeks, for at least a short run, there is nothing wrong with this IF....you get paid properly.

I&#39;d do this if I were doing it 1099 with good negotiated contractor bill rate....I expect to get paid for every hour I work.

I would also jump at this if I were younger....when you are more bullet proof and can do the long hours thing without much problem....

Now would I want to do this for salary and long term, no....but often that old saying &quot;make hay while the sun

I too would not do this in my position / age now but socking away several hundred $K early-career in the market can give somebody a tremendous leg up after a few decades of compounding.

Yeah, when I was in my 20s I usually stayed in the office hours later than anyone else just to see what was going on, had no life outside of work to pull me away. In my 30s, though, fuck that shit. I have things to do. And 9AM-9PM is a terrrible time range. Your entire day is destroyed. Nothing is open early enough to get shit done before 9AM and everything else is closed by the time you get off. 6AM-6PM would be better, but the Jesus freaks would go nuts over calling it a &quot;666&quot; schedule.

And let&#39;s face it - if we&#39;re talking about working 70-80 hours a week for a year or two in order to have a damn good shot at walking away fabulously wealthy, that&#39;s a pretty good deal.

founders believe longer hours buy them a competitive edge.This is such nonsense. Overtime works for incidental cases, not structurally. If you work one or two days overtime, it might help with completing a job that could otherwise not be done. After that, the productivity falls back to normal due to fatigue creeping in. After a week, a 70 our week is as productive as a 40 hour one, at best.

As someone who has worked in numerous startups, I will say:  Bullshit.

In the &#39;90s, when provided with stock options, a good chance the company would IPO, or be bought out, a high salary, and other perks, yes, it may be worth it.  For yet another AI startup that will be long forgotten when the market closes, not really.

Plus, there is fatigue and burnout.  An IT group I was in did 100 hour work weeks during an outage, then realized the MSP was full of shit, and management actually wanted to cause outages so p

How many times have you been able to actually cash in those stock options and make 10-25X what you invested in them in recent times? In the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s you had a much better chance of getting this kind of return on your investment, then the current generation trying it these days. To play the game now, working for post IPO companies is a less risky approach, even though the RSU&#39;s aren&#39;t as good as the privately held stock options, but the starting salaries are better.

Honestly - I have to wonder if, from the point of view of the founder/CEO, the fact that they&#39;ll be burning through people quickly with lots of turnover is by design.

Unlike the old days, where almost all of the initial team would earn significant chunks of the company as a reward... nowadays it&#39;s just one or two people who are hoarding the ginormous payday when a startup manages to make it big.

I used to call the former &quot;burst overtime&quot; and it is great for debugging or overcoming technical issues. The latter is &quot;chronic overtime&quot; and once that starts, it it best to dust off the resume.

Don&#39;t expect to be able to shop or visit many attractions in your average french town between 12 and 2/3pm, they&#39;ve all buggered off home for lunch. Which also leads to the interesting phenomenon of 4 rush hours per day.

While it is different from the norm you are overstating it by a factor of 2. The typical Chinese lunch break is around 1.5-2 hours. But yes napping is something culturally significant there over lunch.

That said this isn&#39;t unique. Many parts of France, Italy, and definitely Spain have extended lunch breaks as a norm as well, Spain culturally so.

I&#39;ve worked, at least tangentially, with IT folk from various cultures. The 996 is for sweatshop work. I remember one place where people sat at their desks entering code, or whatever. Walking around behind them was the boss, who would go from person to person, telling them *exactly* what to do. All the way down to telling one person to put a CD back into its case. The people were barely even code monkeys - more like typists. Probably you can do that 996 without losing productivity. No idea how the boss functioned. Maybe he swapped out with someone else?

When I was studying for my first master&#39;s degree, there was a brief time where I had coursework as well as my thesis. To get everything done, I worked highly structured 80 hour weeks. That was only possible, because it was only for a few weeks - there was an end in sight. That sort of schedule cannot be maintained. Anyone who thinks it can be is spending a lot of time staring into space / talking at the water cooler / something else non-productive.

My first job out of law school was at a (now defunct) Wall Street law firm where people &quot;worked&quot; 70 hours a week regularly. But just because they had their butt in the chair and the billing clock on didn&#39;t mean they were actually being productive during that time. Outside of short bursts or performance enhancing drugs (which really only extend those bursts well beyond healthy levels), humans just aren&#39;t built to focus and work productively for those sorts of hours.

Law firms are particularly toxic in this re

Nah, probably just the usual monomanical autists who don&#39;t have an existence beyond their monitor screen and assume everyone else is the same. They probably wouldn&#39;t recognise a social life if they tripped over one.

true this. There are people who will work around the clock, because they feel like the have to prove they&#39;re better than everyone else. I had one job in my 20&#39;s where we worked for 16 hours on some days, but the office was nice enough to hang out in. Mostly what we were doing was compiling and playing video games to make sure the latest build didn&#39;t have any bugs. It didn&#39;t take a lot of brain work. Another job after that was way worse. Sometimes I&#39;d get exhausted after 10 hours and just start the hour driv

I&#39;ve done it before. Bills to pay. Ambition. Greed. Optimism. There are lots of reasons to do this.

The worst one I did 7am-7pm, 6 days a week. Then half day (6 hours) on Sunday. Felt pretty burned out after 4 months of that.

Ask these same people if they would get into a cab if they knew the driver were on their 69th hour that week.

Correction, should be 71th hour. Or do I round up? Mixing math and English is too hard a problem for a Monday.

If this is in the US, how is this kind of thing even legal?Although, I suppose being that it&#39;s a desk job, I doubt OSHA would get involved.  As long as they pay OT rates for anything over 40 hours, they wouldn&#39;t break DoL rules.But, with minimum-wage being what it is now, the company will go broke in no time flat.  And, then, when the company folds, all those claiming unemployment will drain the entire state&#39;s unemployment fund, and they&#39;ll be stuck in that same sleep schedule (slowly driving them nuts, eve

I have to wonder if these stories are actually real, or if this is just Big Tech putting out these scare pieces to prevent senior IT people from looking for another job.

Sure, many of us haven&#39;t had a meaningful raise in years and recently had our work from home benefits taken from us, but they&#39;re hoping that we read this crap and think &quot;Gee... at least we aren&#39;t being asked to work 70 hours a week, maybe I should stick around a bit longer&quot;.

Replace it with something similar to the EU&#39;s Working Time Directive.  Regrettably this will never happen in the United States. The business interests finance the elections, and they get to nominate who we vote for by paying for their campaign.

develop severe insomnia.12-hours home for six days, then 1 full day off... for those six days, that&#39;s barely enough to unwind, maybe have a few beers or couple drinks, shower, eat dinner (or cook it if you live alone), and get to bed for a decent night&#39;s sleep... and that full-day off is gonna throw off your whole schedule.Insomnia sucks... I developed it while working third shift at Electrolux (I was foam head operator)... 11PM Sunday to 7AM Monday, five days a week, Saturday was the only day fully off (when it wasn&#39;t mandatory OT) which became grocery day, and Sunday would be laundry day... the whiplash from having Saturday off to flipping back to regular schedule resulted in me developing primary insomnia (working there ended in 2012, I still have it to this day... up to 80mg Trazodone nightly).

How the hell are you supposed to have a family life (or any life at all) working like that?  Or, is it just &#39;sign your life over to the company, and only exist for the company&#39; until they wheel your corpse out?

...my brain turned to spaghetti when I worked long hours. It might work good enough to finish periodic deadlines that require dotting i&#39;s and crossing t&#39;s, but general quality becomes wobbly.

Of course, everyone is different, but on average those who work long hours start to look and act funny by my observation.

If the employees are being paid for every hour they work or have stock to make up the difference, sure, maybe long weeks make sense.

But volunteering free labor so someone else can be rich is pretty foolish.

No really in this case it&#39;s true. Labour regulations limit the maximum work hours to 60h / week only on exception and the average working week needs to be 48h over any given 6 month period. Some regions limit this to a lower point such as 52hours unless there&#39;s a government exception granted to the business (e.g. on an industrial plant during maintenance downtime window). But that is compensated with additional leave afterwards.

Where I live (not Germany) a business will get a fine if employees are found wor

And in most of the EU due to EU working time directive. Business interests have tried to change the law, but have so far failed.

so some C-suite can earn a billions extra than another company? If people were smart they&#39;d strike together. People aren&#39;t that smart.

Remind me of the second foundation book (foundation and empire), where &quot;the mule&quot; used psionic habilities to enhance the intellect of certain subjects, and made them work themselves to death on intellectual ventures by burning the candle on both ends...

I know is nothing very relevant, I just wanted to say it.

Similarly, it reminds me of the &quot;Focused&quot; from A Deepness in the Sky by Vernor Vinge: people neurologically altered to become &quot;thinking machines,&quot; their human emotions and desires forcibly suppressed with drugs and conditioning.

This is where the bullshit about &quot;return to office&quot; is truly revealed. If they wanted people to put in the hours, they would be all for it. I&#39;ve been working 100% remote now for 4 years, and when I&#39;m working on something that is very involved and demands time, I put in 16+ hours a day because of how accessible the workspace is, and I enjoy it the actual work. But the flexible schedule of being remote still lets me get my &quot;me time&quot;, and I&#39;d never do that if I was commuting to an office.

I put in 16+ hours a day because of how accessible the workspace is, and I enjoy it the actual work. But the flexible schedule of being remote still lets me get my &quot;me time&quot;12 of those hours are mostly a waste. Humans are good at high level cognitive work for about 4 hours at a time.

Wait, we were assured that AI makes our work more efficient, and that means we should work fewer hours. Shouldn&#39;t the AI companies, the ones on the leading edge of the AI revolution, be the first to show these advantages?

Well, at least I assume that they are going to base the salary on 72 hours per week, including time-and-a-half for overtime? They&#39;re not just using this as a way to get more work for the same pay, right?

Wait, we were assured that AI makes our work more efficient, and that means we should work fewer hours.Exactly what I was thinking. This reminds me of when Zoom required [slashdot.org] their employees to return to work in-person.
It seems to contradict their entire reason for being.

While I was working at Ameritech in the mid-nineties, I had one week I broke 70 hours. Around that time, my late wife was semi-serious about suing Ameritech for alienation of affection.

FUCK THIS SHIT. You want to be an indentured servant?

Back in the 80&#39;s vendors promised companies a &quot;paperless office&quot;, but cynics noted that the equipment sold always included printers.

Now we&#39;re looking at a promise of a post-human-labor era, delivered by armies of human drones performing mountains fo soul-crushing labor.

It took 30+ years, but I would say we have finally achieved a paperless office for the most part. My old company had substantial paper files well into the mid 2010s, but better monitors, cloud solutions, and e-signatures like Docusign have finally killed off paper except for the occasional convenience copy of a document or very large/formal business transactions. I go months without printing anything at my office job. It wasn&#39;t a bad idea- it was just that the tech wasn&#39;t good enough yet in the 80s.

The only phrase that accurately summarises it.

I&#39;m not sure where people get the idea that union jobs are easy. I think all labor should be organized, but a lot of so-called progressives wonder if the highway could be finished in one summer rather than 3 if IDOT wasn&#39;t required to hire union workers.The last union job I had as a bus mechanic for the city was 8-5, hour lunch and 2 15 minute breaks. You could sit all you wanted to as long as your head was inside or under a bus and your hands were pulling wrenches. I got written up for being 1 minute late

Pete Hegseth, perhaps the most thuggish, toadying, all-around underqualified secretary of defense in the job’s nearly 80-year history, has now shown himself to be the most institutionally destructive as well.

His announcement on Friday, that he was cutting the department’s ties to Harvard University—and possibly to other centers of higher learning too—reflects not only a smug anti-intellectualism, which is out of sync with a high-tech modern military, but also a total misunderstanding of how and why its ties to academia first came about.

“For too long,” Hegseth said in a video, “this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class. Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard—heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks. … We train warriors, not wokesters. Harvard, good riddance.”

From start to finish, this speech is pure rubbish.

The need to broaden the education of America’s warriors was first perceived by Gen. George Marshall, the U.S. Army’s chief of staff during World War II (hardly an emblem of woke). Marshall relied heavily on the chief of his Strategy and Policy Group, Brig. Gen. George Lincoln. (I delved into his papers at the West Point Archives for Chapter 1 of my 2013 book The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War.)

In the last year of the war—at age 37 the Army’s youngest general officer—Lincoln met with Marshall daily, coordinated every major military campaign, and helped draft the treaties at Yalta and Potsdam, which shaped the political map of postwar Europe. He then assisted Marshall’s replacement, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, in creating the Department of Defense.

The special thing about Lincoln was, after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1929, he won a Rhodes scholarship and spent the next three years at Oxford, studying philosophy, politics, and economics—then returned to West Point to teach before getting assigned to high-level staff jobs after WWII broke out.

While working with Marshall at the various Allied planning conferences, Lincoln noticed that much of the crucial work was done by a handful of fellow military officers, almost all of whom had also been Rhodes scholars. He did a little research and found that West Point had produced 13 Rhodes scholars in its history. Of the six still alive, four were holding senior policy posts, helping set the terms of military strategy and postwar peace treaties.

As the war ended, the United States was emerging as a global power with global responsibilities. It would need leaders well versed in politics, diplomacy, economics, and strategy. But few such people existed in or out of the military. Certainly West Point, Lincoln’s alma mater, wasn’t training such people. At the time, all its cadets took the same courses, which focused mainly on engineering. There was a course on bridge building, but no courses on military history.

In May 1945, less than two weeks after the end of the war, Lincoln wrote a letter to one of his mentors back at West Point. “I am beginning to think that what we need is a type of staff officer with at least three heads—one political, one economic, and one military.” In another letter, he proposed “baptizing practically all officers” with a “sprinkling” of education in politics, history, and economics, while taking “certain selected” officers and “dunking” them in those waters much more deeply.

The Army, he continued, “can no longer afford to depend on the fortuitous assembly of Rhodes Scholars. … There must be an integrated system of high-level training if Army policy and national policy are properly to be served, a system which begins here at West Point.”

Lincoln could easily have gone on to have a storied career, rising through the Army’s officer corps. Instead, he returned to West Point to create a new department of social sciences, which would mold this new system. Since regulations required that department heads be colonels, not generals, Lincoln even took a demotion in his rank and was never again promoted.

He started his new job on Sept. 1, 1947. He and Col. Herman Beukema, his onetime mentor and now the new department’s co-founder, created courses in history, government, foreign affairs, geography, national-security economics, and international relations. Lincoln also wrote the nation’s first college-level textbook on international politics, a reference that was assigned not only at West Point but at several civilian colleges across the country.

Over time, cadets concentrating in social sciences formed an elite enclave, which became an object of resentment and ridicule among some more hidebound officers. As late as 1991, when Gen. “Stormin’ Norman” Schwarzkopf returned from his command of Operation Desert Storm to deliver a rousing victory speech at West Point, he reminisced about his own days as a cadet and poked fun at the crazy ideas advanced by “a couple of left-wing pinko Social Science instructors.”

Schwarzkopf was mining a well-known stereotype. (Even at this late date, some of the cadets laughed at and applauded his remark.) He was only half joking, however. Some of his own staff officers had been products of “Sosh,” the academy’s nickname for the social sciences department. But Schwarzkopf’s jab (minus the humor) is the view that Hegseth now holds of the entire enterprise: seeing war as nothing more than killing. In this view, all other dimensions of warfare—the idea that soldiers should understand the enemy they’re fighting, interpret their tactics in a strategic context, and stay within the confines of international law—are not merely secondary but counterproductive, contrary to a “warrior spirit,” woke.

Lincoln had another purpose in creating the new department. “I am certain,” he wrote in one letter, “that we must make strenuous efforts … to improve the so-called Army mind.” This would mean, above all, “impressing the student with the fact that the basic requirement is to learn to think—sometimes a very painful process.”

Perhaps more than anything else, this is what Hegseth sees, and fears, in the officers who have earned degrees or fellowships at places like Harvard. This spirit of inquiry, curiosity, and criticism is what he defines as “woke.”

Early on in the development of Sosh, Lincoln put in place a rule allowing cadets who did especially well in his courses to go study at a civilian graduate school, with West Point paying their tuition. In exchange, these cadets, after earning their master’s or doctoral degrees, would come back to teach in the Sosh department for at least three years. Once they fulfilled that obligation, Lincoln would use his still-considerable connections in Washington to get them choice assignments in the Pentagon, the State Department, the White House, a foreign embassy, or a prestigious command post.

Lincoln died in 1975, but the Sosh tradition lived on. Today almost all general officers in the U.S. Army (and also in the Air Force, which was a branch of the Army until 1947, when it became an independent service) hold graduate degrees—and most of them, at least the generals I know, are as proud of their degrees as they are of their ranks.

For instance, Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the more successful phases of the war in Iraq, went to West Point, then earned a Ph.D. at Princeton University. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who was a lethal tank commander and a counterinsurgency strategist in Iraq (as well as, briefly, national security adviser during Donald Trump’s first term as president), followed a similar path, getting his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina.

Maybe Hegseth sees those officers as epitomes of woke. But what about the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, appointed and lauded by Trump and his entire team, including Hegseth? His page on the JCS website states that Caine “has completed a range of national security and leadership courses, including Harvard Kennedy School’s course for Senior Executives in National and International Security.”

Someone should ask Caine, the next time he appears at a press conference or a congressional hearing, whether his spirit and skill as a warrior and a citizen were helped or hindered by his Ivy League exposure. Maybe Hegseth should have asked the question—and maybe he should think and read up even a little bit about a vast range of topics before opening his mouth.

As I followed a patrol of federal agents around New York City’s Chinatown during their fumbling attempted raid in mid-October last year, I noticed something curious. I was following a small group with the immediately recognizable style of Stephen Miller’s paramilitaristic vanguard: baggy street clothes, masked faces, weapons, and ballistic vests without specific insignia, just the catchall “POLICE” or “Federal Agent.” As we turned one corner, we walked past two other agents dressed much the same, except that one wore a vest that did have agency identification, and it wasn’t Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection; it read “IRS-CI,” for the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation division.

This is not typically what IRS-CI does. The comparatively small federal law enforcement agency, like the majority of its counterparts, is specialized around one area of enforcement, in this case tasked with investigating criminal violations of the tax code—complex investigations requiring particularized skills, which is why the IRS’ own job portal encourages “expertise in accounting.” It is not part of the Department of Homeland Security or even the Department of Justice, residing under the IRS in the Treasury Department.

Yet here was an IRS-CI agent on a foot patrol during a much larger operation that seemed primarily geared toward detaining random men whom agents deemed likely to be African, and she wasn’t an anomaly. As a well-placed source confirmed to me contemporaneously, the operation had hastily brought in dozens of agents from ICE, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and the IRS, potentially among other agencies. This approach itself is not now abnormal; per figures obtained and published by the Cato Institute last September, an eye-watering 28,390 federal law enforcement personnel as of August had been detailed to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, the component that handles immigration arrests and detention.

About 17,500 of these came from either ICE’s criminal-focused division, Homeland Security Investigations, or CBP, but that leaves over 10,000 coming from entities that are not focused on immigration enforcement at all. The IRS provided 1,771, which out of a total special agent population of about 2,100, means about 84 percent of its agent workforce was detailed to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. The DEA provided 3,417, which would be some 70 percent of its special agent workforce. Thousands more came from the FBI; Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives; and even the State Department’s Diplomatic Security service.

This reality has been covered mostly from the standpoint of it taking agents away from crucial other tasks, ranging from child exploitation to financial crimes to drug trafficking (the latter of which notably forms the pretext for a lot of the Trump administration’s domestic enforcement push). But it also has some concrete implications for accountability; not only are agents often neither named nor identified, their agencies themselves are unclear.

Some observers noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi simply referred to “federal agents” in her X post and subsequent comments on the arrest of several people including journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort last week. In a video Fort posted to Facebook, an agent wearing a DEA vest can be seen peering through her window; it’s unclear which agency the others belonged to.

We are no longer talking about individual law enforcement agencies, but rather a giant, singular blob. The burgeoning momentum in what has been a stultified Democratic congressional minority’s effort to rein in some of ICE’s actions—partly compelled by public horror at the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis—will have to contend with the fact of this blob. Lawmakers have been pushing for the DHS inspector general to probe the agency’s use of force, among other things, but will this inquiry encompass abuses potentially committed by other agencies’ personnel? Who’s to say which agency is even involved in any given operation?

Democrats are also now negotiating over (relatively small-bore) constraints like mandating body cameras and limiting masks as they work to hold up DHS funding. They should consider that language too narrowly tailored to ICE and CBP is potentially going to miss DEA agents, for example, detailed to the exact same job. The funding freeze itself—which might have limited overall impact in light of the multibillion-dollar orgy of funding already bestowed on ICE in last year’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill—won’t touch the operations of, say, the Department of Justice, which houses the ATF, Marshals, and Bureau of Prisons, all of which have seen agents deployed with ICE.

This amorphous and ever-shifting group of agents drawn from across the federal government looks increasingly like a catchall national police force operating at the direction of the White House itself, used for diffuse political goals like immigration enforcement, speech crackdowns, and occupying politically oppositional cities. While different federal agencies have long collaborated on joint investigations, this appears to be much more like absorption than collaboration. The underlying agencies still exist, of course, but their agent workforces are substantially or even mostly no longer part of them, instead existing as part of this national police blob.

This also shifts the question of capacity. ICE has been going on a messy hiring push to try to significantly beef up its numbers, though the results may take a while to fully manifest. Yet this means that, without hiring a single additional recruit, ICE ERO has just about tripled its workforce as its mission keeps shifting to include its general immigration functions plus additional White House priorities. It has been suggested by Steve Bannon and others that Trump would deploy members of this law enforcement blob during November’s midterms to monitor polling places and potentially intimidate voters. While the administration’s pseudo-sieges of cities have the limiting factor of ICE’s and CBP’s headcount, these are pools of already trained and equipped federal agents that they can draw from other entities to expand this footprint.

They probably already have; though a DOJ attorney told a federal judge that the 3,000-strong surge of agents to the Twin Cities included 2,000 ICE personnel, we don’t really know if this includes agents detailed to ICE from other agencies. The administration does not publicly disclose how many agents from which agencies have been reassigned to ICE ERO, nor where they’re deployed or what they’re doing. In the context of agents prowling around cities, arresting people seemingly at random and occasionally killing protesters, the specific seal on any given agent’s badge might seem inconsequential, but if state authorities and lawmakers want to get serious about oversight and accountability for these authoritarian operations, they will need to understand the scope, nature, and composition of this federal force.

Trump has called for elections to be “nationalized,” something neither the president, nor the federal government, has the authority to do. But as he’s already sent the FBI to raid Fulton County, Georgia’s election offices with director of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and with the midterms on their way, it’s time to ask how much damage a vindictive president could do.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which once again has had the NFL reject its pitch to perform a live reading of this newsletter as the Super Bowl halftime show.

The United States, and its news, failed to improve this week. Congress did fund the government but is already stuck ahead of the next spending deadline. Tulsi Gabbard remains at large. And while it’s not entirely about politics—though it’s not not about politics—we couldn’t resist a few words about the gutting of the local newspaper.

Blah, blah, life is sad—well, not anymore, because we’re kicking off 2026 primary season with Texas Week! Everybody grab two handfuls of sizzlin’ Texas chili (??) and git to reading.

We are less than a month from the start of 2026 primary season, as Texas voters go to the polls on March 3. This is welcome news to the Surge. Early primary coverage feels so distant with its talk of endorsements, “war chests,” and other lifeless stats. Now we can cover proper knife fights down the stretch.

The prime drama of the week came in Texas’ competitive Senate Democratic primary between state Rep. James Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, of Dallas. It started when Morgan Thompson, a Texas TikTok personality, said that Talarico had told her privately “that he signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable and intelligent Black woman.” The Black man in question is former Rep. Colin Allred, who ended his Senate campaign last year and switched to a House race. Allred then posted his own video response in which he endorsed Crockett and trashed Talarico, telling him, “If you want to compliment a Black woman, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.” For his part, Talarico said Thompson had offered a “mischaracterization” of his remark, and that he described only Allred’s “method of campaigning as mediocre.” (Not a particularly controversial observation there.)

National Republicans, who would prefer to run against the more polarizing, partisan figure in Crockett, have greatly enjoyed this all. It’s been a welcome distraction from their own Texas problems.

Our view of the Texas Senate race has been that it gets way too much attention for a contest that Republicans are probably going to win by 5 to 7 points. It’s not among the top pickup opportunities that national Democrats are targeting. Democrats haven’t won statewide there since 1994, and they seriously backslid in the state in 2024. It’s expensive to run in. There’s always a lot of temptation, every cycle, for Democrats to believe that this time could be different. It never materializes.

All of which is to say: It’s temptation time again! The national atmosphere is lousy for Republicans, the gains they made among Hispanic voters in 2024 to fortify their Texas standing are evaporating, Texas Republicans just got dusted in a special election in what they thought was a safe-red district, and, most importantly, they have candidate problems of their own. Incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who would likely win reelection to his seat if he made it to November’s general, is in dreadful primary shape. After $50 million in advertising has been spent on his behalf, it’s still not clear that he’d make it to a runoff in his primary against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. Even if he did make the runoff against Paxton, he’d likely be at a disadvantage. If Paxton, another partisan, polarizing figure laden with personal and professional baggage, becomes Republicans’ nominee, Democrats will feel the Texas temptation like never before.

We regret to say that at the rate she’s going, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is at risk of replacing Lindsey Graham as the Surge’s go-to “Here’s what they were up to this week” entry. Not a good sign for America. We’ve learned of late that Gabbard, who had been out of the public eye for a while, has been running her own investigation into the results of the 2020 election and sniffing around old ballots and voting machines. She was on the scene at an FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election center last week and, as we learned a few days ago, apparently called the president from Atlanta and put him on speakerphone with the agents who conducted the raid. None of this is within the DNI’s purview, all of it is wildly inappropriate at best, any of it would be a major scandal that Congress oversees immediately in a functioning government.

There is more. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that there’s a whistleblower complaint about Gabbard “that is so highly classified it has sparked months of wrangling over how to share it with Congress,” and that it’s “said to be locked in a safe.” A redacted version of the complaint, then, was finally made available to a select group of lawmakers later in the week, with executive privilege claims getting in the way of the good stuff. We shall see. Elsewhere in Gabland: It was reported that Gabbard “obtained” voting machines from Puerto Rico to play around with them and look for security vulnerabilities. OK!

The Washington Post eliminated about a third of its staff and hundreds of journalism jobs this week in the worst single-day massacre of expertise and talent we’ve ever seen—even in an industry that’s been contracting all century. The Post nixed its sports and books coverage, axed much of its arts coverage, and gutted its international and metro desks. It is now narrowly focused on District of Columbia news and politics, making it less a swaggering international newspaper than a publication whose purview matches Politico’s.

The Post has gone through highs and lows going back decades. Yet the acute mismanagement of the past couple of years by its owner, Jeff Bezos, after he’d lost any apparent interest in owning a newspaper, is staggering. Seeking to protect his business before the government ahead of a potential Trump win in 2024, Bezos barred the editorial board from making an endorsement in the presidential race, costing the paper hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Individual mega-billionaires are under no obligation to use their largesse to subsidize public institutions like the Post forever. (A gentleman, though, might backfill at least the hole he personally created by interfering with the editorial board.) They’re not obligated to do so when it collides with their other business interests. We do think they’re obligated, however, to find someone who is willing to carry the task forward. Rather than destroy a public institution because it’s become a hassle in various ways, sell it to someone who gives a shit.

Senate Democrats got what they wanted in the government funding battle that ensued following the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Rather than extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security through September, it would be extended for two weeks while Democrats and Republicans negotiated some new restraints over immigration enforcement. The Senate passed this rejiggered deal late last week, and the House muscled it through on Tuesday.

It is now Saturday, and the sum total of negotiating progress that has been made is nothing. Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries put out a list of 10 demands—among them no masks for DHS officers, no roving DHS patrols, no racial profiling—which was met coolly by Republicans. “Democrats’ newest proposal is a ridiculous Christmas list of demands for the press,” Alabama’s Katie Britt, Senate Republicans’ lead DHS appropriator, said. “They continue to play politics to their radical base at the expense of the safety of Americans.” Democrats, meanwhile, say they are being serious—and it’s the Republicans who aren’t! Et cetera, et cetera, and so on and so forth. The conversation has moved largely toward what the next short-term DHS funding patch will look like, because a bigger deal to rein in immigration authorities does not appear to be in the ballpark of imminent.

A marked push from the most conservative factions in the House and Senate to pass a major voter verification and ID bill has kicked off, but it’s hitting the same old wall: the Senate filibuster. The bill in question was, at first, the SAVE Act, legislation that would require showing “documentary proof of United States Citizenship” in order to register to vote. Now there’s a new version—the SAVE America Act—that tacks on a requirement for presenting photo ID at polling places. Senate Democrats are fully hostile to the legislation, with Schumer calling it “Jim Crow 2.0” and saying it’s about “federalizing voter suppression.”

In order to appease certain House conservatives who were threatening to hold up the government funding bill this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he would at least have a conversation with his senators about how to proceed on the SAVE Act and its successors. One idea that’s come up, as it often does during desperate times, is to force the minority to stage a “talking filibuster” to stall it, and wait for them to exhaust their parliamentary options. Those never happen, and for good reason: It could eat up weeks or months of valuable Senate floor time and force Senate Republicans to be on or near the Senate floor for most of that time. This is one of those discussions we’d expect to naturally dissipate on its own once it becomes clear how unpalatable all of the options are. But depending on how involved Trump gets, Thune could have to withstand a lot of pressure.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia finally said something cool this week, then got in trouble for it. “You bring a gun into the District, you mark my words, you’re going to jail,” Jeanine Pirro said in an appearance on her old stomping grounds at Fox News. “I don’t care if you have a license in another district, and I don’t care if you’re a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else.” This didn’t sit well with gun-rights groups, who were already displeased with the administration for the way it talked about how Alex Pretti, who was carrying lawfully, shouldn’t have brought his gun with him to protest immigration officers in Minnesota. Elected Republicans, too, criticized her, with Florida Rep. Greg Steube, for example, telling Pirro, “Come and Take it!”

As Steube said in his own post, though, he’s licensed in both Florida and D.C. to carry. No one, regrettably, is going to take away Greg Steube’s gun. “Let me be clear: I am a proud supporter of the Second Amendment,” Pirro said in a follow-up social media post. “Washington, D.C. law requires handguns be licensed in the District with the Metropolitan Police Department to be carried into our community. We are focused on individuals who are unlawfully carrying guns and will continue building on that momentum to keep our communities safe.” That’s just a simple explanation of D.C. law that it’s her job to enforce. So she’ll probably have to keep apologizing.

According to Marc Elias, Dahlia Lithwick’s guest on Amicus, “This week will be looked back on as a pivot point in terms of how the midterms play out.” Elias is a nationally recognized authority on voting rights, redistricting, and campaign finance law. He is chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket.

In the past few weeks, Donald Trump’s election denialism has kicked into high gear, just as his poll numbers hit new lows. Elias tells us the FBI/DNI raid to seize ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, and Steve Bannon’s new threats to surround polling places with ICE officers in November, show an administration that is prototyping new mechanisms for election subversion and voter suppression. But the public has power in this scenario, especially if they start paying attention to elections and voting rights now, rather than the day before Nov. 3, 2026.

            <div id="article-text">Anthropic&#39;s sensitive cubs and roaring cougars commercial trampled OpenAI&#39;s offerings in searches and site hit metrics during the Super Bowl, according to ad tracking firm EDO. However, the unknown player ai.com, which pitched the fantastical idea that “AGI is coming,” won the day.

EDO examines online behavior after an ad runs, looking at searches and website visits to determine sales or market shifts, the company’s CEO Kevin Krim said in a segment on CNBC.

“Anthropic’s Claude outdueled OpenAI’s ChatGPT with two of its ads outperforming the three ads from ChatGPT,” Krim said. “But there was a dark horse that came out of the rankings, ai.com, which is a domain purchased by crypto.com founder Kris Marszalek, and he and his creative team trolled ‘Elon’ and ‘Sam’ and that ad got people very curious. The site crashed in the minutes following that ad airing on TV.”

The ai.com hit won 9.1 times as much engagement as the average Super Bowl LX ad, beating Universal Studios&#39; ad for a new Minions movie, Lay’s tear-jerker potato farming ad, a Netflix trailer for the Once Upon A Time In Hollywood TV series, and even a Dunkin’ Donuts ad that had Ben Affleck alongside stars from Friends, Seinfeld, and Cheers, along with an appearance by Tom Brady.

The website ai.com claims to let all users build AI agents that operate on their behalf, according to a press release the company posted Friday. All website visitors must hand over credit card information to vouch that they are human.

Two of Claude’s three ads placed 12th and 13th in the rankings, ahead of EDO’s 14th place Salesforce - a Vault ad which promoted a $1 million give away by Mr. Beast. They were also well in front of OpenAI’s Codex ad which ranked 24th, according to a selection of rankings that are featured on the company’s site. The Register has reached out to EDO for a full list of the rankings.

“I think the theme here was between the AI ads – which outnumbered automotive and beer ads which I thought was fascinating – you saw just his idea that technology whether it was AI or pharmaceutical can change people’s lives,” Krim said.

Meta’s ad with former Seattle Seahawk running back Marshawn Lynch for its wearable AI devices ranked 20th, in a game in which a current Seattle running back stole the show on the gridiron.

Claude last week drew a hard line saying advertising had no place in the conversations with its users.

“We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for,” the company wrote.

Claude’s ads leaned into the problems this could cause with a workout companion recommending shoe lifts for “short kings” after the user feeds it his height, and an AI therapist which pushes a dating site that matches &quot;sensitive cubs with roaring cougars” for a man seeking a better relationship with his mom.

OpenAI’s ad was centered on its software development tool Codex and the progression of a technologist from building cardboard to code.

“I think the stakes are so high in this battle among the AI giants that Anthropic went after the weakness that they saw with ads in the middle of someone’s very intimate chats,” Krim said. “I think OpenAI responded that that was not how it was going to work. I think those types of battles that can really work. The value proposition from the consumer is pretty clear. Open AI went with heartwarming and very good ads around the value proposition of helping you achieve what you want to achieve.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Korean crypto exchange Bithumb says it recovered nearly all of the more than $40 billion worth of funds it mistakenly handed out to customers as part of a promotional campaign.

Bithumb announced the promo on February 5, promising new registrants on the platform a total ₩100,000 ($68) in benefits. It planned to start this with an initial ₩20,000 ($13) payment deposited into users’ accounts after their first transaction, with subsequent bonuses, including points and Starbucks vouchers, tied to completing additional steps such as verification and coupon entry.

However, the platform accidentally credited 620,000 bitcoin (~$42 billion) to the accounts of 695 users the following day – around $61 million each, if divided equally among them all.

In a company announcement, Bithumb claimed it realized that it made hundreds of users incredibly wealthy within 35 minutes, and although some users were quick to sell their newfound gains, the company recovered the majority of the funds very quickly.

&quot;Immediately following the incident, Bithumb immediately [sic] implemented measures to recover overpaid assets, and prioritized ensuring complete consistency of customer assets, including even the slightest discrepancies that may occur during the recovery process,&quot; it said in a press release.

&quot;As a result, 99.7 percent of the overpaid Bitcoin was recovered on the day of the incident, and the 0.3 percent (1,788 BTC) that had already been sold was injected with company assets, ensuring 100 percent consistency between customer deposited assets and exchange-held assets.

&quot;Currently, Bithumb holds all virtual assets, including Bitcoin, at a level that matches or exceeds user deposits, and customer assets are being safely stored as before.&quot;

The company said that the overpayment incident was simply an error on its side and was not related to a cyberattack or breach of its systems.

It went on to say that it does not believe any customers&#39; assets were lost or otherwise damaged as a result, despite the price of Bitcoin briefly falling sharply.

After Bithumb confirmed total consistency between customer-platform assets, CEO Lee Jae-won announced a compensation scheme for those affected.

Lee said all customers connected to the platform at the time of the error would be compensated ₩20,000, and any user who sold Bitcoin at a low price caused by the incident would receive a refund of the selling price plus 10 percent of the transaction&#39;s value.

Beginning at midnight on February 9, Bithumb also paused trading fees for all tokens for seven days.

Additionally, it established a Customer Protection Fund of ₩100 billion ($68.5 million) – a reserve so that in any similar incident that should occur in the future, customers will be protected immediately.

And it wouldn&#39;t be a 2026 apology without the promise of more AI. Coming soon is an &quot;Anomalous Transaction Detection and Automatic Blocking AI System&quot; called Safe Guard that&#39;s designed to stop transactions that appear abnormal for any reason.

Other technical preventative measures include a strengthening of its asset verification system and the introduction of a two-payment process for asset transfers and reward payments.

Bithumb has been hot on comms since the incident, posting frequent, easily accessible updates, but the regulators are still circling.

Lee Eog-weon, chairman at the Korean Financial Services Commission, the country&#39;s superseding financial regulator, called an emergency meeting on February 8 to discuss how to proceed with Bithumb.

Officials from Korea&#39;s financial crime authority and financial institutions regulator were in attendance. They acknowledged the steps Bithumb took to remedy the issues with customers and the price of Bitcoin, but further investigations into user damages and on-site inspections will take place. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s a day with a name ending in Y, so you know what that means: Another OpenClaw cybersecurity disaster.

This time around, SecurityScorecard&#39;s STRIKE threat intelligence team is sounding the alarm over the sheer volume of internet-exposed OpenClaw instances it discovered, which numbers more than 135,000 as of this writing. When combined with previously known vulnerabilities in the vibe-coded AI assistant platform and links to prior breaches, STRIKE warns that there&#39;s a systemic security failure in the open-source AI agent space.

&quot;Our findings reveal a massive access and identity problem created by poorly secured automation at scale,&quot; the STRIKE team wrote in a report released Monday. &quot;Convenience-driven deployment, default settings, and weak access controls have turned powerful AI agents into high-value targets for attackers.&quot;

For those unfamiliar with the saga of Clawdbot, er Moltbot, no, wait, OpenClaw (it keeps changing names), it&#39;s an open-source, vibe-coded agentic AI platform that has been, frankly, an unmitigated disaster for those worried about security. OpenClaw&#39;s skill store, where users can find extensions for the bot, is riddled with malicious software. Three high-risk CVEs have been attributed to it in recent weeks, and it&#39;s also been reported that its various skills can be easily cracked and forced to spill API keys, credit card numbers, PII, and other data valuable to cybercriminals.

Take a bunch of those already vulnerable instances and give them free rein to access the internet, as STRIKE has discovered happening around the world, and those problems are quickly magnified.

STRIKE&#39;s summary of the problem doesn&#39;t even do it justice, as the number of identified vulnerable systems has skyrocketed on its live OpenClaw threat dashboard since publication several hours before our story.

Take the aforementioned 135,000+ internet-facing OpenClaw instances - that number is as of our writing; when STRIKE published its report earlier today, that number was at just over 40,000. STRIKE also mentioned 12,812 OpenClaw instances it discovered being vulnerable to an established and already patched remote code execution bug. As of this writing, the number of RCE-vulnerable instances has jumped to more than 50,000. The number of instances detected that were linked to previously reported breaches (not necessarily related) has also skyrocketed from 549 to over 53,000, as has the number of internet-facing OpenClaw instances associated with known threat actor IPs.

In other words, this is nothing short of a disaster in the making, all thanks to a suddenly-popular AI tool vibe-coded into existence with little regard to the safety of its codebase or users.

That&#39;s not to say users aren&#39;t at least partially to blame for the issue. Take the way OpenClaw&#39;s default network connection is configured.

&quot;Out of the box, OpenClaw binds to `0.0.0.0:18789`, meaning it listens on all network interfaces, including the public internet,&quot; STRIKE noted. &quot;For a tool this powerful, the default should be `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). It isn&#39;t.&quot;

STRIKE recommends all OpenClaw users, at the very least, immediately change that binding to point it to localhost. Outside of that, however, SecurityScorecard&#39;s VP of threat intelligence and research Jeremy Turner wants users to know that most of the flaws in the system aren&#39;t due to user inattention to defaults. He told The Register in an email that many of OpenClaw&#39;s problems are there by design because it&#39;s built to make system changes and expose additional services to the web by its nature.

&quot;It&#39;s like giving some random person access to your computer to help do tasks,&quot; Turner said. &quot;If you supervise and verify, it&#39;s a huge help. If you just walk away and tell them all future instructions will come via email or text message, they might follow instructions from anyone.&quot;

As STRIKE pointed out, compromising an OpenClaw instance means gaining access to everything the agent can access, be that a credential store, filesystem, messaging platform, web browser, or just its cache of personal details gathered about its user.

And with many of the exposed OpenClaw instances coming from organizational IP addresses and not just home systems, it&#39;s worth pointing out that this isn&#39;t just a problem for individuals mucking around with AI.

Turner warns that OpenClaw isn&#39;t to be trusted, especially in organizational contexts.

&quot;Consider carefully how you integrate this, and test in a virtual machine or separate system where you limit the data and access with careful consideration,&quot; Turner explained. &quot;Think of it like hiring a worker with a criminal history of identity theft who knows how to code well and might take instructions from anyone.&quot;

That said, Turner isn&#39;t advocating for individuals and organizations to completely abandon agentic AI like OpenClaw - he simply wants potential users to be wary and consider the risks when deploying a potentially revolutionary new tech product that&#39;s rife with vulnerabilities.

&quot;All these new capabilities are incredible, and the researchers deserve a lot of credit for democratizing access to these new technologies,&quot; Turner told us. &quot;Learn to swim before jumping in the ocean.&quot;

Or just stay out altogether - the ocean is terrifying. ®

It also left many observers on GitHub skeptical, to say the least.

Nicholas Carlini, a researcher on Anthropic&#39;s Safeguards team, detailed the experiment with what he called &quot;agent teams&quot; in a blog that coincided with the official release of Opus 4.6.

He said he &quot;tasked 16 agents with writing a Rust-based C compiler, from scratch, capable of compiling the Linux kernel. After nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions and $20,000 in API costs, the agent team produced a 100,000-line compiler that can build Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V.&quot;

With agent teams, he said, &quot;multiple Claude instances work in parallel on a shared codebase without active human intervention.&quot;

One key task was getting round the need for &quot;an operator to be online and available to work jointly,&quot; which we presume means removing the need for Claude Code to wait for a human to tell it what to do next.

&quot;To elicit sustained, autonomous progress, I built a harness that sticks Claude in a simple loop... When it finishes one task, it immediately picks up the next.&quot; Imagine if humans took that sort of approach.

Carlini continued: &quot;I leave it up to each Claude agent to decide how to act. In most cases, Claude picks up the &#39;next most obvious&#39; problem.&quot; This threw up a number of lessons, including the need to &quot;write extremely high quality tests.&quot;

Readers were also advised to &quot;put yourself in Claude&#39;s shoes.&quot; That means the &quot;test harness should not print thousands of useless bytes&quot; to make it easier for Claude to find what it needs.

Also, &quot;Claude can&#39;t tell time and, left alone, will happily spend hours running tests instead of making progress.&quot;

Which might make you feel working with Claude is closer to working with a regular human than you might have thought. But what was the upshot of all of this?

&quot;Over nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions across two weeks, Opus 4.6 consumed 2 billion input tokens and generated 140 million output tokens, a total cost just under $20,000.&quot;

This made it &quot;an extremely expensive project&quot; compared to the priciest Claude Max plans, Carlini said. &quot;But that total is a fraction of what it would cost me to produce this myself – let alone an entire team.&quot;

Other lessons? &quot;The compiler successfully builds many projects, but not all. It&#39;s not yet a drop-in replacement for a real compiler.&quot; Moreover, &quot;the generated code is not very efficient.&quot;

He added that the Rust code quality is &quot;reasonable but... nowhere near the quality of what an expert Rust programmer might produce.&quot;

Carlini concluded: &quot;Agent teams show the possibility of implementing entire, complex projects autonomously.&quot;

But as a former pen-tester, he said fully autonomous development posed real risks. &quot;The thought of programmers deploying software they&#39;ve never personally verified is a real concern.&quot; Ultimately, the experiment &quot;excites me, [but] also leaves me feeling uneasy.&quot;

Comments on GitHub were less equivocal, not least because they felt the $20K price tag ignored a few other elements, such as the vast amount of other programmers&#39; code the model was trained on in the first place.

As mohswell put it: &quot;If I went to the supermarket, stole a bit of every bread they had, and shoved it together, no one would say I made bread from scratch. They&#39;d say I&#39;m a thief. If this is &#39;from scratch,&#39; then my cooking is farm-to-table.&quot;

While Sambit003 opined: &quot;The comment section and the issue itself is &#39;absolute cinema&#39; moment everyone living through😂... the longer the AI generated codes I see... the safer I feel. 😂 Still we have the jobs (for long enough years)... just enjoy the overhyping bruh.&quot;

Serkosal added plaintively: &quot;okay, nice, could @claude find gf for me? No? I&#39;m not interested.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">If you&#39;re running an online business, it helps to own a memorable domain. That&#39;s why a wealthy tech exec just paid $70 million to buy the hottest word you can own: AI.com.

The deal was brokered by Larry Fischer of getyourdomain.com, according to the Financial Times, and is the most expensive domain purchase in history, eclipsing the previous record – $49.7 million for CarInsurance.com.

The buyer was Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com. While the figure is eye-watering, it is considerably less than the $100 million Fisher was bandying around in 2025. According to the Financial Times, Fischer said: &quot;With assets like AI.com, there are no substitutes. When one becomes available, the opportunity may never present itself again.&quot;

While the final figure is not the nine-figure sum mooted last year, it is not to be sniffed at.

Marszalek told the FT that he hoped AI.com could offer similar features to OpenClaw – ideally without the associated security nightmares of the vibe-coded agent farm.

He added that there were &quot;good business reasons&quot; for coughing up so much for AI.com. &quot;There is a big desire for us to own this touchpoint, otherwise you get commoditized. I thought it was quite interesting that one person can own two domains that stand for such important categories.&quot;

Marszalek is doubtless expecting lightning to strike twice, given the impressive growth of Crypto.com in an already crowded market. According to the company&#39;s website, it has more than 150 million users globally. As the AI bubble continues to inflate, the $70 million paid for AI.com could end up looking like a canny investment. Or it could be the final note in the symphony of hubris that accompanies both crypto and AI.

Marszalek&#39;s purchase coincides with growing investor jitters over the amounts being poured into a technology that has yet to justify the funds lavished on it. Then again, Marszalek told the FT he was taking a long-term view of &quot;10 to 20 years.&quot;

The purchase price was reportedly paid entirely in cryptocurrency. It would probably be best not to check the Bitcoin prices for a bit. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Salesforce has decided to stop developing new features for its Heroku platform-as-a-service.

Senior VP and general manager at Salesforce Nitin T. Bhat delivered the news with a late Friday afternoon post – timing that public relations types call “taking out the trash” because they hope releasing bad news at the end of the working week means it goes unnoticed.

Bhat also used some very indirect language to describe what Salesforce is doing, kicking off with, “Today, Heroku is transitioning to a sustaining engineering model focused on stability, security, reliability, and support.”

He described the platform’s new status as an “actively supported, production-ready platform, with an emphasis on maintaining quality and operational excellence rather than introducing new features.”

Existing customers can continue to use Heroku and renew subscriptions, but Salesforce won&#39;t offer enterprise contracts to new customers.

Heroku is a PaaS layer that runs atop AWS&#39;s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and relies on a version of PostgreSQL. Salesforce acquired Heroku in 2010 and for years suggested it as the ideal environment in which to build and run custom apps for its CRM and other SaaS-y applications, despite also offering its own Force.com app development and hosting platform. In recent years, Salesforce has pushed its Agentforce service as its premier offering for custom development, as it’s an agentic-AI-centric offering and the company is all-in on AI.

Heroku wasn’t immune to that push and has added AI features.

Bhat’s post suggests Salesforce has tired of maintaining multiple development platforms for AI apps, as his post poses the question “Why this change?” and answers it by stating “We’re focusing our product and engineering investments on areas where we can deliver the greatest long-term customer value, including helping organizations build and deploy enterprise-grade AI in a secure and trusted way.”

Independent analyst Michael Warrilow told The Register, &quot;Developers loved Heroku. Exorbitant pricing killed it and Agentforce put the nail in the coffin.&quot;

He advised migration away from Heroku. “Thankfully, Salesforce is giving existing customers a window to act,” he said.

Providers of Heroku alternatives are already spruiking their wares, and users are reminiscing about good times using the platform and mourning its imminent irrelevance.

And plenty are criticizing Salesforce’s decision.

“Salesforce spent the last two years putting Agentforce on every keynote stage and earnings call,” wrote CTO advisor Keith Townsend, a consultant to IT execs. But Townsend thinks Agentforce is missing important features – namely “a governance-aware execution layer that constrains what AI-generated applications can do, enforces policy at the point of creation, and preserves auditability by design.”

He believes “Heroku was closer to being that layer than almost anything else in the market. Salesforce just never saw it that way,” and that the SaaS giant may therefore come to regret its decision to put the product out to pasture.

“That underinvestment may turn out to be one of the most expensive strategic misreads in enterprise AI.”

Ivan Burazin, CEO of daytona.io, an outfit that provides infrastructure and sandboxes to run AI-generated code, also thinks Salesforce has made a poor decision.

“Startups are raising millions to build ephemeral environments for agents, while one of the OG sandbox providers is exiting the race. Instead of evolving Heroku into a definitive infrastructure for the agentic AI era, Salesforce is letting a developer goldmine wither away,” he wrote, before concluding, “Never doubt big tech&#39;s ability to kill great products!” ®

﻿The Fluorite is a ‘console-grade’ graphics engine that can perform well on embedded hardware like the chips in your car.

Using a game engine in a “digital cockpit” can be useful for things like step-by-step 3D tutorials about a car, mapping the environment around your car, and offering more natural controls, Jamie Kerber, the lead engineer of a new game engine developed by Toyota Connected North America, said in a recent presentation at the FOSDEM 2026 conference. That’s why the company is showing off the solution it’s developed, called Fluorite, that could work in its vehicles, as reported on by Eurogamer and Game*Spark.

Epic Games has made a big push for car companies to use Unreal Engine to power those in-car interfaces and visualize them for design and marketing, and so has Unity. As a result, automakers are now regularly looking to hire game designers who have experience using the tools. But limitations like high licensing fees and being resource-heavy on hardware that is sometimes years behind state-of-the-art can be issues for car companies.

Fluorite, on the other hand, is the “first console-grade game engine” that’s “fully integrated with” the Flutter SDK, according to the Fluorite website, and it has “great performance” on lower-end and embedded hardware while also offering “hardware-accelerated visuals comparable to those found on gaming consoles.”

Fluorite still seems quite early in development, however. The team is looking for collaborations with engineering teams to commit development resources to the project and establish a common roadmap for the engine, according to the presentation.

Update your Home app today or you may lose access to your smart home devices.

If you haven’t yet updated to the new Apple Home, your smart home devices may no longer work in the Home app on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch starting tomorrow. On February 10, 2026, Apple will end support for the original HomeKit architecture.

The biggest impact of the change will be felt by anyone still using an iPad as their Apple Home Hub (which allows you to control devices remotely and create automations).

In the new Apple Home, iPads are no longer supported as hubs. You’ll need a HomePod or Apple TV to serve that role. The new architecture also requires your phone and any devices connected to your Home to be running iOS 16.2 or later (or macOS 13.1/watchOS 9.2 or higher).

To ensure no interruption in your smart home control, you’ll need to update your Apple Home. Go to Settings in the Home app, then follow the steps to complete the update. After February 10, Apple says you may be automatically upgraded.

The new Apple Home architecture fully launched with iOS 16.4 in 2023, and was a ground-up rebuild of the platform. It brought increased performance and reliability, according to Apple, along with support for Matter, the new smart home standard Apple helped develop and to which it contributed HomeKit as a foundation.

Upgrading has been optional since the launch of the new platform, but Apple announced last year that it would phase out the old HomeKit architecture by the end of 2025. That deadline was subsequently pushed back, but has now arrived.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Not a single one of these commercials made betting on gen AI seem like a good idea.

﻿Not a single one of these commercials made betting on gen AI seem like a good idea.

It feels like everyone who produced ad spots for this year’s Super Bowl with generative AI failed in terms of making gen AI seem useful or like something worth getting excited about. Though we’ve seen plenty of AI-generated commercials before (at previous Super Bowls, no less), this year’s event was oversaturated with them. That’s in part because image and video generation models have become more sophisticated in the past year — though still subpar compared to what humans create, they’re just improved enough for a number of brands to now be comfortable having their names associated with AI-derived footage.

Also, it’s much, much cheaper and faster to use gen AI, which is convenient when the cost for 30-second ad spots at this year’s Super Bowl ranged anywhere from $8–$10 million. With traditionally produced ads from previous Super Bowls, you could really see how spending money on production ultimately led to commercials that felt more premium than what you would usually see on television. But this year, there was an undeniable cheap and sloppy quality to many of the advertisements. Here are some of them.

One of the worst examples of this was the Artlist ad. The main thrust of the ad (which only aired in New York and Los Angeles) from Israeli creative firm Artlist is that anyone can generate Super Bowl-worthy video footage using the company’s suite of production tools. It even makes a point of bragging that Artlist only bought its Super Bowl space about a week ago and spent a mere five days producing the commercial. That would be impressive if Artlist’s final product actually looked like something that would get average consumers to want to use these tools.

Instead, the ad features the very hallmarks that have convinced people to see AI-generated video as slop. Rather than telling a short, compelling, cohesive story of any kind, the ad is just a series of very short clips of animals doing weird things, strung together with a voice-over. There is nothing innovative about it. And given how much slop there already is in the world, the whole thing feels more like a threat than a promise of good things to come.

For its presence at the Super Bowl, vodka brand Svedka — which is owned by Sazerac Company — resurrected its old Fembot CGI character, gave her a new male-presenting companion called Brobot, and dropped the android pair into a commercial that was almost entirely created with gen AI. Though Fembot has previously been part of the larger Svedka brand and has always looked… like that, everything about the Brobot character feels like a ripoff of I, Robot’s Sonny character, who was portrayed by Alan Tudyk in the 2004 film.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter ahead of the Super Bowl, Sazerac’s chief marketing officer, Sara Saunders, said that using AI to create the ad didn’t actually save the company all that much time or money. Rather, Sazerac felt that an AI aesthetic could be thematically resonant for a vodka brand, and the company believed that the ad could convey a message that “is ultimately pro-human.”

The ad’s story is pretty straightforward: Two robots show up at a club, pop bottles of vodka out of their bodies, and proceed to get drunk while standing in a crowd of awkwardly dancing, AI-generated humans. We’re meant to understand that liquor helps machines let loose in a very human way. But what stands out most about the commercial is the way Brobot starts short-circuiting after gulping down a drink, which immediately starts spilling down its chassis because the machine’s mouth isn’t connected to an internal system of pipes that are meant to process fluids.

Though Sazerac says Brobot’s malfunction is intentional, it looks very much like the sort of gross accidental video output that AI models have been known to generate without being explicitly prompted to do so. The sequence reads like the Brobot character is breaking itself by interacting with Svedka’s product, which isn’t exactly the sort of message that alcohol companies have been known to lean into. Sazerac can try all it wants to spin the Svedka ad as a win that’s in line with the vodka brand’s identity, but the most pro-human thing the company could have done in this situation would have been to hire more humans to develop a better idea.

Clearly, we’re not alone in our feelings about gen AI’s less-than-polished production process, which is why it was even riskier for these brands to participate in it this year. So much animosity is in the air that people are now quick to assume that wonky visuals are AI-generated, even if sloppy editing work might actually be to blame.

One of the most star-studded Super Bowl commercials was a Jurassic Park-themed ad for Comcast’s Xfinity network that digitally de-aged Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum. While people across social media have remarked that the questionable CGI and de-aging “look like AI slop,” Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Lola VFX are actually credited for creating the visual effects — the latter of which has been digitally de-aging actors for years in movies like X-Men: The Last Stand and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.

Dunkin’s ad spot fell foul of the same speculation regarding AI usage. The “Good Will Dunkin’” commercial featured de-aged versions of Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, and other stars parodying a ’90s sitcom, but the oddly smoothed skin and unnatural facial movements have divided opinions online regarding whether AI was used to shave three decades off the actors’ appearances. Sure, the ad has gone viral because people are playing “spot the AI Super Bowl ads,” but none of those conversations are about coffee or pastries.

There are usually some machine learning processes involved with creating computer-generated effects, but these are typically embedded with creative software editing tools rather than the text-to-video models now associated with AI videos. (We have reached out to Dunkin’, ILM, and Lola VFX to ask what tools were used to create the Xfinity and Dunkin’ ads.)

AI usage has also worked its way into rivalries between companies, as seen with the Super Bowl ad for Pepsi Zero Sugar. The commercial, set to Queen’s “I Want to Break Free,” features a CGI polar bear (traditionally a Coca-Cola mascot) having a crisis about preferring Pepsi in a blind taste test. It ends with the message that consumers “deserve taste” — possibly a jab at Coca-Cola’s controversial AI-generated holiday ads. In a statement to AdWeek, Pepsi marketing VP Gustavo Reyna said it was important to have a human touch in the ad. “If there’s something we care about and we believe in, it’s in the craft and the creativity of our people, our talent, and our partners,” Reyna said. Even if this is meant to be understood that unlike Coca-Cola, Pepsi is not using AI, it is suspicious by association on account of the “animals doing weird stuff” trope farmed so sloppily by Artlist.

This latest crop of gen AI ads was, in part, aiming to normalize the technology via onslaught. But the point of a truly effective Super Bowl ad is to create a cultural moment that is positive and exciting to associate with your product. Instead, the ads have left people questioning: Is it AI? Does it just look like AI? Does it even matter anymore?

            <div id="article-text">There’s a lot of Gorilla glass and aluminum, as well as a surprising number of buttons and physical controls.

There’s a lot of Gorilla glass and aluminum, as well as a surprising number of buttons and physical controls.

Ferrari released the first interior images of the company’s first all-electric supercar, called the Ferrari Luce (“light” in Italian). This is the second time the Italian automaker has teased the Luce (formerly Elettrica) without showing us the actual car, or even a silhouette. But the interior images should suffice given the bold-faced name of the designer: Jony Ive.

Ferrari decided to outsource the work of designing the Luce’s interior to Ive and his partner Marc Newson, who together run the design shop LoveFrom. Ive, obviously, is well known for his work as Apple’s former chief designer, overseeing such iconic products as the iMac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Now he’s turning his attention to a vehicle from Ferrari — and perhaps, in the process, giving us an idea of what an Apple car could have looked like, had the tech giant decided to pursue its secretive Project Titan instead of spiking it.

Ferrari and LoveFrom have been quietly collaborating for five years, and the Luce is the first time we’re seeing the results. The tech underpinnings were revealed last year in Italy; the exterior will debut in May 2026.

Ive’s work at Apple focused on sleek minimalism, so it is somewhat surprising to see a bunch of buttons in the Luce’s interior. When I first heard that Ive was handling the design, I expected Ferrari to turn over all of its controls to a touchscreen. So it was encouraging to see a fair amount of physical controls. Of course, the screens all have rounded corners reminiscent of the iPhone or iPad, so Ive’s influence is still front and center.

Ive’s influence is also felt in the materials used in the Luce’s interior, such as anodized aluminum and strengthened glass from specialist firm Corning — two key components of Apple’s products.

The steering features a simplified three-spoke design inspired by classic Ferrari wheels from the 1950s and ’60s. The spokes are made from 100 percent recycled aluminum, CNC-machined from 19 individual parts, and weighs 400 grams less than a standard Ferrari wheel.

The Luce has three main displays: an instrument cluster, a central display, and rear control panel. The gauge cluster actually moves with the steering wheel (a Ferrari first), using overlapping OLED displays that blend digital and analog cues. The ultra-thin OLED displays are made by Samsung with cutouts that reveal a second display underneath, adding literal visual depth.

Ive’s influence is also felt in the materials used in the Luce’s interior, such as anodized aluminum and strengthened glass from specialist firm Corning

The central display sits on a ball-and-socket joint, allowing it to rotate toward either the driver or passenger. It also includes a palm rest so you can interact with controls without looking. And the mechanical multigraph display with three independent motors functions as a clock, chronograph, compass, or launch control indicator.

The key fob features its own E Ink display, which Ferrari claims is an automotive first, that only uses power when it changes color. Insert the key into the central console, and the E Ink screen shifts from yellow to black as the cabin wakes up.

The gear shifter features Gorilla glass; in fact, some 40-odd pieces featuring the durable, scratch-resistant glass are scattered throughout the cabin, some of which feature laser-drilled micro-holes to deposit ink for the graphics.

It makes sense that Ferrari would outsource the work to Ive and his firm. After all, it was the Ferrari FF that was the first production car to feature Apple CarPlay in 2014. Even so, the automaker has yet to say whether it will adopt the more deeply integrated CarPlay Ultra in the future.

Ive was on hand in San Francisco to reveal the new interior, where he told reporters that his firm had been working in secret for five years. The renowned designer said he was unfamiliar with the safety and regulatory requirements of auto design before embarking on this particular project.

“It’s very hard,” Ive told Tim Stevens of Engadget. “I’ve never worked in an area that’s so regulated. Some of it’s great, because you understand why, and people’s safety is certainly important, but some of it drives you nuts.”

The Pixel 9A is an incredible phone that’s worth hopping on while it’s $349 for the 128GB version in blue, black, or pink at Amazon and Best Buy. It’s discounted ahead of the new Pixel 10A, for which Google will open pre-orders on February 18. That’s also when the company will share more details regarding specs and price for the midrange phone.

The Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone. Read our review.

Even at its original $499 price, our reviewer Allison Johnson felt that what you got for the money was just right. The Pixel 9A is an especially great value at this sale price. It has an IP68 rating, seven years of software updates, a larger, brighter screen than the Pixel 8A, plus wireless charging and a 120Hz refresh rate.

The Sony WF-1000XM6 will reportedly feature a faster processor and an upgrade to eight mics instead of six.

Following images of Sony’s new WF-1000XM6 earbuds shared by a retailer last week ahead of an official announcement, reliable leaker billbil-kun has revealed what they’re claiming are the full specs and new features of the company’s next flagship buds.

The WF-1000XM6 will be powered by a new QN3e processor that’s “three times faster” than what’s inside the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds that debuted over two-and-a-half years ago. The upgraded processor will provide improved ANC performance alongside the addition of two more microphones, giving the WF-1000XM6 eight in total. The new earbuds will also feature a “new speaker, an improved DAC, and an enhanced amplifier,” according to billbil-kun.

Battery life for the buds themselves will still be up to eight hours with ANC turned on, which can be extended by an extra 16 hours using their charging case, matching both the WF-1000XM5 and 2021’s WF-1000XM4. As revealed last week through the early photos, Sony is also further refining the size, shape, and ergonomics of the WF-1000XM6 so they’re more comfortable to wear with “insulated tips” that could provide an improved fit. When connected to the Sony | Sound Connect app, you’ll also have more control over how music sounds using an equalizer that’s being upgraded from five adjustable bands to 10.

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

Making AI Work, MIT Technology Review’s new AI newsletter, is here

For years, our newsroom has explored AI’s limitations and potential dangers, as well as its growing energy needs. And our reporters have looked closely at how generative tools are being used for tasks such as coding and running scientific experiments.But how is AI actually being used in fields like health care, climate tech, education, and finance? How are small businesses using it? And what should you keep in mind if you use AI tools at work? These questions guided the creation of Making AI Work, a new AI mini-course newsletter. Read more about it, and sign up here to receive the seven editions straight to your inbox.

—William Alexander, an ambitious 21-year old AI worker, explains his and his cohort’s attitudes towards trying to make it big in the highly-competitive industry to the New York Times.

The open-source AI boom is built on Big Tech’s handouts. How long will it last?In May 2023 a leaked memo reported to have been written by Luke Sernau, a senior engineer at Google, said out loud what many in Silicon Valley must have been whispering for weeks: an open-source free-for-all is threatening Big Tech’s grip on AI.

In many ways, that’s a good thing. AI won&#39;t thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Austrian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include cloud computing that allows agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turns out that the post Karpathy shared was later reported to be fake—placed by a human to advertise an app. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a Swedish AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

And yet, even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook post telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet abusive comments at Elon Musk.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <div id="article-text">The European Union has formally inaugurated NanoIC, a semiconductor pilot line backed by a €700 million investment under the European Chips Act.

The facility aims to accelerate the development of advanced chip technologies and strengthen Europe’s position in the global semiconductor landscape.

Situated at the research hub imec in Leuven, NanoIC is designed as an open pilot line where companies, research institutes, and startups can prototype and test cutting-edge components before commercial deployment.

Unlike traditional closed fabs, the facility offers access to beyond-2-nanometre system-on-chip (SoC) technologies, early-stage process design kits, and advanced toolsets that bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application.

Officials from the European Commission, imec leadership, and industry partners marked the launch at an event in Leuven, highlighting the pilot line as a key milestone in Europe’s semiconductor sovereignty strategy.

The investment forms part of a broader €2.5 billion Chips Act programme supported by national governments and private partners, including ASML, underscoring a shared effort to make the continent more competitive in next-generation electronics.

NanoIC’s capabilities target innovations across critical markets such as artificial intelligence, 6G communications, autonomous systems, and health technologies, where advanced chip performance and efficiency are crucial.

By lowering barriers to access for SMEs and research organisations, the initiative seeks to diversify Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem and catalyse new product development without the massive upfront costs of commercial fabs.

The pilot line is one of the first tangible outcomes of the Chips Act’s “Chips for Europe” initiative, which also includes other pilot lines focusing on packaging, wide bandgap materials, and photonic integrated circuits.

These efforts reflect growing pressure on the EU to reduce reliance on Asian and U.S. supply chains and to foster a more resilient semiconductor industry at home.

Industry observers say that by opening facilities like NanoIC to a broad set of stakeholders, Europe can speed up the transition from research breakthroughs to commercially viable technologies, addressing long-standing gaps in chip production capabilities and cultivating talent across the continent.

            <div id="article-text">Everyone knows Super Bowl commercials are expensive, bombastic, and designed to be talked about. What we didn’texpect was an AI startup using the biggest ad stage of the year to throw shade at a rival’s advertising strategy.

That’s exactly what Anthropic has done. The company bought Super Bowl airtime to broadcast a simple message: “Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude.” Its ads depict a chatbot spitting product pitches mid-conversation, ending with a clear contrast to its own ad-free promise.

Even ads these days aren’t what they used to be.

On paper, it’s witty positioning. In practice, it’s a symbolic escalation of the AI narrative war, from technical features and safety debate to brand virtue signaling.

Here’s the setup: OpenAI, facing towering infrastructure costs and financial pressure, has signalled a shift toward ads in ChatGPT’s free and lower-cost tiers, saying they’ll be clearly labelled and won’t influence the assistant’s output.

Anthropic has seized on this to frame itself as the principled alternative, a chatbot that will remain ad-free. I will save these ads in case we need to for the future.

Ads in any product that’s expensive to operate are a practical monetization strategy, not a nightmare scenario. OpenAI’s plan doesn’t involve bots randomly pitching breakfast cereal mid-answer. That exaggerated depiction belongs in satire, not an accurate product comparison.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman responded by calling Anthropic’s portrayal “clearly dishonest,” noting that the company won’t implement ads in the intrusive way the ads suggest.

That exchange tells you everything you need to know about how this story has been framed.

This clash highlights a broader trend: ethical stances are being used as marketing weapons. Instead of discussing the trade-offs that come with running large AI models, including cost, access, and user choice, the conversation has been reduced to a simple morality play: “Ads are bad; we are good.”

That’s not a serious engagement with the business realities, it’s advertising dressed up as principle.

Whether conversational AI should have ads isn’t a clear ethical line like privacy or data misuse. It’s a product design choice with real implications.

Free users get wider access, maybe subsidized by ads. Paying customers can avoid them. People who care deeply about ad-free experiences pay a premium. Those indifferent to ads choose products that suit them.

What makes this episode interesting, and a bit absurd, is that both Anthropic and OpenAI are unprofitable and competing for narrative territory as much as market share. Spending Super Bowl-level money to argue over why your chatbot won’t show ads feels less like product differentiation and more like a branding battle staged for investors and tech pundits.

This isn’t just about two companies squabbling over who’s less commercial. It’s symptomatic of a broader issue in AI discourse: nuance gets swallowed by cliffnotes. Instead of explaining the real trade-offs to users, cost structures, pricing tiers, and data policies, we get satirical commercials aired to millions, turning complex decisions into sound bites.

That’s a sign of how the AI narrative is evolving: not through clear debate about trade-offs and user impact, but through curated messages designed to elicit applause. If we want a responsible monetization conversation in AI, it needs to happen outside of game-day spots and brand posturing.

Honestly, I miss the days when we were critiquing mistakes in commercials, when advertising was genuinely creative because it came from real insights we all recognized, when the jokes were original. After all, they weren’t pulled from an AI’s memory. That’s just me.

The only real things at the Super Bowl this year are Bad Bunny and Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.
