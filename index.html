            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/heres-why-nasa-and-the-space-force-are-interested-in-pizza-shaped-satellites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four small satellites rode a Rocket Lab Electron launch vehicle into orbit from Virginia early Thursday, beginning a government-funded technology demonstration mission to test the performance of a new spacecraft design.

The satellites were nestled inside a cylindrical dispenser on top of the 59-foot-tall (18-meter) Electron rocket when it lifted off from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility at 12:03 am EST (05:03 UTC). A little more than an hour later, the rocket’s upper stage released the satellites one at a time at an altitude of about 340 miles (550 kilometers).

The launch was the starting gun for a “proof of concept” mission to test the viability of a new kind of satellite called DiskSats. These satellites were designed by the Aerospace Corporation, a nonprofit federally funded research and development center. The project is jointly financed by NASA and the US Space Force, which paid for DiskSat’s development and launch, respectively.

“DiskSat is a lightweight, compact, flat disc-shaped satellite designed for optimizing future rideshare launches,” the Aerospace Corporation says in a statement.

The DiskSats are 39 inches (1 meter) wide, about twice the diameter of a New York-style pizza, and measure just 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) thick. Made of composite carbon fiber, each satellite carries solar cells, control avionics, reaction wheels, and an electric thruster to change and maintain altitude.

“The launch went perfectly, and the DiskSat dispenser worked exactly as designed,” said Darren Rowen, the project’s chief engineer, in a statement. “We’re pleased to have established contact with all four of the DiskSats, and we’re looking forward to the rest of the demonstration mission.”

The Aerospace Corporation has a long history of supporting of the US military and NASA since its founding in 1960. A few years ago, engineers at the center came up with the DiskSat concept after surveying the government’s emerging needs in spaceflight.

CubeSats have been a ubiquitous part of the satellite industry for nearly a quarter-century. They are based on a cube-shaped design, measuring about 10 centimeters per side, but can be scaled from a single cube “unit” to three, six, 12, or more, depending on mission requirements. The CubeSat standard has become a popular choice for commercial companies, the military, NASA, and universities looking to build small satellites on a tight budget.

By one measure, nearly 3,000 CubeSats have launched since the first one soared into orbit in 2003. After originally being confined to low-Earth orbit, they have now flown to high-altitude orbits, to the Moon, and to Mars.

While CubeSats are now prolific, engineers at the Aerospace Corporation saw an opportunity to improve on the concept. Debra Emmons, Aerospace’s chief technology officer, said the idea originated from Rich Welle, a scientist recently retired from the center’s Experiments Lab, or xLab, division.

“They were asking questions,” Emmons recounted in an interview with Ars. “They were looking at CubeSat studies and looking at some alternatives. The typical CubeSat is, in fact, a cube. So, the idea was could you look at some different types of form factors that might be able to generate more power … and offer up benefit for certain mission applications?”

Aerospace’s research team arrived at the DiskSat design. Emmons said the stackable flat-panel format is easier to pack for launch than a CubeSat. The concept is similar to SpaceX’s pioneering approach to launching stackable Starlink Internet satellites, but DiskSats are significantly smaller, lighter, and adaptable to different kinds of missions.

DiskSats have several advantages over CubeSats, according to the Aerospace Corporation. Each of the four DiskSats launched Thursday has a mass of about 35 pounds (16 kilograms), less than that of a typical 12U CubeSat. But a DiskSat has more than 13 times the surface area on a single side, providing valuable real estate for developers to load up the satellite with power-generating solar arrays, sensors, antennas, or other payloads that simply won’t fit on a CubeSat.

SpaceX’s current generation of mass-produced Starlink V2 satellites, by comparison, each have a mass of more than 1,100 pounds, or 500 kilograms.

DiskSat’s design offers “a power-to-weight ratio unmatched by traditional aluminum satellites,” the Aerospace Corporation says. In a research paper published earlier this year, engineers from the Aerospace Corporation claimed DiskSat can generate five to 10 times more power than a CubeSat.

What kinds of missions might DiskSat be useful for? One idea involves placing a large radar antenna—too big to fit on any other low-mass satellite—on the broadside of a DiskSat to collect all-weather surveillance imagery. Similarly-sized antennas on other DiskSats could support high-bandwidth communications.

With this demo mission, the Aerospace Corporation will test the performance of the DiskSat platform in space for the first time. Engineers will initially look at how the satellites function at 340 miles, then use their electric thrusters to gradually step down to lower altitudes, where another aspect of DiskSat’s design will shine.

Flying edge-on, the satellite’s pancake shape will minimize aerodynamic drag as the DiskSats encounter thicker air below 250 miles. Continual pulsing from the satellites’ electric thrusters will allow the DiskSats to maintain altitude as they glide through the uppermost layers of the atmosphere.

“The primary mission is to demonstrate and to understand the performance, functionality and maneuverability of the DiskSat buses on orbit, particularly in low-Earth orbit, or LEO, and very low-Earth orbit, or VLEO,” said Catherine Venturini, DiskSat’s principal investigator.

“In theory, I think you could operate down to 200 kilometers (124 miles) with electric propulsion,” Emmons said. That is two to three times closer to Earth than most commercial radar imaging satellites. Other satellite operators are also assessing the viability of flying remote sensing missions in VLEO.

Flying closer to the ground delivers higher-resolution imagery, bringing cities, ships, airports, and military bases into sharper view. So it’s easy to see why the Space Force is interested in the DiskSat concept.

DiskSat’s engineers acknowledge there are drawbacks to the format. With such a large surface area, it’s more difficult to manage the temperature extremes of low-Earth orbit than it is with a conventional cube-shaped satellite. While DiskSats carry a lot of oomph to change altitude, their shape makes them somewhat clunky and hard to turn, and engineers say they aren’t well suited for missions requiring agile pointing.

The Aerospace Corporation is a research center, not a commercial satellite manufacturer. Officials at the nonprofit are looking to hand over the DiskSat design to industry through a technology transfer agreement. “The plan is to release or license the technology to partners once it is flight-proven,” the Aerospace Corporation says on its website.

“We think this new technology will be disruptive to the small spacecraft enterprise and ecosystem,” said Eric Breckheimer, DiskSat’s program manager.

DiskSat’s stackable design makes it possible to launch a fleet of high-power, low-mass satellites in one go, according to Emmons.

Following the trend toward bigger CubeSats, the DiskSat format could also grow larger to take advantage of heavier rockets. “There’s a key scalability aspect, and with that in mind, you could bring an entire constellation of DiskSats with you in a single launch,” Breckheimer said.</div>

            <h2>Parasites plagued Roman soldiers at Hadrian’s Wall</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/study-roman-soldiers-battled-parasites-at-hadrians-wall/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It probably sucked to be a Roman soldier guarding Hadrian’s Wall circa the third century CE. W.H. Auden imagined the likely harsh conditions in his poem “Roman Wall Blues,” in which a soldier laments enduring wet wind and rain with “lice in my tunic and a cold in my nose.” We can now add chronic nausea and bouts of diarrhea to his list of likely woes, thanks to parasitic infections, according to a new paper published in the journal Parasitology.

As previously reported, archaeologists can learn a great deal by studying the remains of intestinal parasites in ancient feces. For instance, in 2022, we reported on an analysis of soil samples collected from a stone toilet found within the ruins of a swanky 7th-century BCE villa just outside Jerusalem. That analysis revealed the presence of parasitic eggs from four different species: whipworm, beef/pork tapeworm, roundworm, and pinworm. (It’s the earliest record of roundworm and pinworm in ancient Israel.)

Later that same year, researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of British Columbia analyzed the residue on an ancient Roman ceramic pot excavated at the site of a 5th-century CE Roman villa at Gerace, a rural district in Sicily. They identified the eggs of intestinal parasitic worms commonly found in feces—strong evidence that the 1,500-year-old pot in question was most likely used as a chamber pot.

Other prior studies have compared fecal parasites found in hunter-gatherer and farming communities, revealing dramatic dietary changes, as well as shifts in settlement patterns and social organization coinciding with the rise of agriculture. This latest paper analyzes sediment collected from sewer drains at the Roman fort at Vindolanda, located just south of the defense fortification known as Hadrian’s Wall.

An antiquarian named William Camden recorded the existence of the ruins in a 1586 treatise. Over the next 200 years, many people visited the site, discovering a military bathhouse in 1702 and an altar in 1715.  Another altar found in 1914 confirmed that the fort had been called Vindolanda. Serious archaeological excavation at the site began in the 1930s. The site is most famous for the so-called Vindolanda tablets, among the oldest surviving handwritten documents in the UK—and for the 2023 discovery of what appeared to be an ancient Roman dildo, although others argued the phallus-shaped artifact was more likely to be a drop spindle used for spinning yarn.

Per the authors of this latest paper, analyzing fecal matter (paleoparasitology) from Roman Britain  has thus far largely been done at urban centers such as London and York, and the only site where it has been done along Hadrian’s Wall is Carlisle. Vindolanda’s exceptional preservation makes it a prime candidate for learning more about the transmission of parasites and resulting gastrointestinal diseases among the Roman military manning the northern frontiers at that time.

The material was collected in 2019 from the main drain carrying latrine waste from the bath house toilet down to the stream and valley to the north. The team also excavated what was left of a 17th-century farmhouse, where they found sealed deposits from a previous third-century bath house drain at the site. They collected and analyzed 58 samples of sediment from those drains, as well as one sample collected from a nearby fort ditch circa 90 CE.

The analysis revealed that 28 percent of the samples contained eggs from either roundworms or whipworms, intestinal parasites typically spread as a result of poor sanitation, either via food, drink, or hands that come in contact with fecal matter. The first-century fort sample also contained roundworms and whipworms. Using a biomolecular method that binds antibodies to proteins produced by single-cell organisms, they found traces of a microscopic protozoan parasite called Giardia duodenalis. According to the authors, this suggests Roman solders regularly suffered from diarrhea and malnutrition.

Even having communal latrines and a sewer system apparently didn’t prevent parasitic transmission. “While the Romans were aware of intestinal worms, there was little their doctors could do to clear infection by these parasites or help those experiencing diarrhoea, meaning symptoms could persist and worsen,” said co-author Marissa Ledger of the University of Cambridge. “These chronic infections likely weakened soldiers, reducing fitness for duty. Helminths alone can cause nausea, cramping and diarrhea.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A couple of hours after a judge formally swore in private astronaut Jared Isaacman as the next administrator of NASA on Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order outlining his space policy objectives for the next three years.

The executive order, titled “Ensuring American Space Superiority,” states that the country must “pursue a space policy that will extend the reach of human discovery, secure the nation’s vital economic and security interests, unleash commercial development, and lay the foundation for a new space age.”

There is nothing Earth-shattering in the new executive order, as much of it builds on previously announced policies that span multiple administrations. There are some notable points in the document that clearly reflect the White House’s priorities, though, and Isaacman’s leadership of NASA.

Strikingly, there is no mention of a concrete plan to send humans to Mars in this document. There are just two references to the red planet, both of which talk about sending humans there as a far-off goal. One source recently told Ars that as soon as Trump learned there was no way humans could land on Mars during his second term, he was no longer interested in that initiative.

Also absent from this document is much reference to space science, with only a mention of “optimizing space research-and-development investments to achieve my Administration’s near-term space objectives.”

The architect of the Trump Administration’s proposed deep cuts in space science (which Congress has largely forestalled) was Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget. It’s probably not a great indicator for science missions that Isaacman is directed to coordinate with Vought’s office to achieve policy objectives in the executive order.

All told, the policies Trump signed are generally forward-looking, seeking to modernize NASA’s exploration efforts. Isaacman will face many challenges, including landing humans on the Moon by 2028 and working with industry to develop an on-time successor to the International Space Station. Whether and how he meets these challenges will be an intriguing storyline in the coming months and years.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a year of record gains for the crypto industry, recent forces have sent itinto a tailspin. Bitcoin, for example, reached dazzling heights of more than $120,000 in October — before crashing back down to around $88,000 today, about 12 percent down from where it was a year ago.

While that might be bad news for crypto bros or Robinhood day traders, one economist argues that the decline is actually good news for the rest of us.

Co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research Dean Baker argued in his blog Beat The Press this week that as the major cryptocurrencies fall, purchasing power for the rest of us goes up. In his analysis, he compares crypto to counterfeit currency — fake money that allows shady gangs to buy up all kinds of scarce goods, like houses and sports tickets.

When they buy up those goods with funny money, they help drive prices up, making them less affordable for those of us who don’t play the game.

“If some supersleuth detective figured out a way to recognize the counterfeit bills, they could then remove trillions of dollars of fake money from circulation,” Baker explains. “This would benefit the general public by reducing demand in the economy and reversing the run-up in the price of housing and Superbowl tickets. It is the same story with plunging crypto prices.”

From this reading, crypto — which infamously has no real value — allows people to suck up “large chunks” of the economy with a currency that’s built on thin air. When their share of fake money shrinks, it eases pressure on the rest of us. “To put it simply: there’s more for everyone else,” Baker explains.

We’re not talking small, intangible changes, either. By Baker’s count, the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Etherium have shed over $1.2 trillion in market cap, or “enough to send every household in the United States a check for $10,000.”

In his thinking, everybody who doesn’t own it should be cheering for crypto’s ongoing downfall to continue.

“The only possible impact of lower crypto prices on production is that we will make less crypto,” says Baker. “The horror! The horror!”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sure, an inexplicable small-town mystery is fun.

But for John Grossnickle, sheriff of Sweetwater County, Wyoming, this one’s getting a little stale. For over a year, Sweetwater officials have been trying to get to the bottom of a series of unexplained appearances by unidentified flying objects.

Alarmingly, the UFOs seem to have a peculiar interest in a local power facility, the Jim Bridger Steam Plant, which houses four coal-fired generators.

“We’ve worked with everybody,” the sheriff’s spokesperson, Jason Mower told the Cowboy State Daily. “We’ve done everything we can to figure out what they are, and nobody wants to give us any answers.”

Sheriff Grossnickle, who began fielding calls about the sightings 13 months ago, says he’s now observed them with his own eyes. The objects are said to be “lighted” and “drone-like,” and congregate together in “coordinated formations,” CSD reports. They’re typically reported between 2am or 3am.

Shooting them down isn’t an option, as they fly thousands of feet above ground. A state investigation doesn’t seem to be on the table either, as Wyoming National Guard adjutant general Greg Porter said he “doesn’t think he could discuss [them] in open testimony,” per CSD.

“It’s like the new normal,” Mower explained. “It’s like this phenomenon that continues to happen, but it’s not causing any, you know, issues that we have to deal with — other than the presence of them.”

Officials in Sweetwater aren’t alone. Seven sheriffs of nearby counties canvassed by CSD said they’d either viewed similar mystery objects or received reports about them from locals. Back in January, three of those sheriffs had documented sightings above energy infrastructure such as oil fields and power plants, CSD reported at the time.

The strange Wyoming sightings come nearly a year after similar drone hysteria in New Jersey was seemingly put to rest. Despite a huge mystery back in late 2024, president Donald Trump claimed tho drones were authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration for research.

Whether the same can be said for the Wyoming UFO mystery? That’s anyone’s guess.

            <div id="article-text">What’re professional team sports without a good shoving match? Basketball star Kyrie Irving got into one recently — though not on the court, but with a humanoid robot.

In a video shared by the Dallas Mavericks social media page, a Unitree G1 android shows off its slick karate moves in front of the team, before Irving approaches and squares it up. The diminutive 4’2″ robot displays better survival instincts than most humans and nervously skitters away from the imposing athlete, who is two feet taller.

But it was to no avail. Irving shoves it in the chest, and the robot stumbles with human-like agility — or lack thereof — before falling flat on its back. Onlookers howl in laughter as it lies paralyzed on the ground, utterly motionless.

“My apologies, I thought I could push him a little harder,” Irving says, while the robot’s operators attend to it like courtside medics. “My bad.”

Maybe next time he can shoot hoops with one instead.

Back falls are no joke. Irving and the others try to lift the bot back on its feet, but it remains unresponsive, its limbs flopping around. Later, Irving comes back to check on it one last time, but it’s still out cold.

The Unitree G1 has become a cultural sensation with its surprising spryness and cute stature, with influencers using them for all kinds of slapstick stunts and “GONE WRONG!” videos. Some have become their own mini-celebrities, like “Jake the Rizzbot,” which is known for slinging Gen-Z slang and coming out as gay, whatever that means for a robot.

One way Unitree bots often shows off their adroitness is by performing martial arts moves, a trend that other robotics companies have eagerly jumped on (with some interesting iterations.) The flipside is that they also make tempting punching-bags for humans. No doubt that it’s hilarious to see them ragdoll on the ground after getting laid out, but they can only take so much abuse. The owners of Jake the Rizzbot, for instance, are currently suing the popular streamer IShowSpeed for allegedly wrecking their little celebrity after he punched it in the face, pinned it to a couch, and threw it to the ground during a stream.

As it stands, it’s unclear what condition the Mavericks robot is in after Irving made it eat pavement. But we hope it’s okay — if not for its sake, then for our own.

“Skynet will remember that,” a commenter joked.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Krafton, the South Korean gaming company behind hit titles such as PUBG and Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), is launching a growth investment fund focused on India, stepping up its push into the world’s largest internet user base.

Called the Unicorn Growth Fund, the investment vehicle is a collaboration between Krafton and South Korean internet conglomerate Naver, and investor Mirae Asset. It aims to deploy up to ₹60 billion (around $669.3 million) over four years, Krafton confirmed to TechCrunch.

The fund, which will be managed by Mirae Asset Venture India, is expected to be established in January and begin operations with an initial size of more than ₹30 billion (about $334.6 million). Krafton will contribute ₹12.3 billion (approximately $137.2 million) at the first close, the company said.

Naver’s capital commitment is expected to be “broadly comparable” to Krafton’s $137 million investment, a Krafton spokesperson told TechCrunch. The fund will not operate with rigid country-allocation thresholds, and typical investment sizes are expected to range between $10 million and $30 million, the spokesperson said.

Krafton said investments through the new fund would primarily be treated as financial positions rather than strategic bets, though the level of engagement with portfolio companies could vary depending on the opportunity and long-term potential of each business.

To date, Krafton has invested more than $200 million in India, backing companies in the gaming, content and fintech spaces. Recent investments include fintech Cashfree and venture fund IMM Investment, alongside earlier bets on gaming and content platforms such as Nodwin Gaming, Loco, Pratilipi, and Kuku FM. The company also launched a gaming incubator in India in 2023, and acquired a controlling stake in Indian gaming studio Nautilus Mobile for $14 million earlier this year.

Krafton’s expansion in India has not been without setbacks. New Delhi banned BGMI, the company’s flagship local title, in 2022, before allowing it to return in 2023 following a three-month trial approval. Krafton subsequently announced a $150 million investment commitment in the country.

BGMI, which has surpassed 240 million downloads, launched in 2021 as a revamped, localized version of PUBG Mobile, another popular title that was banned by the Indian government in mid-2020 over national security concerns. Since then, Krafton has made a series of operational changes in the country — including cutting ties with Tencent as its publisher and migrating its India servers to Microsoft’s Azure cloud — to address regulatory concerns.

With the new fund, Krafton is looking to extend its India strategy beyond gaming, channeling capital into a wider set of technology startups as it seeks to build a long-term presence in one of Asia’s fastest-growing digital markets.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/hacks-thefts-and-disruption-the-worst-data-breaches-of-2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every year, TechCrunch looks back at the cybersecurity horrorshows of the past 12 months — from the biggest data breaches to hacks resulting in weeks of disruption — to see what we can learn. This year, the data breaches were like nothing we’ve seen before.

Here’s our look back at some of the biggest security incidents of 2025, starting with:

The U.S. government remained one of the biggest targets in cyberspace. The year started with a brazen cyberattack by Chinese hackers on the U.S. Treasury, followed by the breaching of several federal agencies, including the agency tasked with safeguarding U.S. nuclear weapons, thanks to a SharePoint security flaw.

All the while, the Russian hackers were stealing sealed records from the U.S. Courts’ filing system, sending alarm bells ringing across the federal judiciary.

But nothing quite came as close as DOGE ripping through federal government departments and databases in what became the biggest raid of U.S. government data in its history.

The Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE as it was widely known, led by Elon Musk and his band of private sector lackeys, violated federal protocols and defied common security practices. They ransacked federal databases of citizens’ data, despite warnings of the national security risks and conflicts of interests over Musk’s overseas business dealings. Legal experts say that DOGE staffers are “personally liable” under U.S. hacking laws, though a court would also have to agree.

Musk’s subsequent, very public falling out with President Trump saw the billionaire leave DOGE, and left staffers fearing that they could face federal charges without his protection.

In late September, senior executives at American corporate giants began receiving threatening emails from a prolific ransomware and extortion group called Clop. The emails included an attached copy of their personal information — and a ransom demand for several million dollars not to publish it.

Months earlier, the Clop gang had quietly exploited a never-before-seen vulnerability in Oracle’s E-Business software, a suite of applications used for hosting a company’s core business information, such as financial and human resources records, supply chain data, and customer databases. The vulnerability allowed Clop to steal reams of sensitive employee data, including data belonging to executives, from dozens of organizations that rely on Oracle’s software.

Oracle had no idea until it was caught out in October as it was scrambling to patch the vulnerability. It was too late, though: the hackers had already stolen gobs of data from universities, hospitals and health systems, media organizations, and more.

This was Clop’s most recent mass-hacking campaign. The group had previously exploited flaws in enterprise file-transfer services, such as GoAnywhere, MOVEit, and Cleo Software, which tech giants use to share large amounts of information over the internet.

Salesforce customers had a rough year after two separate data breaches at downstream tech companies allowed hackers to steal a billion records of customer data stored in Salesforce’s cloud.

Hackers targeted at least two companies, Salesloft and Gainsight, both of which allow their customers to handle and analyze the data that they store in Salesforce.

By breaching these companies directly, the hackers gained access to all of the data through their customer connections to Salesforce. Some of the largest tech giants had data stolen in the breaches, including Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, Proofpoint, Docusign, GitLab, Linkedin, SonicWall and Verizon.

A hacking collective known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, made up of members from different hacking groups, including ShinyHunters, published a data leak site advertising the stolen records in exchange for a ransom paid by the victims. New victims are still rolling in.

Hackers tore through the U.K. retail sector earlier this year, stealing data from Marks & Spencer and at least 6.5 million customer records from the Co-op. The back-to-back hacks sparked outages and disruption across the retailers’ networks, and some grocery shelves went empty as the systems used to support the retailers were knocked out. Luxury store Harrods was also later hacked.

But a major cyberattack targeting Jaguar Land Rover, one of the country’s biggest employers, left a dent in the U.K. economy. A September hack and data breach saw JLR’s car plant stall production for months as the company worked to get its systems back up and running.

The fallout affected JLR’s suppliers across the U.K., some of whom went out of business altogether. The U.K. government ended up guaranteeing a bailout to the tune of £1.5 billion to ensure Jaguar Land Rover employees and suppliers got paid during the shutdown.

U.K. security experts said the breach was the most economically damaging cyberattack to hit the United Kingdom in history, showing that disruption may be more valuable for financially motivated hackers than stolen data.

South Korea experienced a major data breach every month this year, and the personal data of millions of its citizens was compromised thanks to security lapses and shoddy data practices at the country’s biggest tech and phone providers.

The country’s largest phone company, SK Telecom, was hacked and 23 million customer records were exposed; several cyberattacks were attributed to its hostile North Korean neighbor; and a massive data center fire wiped out years of Korean government data that wasn’t backed up.

But the cherry on data breach cake was the months-long theft of some 33 million customers’ personal information from Coupang, the country’s retail giant that some call Asia’s Amazon. The data theft began in June, but wasn’t detected until November, and ultimately led to the company’s chief executive resigning.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $100 billion in a funding round that could value the ChatGPT maker at up to $830 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources.

The company is aiming to raise the funding by the end of the calendar first quarter next year, and it may ask sovereign wealth funds to invest in the round, the WSJ reported. The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.

The funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits, suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.

And, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google, OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.

Meanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.

OpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.

If the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction.

OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.

            <h2>MAGA’s Immigration and Pronatalist Goals Are at Odds</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump, and the MAGA movement more broadly, have made two priorities very clear: They want fewer immigrants in America and more babies born to American mothers.

Those goals, however, are at odds. Millions of parents in the United States, native- and foreign-born alike, rely on immigrants to take care of their kids. (My toddler son has only ever been cared for by immigrant women, myself among them.) Immigrants make up at least 21 percent of the child-care workforce—and this may be an undercount. When fewer immigrants are in the American workforce, economic research suggests, women may work less or have fewer babies—possibly both.

In the first half of this year, Trump’s ICE agency made twice as many arrests as it did under the Biden administration during the same period last year. These efforts seem to have created a chilling effect, making many female immigrants scared to show up for work. According to a report from the New America Foundation published earlier this month, the arrests were associated with a loss of about 39,000 foreign-born child-care workers. Meanwhile, 77,000 U.S.-born mothers of kids under 5 dropped out of the workforce.

The study’s conclusion echoes past research by other scholars. A 2024 study found that Secure Communities, an Obama-administration program that led to hundreds of thousands of deportations, reduced the total number of day-care employees, in part by sparking fear among even documented immigrant workers. “Even if they are a legal immigrant,” Jessica Brown, an economics professor at the University of South Carolina’s business school and an author of the study, told me, “they may have family members who are not.” Brown estimates that during the Secure Communities era, 16,000 fewer people were working in child care and 1,700 fewer day cares were open than would have been otherwise. Brown theorized that lower-paid immigrant workers leaving the sector might have required child-care centers to bring in more higher-wage, native-born employees—“but maybe that’s not sustainable,” she said, “and so your center just closes instead.”

Read: An unexpected argument from the right

These reductions in the child-care workforce had a big impact on mothers, who are typically the parent to step in when a nanny or day care isn’t available. A study by Chloe East, an economist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and her co-authors found that Secure Communities was associated with mothers of young children becoming about 1 percent less likely to work—a small-seeming but significant decrease, when considering the 24 million working mothers in the U.S. East said she believes that this was because affordable child care became less available, given that a similar decrease was not seen among women without children or among fathers, who tend not to be the primary caregivers for young children.

Some researchers anticipate that the Trump administration’s ICE operations will affect immigrant child-care workers even more than Secure Communities did. “When we see ICE all over a city for a week, when we see them go to an apartment complex and try to knock on every single door,” East said, “that is a really new phenomenon at the scale that we’re seeing.” The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, estimated that if Trump succeeds in his goal of deporting 4 million people, employment in the child-care sector would shrink by about 15 percent, which would almost certainly make continuing to work more difficult for many mothers.

Perhaps this is what the MAGA movement wants: for American women to quit their jobs to stay at home with their kids. Several prominent MAGA figures, including Vice President J. D. Vance, have suggested parents do just that. But setting aside the fact that most mothers say they don’t want to do this, and that many working families cannot get by on only one income, making child care less available might not inspire working women to stay home. It could push them to have fewer kids.

The relationship between affordable child care and fertility is fuzzy; many countries with subsidized day care and other benefits for parents nevertheless have low birth rates. But some data suggest that as child care gets more expensive or less available, women have fewer kids. A recent working paper by Abigail Dow, an economics Ph.D. candidate at Boston University, found that higher child-care costs lead to lower birth rates and delay when mothers have their first child. When the price of child care for children under 3 increased by 10 percent, the birth rate of women ages 20 to 44 decreased by 5.7 percent.

Read: The loneliness of the conservative pronatalist

Research has shown that after immigration restrictions loosened in the 1960s and the immigrant population grew, the price of child care decreased relative to what it likely would have cost otherwise. That seems to have led to more educated women having kids: A one percentage-point increase in immigrants to a given metro area was associated with a 0.3-percentage-point increase in the probability of highly educated women having had a child in the previous year. According to Delia Furtado, an economist at the University of Connecticut and the author of that study, these mothers might have been responding not only to the cost of child care but also to its convenience and quality.

If the president and his supporters see the tension between anti-immigration policy and pronatalist efforts, they haven’t acknowledged it publicly. MAGA world may talk about both issues a great deal, but deportations almost always win out. Immigration was one of the most important issues to Trump voters in 2024; pronatalism is much less popular as an issue, and the majority of Republicans say the government should have no role in encouraging people to have more kids. In a speech to Congress this year, Trump used the word border 21 times and the word children just 10. Joshua C. Wilson, a political scientist at the University of Denver who studies the conservative movement, told me, “Immigration is the lead-off issue that gets the attention of the base.” Pronatalism, by contrast, is “multiple rows behind.”

The authors of Project 2025 call “open-borders activism” a type of “cheap grace,” which they define as “publicly promoting one’s own virtue without risking any personal inconvenience.” By this definition, MAGA’s pronatalist rhetoric can also be considered cheap grace: a way for the president and his administration to throw red meat to social conservatives without needing to adjust their anti-immigration stance—or to pay up for parental leave or subsidized child care. In his first public address as vice president, Vance said it should be “easier to raise a family” in America. His administration’s immigration policies could make doing so much harder.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If President Donald Trump wanted Americans to take away one message about autism, it was this: Blame Tylenol. During his September press conference on the subject, Trump warned pregnant women more than a dozen times not to take the drug, even though two massive studies had found no meaningful association with the disorder in children. He also spread false rumors that “essentially no autism” can be found in Cuba or among the Amish. The other stated purpose of the event—the announcement of what FDA Commissioner Marty Makary called an “exciting treatment” for autism—was largely overshadowed by the president’s performance.

But parents of autistic children took note of that promised remedy. How could they not? Officials suggested that the little-known drug, leucovorin, could alleviate the symptoms of profound autism, perhaps allowing children with speech difficulties to find their words. Hundreds of thousands would benefit, according to Makary. No, it wasn’t a cure—officials stopped short of invoking that word—but it sounded like a miracle.

After the government’s endorsement, many parents rushed to get their hands on leucovorin. They soon discovered that they were effectively taking part in a nationwide experiment with few guidelines—assuming, that is, they could even get a prescription.

The theory behind treating autism with leucovorin is that the drug gives autistic kids something they’re missing. Children with autism seem to be more likely than other children to produce an antibody that prevents folate, also known as vitamin B9, from reaching their brain. Because folate plays a role in brain development, some researchers—most notable among them Richard Frye, a doctor who has been prescribing and promoting leucovorin for nearly two decades, and who told me he spoke with leaders in the Health and Human Services Department before the press conference—think these antibodies might hamper the growth of a child’s language abilities. Leucovorin is essentially a massive dose of folate, delivered in a form that can bypass those antibodies.

But that theory, which has long been debated in autism subreddits and Facebook groups, hasn’t gained traction among mainstream autism scientists. They point to a 2018 study that found that autistic children and their non-autistic siblings were equally likely to have these antibodies. The clinical evidence for leucovorin’s effectiveness for autistic kids is limited to a handful of small studies that don’t measure the same outcomes. No large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial has ever been conducted. If you want to get the drug for autism, it has to be prescribed off-label, which many doctors refuse to do.

Part of the Trump administration’s promise was to make leucovorin more accessible to patients and easier for doctors to prescribe. So far, nothing official has happened. At the press conference, Makary promised that the FDA would change leucovorin’s label so that doctors could start prescribing it to kids with autism. But when the FDA formally laid out its leucovorin plan two days later, it made no mention of autism. The plan instead centered on cerebral folate deficiency, an extremely rare genetic condition. Emily Hilliard, an HHS spokesperson, wrote in an email that “the FDA’s current action is focused specifically on cerebral folate deficiency,” noting that some of its symptoms overlap with autism. (My other questions about the administration’s leucovorin rollout went unanswered.) A spokesperson for GSK, which originally manufactured the drug and controls the label, told me that the company submitted an application for the label change this week.

During the press conference, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, said that HHS would “help doctors treat children appropriately” with leucovorin. But Alycia Halladay, the chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, told me that physicians she’s spoken with have heard nothing from HHS. For her part, Halladay doesn’t believe that enough evidence exists to recommend leucovorin as an autism treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics has also said that the current data are lacking. In a statement, the organization allowed that if physicians prescribe the medication, they should work with families to monitor side effects; some parents report increased hyperactivity and aggression after their kids take leucovorin.

Several researchers I spoke with compared the excitement about leucovorin to the enthusiasm for secretin, another drug that was popular as an autism treatment in the 1990s after early promising results. More rigorous clinical trials later showed that it wasn’t effective. Halladay said she’s heard from multiple doctors, including her child’s pediatrician, that they’ve been besieged with calls from parents hoping to get a prescription. One doctor in Chicago told me he had received dozens of inquiries.

In the absence of official advice on leucovorin, parents—almost always moms—of kids with profound autism have been turning to one another for opinions and encouragement online.

Some post regular updates on TikTok and Instagram detailing their kid’s progress on leucovorin, saying they’ve noticed more regular eye contact, fewer repetitive movements and sounds, or improvements in language use. In the comments, fellow parents complain about not being able to get the drug (“My sons pediatrician refuses, wants us to just wait for prescribing guidelines”), ask questions about dosage (“I just gave her 15 mg today is that too much??”), and wonder whether it’s really working (“how do we know we see results, what do we see?”). Others say their child’s behavior didn’t improve—or even grew worse—after taking the medication (“I didn’t see it helping my son more with speech like we hoped”).

Some insist the drug must be paired with vitamin B12, omega-3, or a certain amino acid; others caution that dairy can reduce its effectiveness. Many want to know about an antibody test that purports to indicate whether a child’s brain is receiving enough folate. But that test isn’t widely accepted as valid, and not all doctors are willing to give it.

Jessie Carrasco is one of those TikTok moms. She lives with her husband and their three children on the outskirts of the east-Texas city of Tyler. Their oldest son, Ezra, is 11 and has autism. He didn’t talk until he was 4; she credits fish-oil supplements, in part, with helping him speak in short sentences and respond to simple questions. (Some studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish oil, may improve communication in autistic children, though the evidence is mixed.) When Carrasco invited me into their backyard, which was lively with chickens and dogs, Ezra ran up, gave me a quick once-over, and then darted off to play on the swing set with his younger brother.

Carrasco learned about leucovorin after hearing Trump refer to a new treatment for autism during his speech at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service. She emailed Ezra’s nurse practitioner, who was willing to prescribe it but didn’t know enough about the drug to offer advice on how much to give Ezra or how to deal with potential side effects. Since then, Carrasco has posted more than 200 videos on TikTok, most of them documenting Ezra’s progress on leucovorin. One clip shows him serving himself food from a pot on the stove—the first time he’d ever done that, she told me. Her video of Ezra before and after taking the drug has nearly 6,000 likes.

“Since we’ve been giving leucovorin, I think everything that we’ve been trying to teach, he’s started to get it more and faster,” she said. Ezra’s behavioral analyst, Margaret Hawkins, told me that before leucovorin, she used to work with Ezra on pronouncing single words; now she’s coaching him on telling three- or four-sentence stories.

Without Kennedy and Trump, Carrasco might not have learned about leucovorin; she’s grateful to them for giving her more faith in Ezra’s future, and hopes that the progress she’s seen so far won’t turn out to be a mirage. At the same time, she’s frustrated by the lack of information about how to use the drug and the difficulty she and other parents have had getting their hands on it. “I feel like they presented something and then just kind of left it in the dust,” she said. The last time she checked, the pharmacies in Tyler were out of leucovorin; she was planning to drive to a neighboring town to get more. “I got my hopes up and now I’m nervous,” she texted me recently. “I don’t wanna watch him regress.”

If the posts and comments are any indication, even parents who have managed to get prescriptions, like Carrasco, have been having trouble filling them. Whether the drug is in shortage now is unclear, but it has a history of supply problems going back more than a decade. A drug-shortage database maintained by a pharmacists’ association recently listed leucovorin shortages at five companies. (One of them, Teva, said its 25-milligram pills were in stock, but not its 5-milligram dose; the others either didn’t respond to me or couldn’t confirm whether they had supply issues.)

Perhaps because of shortages—or difficulties finding a doctor willing to prescribe leucovorin at all—some parents are turning to supplemental forms of folate. Such supplements are far less potent than leucovorin, but are usually cheaper and don’t require a prescription. (Even if leucovorin does turn out to be an effective autism treatment, it’s unknown whether low-dose supplements would have any effect.)

Offline, parents have been calling Frye, the longtime leucovorin doctor, who believes that as many as 1 million kids could benefit from the drug. He mostly treats children with significant language delays, though he says that the drug can sometimes help higher-functioning kids too. Frye was the lead author of a small 2016 study that found that children with autism who received leucovorin showed improvements in verbal communication, compared with those given a placebo; he also recently published a book called The Folate Fix. Ever since the press conference, his office has been inundated with calls and emails from parents who want the drug for their children.

For years, Frye has had a backlog of patients wanting to see him, but the White House announcement, he told me, made an “impossible situation worse.” He already has about 1,000 patients who are taking leucovorin, and he isn’t planning to accept any new ones until 2028. According to Frye, the FDA has asked him to submit an application to conduct clinical trials on leucovorin as an autism treatment, but last week, he told me that “not much is going on at this time.” He guesses those trials will take about two years. In the meantime, parents will be left to experiment with leucovorin on their own.</div>

What will you do about it? Nothing, as usual.  You whine and complain Russia is doing this to you, yet you do nothing in return.

Either punch the bully in the teeth with brass knuckles or stop complaining you&#39;ve been attacked.

As Ukraine has shown, taking the fight to the bully is the only way to get results.

No, it doesn&#39;t. Russia has shown they have a veto power through European courts over what happens to that money. Belgium and Italy gave it to them when they decided they fear Russia more than they like Ukraine. A few other countries in Europe are similarly weak-kneed.

The money the Europeans just approved for Ukraine is a loan and it is backed by the EU. They make reference to the Russian money and say that they will wait two years for Russia to pay reparations....which they know won&#39;t happen. The threat is that the EU will come for the money in two years but Russia known that is an empty threat. And Russia doesn&#39;t have to worry about Putin&#39;s Poodle, the alleged U.S. president, backing the EU.

Denmark would have to do it through NATO. The problem with that is the U.S. has a Putin Poodle as an alleged president and hence NATO cannot rely upon the U.S. to back them up. Even Putin himself says that Europe is out of step with a Moscow-friendly U.S. So the current U.S. will cede Russian hegemony over Europe, and el Bunko will laugh all the way to the bank. It will be a few years before the price for that capitulation by the U.S. becomes apparent, but that will be after el Bunko is gone and his Maggots

The practice should be illegal, punishable by both fines and being forced to sell the domain in an open auction for whatever the market will bear or relinquish it without recompense within 30 days.

So you&#39;re just going to seize somebody&#39;s because you&#39;ve decided that you don&#39;t like how they&#39;re using it?No, they&#39;re going to sell it to the highest bidder. You&#39;re going to need a tune-up on your translation software, Ivan.

No, they&#39;re going to seize a domain because it&#39;s being used *to commit a crime*.  That&#39;s a big difference.

If you&#39;re selling (or just giving away) copyrighted content, they will seize your domain, and then go about trying to sue or arrest you.

What shocks me here is how long it took to become such a popular thing?  Parking domains isn&#39;t that expensive, but certainly isn&#39;t free, especially in large numbers.  The people doing the parking are basically squatting on property they speculate will have value down the road.  They may as well collect a little &quot;rent&quot; on them while they squat?

I can remember when &quot;domain tasting&quot; first became a thing, I looked at it and thought,  &quot;This is a TERRIBLE idea, it&#39;s going to make it more expensive for people to start up their own web site and &#39;interesting&#39; domains are going to be unobtainable by the average person just because some squatter thinks they&#39;re parked on gold.&quot;  No random person is going to pay thousands of dollars for a domain name they fancy just for a hobby, so it&#39;s just going to stifle small private sites.

I don&#39;t know how it currently works, but back when it started you could &quot;taste&quot; a domain for months almost for free, and there was nothing stopping you from &quot;tasting&quot; it again the instant your current taste expired,  So you could squat domains for an unlimited time almost for free.  &quot;gee, nobody would ever abuse that!&quot;

Though now with the explosion of TLDs, it&#39;s widened the market so far that the squatters are finding it hard to cover all the bases.  Raise their rent! (and make the price go up exponentially to KEEP it parked)  Watch the squatters scurry away like the cockroaches they are!

You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.

Its people typing in domains, and going to random websites, yeah that&#39;s the problem! /sarc. More like its that the world wide web has become a transfer of executables, such that you can basically run an OS https://www.windows93.net/ [windows93.net] just think of the possibilities of running that level of code over just a basic document like how things used to be

Agreed. What&#39;s needed is a way to do essentially the same thing as AJAX without any client JS. There would be more latency with the processing happening on the server side, but that&#39;s an acceptable tradeoff for many purposes where it doesn&#39;t matter much.

It’s hard to put numbers behind what feels like a rise in antisemitism in American political discourse. But people are trying. Back in 2024, a Democratic pollster named David Shor released some polling data from more than 100,000 voters. He said he found that a quarter of those younger than 25 held an “unfavorable opinion” of Jewish people. That sentiment plummeted with age, but Isaac Saul has started to wonder if this is a warning—especially because of how younger people are getting their information online and from far-right influencers.

“I think what people miss is just how ubiquitous it is,” says Saul, who writes the Tangle newsletter and is Jewish. “Everybody talks about Nick Fuentes or Candace Owens and they’re the superstars, but there are dozens, hundreds of other people who are ‘smaller’ that still have bigger platforms than me.”

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Saul about why antisemitism is everywhere and how to confront it. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: How worried are you about antisemitism right now? From a scale of 1 to 10?

Isaac Saul: I would say pretty worried. And it’s changed pretty seriously. If you asked me this question three years ago, I would have said −3. I was somebody who laughed at and mocked my mom or grandmother for seeing antisemitism everywhere. I was always telling them “Nobody cares about the Jews anymore.” But then I started to experience it.

I would get soft antisemitism, like people making Jew jokes or stuff that I could laugh at. And now I’m experiencing stuff that I don’t think is funny.

We’re speaking this week of this attack at Bondi Beach in Australia. I’m curious if you put these fears together, the fear of an attack and the fear about what you’re talking about now, which is more of a creeping rhetorical antisemitism that seems to be on both sides of the political spectrum in the United States. And what I’m so concerned about in this moment is something almost gentler, a creeping sense, especially among young people, that something is off with Jews or Judaism. What do you think?

I can’t get over just how ridiculous it feels that we’re having this conversation in 2025. I do think that that’s a smart distinction. But I also lend some credence to the view that has been expressed by some Jews and Zionists after this attack that this is why chanting “Globalize the intifada” sends a chill up some people’s spine. When I see college students doing that at Columbia’s campus, I don’t think they’re going to shoot up a beach in Australia. But it’s also true that what just happened in Bondi Beach is, to many people, what globalizing the intifada looks like. This is why a lot of Jews want to nip that rhetoric in the bud. They want to hear Zohran Mamdani condemn it. They seek that because they fear this. And it justifies the fear for a lot of them, and I don’t blame them for feeling justified.

You have drawn a line between true believers in antisemitic beliefs and Gen Z converts. Can you just tell me more about what that line is?

There are actual 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22-year-old kids who are asking, “Why are there so many Jews in finance? I don’t get it.” And nobody’s answering the question, which there’s an actual sensible answer to that question, so then they’re going to fill the gaps with the answers that they’re getting on YouTube. If they’re not allowed to ask that question in school, if they’re not allowed to ask that question to their parents, if they are not to ask that question to Jewish friends, then they are going to go ask it on Reddit, or 4chan. And they’re going to get a very different answer than they would have gotten from a Judaic studies teacher at their college.

If that’s not something you can raise your hand and ask in a college classroom—which it is not, it is a very taboo thing to say—then you’re not going to do it, and you’re going to turn to the other sources that kids use to get information these days. There’s a really good argument for making that kind of stuff a little bit less taboo so we can fill in those gaps for people.

For centuries, Jews were considered less than, and Christians were prohibited from doing things like money lending because that was viewed as an immoral job. So they gave it to the Jews, and because they were second-class citizens, that was the only job available to them, because they couldn’t own land, and they weren’t allowed to be part of trade networks. They started making money, and it turned out being a money lender was actually a pretty good profession. That’s the actual story, which makes total sense, which you can explain to somebody, but only if they’re allowed to probe it and hear it.

But I think some people would say, “Once you say, ‘Yes, but,’ ” you’re letting the bad idea in. People may not listen, right?

We have to stop acting like we have something to hide. That’s my point. Somebody says, “Six percent of Congress is Jewish. We’re only 2 percent of the population.” Go us, we did it! And if you’re asking me for an explanation, I can give you an explanation that’s about the history of education in the Jewish community. The great Jewish diaspora required us to be really literate so we could keep studying our religious texts while not having a synagogue that we could go to because all you guys bombed and burned them and committed a bunch of pogroms and ran us off. There is a historical explanation for why Jews have high literacy rates or are going to school and university at high rates in the mid-19th century.

There’s an interesting moment in your writing where you basically say, “It was always going to come to this.” You essentially make the argument that no matter what happens, there is this durability to antisemitic beliefs. And there are so many things that even in the current moment are being blamed on Jewish people.

You can think about that in a couple ways. You can think of it as like, “OK, it was always going to happen.” That’s really depressing. Or, “We’ve always known that this is going to be on all of us to keep explaining why this is wrong.” What do you think?

I really reject the framework that Jews shouldn’t have to do the work. It’s part of the anti-racist framework too, that Black people shouldn’t have to do the work, and they need white allies. There’s always been something a little bit problematic with that. Yes, they need allies, but also the people who need to hear it the most often need to hear it from the people that they think they hate the most.

It is literally what all the evidence suggests. If you go look at how deradicalization groups work, how people get pulled out of being in neo-Nazism or white nationalist groups, almost every single one of these guys has stories along the lines of how they had a Jewish boss who was really nice to them when their mother died.

We don’t really have the choice. The option is we sit back and let it be whatever, or we say, “Actually, we’re going to be part of the solution. We’re going to fight the rising tide.” And some of that’s going to be killing them with kindness. Some of that is going to be aggressively trying to defend against misinformation and nonsense and conspiracies. And some of that is just by being a good person in your existence as somebody who is part of the ethnicity.

I think it’s hard to do all that when you’re scared. And I think a lot of American Jews are scared right now. What would you say to them?

First of all, I would say we are the majority—not the literal Jews, but the good people. We are the majority. I know it doesn’t feel that way, but we’re the ones who actually have the strength in numbers. This isn’t the normie thing to view this stuff this way, to hate Jews. The average person you meet on the street, the odds of them being a Jew hater are not better than them liking Jews. Exist in the world with that confidence.

And fear is not a productive feeling to embrace and swim in. I’m not a particularly brave person, but I don’t think you’d have to be brave to walk around with this mentality. You just have to have the confidence that we don’t have anything to hide. We have a history and a story about our people that we know, that we can learn, that we tell, that we can communicate, that there are more good people out there than bad people.

When I put on a yarmulke and go to Shabbat services, and I’m walking a mile to my synagogue in Philadelphia, I’m not thinking about, Oh my God, I hope nobody sees me in my yarmulke and they do something terrible to me. I’m thinking, I’m a Jew who’s representing as a Jew. And I’m representing all Jews walking down the street right now, so I better be a good fucking person. I smile at people, and I say hi. I am an ambassador for my people right now in this little neighborhood in South Philly, where maybe there’s a bunch of antisemites—probably not, but if I run into one tonight on accident and I am really nice to him, maybe it will have an impact on his worldview. I think that is a more empowering, productive, helpful way to live your life than just looking around for ghosts at every corner and being scared of what’s going to happen to you next.

Gather around. Here is a useful heuristic to understand the shabby, campy, and uniquely unserious nature of this incarnation of the Trump presidency.

For the past several weeks, much attention has been paid to Alexis Wilkins, the 27-year-old country-singer girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel. This alone is unusual. Generally speaking, FBI directors are not meant to be understood as tabloid celebrities with rich personal lives. But the scandal that has enveloped the both of them is even more chintzy, in a perfectly Trumpian way. Basically, since getting sworn in to the role, Patel has used a Gulfstream jet owned by the agency to buttress his vacation time. This includes flying to concerts at which Wilkins is performing, and to a luxury hunting lodge in Texas called Boondoggle Ranch. This is the sort of controversy that raises a lot of questions—about taxpayer dollars, Patel’s ego, and why the current administration seems to be permanently occupied by manchildren stuck in various stages of arrested development. But Patel, for his part, has decided to address the charges head-on in the only way he knows how: Step in front of a podcast microphone, on a couch next to his girlfriend, and dress down the haters and losers.

The show in question is The Katie Miller Podcast, and, naturally, it is hosted by Katie Miller, wife of skull-measuring psychopath and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The podcast has platformed a cavalcade of regime-boosting sycophants, and Patel is no different. Between whining complaints about the press (hi, Kash!), boasts about his threadbare criminal justice bona fides, and mandated tributes to the genius of Donald Trump, he uses the opportunity to settle some scores. Miller asks Patel about the claims that he is mishandling FBI resources in service of his personal life, a credible accusation that he nonetheless finds completely outrageous. “If I was actually abusing [the jet], I would actually be seeing every one of her shows,” Patel says. “I think I get to, like, 15 percent.” Hilariously, the episode of the podcast opens with solemn text embossed on a black screen, informing viewers that the interview was recorded before the horrific mass shooting at Brown University. As of this writing, the FBI has yet to apprehend a suspect. (Update, Dec, 19, 12:09 a.m.: The suspect has been found dead in a storage unit. Unfortunately, the rest of this story stands.)

As we just described at Slate, Katie Miller is a mind-numbingly dull interviewer, but this thing still goes on for 50 minutes, and it’s completely dominated by pablum. At one point, Miller asks Wilkins if she disagrees with Patel on anything significant. She stumbles over the potential political ramifications of the query before informing listeners that the FBI director likes spicy food, while she does not. Scintillating stuff.

Miller, who is adjacent to the conspiracy network that animates the MAGA media ecosystem, also opens up a discussion about whether Wilkins is an Israeli spy. Apparently, this is an assertion that gets batted around in the dankest corners of fascist Discords. (Among the comments underneath the YouTube video for a vibeless Wilkins track called “GRIT,” one reads, “This is exactly what I imagine Mossad agent singing country music would sound like.”) Wilkins responds by saying that she has never been to Israel.

If there is one theme throughout the dialogue, it is Patel laying the blame for all of his grievances at the feet of the fourth estate. In that sense, he’s following a well-worn track laid out by Trump. But Patel’s demeanor is genuinely baffling. My favorite of these swipes is when Miller asks Patel when he might get engaged to Wilkins. He retorts by saying that he won’t “let the media determine the speed in which this relationship moves.” What? What are you talking about, man? I implore every boyfriend reading this to give that line a shot the next time the topic of marriage comes up: “The New York Times doesn’t control me!!” Let me know how it goes.

I guess this is what counts as damage control in the spiraling psychedelia of Trump 2.0. It doesn’t seem likely that the fiasco surrounding Patel’s chartered flights is going to stick for long, if only because this version of the White House has made highly visible corruption a defining aesthetic. Only months ago, we learned that border czar Tom Homan accepted a bag of $50,000 in cash from FBI agents, and we breezed right past it. I mean, yes, Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee are probing Patel’s flight logs, which could surface more-embarrassing information. But I’m not holding my breath over here.

Maybe none of this is really damage control at all. Sometimes it really seems as if Wilkins is the first girlfriend Patel has ever had. The idea that he needed to appear on Miller’s podcast with Wilkins to “clear the air” or whatever belies a more visceral purpose—to issue another reminder, for the American people, that the FBI director is getting laid. There is a bushy-tailed earnestness in the way Patel trumpets this information, a spiral-eyed mania of a man who, at last, is on the receiving end of positive interaction with a woman and wants to rub it in our faces. Frankly, once you understand the cretins in Trump’s orbit through that framing, a lot about this current moment begins to make sense.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new pearOS distro is a Romanian project that picks up the concepts behind the original Pear Linux from 2011 and updates them. It&#39;s not going to turn the distro world upside down, but it&#39;s fun, interesting, and a showcase for the versatility and customizability of the Linux desktop.

Pear Linux was a French distro by David Tavares, based on Ubuntu and GNOME but heavily themed with custom fonts, icons, menu layouts, and more, all intended to make it visually resemble Apple&#39;s Mac OS X as closely as possible. As DistroWatch records, it went through some seven releases between 2011 and 2013, before Tavares announced that an unnamed company had bought it, and the distro vanished. Some contemporary reviews of PearOS 3.0 (2012), PearOS 7.0, and PearOS 8.0 (both 2013) – especially their screenshots – will give you an idea of how well it accomplished that. The idea has enduring appeal. After it disappeared, there were attempts to revive it, including Pearl Linux and Clementine OS, both in 2014, but neither got far.

pearOS is back, replacing Ubuntu with Arch and GNOME with the latest KDE Plasma

Over a decade later, a young Romanian developer called Alexandru Balan has released a new pearOS distro, rebuilt on a new basis of Arch Linux and the latest KDE Plasma 6.5.4. The release announcement calls this basis NiceC0re, and as the screenshots there show, this pearOS is styled to look like this year&#39;s macOS 26 &quot;Tahoe.&quot;

This is more than just a custom theme slapped onto a default KDE Plasma setup. There&#39;s a working global menu bar, with a pear menu in place of an apple menu at top left. This contains a single-column Settings app, which resembles the iOS style Settings app of macOS 13 Ventura and above. Within is an optimistic array of macOS-like features, many of which, such as Focus Mode, don&#39;t open and instead display:

This feature is currently not available. Please check back later for updates.

There&#39;s a Pear Piri option (in place of Siri) with a Pear Intelligence feature, the desktop is called &quot;Pinder,&quot; there&#39;s a pCloud section, and &quot;Wallet and Pear Pay,&quot; and so on. We certainly can&#39;t fault the ambition here. Since quite a bit of its functionality is yet to be implemented, it&#39;s a good thing that this is in addition to KDE&#39;s standard System Settings app.

Rather than KDE&#39;s Dolphin file manager, it uses the GNOME Files app, but most of the accessories are KDE ones: the Kate text editor, Discover app store, and so on. It ships with Flatpak installed, but no Flatpak apps. The default browser is the latest Firefox, and there&#39;s no office suite, just KWrite.

It&#39;s not a lightweight distro. It takes about 12 GB of disk and 1.2 GB of RAM at idle. The installation medium&#39;s boot menu offers a choice of using the latest Nvidia drivers, or FOSS drivers. With the latter, it was able to bring up the second screen on our testbed ThinkPad W520, although it&#39;s attached to a long-unsupported GPU. We weren&#39;t able to install it on that machine, though.

The installer is custom and one of the more unfinished areas of the distro. It comes up with a choice of just three languages: Romanian, Czech, or English. However, selecting them won&#39;t help you, as there is no Next or Continue button. It took us considerable experimentation to determine that the only way to get the button to display was to press the Tab key to move the selection, and then a big right-facing arrow became visible. This quickly revealed a very significant limitation. Much like that other FOSS macOS-like, the Hello System, the installer will only let you select a whole drive. There&#39;s no way to dual-boot with another OS unless you have two separate physical drives – and we could tell that this was unexpected, because when we tried again on another machine with two SSDs, the icon for the second appeared completely off the bottom of the installer window and floating over the desktop. It doesn&#39;t show its best under VMs either.

With that hiccup overcome, it installed fine and ran well. It uses X11 rather than Wayland and adding a user account is postponed until post-installation like in Fedora.

From the project&#39;s GitHub page, it looks to have been under construction for several years, and we found traces on the Internet Archive of several earlier versions of this restarted project. Even so, there are a number of sections in the Settings app that clearly aim to resemble Apple features that Linux doesn&#39;t really do just yet.

Compatibility-wise, it&#39;s Arch with the latest KDE. Pretty much everything you could want is here or in the AUR repository. Functionally, it&#39;s KDE, but it&#39;s a lovely and very functional take on KDE. Appearances are of course subjective, but The Reg FOSS desk isn&#39;t fond of any of the modern themes or looks included with KDE, and it lacks anything as simple as Xfce&#39;s Panel Profiles to load different desktop layouts with a single click. It&#39;s a bit of fun in the bleak midwinter (for those of us in the northern hemisphere). We rather like it. ®

            <div id="article-text">Hewlett Packard Enterprise has told customers to drop whatever they&#39;re doing and patch OneView after admitting a maximum-severity bug could let attackers run code on the management platform without so much as a login prompt.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-37164 and rated a maximum 10.0 on the CVSS scale, affects HPE OneView versions 5.20 through 10.20 and allows unauthenticated remote code execution, according to an advisory published by the company this week. OneView sits at the heart of many enterprise environments, serving as a central control plane for servers, firmware, storage, and lifecycle management.

&quot;A potential security vulnerability has been identified in Hewlett Packard Enterprise OneView Software,&quot; HPE said in its advisory. &quot;This vulnerability could be exploited, allowing a remote unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution.&quot;

HPE said the issue was reported by security researcher Nguyen Quoc Khanh and is urging customers to either upgrade to OneView 11.0 or apply the emergency hotfix immediately. Separate fixes are available for the OneView virtual appliance and for HPE Synergy deployments.

Rapid7, which has analyzed the vulnerability and the vendor&#39;s hotfix, told The Register that the real danger isn&#39;t just code execution, but where it happens. OneView is typically deployed deep inside the network with sweeping privileges and minimal scrutiny, because it&#39;s assumed to be trustworthy. An unauthenticated RCE at that layer doesn&#39;t just open a door – it hands over the keys to the building.

In other words, popping OneView could give an attacker centralized control over large chunks of infrastructure at scale, rather than access to a single compromised box. That makes it a far more attractive target than the average edge-facing server bug.

Rapid7&#39;s initial inspection of the hotfix suggests the vulnerability is tied to a specific REST API endpoint exposed by the appliance. The fix works by blocking access to that endpoint at the web server level, and the firm said it has a high degree of confidence that this endpoint is the primary access vector.

HPE has not said whether the flaw is being actively exploited, but history suggests bugs like this don&#39;t stay theoretical for long. Highly privileged management platforms are often targeted by ransomware crews and other attackers seeking shortcuts past perimeter defenses.

For now, if you&#39;re running a vulnerable version of OneView, patch or upgrade immediately. Rapid7, meanwhile, suggests defenders treat the issue as an assumed-breach scenario, review network segmentation, and stop treating infrastructure management layers as untouchable. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Britain is set to become a post-3G nation as Virgin Media O2 (VMO2) prepares to be the last of the country&#39;s mobile networks to switch off its 3G service, although it may linger for a while at a few sites.

The operator says that its rivals have completed their switch-offs and now the firm is set to complete its own program &quot;in the coming weeks&quot; following a series of successful pilots throughout 2025.

The sale of 3G licences at the turn of the century cost UK operators billions and the technology never really lived up to its hype ...

VMO2&#39;s telecoms turn-off started with the city of Durham in northeast England back in April, and saw it withdrawing 3G services in Scotland from early November.

Customers who haven&#39;t upgraded to a 4G or 5G device before 3G is switched off in their area will still be able to make calls and send text messages, the company says, but they won&#39;t be able to access mobile data. That would mean they won&#39;t be able to use websites and many phone apps will no longer function.

The same applies to subscribers of mobile providers that use VMO2 to deliver their services, such as Giffgaff, Tesco Mobile and Sky Mobile.

As we have noted previously, this all stems from plans announced in 2021 by the previous UK government for all 2G and 3G mobile networks to be phased out of use by 2033.

BT/EE completed its switch-off in early 2024, as did Vodafone, while Three was understood to have concluded its process by November of last year, although there were reports of a small number of sites still providing a 3G service into 2025, to &quot;avoid customers losing service.&quot;

The same may happen with VMO2, according to the firm&#39;s chief technology officer, Jeanie York.

&quot;Our 3G network has already been withdrawn across many UK locations, with the final areas set to follow shortly. You may still see a 3G signal in some places for a short period in early 2026, but the network will soon be switched off entirely, so I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to urge anybody who is still using a 3G-only handset to please visit your local store, or call us, to upgrade as soon as possible,&quot; she stated.

We&#39;re well aware that when we have written about the 3G switch-off in the past, some readers complained that 3G was the only service they could reliably get in their area. Presumably, these are the areas where &quot;you may still see a 3G signal for a short period.&quot;

The government has been pushing the network companies to hit 95 percent coverage of the country by the end of this year, although there were doubts that this target would be reached. BT claims it expects to have a 5G Standalone (5G SA) mobile service available to 99 percent of the population by the end of the decade.

&quot;This is a necessary move for the industry; 3G carries only a tiny fraction of all mobile data and reallocating spectrum to 4G and 5G networks will give more people a better overall smartphone experience,&quot; said Kester Mann, director of Consumer and Connectivity at CCS Insight.

Turning off 3G marks the end of an era. It was the first mobile technology able to offer a reasonable experience for mobile browsing when it arrived in the UK in March 2003. Before that, phone users had to rely on something called Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), which the mere mention of will bring a shudder to those old enough to remember it.

However, 3G also had something of a shaky start in the UK. Network operators bid billions of pounds for their 3G licenses in a government auction, which left them cash-strapped when it came to actually building anything. The initial rollout was plagued with problems, and the first operator, Three, failed to make a profit for several years after its launch.

&quot;Not everyone will mourn its closing,&quot; said Mann. &quot;The sale of 3G licences at the turn of the century cost UK operators billions and the technology never really lived up to its hype. Its successor, 4G, was credited with supporting many of the uses of today&#39;s smartphones,&quot; he added.

Paolo Pescatore, analyst and founder at PP Foresight, was even more scathing.

&quot;Amen to 3G, one of the most overhyped network technologies with unmet expectations, inflated spectrum auctions, complex, slow network build and a terrible user experience,&quot; he commented.

&quot;Transitioning to 4G and 5G has not been easy due to the need to support legacy M2M and IoT devices. Looking back, hindsight is a wonderful thing; 4G addressed the shortcomings of 3G.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">﻿It’s far too easy to buy so-called GLP-3s through gray-market websites.

This is Optimizer, a weekly newsletter sent every Friday from Verge senior reviewer Victoria Song that dissects and discusses the latest phones, smartwatches, apps, and other gizmos that swear they’re going to change your life. Optimizer will be taking a break for the holidays and will be back January 9th. Opt in for Optimizer here.

You’ve probably heard of Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound, and Mounjaro. But if your algorithm serves up wellness and fitness content — like mine does — there’s a good chance you’ve been seeing influencers talk about a new weight loss drug: retatrutide, the so-called GLP-3.

The first video I saw was sent by a colleague. It features a fitness influencer enthusiastically saying “GLP-3, aka Ratatouille, as we have to call it here.” In the upper right-hand corner is a disclaimer saying the video is for “educational” or “research” purposes only and to consult with a doctor. This particular creator says they’ve been using “ratatouille” for 102 days and lost 26 pounds. They talk about how “GLP-3s” contain semaglutide, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon — hormones that help reduce appetite and burn fat. There’s some truth in this, but it’s definitely not that simple.

If you search retatrutide on TikTok and Instagram, you’ll find several influencers giving tips on dosing “reta,” influencers asking followers to DM them or head to linktrees for “reputable” vendors complete with discount codes. Some are bodybuilders who claim they’re simply into optimizing their bodies and looking for anything to give them an edge. Many hastily add that they’re not medical professionals, that this is their experience only, and everything they’re saying is for “research and educational purposes” only. In the comments, you’ll see dozens of people asking where to get this miracle peptide.

These creators almost never mention that retatrutide currently hasn’t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The experimental drug from Eli Lilly is currently undergoing phase three clinical trials, and while it’s yielded promising preliminary results under strict trial conditions, it’s not been deemed safe for the market yet. The majority don’t educate viewers that the FDA has issued warnings to six companies — five in the US and one in Germany — for selling the unapproved drug via the gray market.

After about five minutes on TikTok, I click on a random influencer’s linktree and enter their 10 percent discount code. I’m able to stick a 10mg vial of “peptide-R” plus a free supply of bacteriostatic water into my cart. You see, I’d have to manually reconstitute a powdered version of “peptide-R” with bacteriostatic water to use it. All over the site, there are warnings stating that this particular pharmacy is selling for “research” only, not medical or personal use. However, I’m not required to provide any proof that I’m a lab researcher when I check out. With that discount, I successfully order a vial costing $117 — $130 total with shipping.

This is significantly cheaper than the FDA-approved, brand-named GLP-1 medications out of pocket. While there are some introductory prices around $200–$400 monthly, most of these medications cost over $1,000 monthly unless covered by insurance. Even then, many insurance companies require prior authorization.

Afterward, when I’m back to doomscrolling, I’m shown ad after ad for compounding pharmacies that will help me avoid the mean old doctor who won’t prescribe a GLP-1. All I have to do is answer a quick quiz. Those are interspersed with more tutorials from non-medical professionals on how to reconstitute gray-market retatrutide from my own home using Amazon-bought syringes, alcohol wipes, and “bac water.”

For research and educational purposes, “GLP-3” is somewhat of a misnomer.

Ozempic and Wegovy are semaglutides, medications that mimic a natural gut hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). These are called agonists because they bind to a cellular receptor and activate it. Likewise, Zepbound and Mounjaro are tirzepatides, which mimic GLP-1 and GIP. The difference between these medications and retatrutide is that the latter is a single molecule that mimics GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon, a third metabolic hormone. Those three “G’s” are why influencers have dubbed retatrutide a “GLP-3.”

“Triple agonist is a better name than GLP-3 because it agonizes the receptor for GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon,” says Dr. Michael Weintraub, an endocrinologist at NYU Langone Diabetes & Endocrine Associates. Weintraub explains that this triple action is likely why early phase three clinical testing results for retatrutide show a profound decrease in appetite and significant weight loss.

However, he also notes that the phase three trial for retatrutide is ongoing. Only one study has been completed, and the full paper hasn’t been released yet. All anyone has so far is the top-line data. There are seven additional phase three trials that are expected to finish in 2026.

“This is a medication that hasn’t even been fully studied. It’s a totally new mechanism and we don’t have any analogous medication to even look at the potential effect of this family of medicine that affects this glucagon receptor. There could be a lot of unwanted side effects of adverse events that we don’t yet know about that would maybe lead to this medication not being FDA-approved. We have to go through that process to make sure something is safe,” Weintraub says.

So if retatrutide is currently experimental, how are all these influencers getting it? What are these pharmacies that they’re pointing to?

Currently, the only way to get legitimate retatrutide is to be part of Eli Lilly’s clinical trials. Much of what’s being peddled online comes from dubious resellers or compounding pharmacies. Compounding refers to the medical practice of custom-creating medications that cannot be commercially bought. There are legitimate reasons for compounding — for instance, if a patient is allergic to a key ingredient in a commercial formulation or requires a dosage that isn’t readily available.

In the case of GLP-1 medications, the FDA allowed compounding pharmacies to create the drug in 2022 when there was a shortage due to increased demand. Earlier this year, the FDA announced the shortage is over. That means compounding pharmacies can no longer legally create carbon copies of drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound, or Mounjaro — especially if it’s simply to offer cheaper alternatives to FDA-approved versions. These pharmacies were given a grace period to phase out production, which ended in May 2025. Some have turned to selling a precursor to GLP-1s called liraglutide, which are less effective and can cause more severe side effects.

As for retatrutide, the FDA stated in a warning that it cannot be used in compounding under federal law. Furthermore, the agency states that “these are not components of FDA-approved drugs and have not been found safe and effective for any condition.”

The problem with compounding pharmacies is that they require zero FDA oversight or quality control. That can lead to drugs that aren’t properly refrigerated during shipping, incorrect dosages, and different forms of ingredients that haven’t been clinically tested. That increases the chance of adverse effects. The risk increases further if people are buying gray-market peptides that require them to manually reconstitute powdered versions.

“We’re already seeing in these compounding formulations a lot of worsened side effects and hospitalizations compared to what is produced by the pharmaceutical manufacturer,” says Weintraub.

As of July 2025, the FDA says it’s received 605 reports of adverse effects related to compounded semaglutides and 545 reports related to compounded tirzepatides. The agency notes that it’s likely this number is underreported. It’s impossible to know if or how many people have been hospitalized from so-called GLP-3, though it was easy enough to find commenters relaying stories about intense nausea and vomiting from incorrect at-home dosing. While these comments can’t be verified, it’s a major concern for physicians.

“As a physician or medical provider, whenever we think about starting medication we always weigh risk versus benefit,” says Weintraub, noting that managing side effects and monitoring other vitals are a major part of that conversation. “I’m concerned when patients are able to get these medicines when they’ve never even spoken to a medical provider or gotten a full assessment because no one’s done that risk-versus-benefit analysis.”

“Any app, any website, any company that is advertising that they are producing or selling retatrutide cannot be trustworthy.”

Another complication: Weintraub says these medications, approved or unapproved, have primarily been studied in obese and diabetic people. There’s not a wide body of evidence regarding leaner people, as in the bodybuilders who are singing the praises of retatrutide online. Doctors don’t know how to weigh the risks or benefits for people who aren’t obese or don’t have metabolic conditions stemming from obesity.

He says he doubts whether what they’re taking is truly retatrutide as it’s impossible to know what’s actually in these gray-market peptides.

“Any app, any website, any company that is advertising that they are producing or selling retatrutide cannot be trustworthy,” Weintraub says.

While researching the influencer effect on the “GLP-3” market, I noticed another narrative forming. Videos have begun popping up from influencers warning that the “research peptide market” is beginning to dump its inventory ahead of increased regulatory scrutiny. In Washington, legislators in the pocket of Big Pharma are trying to pass drug safety bills that will limit access to GLP-1s and retatrutide to protect their profit margins.

The bill they’re referring to is the Safeguarding Americans from Fraudulent and Experimental (SAFE) Drugs Act of 2025. Introduced by Reps. Rudy Yakym and André Carson, it’s aimed at “protecting patients from untested, unapproved, and potentially dangerous mass compounded drugs,” with a particular mention of GLP-1 medications.

These lawmakers don’t actually care about your safety, the influencers say, nitpicking parts of the bill. Reputable vendors do the same third-party testing as FDA-inspected facilities! All Big Pharma cares about is intellectual property, they say. After all, Reps. Yakym and Carson are both from Indiana, and you know what company is based in Indiana? Eli Lilly — the pharmaceutical company behind retatrutide. Compound pharmacies and the research peptide market, they assert, are the Robin Hoods stealing profit from Big Pharma and giving GLPs, even those that haven’t been approved, to the masses.

Never mind that influencers also profit from the “research peptide market” via their affiliate codes and partnerships. That this legislation potentially threatens their income, too. This narrative — along with anecdotal testimonials of how effective “ratatouille” can be — is powerful word-of-mouth marketing. And it contains a spark of truth: For many Americans, the healthcare system feels broken.

The “GLP-3,” ratatouille, reta — whatever you want to call it — market is a prime example of the wellness wild west. It’s a major part of what I want to investigate as part of Optimizer.

Technology often seeks to democratize and disrupt established institutions. In the medical space, the stakes are incredibly high. Yet, in my decade of covering this beat, I’ve seen this same story play out time and time again.

Companies or influencers claim they have a secret to solving your health problem. They say their claims are backed by science. Words like “clinically validated” are emblazoned on their packaging. There are often white papers — which are not the same thing as peer-reviewed studies — or preliminary scientific research that lend credence to their assertions. However, because the FDA regulatory process is time-consuming and requires incredible resources, companies market their products under the wellness label. Wellness, as I’ve written about before, doesn’t require FDA oversight, leading to dangerously blurred lines between health tools and snake oil. Well-meaning influencers promoting these products are often on the frontier spreading truths mixed with half-truths, marketing, and misinformation.

Once my bottle of gray-market peptide-R arrives, I fully intend to send it off for lab testing. And while Optimizer will be taking a break over the holidays, I hope you’ll join me in 2026 when I can report back exactly what I’ve found.

On The Vergecast: the future of free speech, the winners of the streaming wars, and much, much more.

All year on The Vergecast, we’ve been tracking the many bizarre and problematic actions of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. There has been a lot to discuss! Then, this week, ahead of one of our last episodes of the year, Carr appeared in front of the Senate Commerce Committee and spent three hours explaining how he thinks about his job, the FCC, and the state of online communication and entertainment. It was a lot.

On this episode of The Vergecast, we begin with a dissection of Carr’s testimony, his threats against broadcasters, and the ways in which he’s using old ideas about content delivery to get his political way. Nilay and David walk through some of Carr’s most important quotes, explain the history of broadband regulation, and look ahead to how Carr might bring these same tactics to internet regulation next year.

After that, the hosts talk through some odd but telling news in the streaming wars. YouTube got the Oscars; Netflix got FIFA and a bunch of podcasts; Warner Bros. doesn’t want Paramount’s money. Along with producer Travis Larchuk, we then update the Go90 Scale of Doomed Streaming Services, to see who’s winning the streaming wars and who’s in danger of losing them forever.

Finally, in the lightning round, we discuss the Copilot icon that suddenly appeared on a bunch of LG TVs, Bluesky’s controversial contact import feature, the latest product ideas from the AI industry, Ford’s EV overhaul, Will.i.am’s odd ideas about cars, and the seemingly looming end of the metaverse.

Also, an important housekeeping note: The Vergecast will be live at CES! We’ll be at the Brooklyn Bowl in Las Vegas, at 3:30PM on Wednesday, January 7th. There will be podcasting, and hanging out, and bowling. It’s going to be great, and if you’re going to be in Vegas, we’d love to see you there.

Until then, if you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, first on Brendan Carr:

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A year or two ago, when a phone showed up at my door for review, I could pretty much count on it being black, gray, or maybe (as a treat) white. But in 2025, that hasn’t been the case. Phones I reviewed this year featured everything from real wood grain back panels to deep blue finishes, with color-coordinated crossbody straps and magnetic accessories to match. For an industry that has been content to churn out a lot of black rectangular gadgets, 2025 marked a welcome return to bold colors and fashion-forward accessories from phone manufacturers.

Phones haven’t always been boring, utilitarian objects. Remember the original bright pink Motorola Razr? Iconic. Or more recently, Nokia’s neon yellow Lumia phones — you couldn’t miss them. Even the ever-conservative iPhone appeared in vibrant orange, yellow, and blue options in 2018’s XR; my husband refused to part with his until absolutely necessary because he didn’t want to give up his yellow phone. But somewhere along the way in the past five years, phone makers decided that these devices should be more serious, and the fun options fell by the wayside.

If any single company deserves recognition for bringing style back, it’s Motorola. The Razr Ultra foldable in MountainTrail is easily the best-looking phone I used this year, but maybe I’m just partial to the Moto X vibes the wooden back evokes. The bronze-colored side rails, the satisfying sound as the flip phone snaps shut — it’s all so nice. But it’s not just foldables — Motorola has been way ahead of the curve with vibrant colors and unique finishes for the past year or so. I wish Moto’s software looked as pristine — lately it’s been stuffed to the gills with ads and bloatware — but the company has definitely nailed good-looking hardware.

Even product lines that are traditionally conservative with color got some splashier options this year. 2025 gave us the Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro, for the truly bold among us. The standard iPhone 17 also comes in some fetching colors, which hasn’t been a given in recent years — no repeat of the iPhone 15’s washed-out color options, thankfully. Even Google offered its folding phone in something other than black or white for the first time: a gray-ish Moonstone and a subtle greenish-yellow Jade.

But it hasn’t been just the phones themselves. This year, manufacturers seemed to remember that phone accessories can be fashionable, too. Apple launched this year’s iPhones with a new crossbody strap accessory, available in a range of colors to coordinate with its cases. And later in the year, we got the crossbody sock, er, iPhone Pocket, created with fashion designer Issey Miyake. Starting at $229 for the long version, it’s a luxury that won’t appeal to most people, but it makes a strong statement.

Google also released a line of magnetic accessories called Pixelsnap to go with its Pixel 10 series, which includes a ring of MagSafe-esque magnets in the rear panel. I used the Pixel 10 Pro Fold almost exclusively with the handy ring grip, which, in addition to relieving some of the fatigue from holding the phone for a long time, doubles as a nice-looking object adorning the back of the phone. For someone like me who hates using cases, it’s a welcome way to add utility and a hint of style.

Not everyone wants a flashy color or statement-making accessory for their phone, and that’s fine. But I think it’s also fine to care about how your phone looks and to want something a little less utilitarian and a little more fashionable than a black rectangle. After all, we look at our phones one million times a day! It only makes sense that we should like what we see. Whatever was in the water this year encouraging manufacturers to fancy up their phones, I hope it sticks around in 2026.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road. Read the full story.—Caiwei Chen

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
