            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The electric vehicle transition might not be moving ahead with the same gusto it showed in the early 2020s, but it’s still happening. According to Deloitte’s 2026 Global Automotive Consumer Study, 7 percent of US car buyers want an electric vehicle for their next car. While that might sound rather meager, it’s a 40 percent increase from 2025’s survey, which found just 5 percent of car buyers wanted an EV.

Plain old internal combustion remains Americans’ first choice, with 61 percent telling the survey that’s how their next ride will be powered. Twenty-one percent want a hybrid, up from 20 percent last year. Just 5 percent indicated a desire for a plug-in hybrid (down from 6 percent last year), with the remaining confused souls either unsure of what to buy next (4 percent) or some other option, presumably hydrogen (1 percent).

The high demand for internal combustion engines makes the US an outlier among large car-buying markets. Fewer than half of German car buyers want another gas-powered vehicle, and that number falls to just 41 percent in China, Japan, and South Korea. But those consumers aren’t all fleeing internal combustion for battery EVs. Well, they mostly are in China, where EV demand is now 20 percent. But in Japan, only 5 percent of consumers want a battery EV, versus 37 percent indicating their next car would be a hybrid.

Deloitte conducted the survey between October and November 2025, by which time the current US government’s anti-EV policies would have come into effect. These include cancelling the clean vehicle tax credit, rolling back fuel efficiency standards, and declining to prosecute automakers that exceed existing efficiency regulations, as well as the uncertainty of capricious import tariffs. Many automakers have spent the last several years building up capacity to manufacture EVs in North America for the US market, but the return on those investments is unlikely be soon.

Americans also lag behind many of their international peers when it comes to that most important condition for buying an EV or plug-in hybrid: having somewhere to plug it in at night. Fifty-three percent of US respondents said they do not have a way to charge at home. By contrast, that number was 20 percent in Germany and just six percent in China. Only Japan—where plug-ins and EVs are even less popular than in the US—had a higher rate of no charger access at home (75 percent).

While reliable charging at one’s workplace—emphasis on reliable—can make up for not being able to charge at home, 77 percent of US car buyers said they would prefer to charge at home (with just 13 percent indicating they would prefer charging at work).

For people who haven’t yet decided to switch, an under-appreciated fact is just how much more efficient an electric powertrain is compared to one that burns liquid petroleum. Ford’s experiment putting an electric powertrain into its best-selling F-150 pickup truck might have turned sour, but consider the following: The V6 truck needs more than three times as much energy to travel 300 miles as the one you plug into a wall, when you consider a gallon of gasoline contains 33.7 kWh of energy.

Among the EV-convinced, this is presumably old news. More than half—52 percent of US survey respondents—said lower fuel costs were a reason for choosing an EV, beating out concern for the environment, which ranked second at 38 percent. And between $20,000 and $49,999 appears to be the pricing sweet spot, with 24 percent looking for something in the $20,000–$34,999 band (cars like the new Nissan Leaf or the soon-reborn Chevrolet Bolt) and another 24 percent looking in the $35,000–$49,999 band, which has plenty of EVs to choose from, including Mercedes-Benz’s efficient new CLA.

Just seven percent of those EV buyers are looking to spend more than $75,000 on their electric car, but luxury EVs abound at this price point.

Meanwhile, range and charging times remain the foremost concerns among car buyers when discussing EVs, along with the cost premium. Some other fears are ill-founded, however. Thirty-eight percent said they were concerned about the cost of eventually replacing an EV’s battery. But EV batteries are proving more durable on the road than many early adopters once believed. There’s little evidence that EVs will require costly battery replacements with any more frequency than older cars require new engines, a concern that is rarely mentioned when someone wants to buy a gas-powered machine.

One of the biggest shifts in car design and manufacturing over the past few years has been the advent of the software-defined vehicle. Until now, pretty much every electronic function in a car, from an electric window to the antilock brakes, needed its own electronic control unit. Some cars can have up to two hundred discrete ECUs, some with software dating back years.

A software-defined vehicle (or SDV) goes for a clean-sheet approach. Instead of dozens and dozens of discrete black boxes, a handful of powerful computers replaces them. One usually controls the vehicle dynamics and powertrain, a second will handle driver assists and safety tech, a third is in charge of infotainment, and a fourth handles heating, cooling, and other in-car comfort. All-new code means no more legacy cruft, and the modern electronic architecture allows for regular over-the-air bug fixes and updates that add new functionality.

Anecdotally, I’ve found that the Ars Technica audience has very little interest in reading about this seismic shift, and you’re not alone. Only 41 percent of US car buyers think SDVs are useful, and one in three says they have no use for one. The concept is even less popular in the UK, Germany, and Japan, but it has far more acceptance in China, South Korea, and Southeast Asia.

Those attitudes correlate with willingness to pay extra for OTA updates. Only 7 percent of Chinese customers said they were unwilling to pay for OTA updates, and half said a car that can be updated would be worth a 6–10 percent price premium compared to a car that can’t. In the US, 39 percent said they would not pay more for a car with OTA functionality.

There’s also much less interest in using one’s car as a digital platform for other “integrated” services. More than half (53 percent) of US car buyers have no interest in such a thing, with another 19 percent indicating neutrality on the topic. Only one in five Americans said their car was a more important digital platform than their smartphone, compared to 56 percent of Chinese car buyers. Given this reality, how much longer will automakers like Rivian and General Motors keep Apple CarPlay out of their cockpits? Neither has significant export markets for its EVs, yet both believe EV drivers will eschew their smartphones over an in-vehicle solution, presumably with some kind of recurring revenue involved.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/new-battery-idea-gets-lots-of-power-out-of-unusual-sulfur-chemistry/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anyone paying attention to battery research sees sulfur come up frequently. That’s mostly because sulfur is a great storage material for lithium, and it could lead to lithium batteries with impressive power densities. But sulfur can participate in a wide range of chemical reactions, which has made it difficult to prevent lithium-sulfur batteries from decaying rapidly as the sulfur forms all sorts of unwanted materials. As a result, despite decades of research, very few lithium-sulfur batteries have made it to market.

But a team of Chinese researchers has managed to turn sulfur’s complex chemistry into a strength, making it the primary electron donor in a sodium-sulfur battery that also relies on chlorine for its chemistry. The result, at least in the lab, is an impressive energy per weight with extremely inexpensive materials.

Sulfur sits immediately below oxygen on the periodic table, so you might think its chemistry would look similar. But that’s not the case. Like oxygen, it can participate in covalent bonding in biological chemistry, including in two essential amino acids. Also, like oxygen, it can accept electrons from metals, as seen in some atomically thin materials that have been studied. But it’s also willing to give electrons up, forming chemical compounds with things like chlorine and oxygen.

It’s that last feature the researchers behind the new paper are most interested in. Pure sulfur forms an eight-atom complex that can give up 32 total electrons under the right conditions. The trick was finding the right conditions.

The system had a cathode of pure sulfur and an anode that was simply a strip of aluminum that acted as a current collector. The electrolytes the researchers tested contained a lot of aluminum, sodium, and chlorine (typically something like eight Molar aluminum chloride and a 4.5 Molar solution of some sodium salt). The aluminum helps stabilize the foil at the anode, while the other two chemicals participate in the reactions that power the battery.

When the battery starts discharging, the sulfur at the cathode starts losing electrons and forming sulfur tetrachloride (SCl4), using chloride it stole from the electrolyte. As the electrons flow into the anode, they combine with the sodium, which plates onto the aluminum, forming a layer of sodium metal. Obviously, this wouldn’t work with an aqueous electrolyte, given how powerfully sodium reacts with water.

To form a working battery, the researchers separated the two electrodes using a glass fiber material. They also added a porous carbon material to the cathode to keep the sulfur tetrachloride from diffusing into the electrolyte. They used various techniques to confirm that sodium was being deposited on the aluminum and that the reaction at the cathode was occurring via sulfur dichloride intermediates. They also determined that sodium chloride was a poor source of sodium ions, as it tended to precipitate out onto some of the solid materials in the battery.

The battery was also fairly stable, surviving 1,400 cycles before suffering significant capacity decay. Higher charging rates caused capacity to decay more quickly, but the battery does a great job of holding charge when not in use, maintaining over 95 percent of its charge, even when idled for 400 days.

While the researchers provide some capacity-per-weight measurements, they don’t do so for a complete battery, focusing instead on portions of the battery, such as the sulfur or the total electrode mass.

But with both electrodes considered, the energy density can reach over 2,000 Watt-hours per kilogram. While that will undoubtedly drop with the total mass of the battery, it’s difficult to imagine that it wouldn’t outperform existing sodium-sulfur or sodium-ion batteries.

Beyond the capacity, the big benefit of the proposed system appears to be its price. Given the raw materials, the researchers estimate that their cost is roughly $5 per kilowatt-hour of capacity, which is less than a tenth of the cost of current sodium batteries.

Again, there’s no guarantee that this work can be scaled up for manufacturing in a way that keeps it competitive with current technologies. Still, if materials used in existing battery technologies become expensive, it’s reassuring to have other options to explore.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/weve-got-a-fossil-closer-to-our-split-with-neanderthals-and-denisovans/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A group of 773,000-year-old hominin fossils from Morocco may shed new light on when our species branched off from the ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans.

A team of anthropologists recently examined a collection of fossil hominin jawbones, teeth, and vertebrae that belong to hominins who probably lived very close in time to our species’ last common ancestor with Neanderthals and Denisovans. They reveal a little more about a murky but important moment in our evolutionary history.

Archaeologists unearthed the 773,000-year-old bones just southwest of Casablanca in a cave aptly named Grotte à Hominidés. They’re just fragments of what used to be hominins: an adult’s lower jawbone, plus the partial lower jaw from another adult and a very young child, along with a handful of teeth and vertebrae. A hominin femur from the same layer of sediment in the cave has clear gnaw marks from sharp carnivore teeth, offering a chilling clue about how the bones got there.

The layer of sediment in which the fossils lay spanned a few thousand years on either side of a long-ago flip in the polarity of Earth’s magnetic field (periodically our planet just… does that), which happened around 773,000 years ago. It’s a slice of time not quite narrow enough to say whether the three jawbones’ owners might have known each other but narrow enough to put them all at a crucial point in the story of human evolution.

Around 1.8 million years ago, a species called Homo erectus emerged in Africa and spread around most of the world (sorry, Americas and Australia). And around a million years ago, populations of Homo erectus living in different places started to evolve along their own paths. Potentially with a few species in between, this process likely gave rise to species like Homo floresiensis and Homo luzonensis in the islands of Southeast Asia.

In Europe and Asia, we got Neanderthals and Denisovans (or Homo longi, if you prefer). And our species, Homo sapiens, evolved in Africa. We, Neanderthals, and Denisovans share a branch of the hominin family tree, with the latter two splitting off from our branch sometime between 765,000 and 550,000 years ago. That timing is what makes the Grotte à Hominidés fossils so important. At 773,000 years old, they’re all that’s left of hominins who lived right around the time of that big split between our ancestors on one path and those of Neanderthals and Denisovans on another.

Max Planck Institute anthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin and his colleagues used micro-CT imaging to build detailed digital models of all the bones and teeth. They then compared the shapes of certain features—like the boundary between enamel and dentine in the teeth or the points on the jawbone where chewing muscles would have attached—to compare the fossils to other hominin species. Archaeologists call that technique geometric morphometry, and it helps shed light on how closely related two species might be.

In this case, the results suggest that the Grotte à Hominidés hominins were a very late model of Homo erectus, already beginning to evolve in the general direction of our species.

Anthropologists still aren’t sure what our last common ancestor with Neanderthals and Denisovans looked like or where they lived because we just don’t have many African fossils of the right age. The Casablanca fossils at least bring us closer to that pivotal moment in human evolution, and they may even suggest that it happened a little earlier than we thought, closer to 800,000 years ago (although it will take more data from more fossils to be sure).

The Casablanca fossils are about the same age as hominin fossils from Spain, which belong to a species called Homo antecessor. This species has been suggested to be a likely ancestor of Neanderthals and Denisovans. Overall, it looks like the fossils from Casablanca are a North African counterpart to Homo antecessor, with the Spanish hominins eventually leading to Neanderthals and the North African ones eventually leading to us.

Both groups share some features in their teeth and lower jaws, but they’re also different in some important ways. The teeth and chins in particular share some older features with Homo erectus. But the jaws have more newfangled features in the places where chewing muscles once attached to the bone—features that Neanderthals and our species share. On the other hand, the teeth are missing some other relatively recent features that would later help define Neanderthals (and were already beginning to show up in Homo antecessor).

Altogether, it looks like the Homo erectus populations and the Neanderthals and Denisovans had been separated for a while by the time the hominins at Grotte à Hominidés lived. But not that long. These hominins were probably part of a generation that was fairly close to that big split, near the base of our branch of the hominin family tree.

Based on ancient DNA, it looks like Neanderthals and Denisovans started evolving into two separate species sometime between 470,000 and 430,000 years ago. Meanwhile, our branch would eventually become recognizable as us sometime around 300,000 years ago, or possibly earlier. At various times and places, all three species would eventually come back together to mingle and swap DNA, leaving traces of those interactions buried deep in each other’s genomes.

And 773,000 years after a predator dragged the remains of a few unfortunate hominins into its den in northern Africa, those hominins’ distant descendants would unearth the gnawed, broken bones and begin piecing together the story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I arrive 10 minutes ahead of schedule from an early morning Eurostar and see Yann LeCun is already waiting for me, nestled between two plastic Christmas trees in the nearly empty winter garden of Michelin-starred restaurant Pavyllon.

The restaurant is next to Paris’s Grand Palais, where President Emmanuel Macron kick-started 2025 by hosting an international AI summit, a glitzy showcase packed with French exceptionalism and international tech luminaries including LeCun, who is considered one of the “godfathers” of modern AI.

LeCun gets up to hug me in greeting, wearing his signature black Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses. He looks well rested for a man who has spent nearly a week running around town plotting world domination. Or, more precisely, “total world assistance” or “intelligent amplification, if you want.” Domination “sounds scary with AI,” he acknowledges.

The last time I met him was at a summer conference in Paris, where he was unveiling the latest iteration of his vision for superintelligent machines as Meta’s chief AI scientist. Now, he is preparing to leave his longtime employer, and fundraising for a new start-up that will bring that vision to life.

LeCun’s schedule has been relentless since the Financial Times broke the news that he was leaving Meta. “It basically pushed us to accelerate the calendar,” he says. Macron sent him a WhatsApp message after the story came out. LeCun declines to tell me exactly what the president said, but does hint that he was pleased the new “worldwide” company will have a strong connection to France.

LeCun will not be the company’s chief executive, but the executive chair, allowing him the same kind of freedom to do research that he had at Meta. (Since our lunch, the FT has reported that LeCun’s new venture is called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs and will be led by Alex LeBrun, the co-founder and chief executive of French health care AI start-up Nabla.)

“I’m a scientist, a visionary. I can inspire people to work on interesting things. I’m pretty good at guessing what type of technology will work or not. But I can’t be a CEO,” LeCun says. “I’m both too disorganized for this, and also too old!”

The waitress offers us champagne to start. I opt for a glass of alcohol-free Blanc de Blancs. LeCun, a fan of wines, is curious to try it too. We clink glasses.

Things have changed for me as well since we last met: I am pregnant. I make a joke that I too am growing my own superintelligence. “It is the most efficient way,” he says.

LeCun would know, as he has been gestating ideas for the creation of such intelligence in machines for decades. He has also been vocal about his disdain for large language models (LLMs) and their potential to reach superhuman intelligence, which is the current obsession of Silicon Valley. He argues that LLMs are useful but fundamentally limited and constrained by language. To achieve human-level intelligence, you have to understand how our physical world works too.

His solution for achieving that relies on an architecture called V-JEPA, a so-called world model. World models aim to understand the physical world by learning from videos and spatial data, rather than just language. They are also able to plan, reason, and have persistent memory. He calls this kind of intelligence Advanced Machine Intelligence, or AMI.

Born in 1960 and raised in the suburbs of Paris, LeCun has been fascinated by the question of how human intelligence emerged since he was a young boy.

It was the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, which he saw when he was 8 or 9 years old, that set him on the path he is on today. He gestures having his mind blown.

LeCun’s father, an aeronautical engineer and “a bit of an inventor,” instilled a love of building and tinkering with things. LeCun grew up constructing model aeroplanes and playing woodwind instruments such as the recorder and the crumhorn, a “weird Renaissance instrument,” which he played in a Renaissance dance music band.

We’ve both chosen the four-course “Champs-Élysées” lunch set menu. As we tuck into our starters (soft-boiled eggs, tuna tartare with smoked pike roe and croutons for LeCun, and a broth of root vegetables and horseradish ravioli with Chartreuse sauce for me), he tells me how a teacher deemed him too bad at math to study it at university, so he decided to pursue engineering.

The waitress comes to check on us, and LeCun orders a glass of Chassagne-Montrachet from Burgundy. “What Americans would call Chardonnay,” he says, jokingly.

LeCun’s lightbulb moment came as a student at the École Supérieure d’Ingénieurs en Électrotechnique et Électronique in Paris in the 1980s, when he read a book about a debate on nature versus nurture between the linguist Noam Chomsky and Jean Piaget, a psychologist. Chomsky argued that humans have an inbuilt capacity for language, while Piaget said there is some structure but most of it is learnt.

“I’m not gonna make friends saying this… ” he tells me, “but I was reading this and I thought everything that Chomsky… was saying could not possibly be true, [because] we learn everything. Intelligence really is about learning.”

AI research—or neural networks, as the technology was then called, which loosely mimic how the brain functions—was practically a dead field and considered taboo by the scientific community, after early iterations of the technology failed to impress. But LeCun sought out other researchers studying neural networks and found intellectual “soulmates” in the likes of Geoffrey Hinton, then a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon.

He later joined Hinton at the University of Toronto as a postdoc researcher. The two, along with Yoshua Bengio, went on to lay the groundwork for deep learning and modern AI, which saw them rewarded in 2018 with the Turing Award, the most prestigious prize in computer science.

The waitress lays our second, gorgeous, dish in front of us and launches into an enthusiastic description of the meal in French. I nod along equally enthusiastically, understanding nothing.

“Did you get that?” LeCun asks. “This is the foie gras, and this is the Comté soufflé, and the Comté is 18 months aged.” When in France, I think, and take a bite of the liver.

LeCun is the brain behind important early AI technologies. In the late 1980s and 1990s, while a researcher at AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey—once known as the leading industry research lab in the world—he developed convolutional neural networks, an architecture used in image recognition technology, which he built into a system that was widely used by banks to read checks.

He had conceived of the research at Toronto, but was able to roll it out in the real world thanks to the seemingly unlimited coffers of cash and cutting-edge technology available at Bell Labs.

LeCun recounts something his boss at the time, Larry Jackel, told him when he first joined. “He said, ‘You know, at Bell Labs? You don’t get famous by saving money.’”

Our main dish arrives, a portion of cod with herbed breadcrumbs and fried capers. LeCun is in a jovial mood, and I find myself engrossed in his colorful stories about the early years of AI research.

He, along with his pharmacist wife, Isabelle, and their three sons, ended up settling in New Jersey for good, although he visits Paris every five weeks or so. America was a “culture shock,” he says.

The party at Bell Labs was destined to end. A corporate shake-up meant the lab lost significant funding and was spun off to different subsidiaries. LeCun rejoined academia and started a new project at NYU aimed at researching neural networks, frequenting Greenwich Village’s jazz clubs after his lectures.

By 2013, it was clear that deep learning was going to work, with image recognition applications showing impressive results. Google had just started Google Brain, and a year later would acquire British AI lab DeepMind.

It was also then that Mark Zuckerberg called. He wanted to start an AI unit at Facebook, and to woo LeCun invited him over for dinner at his California home. A private chef prepared “chicken with some pretty good white wine,” LeCun recalls.

LeCun agreed to join on three conditions. He wouldn’t have to quit his job at NYU. He wouldn’t move to California. And the research results of the new lab had to be made publicly available.

Zuckerberg agreed, and the deal was done. LeCun was to join Facebook, one of the biggest technology companies in the world, to set up a new AI research lab focusing on fundamental research, called Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (Fair).

Facebook was a “tabula rasa with a carte blanche,” LeCun says. “Money was clearly not going to be a problem.”

The waitress interrupts us to bring our dessert, bricelets. “Magnifique,” LeCun says, as the dish is placed in front of him.

I shift the conversation to a more tumultuous time. In early 2022, pre-ChatGPT, all the major AI labs had some version of the technology kicking around, but it was seen as largely experimental. It was a small, relatively unknown AI lab called OpenAI that kick-started today’s AI mania, when it quietly launched the technology as an easily accessible chatbot.

ChatGPT caused a frantic scramble at Meta. The company’s leadership decided to put all their chips into work developing Llama, a large language model. Zuckerberg reshuffled the organization to create a generative AI unit, which was tasked with accelerating research into products. LeCun insisted the model was released openly.

Llama 2, released with open weights for all users, meaning people could download and tweak it for free, was a “watershed” moment, which “changed the entire industry,” LeCun says. The model became the gold standard in powerful open LLMs, and championed an approach that was counter to the extreme concentration of power that Google and OpenAI were pushing. Meta was seen as the good guys in AI research.

Meta switched gears aggressively on AI last year. Zuckerberg placed more pressure on the GenAI unit to accelerate AI development and deployment, which led to a communication breakdown, LeCun says.

“We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,” he says. “When you do this, you fall behind.”

The subsequent Llama models were duds. Llama 4, which was released in April 2025, was a flop, and the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make it look more impressive. LeCun admits that the “results were fudged a little bit,” and the team used different models for different benchmarks to give better results.

“Mark was really upset and basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved in this. And so basically sidelined the entire GenAI organization. A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven’t yet left will leave.”

Last June, Meta invested $15 billion in data-labeling start-up Scale AI and hired its 28-year-old chief executive and co-founder Alexandr Wang. Wang took the reins of the company’s new bet on AI and its research unit, called TBD Lab. The lab is tasked with developing new frontier AI models.

Meta made headlines for trying to poach elite researchers from competitors with offers of $100 million sign-on bonuses. “The future will say whether that was a good idea or not,” LeCun says, deadpan.

LeCun calls Wang, who was hired to lead the organization, “young” and “inexperienced.”

“He learns fast, he knows what he doesn’t know… There’s no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.”

Wang also became LeCun’s manager. I ask LeCun how he felt about this shift in hierarchy. He initially brushes it off, saying he’s used to working with young people. “The average age of a Facebook engineer at the time was 27. I was twice the age of the average engineer.”

But those 27-year-olds weren’t telling him what to do, I point out.

“Alex [Wang] isn’t telling me what to do either,” he says. “You don’t tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don’t tell a researcher like me what to do.”

LeCun doesn’t mince his words about why he ultimately decided to leave Meta after more than a decade. Staying became politically difficult, he tells me. And while Zuckerberg likes LeCun’s world model research, the crowd who were hired for the company’s new superintelligence push are “completely LLM-pilled.”

This clearly alienated LeCun. “I’m sure there’s a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence,” he says. “But I’m not gonna change my mind because some dude thinks I’m wrong. I’m not wrong. My integrity as a scientist cannot allow me to do this.”

Another driver to leave was that his work with world models and AMI was also proving to have potential uses that were not interesting to Meta, such as jet engines and heavy industry. And LeCun had no trouble finding investors who were willing to bet on the next generation of AI technologies.

In his next chapter, LeCun believes that setting up a “neolab,” meaning a start-up that does fundamental research, is the new, most fertile ground. He cites OpenAI former chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines (“I hope the investors know what they do”) and OpenAI’s co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence (“There I know the investors have no idea what they do”) as good examples.

His new architecture uses videos to give AI models an understanding of the physics of our world, which will allow them to make better predictions of what will happen next. The model also relies on “emotions,” meaning past experiences and evaluations, to guide its predictions.

“If I pinch you, you’re going to feel pain. But then your mental model of me is going to be affected by the fact that I just pinched you. And the next time I approach my arm to yours, you’re going to recoil. That’s your prediction, and the emotion it evokes is fear or avoidance of pain,” he says.

LeCun says we will see “baby” versions of this within 12 months, and on a larger scale within a few years. It’s not quite yet superintelligence, but a path toward it. “Maybe there is an obstacle we’re not seeing yet, but at least there is hope.”

After three and a half hours, we are now the only customers left in the restaurant. I ask him what he wants his legacy to be.

Increasing the amount of intelligence in the world, he replies, without batting an eyelid. “Intelligence is really the thing that we should have more of,” he says, adding that with more intelligence, there’s less human suffering, more rational decisions, and more understanding of the world and the universe.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Stranger Things has finally come to an end and left us with some big complicated feels about how it all went down. Both of us (Jennifer and Beth) are bona fide fans who have seen prior seasons multiple times, and we had remarkably similar reactions to the fifth season, especially the series finale. So we decided to co-write a review, discussing everything we liked about it as well as kvetching about the things we definitely didn’t like—a shared “airing of grievances.”

(WARNING: Many, many spoilers below in the interest of a thorough analysis.)

Season 4 ended with Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) opening the fourth gate that allowed the Upside Down to leak into Hawkins. We got an 18-month time jump for S5, Vol. 1, but in a way, we came full circle, since those events coincided with the third anniversary of Will’s (Noah Schnapp) original disappearance in S1.

Hawkins was now under military occupation, and Vecna was targeting a new group of young children in his human form under the pseudonym “Mr. Whatsit” (a nod to A Wrinkle in Time). He kidnapped Holly Wheeler (Nell Fisher) and took her body to another dimension (the Abyss), while her consciousness was trapped in Vecna’s mind. There she found an ally in Max (Sadie Sink), still in a coma in Hawkins, but also trapped in Vecna’s mind, hiding in one of his old memories. Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) was struggling to process his grief over losing Eddie Munson (Joseph Quinn) in S4, causing a rift with Steve (Joe Keery). The rest of the gang was devoted to stockpiling supplies and helping Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and Hopper (David Harbour) track down Vecna in the Upside Down. They found Kali/Eight (Linnea Berthelsen), Eleven’s psychic “sister,” instead, being held captive in a military laboratory.

Things came to a head at the military base when Vecna’s demogorgons attacked to take more children (he needed 12), wiping out most of the soldiers in record time. The big reveal was that, as a result of being kidnapped by Vecna in S1, Will has his own supernatural powers. He can tap into Vecna’s hive mind and manipulate those powers for his own purposes. He used his newfound powers to save his friends from the demogorgons. It was a bit of a deus ex machina move but one that previously has been foreshadowed, so we’ll allow it. But Vecna successfully took the children for his master plan of using their weak child minds to “reshape the world.”

Stranger Things has ballooned in size and scope over the years, so there are a lot of characters and narrative arcs to juggle along with the basic plot mechanics, making most episodes feel uncomfortably overstuffed while still peppered with plot holes. But there was a lot to like. One of Vol. 1’s best moments was wine-mom Karen Wheeler’s (Cara Buono) fierce defense of Holly from an attacking demogorgon. Alas, she was nearly killed and ended up in the hospital, along with her useless husband, Ted (Joe Chrest), to Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and Nancy’s (Natalia Dyer) horror. But she rises from her hospital bed at a crucial moment to take out a pack of demodogs that Vecna sent after a comatose Max, cementing her badass bona fides.

In S5, we find the same crazy strategies for missions that inevitably go wrong. And the Duffer brothers also didn’t forget to include their usual flashes of humor either, like Robin (Maya Hawke) finding an excuse to get Will away from his overprotective mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder), by pretending their equipment had a faulty “flux capacitor.” (Joyce clearly has not seen Back to the Future.) Joyce’s maternal instincts were useful, however: she turned the bratty kid known as “Dipshit Derek” (Jake Connelly), Vecna’s next target, into an ally by encouraging him to be “Delightful Derek” instead. Murray (Brett Gilman) is always good for a spot of comic relief. And Max and Holly’s bonding in Vecna’s mind (which Holly dubs Camazotz) was another strong point.

In S4, we learned that there are “factions” of the US government—with one, including Dr. Sam Owens (Paul Reiser), that understands what Eleven is facing and sees her as part of the solution, and another that believes Eleven is the source of Hawkins’ alleged “curse” and seeks to find and, presumably, destroy her. S4 ends with Eleven being pursued by this latter, anti-Eleven military faction in an operation led by Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan (Sherman Augustus). S5 picks up with Sullivan still seeking Eleven.

But as the season goes on, our understanding of this military faction falls apart entirely. We see Sullivan is under Major General Dr. Kay (Linda Hamilton), who doesn’t care one way or the other if Eleven is the cause or solution to Hawkins’ problems. In fact, Hawkins’ problems don’t seem to matter whatsoever. Kay has the absurdly myopic goal of simply restarting Dr. Martin Brenner’s (Matthew Modine) program, and she needs Eleven to do so. Eleven is not an evil to defeat, but a weapon to replicate.

At the start of Vol. 2, Kali reveals that Brenner gave Eight and Eleven (among other non-surviving children) their powers via prenatal transfusions with the blood of Henry Creel, aka One, aka Vecna, who we later learn got his powers directly from the Mind Flayer as a child. Kay captured Eight not to use her as bait for Eleven or to use Eight’s power against Eleven, but to try to use Eight’s blood to make more numbered super soldier children. But, the experiment fails, and the pregnant women are dying from Eight’s blood. Thus, she wants Eleven for a second try. And she explicitly doesn’t care if Eleven is good or evil.

Unlike the exposition of Brenner and Vecna in S4, we get zero insight into Kay’s motivations or goals in S5 other than the paper-thin and seemingly self-defeating aim of creating more numbered children. It’s unclear what Kay understands about the current situation in Hawkins and why she doesn’t care about it. As someone who is trying to restart Brenner’s work, she seems to be unaware of what the Upside Down is—a wormhole, it turns out, linking Hawkins to a distant world dubbed the Abyss—and the extreme existential threat it enables. She merely spends her time ruthlessly barking orders and poking at hivemind vines—a mindless plot and a waste of Hamilton’s talents. Meanwhile, Dustin easily stumbles upon the CliffsNotes version, aka Brenner’s notes, which are just sitting out in the Upside Down Hawkins National Lab, which Kay had access to for 18 months.

This all ties into a Broadway spin-off play, Stranger Things: The First Shadow, which was written amid S4 and explores One’s and Brenner’s origins more. In the play’s prologue, it’s revealed that the military accidentally transported a military ship to the Abyss in 1943 while trying to make the ship invisible. The captain and sole survivor of the ship was Brenner’s father, who returned with altered blood. A young Henry Creel, meanwhile, stumbles upon a government scientist in a cave who was carrying a Mind Flayer fragment tied to that military mishap, which is how Henry gains his powers and becomes One/Vecna.

The problem is that the percentage of Stranger Things fans who actually saw the play, or even read the Wikipedia summary, is small compared to the total viewership—so many people tuned in for the New Year’s Eve finale, in fact, that it crashed the site, and that’s not counting the more than 1 million who opted to watch in theaters. Thus far, the Duffer brothers have really nailed building up the show’s mythology, particularly the revelations of S4 with the spooky Creel House legend and its connection to Vecna, as well as the truth about what really happened the night Eleven escaped from the laboratory back in S1.

Unfortunately, this time the brothers stumbled. We are given the scantest information about Henry’s cave encounter backstory and that he knows Joyce and Hopper from high school, apparently, a coincidence that makes no sense without prior knowledge of the play. The Duffer brothers just sketched a rough outline of those pivotal events for their big, final season. Perhaps they were living and breathing their fictional world for so long that they forgot not everyone is as steeped in it as they are. Or perhaps they were just dropping crumbs and saving the good stuff for the spinoff prequel, which would be an odd creative decision. (It’s unclear whether the spinoff will have its own separate mythology, but if so, why complicate matters by including hints in the finale? The plot is already complicated enough.) The result is that we’ve lost a lot of the rich narrative texture that made the prior four seasons so compelling.

Vecna wants to use the 12 kidnapped children to channel enough energy to use the Upside Down wormhole to merge Hawkins and the Abyss into a horrifying new reality. In S4, he told Eleven that humans are pests “poisoning our world” and enforcing a “deeply unnatural structure&quot;—hence his desire to reshape it. How much of this is due to the Mind Flayer’s influence is unclear since Vecna declines to separate himself from the Mind Flayer’s influence when Will gives him the chance in the S5 finale.

We actually see the Abyss start to crush the radio tower with several members of our intrepid Hawkins heroes still on top of it, which strains the willing suspension of disbelief to a breaking point. The Duffer brothers have said they conceived the “Upside Down is a wormhole to an even scarier dimension” twist back in S1. But given the gaping plot holes, it doesn’t seem like they mapped out a careful step-by-step execution to get there. That’s always the fundamental challenge when writing a “mystery box” kind of series: it’s very difficult to pull off a truly satisfying final reveal.

Having said all that, the final season of Stranger Things did get a lot of things exactly right. We’ve come to know and love these characters over the last decade, through suffering and heartbreak and tragic losses and bittersweet triumphs. Granted, Will’s big coming-out scene felt unnecessary—we saw him come to terms with his sexuality in the Vol. 1 finale, thereby unlocking his inner strength and power, so it felt anticlimactic and inorganic, although Schnapp’s performance was perfection. But for the most part, all those emotional heart-to-hearts at key moments really hit home.

Case in point: Nancy and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) are trapped in a building that is literally melting around them because Nancy unwisely shot at the wormhole’s stabilizing sphere of negative matter—yes, really, and no, we don’t understand why, but the melting visual effects were very cool, so we’re going with it, okay? They confess that they both knew the relationship had run its course but had been unwilling to let each other go. They have a tearfully amicable breakup right before Dustin and Steve burst in to save them.

Speaking of Dustin and Steve, they’ve always had one of the sweetest unlikely friendships on the series, so it hurt our hearts to see Dustin constantly pushing Steve away in his grief over Eddie’s death. When he finally breaks down and admits that he just can’t bear to lose Steve too—well, viewer eyes were welling up all over the world. It’s a fitting tribute to one of the most memorable and beloved supporting characters of the series. Eddie’s death was hugely controversial among fans, and Dustin and Steve’s triggering argument revisits those issues and resolves them with a warm reconciling embrace and renewed commitment to each other: “You die, I die.”

The movie-length finale also delivered on the action front. Our heroes defeat Vecna, destroy the Mind Flayer, and blow up the wormhole tying Hawkins to the Abyss. It was everything a fan of the series might expect: a CGI-extravaganza with Rambo Nancy, a group ambush of the kaiju Mind Flayer—reminiscent of the Starcourt battle at the end of S3—while Eleven takes on Vecna, with Joyce chopping off an impaled Vecna’s head with an axe. That scene was especially effective because with each blow, we flashed back to all the characters we lost to Vecna and the Mind Flayer in prior seasons, notably Barb, Bob Newby, Billy, and Eddie. (Kali/Eight falls in battle, too, but the show has never treated her as much more than a plot device, so her death just didn’t have the same emotional impact.)

Since this was the series finale, fan speculation was rampant about whether the Duffer brothers would kill off any major characters, with many fearing Steve was due for a fatal encounter—and he did have a close call on the radio tower, saved at the last minute by Jonathan. But we lost the biggest character of all: Eleven, who chooses to remain in the wormhole when the bomb goes off to ensure that the military can’t use her to bring fresh horror onto Hawkins.

It was the right creative decision; it was even foreshadowed in the S1 finale to some extent. This was also foreshadowed in the first S5 episode when Mike invokes The Lord of the Rings: “The party doesn’t return to their local village. Too much has happened and they’ve seen too much.” Mike sees a future where he and Eleven go to a faraway land with “like three waterfalls or something&quot;—a Tolkien-like ending. (“It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: someone has to give them, lose them, so that others may keep them.”)

El’s departure was always the plan. In a Netflix interview, Ross Duffer explained: “There was never a version of the story where Eleven was hanging out with the gang at the end. For us and our writers, we didn’t want to take her powers away. She represents magic in a lot of ways and the magic of childhood. For our characters to move on and for the story of Hawkins and the Upside Down to come to a close, Eleven had to go away.” So did they pull off the ending they had envisioned? In short, we would say no.

Eleven’s fate is left to the final battle with the military. And this part was just plain weak sauce. The vaguely explained military operation is the sole reason we see Eleven seize her own agency and make the ultimate sacrifice to allow the rest of the party to return to a normal life. And the military’s plot is entirely untethered from everything we know. While Eleven’s journey may have always been destined to end with the series, the sacrifice lands as ridiculous and unnecessary. After nearly a decade and five seasons, our storied, magical child hero falls to a vacuous cartoon villain.

The epilogue at least offers a cathartic glimpse into the futures for the rest of the party, one that feels satisfying in many ways. Hopper and Joyce get engaged and plan to start a new life in picturesque Montauk, New York, which was apparently a location the Duffer brothers first considered as a setting for the series. Nancy drops out of college to take a job at the Boston Herald. Max and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) are going strong. Dustin goes to college while continuing his bromance with Steve. After Will’s touching coming out, he finds himself—and a boyfriend—in college. Mike becomes a storyteller while holding out hope that Eleven is alive somewhere, having the happy, peaceful life she deserves.

While the finale (and the series overall) does a very nice job on the coming of age stories for the characters—handling themes of parental overprotection giving way to burgeoning autonomy; self-acceptance; ending cycles of abuse; building bridges and community; and leaving the magic of childhood behind—the epilogue feels more like Mike’s imagined fairytale ending than a reality, or Holly’s experiences in “Camazotz.” Perhaps that’s why the “Conformity gate” fan theory sprang up—i.e., Vecna somehow survived and has trapped them all in a mass illusion, with a secret bonus episode waiting in the wings as the real finale. The epilogue is a little too good to be true, however much those characters deserve peace.

Most notably, Kay and every hint of the military has vanished from Hawkins. While the series writers pressed for Eleven and the audience to think realistically about what Eleven’s future might be like if she continued on after the fighting, apparently no one else in the story had to deal with any such reckoning. For instance, Hopper, who broke into the MAC-Z and physically assaulted Kay, is not, as one might expect, locked up in the dark basement of a military prison; he’s planning a future with Joyce after getting his old job back as chief of police. None of the kids seem to be hassled by any lingering military offenses either. On the flip side, there is no reckoning for the military, which used the town’s children as bait, among other atrocities. And what happened to those pregnant women?

The town meanwhile, seems to be rebuilding and thriving once again, but we have no idea what explanation was given to Hawkins’ residents for how it was restored, what assurances they have that it is safe now, or whether there are health consequences of their exposure to the wormhole environment—something the series itself raised multiple times. Somehow Ted Wheeler survived being attacked by a demogorgon, perhaps so the writers didn’t waste screen time making the characters feign sadness for his death. But it’s hard to imagine he would handle the truth as well as his wife.

Verdict: despite its many strengths, the final season of Stranger Things didn’t quite stick the landing. But we got some much-needed closure, and it ended on a pitch-perfect note: The original gang (plus Max) holes up in the Wheeler basement for one last D&D campaign, and once it concludes, they file their individual character notebooks on a shelf—leaving childhood behind for good. But then Holly and her new young friends come barreling down the stairs to start their own campaign, passing the torch to the next generation.

The entire fifth and final season of Stranger Things is streaming on Netflix, along with the previous four seasons.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/here-are-the-launches-and-landings-were-most-excited-about-in-2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year delivered doses of drama and excitement in the space business, with a record number of launches, breathtaking vistas of other worlds, and a multitude of breakthroughs and setbacks. 2026 is shaping up to be another thrilling year in the cosmos.

For the first time in more than 54 years, astronauts are training to travel to the vicinity of the Moon, perhaps within the next couple of months. NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, and other companies are poised to take major steps toward actually landing humans on the Moon, perhaps within a few years.

New rockets are slated to debut in 2026, and scientists hope to open new windows on the Universe. Here, we list the most anticipated space missions scheduled for this year, ranked according to our own anticipation for them. We also assess the chances of these missions actually happening in the next 12 months. Unless specified, we don’t assess the chances of a successful outcome.

Final preparations for the Artemis II mission are well underway at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft fully integrated inside the Vehicle Assembly Building. Within a couple of weeks, the SLS rocket could roll to Launch Complex 39B for a countdown dress rehearsal. Then, perhaps in February, the Artemis II mission is scheduled to depart Florida’s Space Coast on a 10-day flight that will carry astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth. This will be the first crew flight on the SLS rocket and Orion capsule. Even if delays prevent a launch in February, Artemis II is well-positioned to fly by spring or summer. Chance of Artemis II happening in 2026: 90 percent.

The next mission on our list is on SpaceX’s Starship roadmap for 2026. A demonstration of large-scale orbital refueling is key to unlocking Starship’s ability to travel beyond low-Earth orbit. SpaceX must master its refueling capability before sending Starships to the Moon to fulfill the company’s lunar lander contract with NASA. The same can be said for SpaceX’s future plans for Starship flights to Mars. This first refueling demo will involve two Starship launches from separate launch pads in Texas, or perhaps Florida. The ships will link up together in orbit, and one will attempt to transfer super-cold methane and liquid oxygen propellants to the other. Cryogenic refueling has never been tried at this scale in space before. Chance of a refueling demo happening in 2026: 50 percent.

SpaceX plans to debut its next version of Starship—Starship Version 3, or V3, with an inaugural test flight in the next few months. This first flight of Starship V3 will look a lot like SpaceX’s past Starship test flights, with the rocket launching from South Texas and flying on a suborbital arc halfway around the world for a precise ocean landing.

If that goes well, SpaceX could take the next step in Starship development on the following flight. This will entail launching Starship—the world’s largest rocket—into low-Earth orbit and bringing the ship back for a reentry over northern Mexico and recovery back at SpaceX’s test facility at Starbase, Texas. There, the ship will be caught back at its launch pad with giant mechanical arms, similar to how SpaceX has recovered the rocket’s Super Heavy booster. A successful catch would be a major leap toward making Starship fully reusable. Chance of a successful Starship catch happening in 2026: 70 percent.

Blue Origin’s first lunar lander is a behemoth. If successful, the Blue Moon Mark 1 cargo lander will become the largest spacecraft to ever set down on the lunar surface. The craft stands more than 26 feet (8 meters) tall and is more than 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter. Engineers in Florida are finishing up assembly of the first Blue Moon Mark 1 before shipping it to Houston for environmental testing.

The lander will then travel back to Cape Canaveral for preparations to fly on top of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket. The company’s current plan is to launch the Moon lander on a New Glenn rocket some time this year. The unpiloted lander’s first jaunt to the Moon will take on greater importance as engineers study the possibility of modifying future Blue Moon Mark 1s for astronauts. Chance of Blue Moon Mark 1 launching in 2026: 70 percent.

Rocket Lab has comfortably held second place among US rocket companies for number of launches per year. The company’s light-class launcher, the Electron, surpassed a monthly launch cadence in 2025. Rocket Lab’s next rocket, the medium-lift Neutron, will open new markets for the company. Neutron is designed with a reusable first stage and integrated payload fairing, which will return to Earth in one piece after releasing the rocket’s expendable upper stage to accelerate into orbit.

The launch pad at Wallops Island, Virginia, is complete, but the rocket wasn’t ready to meet Rocket Lab’s goal of a first flight by the end of 2025. Rocket Lab’s founder, Peter Beck, has a history of giving his team ambitious schedules for the first flight of Neutron. His latest projection calls for delivering the first Neutron rocket to the launch site in the first quarter of 2026, “with first launch thereafter.” Chance of Neutron launching in 2026: 50 percent.

Unlike Rocket Lab, Stoke Space has no experience in launching orbital rockets, but the company’s founders have an impressive pedigree with long tenures overseeing propulsion projects at Blue Origin. Stoke’s first rocket, the Nova, is officially scheduled to fly for the first time in 2026. Construction is in an advanced stage for Nova’s launch site at Cape Canaveral, while Nova’s first and second stages underwent qualification testing last year.

Engineers completed the first hot-fire test of the rocket’s first stage engine in 2024 in Washington state, following earlier tests of the upper stage propulsion system. What’s unique about Nova is that it’s designed for full reusability, with a recoverable booster and upper stage. Stoke is the only company besides SpaceX that seems close to actually test-flying a fully reusable rocket. Chance of Nova launching in 2026: 30 percent.

China’s goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by 2030 is now less than five years away, and a critical test of the country’s new human-rated spacecraft is scheduled for launch sometime in 2026. The partially reusable Mengzhou spacecraft is designed to carry up to seven people to the China’s Tiangong space station or a smaller crew on voyages to the Moon, eventually replacing China’s Shenzhou crew capsule tailored for low-Earth orbit missions.

Mengzhou is akin to NASA’s Orion spacecraft or Apollo command module and is a key element of China’s lunar architecture, along with a human-rated lander named Lanyue, which will make its debut in space on a separate mission. It will launch on China’s new Long March 10A rocket, which the China Manned Space Agency says will make its first flight along with Mengzhou—likely uncrewed—some time this year. We’ve seen hot-fire testing of the rocket’s booster stage in recent months, and China typically does not publicize launch schedules without believing they are realistic. Chance of Long March 10A and Mengzhou launching in 2026: 60 percent.

The first of several reusable rockets under development in China launched in early December. The medium-class Zhuque-3 rocket, developed by a commercial startup named LandSpace, successfully reached orbit on its debut flight, a remarkable achievement in its own right. But LandSpace’s attempt to land the rocket’s first stage booster downrange showed it is close to recovering—and eventually reusing—a Zhuque-3 booster stage.

The rocket failed during its landing burn moments before landing, then crashed right next to its landing pad in the Gobi Desert. LandSpace will try again with Zhuque-3, and other companies have rockets that will make similar attempts in the coming months. Chance of a Chinese orbital-class rocket making a successful landing in 2026: 60 percent.

If you look at public schedules, the California-based company Vast seems to have a significant head start in the race to put a commercial space station in orbit before the International Space Station’s retirement in 2030. Vast’s first crewed habitat, named Haven-1, is under construction for launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, followed by the first of up to four visits by private crews on SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, with each stay lasting up to 10 days. This capability is far short of the permanent human presence supported by the ISS, but a successful launch and activation of Haven-1 would be a significant accomplishment for the commercial space industry.

Vast aims to follow Haven-1 with a larger space station to accommodate visitors for longer stays. So what’s the status of Haven-1? The primary structure of the flight module completed structural testing in October and was set to undergo final weld inspections and integration soon thereafter. Vast’s most recent public schedule called for the launch of Haven-1 as soon as May 2026, but it seems likely to take longer than that to fully outfit the module’s interior, which appeared bare during structural testing earlier this fall. Chance of Haven-1 launching in 2026: 30 percent.

The next of NASA’s flagship-class astronomical observatories is now fully assembled at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, named for NASA’s first chief astronomer, will have a field of view at least 100 times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope. Roman’s primary science instrument will perform wide-area surveys of the Universe, covering 50 times more of the sky in five years than Hubble did in its first 30 years.

A secondary coronagraph instrument will advance astronomers’ ability to directly image exoplanets. NASA announced in December that assembly of Roman was completed, kicking off a series of environmental tests before its scheduled launch no earlier than September on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. Chance of the Roman Space Telescope launching in 2026: 80 percent.

The next robotic mission in China’s lunar exploration program is scheduled for launch as soon as August 2026. Chang’e 7 won’t repeat China’s past feat of returning samples from the Moon, but it will have its share of firsts. The lander will attempt to set down in the Moon’s south pole region and deploy a miniature flying probe to search for water ice in cold traps hidden on the floors of dark craters. The target landing site is on the rim of Shackleton Crater, which is within range of cold, unlit regions thought to harbor water ice. If successful, Chang’e 7 will be the first mission to locate and characterize water ice deposits on the lunar surface, beating similar US missions to the Moon by a year or more. Chance of Chang’e 7 launching in 2026: 80 percent.

Similar to the way we addressed China’s emerging reusable rockets, we decided to group Europe’s new startup launch companies together in a single entry. Three of these European companies say they are targeting the first flight of their small satellite launchers in 2026. One is Isar Aerospace, headquartered near Munich, which launched its first Spectrum rocket in March 2025. The rocket didn’t make it far, but Isar is gearing up for a second orbital launch attempt in the early weeks of 2026.

Trailing behind Isar is Rocket Factory Augsburg, another German company, which appeared to be on track to launch its first RFA One rocket before a fiery accident during a test-firing in 2024. PLD Space of Spain is targeting a first flight of its Miura 5 rocket in 2026, although it seems to be lagging behind Isar Aerospace and Rocket Factory Augsburg. Other serious contenders in the European small launch arena include MaiaSpace of France and Germany’s HyImpulse. Both appear to have delayed their first orbital launch attempts to 2027. Chance of a European launch startup reaching orbit in 2026: 20 percent.

Relativity Space is officially targeting the first flight of its heavy-lift Terran R rocket in late 2026, but there is reason for skepticism. At its Long Beach, California, headquarters, Relativity is wrapping up welding on the first stage, second stage, and interstage adapter for Terran R’s first flight, while also installing internal fluid lines to flow propellant to the rocket’s engines. Each stage is expected to undergo structural testing and acceptance testing at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi before shipment to Cape Canaveral, Florida, for launch preparations. At Stennis, Relativity is performing acceptance testing on first stage engines and continuing developmental testing on Terran R’s upper stage engine. Construction is still in full swing at the Terran R’s launch pad in Florida. Chance of Terran R’s first launch in 2026: 10 percent.

Another rocket that is officially scheduled to launch in late 2026 is Eclipse, the new medium-lift launcher under joint development by Firefly Aerospace and Northrop Grumman. On paper, the Eclipse rocket is at about the same stage of development as Relativity’s Terran R. The most recent update from Firefly indicated the company has completed more than 100 hot-fire tests of the Eclipse’s Miranda main engine, more than Relativity has done with its Aeon R main engine. Relativity is already test-firing its upper stage engine, while Firefly has not yet achieved that milestone. Chance of Eclipse’s first launch in 2026: 20 percent.

The first US company to put a spacecraft on the Moon plans to return to the lunar surface in 2026. Intuitive Machines is preparing to launch its third Nova-C lander in the second half of the year, but it hasn’t released a more specific schedule. In the company’s most recent quarterly update, officials said they are targeting May 2026 for a flight readiness review, the last review before shipping the spacecraft to the launch site in Florida.

Intuitive Machines’ first two landers toppled over after landing but still returned some limited science data to Earth. The next lander will incorporate updated navigation sensors to help guide it to a gentle touchdown in the Reiner Gamma region on the Moon’s near side. A secondary payload will hitch a ride to space on the same launcher with IM-3. The Vestri mission from the asteroid mining company AstroForge will head into the Solar System and attempt to land on a metal-rich asteroid. Chance of IM-3 and Vestri launching in 2026: 50 percent.

Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lunar lander completed the first-ever fully successful commercial mission on the Moon’s surface last March. The next Blue Ghost mission is more ambitious, with a landing targeted for the far side of the Moon “as early as 2026,” Firefly says. The next mission actually consists of three spacecraft, with a Blue Ghost lander aiming for the lunar far side, a Firefly-built Elytra orbiter for data relay, and a European Space Agency (ESA) orbiter called Lunar Pathfinder.

This will be the first US mission to attempt a landing on the lunar far side, following two Chinese landers that touched down on the back side of the Moon in 2019 and 2024. Updates from Firefly suggest the company is still in the early stages of manufacturing flight hardware for Blue Ghost Mission 2, while an ESA website shows a target launch schedule no earlier than November 2026. Chance of Blue Ghost Mission 2 launching in 2026: 10 percent.

Astroscale, a company founded with the purpose of cleaning up space debris, has pivoted to pursuing the more lucrative market of satellite servicing. Many of the key technologies needed for space debris cleanup, such as rendezvous and proximity operations, are also applicable to Astroscale’s new focus. Astroscale launched a satellite last year to approach a derelict Japanese rocket in low-Earth orbit, marking the first time any mission has inspected a piece of space junk.

Astroscale’s next mission will go for another first: refueling a US military satellite above geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) above the Earth. Western analysts believe China completed the first geosynchronous satellite refueling mission in 2025, and Astroscale’s contract with the US Space Force will attempt to do the same. The most recent schedule available for this mission shows a launch in mid-2026. Chance of Astroscale’s refueler launching in 2026: 50 percent.

The European Space Agency’s next medium-class science mission, named for the Greek philosopher Plato, could become the most prolific planet hunter ever sent into space. Fitted with 26 ultra-sensitive cameras, Plato will search for exoplanets by detecting tiny dips in light as planets pass in front of other stars. Some estimates suggest Plato could discover several thousand to several tens of thousands of extrasolar worlds, doubling or tripling the number of exoplanets in the confirmed archive.

Plato is specifically designed to find Sun-Earth analogs, potentially habitable rocky planets around stars like the Sun. These are expected to be a small percentage of Plato’s total planet haul. Preparations for Plato’s launch appear to be going well. ESA said ground teams finished assembling the observatory in October, and Plato will spend the coming months in vibration, acoustic, and thermal vacuum testing. The mission has at least two months of schedule margin for its official launch date in December 2026. But given the launch is scheduled for so late in the year, there is a chance a minor delay could push the start of Plato’s mission into 2027. Chance of Plato launching in 2026: 60 percent.

India has lofty ambitions for its space program, including a heavy-lift rocket, a space station in low-Earth orbit, and eventually human landings on the Moon. The precursor to many of these objectives is Gaganyaan, India’s human spaceflight program. Gaganyaan has been in full-scale development since winning approval from the Indian government in 2018. The Gaganyaan program still has government backing, but India has a history of announcing unrealistic schedules for the spacecraft’s initial test flights.

The first uncrewed orbital test flight of the Gaganyaan capsule has been mere months away for the last five years. The first test flight is currently slated for the first quarter of 2026. India’s space agency has reported some progress in 2025, such as human-rating the capsule’s LVM3 launch vehicle, installation of the spacecraft’s propulsion system, and parachute tests. But it’s a good idea to be skeptical of any of India’s schedules until officials provide more meaningful updates. Chance of Gaganyaan-1 launching in 2026: 30 percent.

This is an exciting mission, but the most dramatic part of MMX’s journey will come after it arrives at Mars in 2027. MMX will attempt to land on the Martian moon Phobos up to two times and collect samples for a return to Earth. The mission is poised to begin with a launch in October to start its journey to Mars. The launch was previously set for 2024, but Japan’s space agency delayed it due to problems with the country’s new H3 rocket.

The H3 scored a series of successful flights until December, when it failed to deliver a Japanese navigation satellite to orbit. There’s still time for engineers to investigate the failure and return the H3 to flight before MMX’s planetary launch window in October, but the H3 failure introduced some doubt into a scheduled that seemed assured before last month. The fully integrated MMX spacecraft underwent environmental testing throughout 2025. MMX builds on Japan’s successful Hayabusa 2 mission, which brought specimens from an asteroid back to Earth in 2020. If all goes according to plan, samples from Phobos should be back on Earth in 2031. Chance of MMX launching in 2026: 80 percent.</div>

            <h2>Boston Dynamics’ Unnatural New Robot Demo Will Give You Goose Bumps</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/robots-and-machines/boston-dynamics-new-demo">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not everybody agrees that replicating the four-limbed, bipedal shape of a human should be replicated in robot form. For one, walking with two feet is inherently less stable than four, nevermind a set of wheels. Replicating the dexterity and fine motor skills of human hands also remains a major challenge.

In a modified approach, Boston Dynamics has clearly decided to loosen up some of the restrictions of the human form. During an on-stage demonstration at this year’s CES convention in Las Vegas, Boston Dynamics showed off the agility of its humanoid Atlas robot — albeit with an unnerving degree of freedom of movement that dispels the illusion of a human entity.

Key to the demo is that the robot features clever joints that allow for “continuous rotation.” In effect, its hips, wrists, and neck can swivel a full 360 degrees unimpeded.

After confidently strutting to the front of the stage, Atlas starts twisting its hands like a drill, rotating its head like the girl in “The Exorcist,” and even turning its entire torso around in a dizzying maneuver — a clear indication that Boston Dynamics isn’t planning to be boxed in by the limitations of human anatomy.

“There’s more to it than just copying nature,” Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said during the announcement. “We can pick the best parts of what nature has to offer and do better in others.”

The demo was part of Boston Dynamics’ announcement of a production-ready version of its Atlas robot. The Hyundai-owned firm also announced a partnership with Google’s DeepMind to bring AI smarts to its bots as well.

The firm claimed that it’s already working on a robot that can be deployed in a car factory. The plan is to deploy it at Hyundai’s EV manufacturing facility by 2028.

However, pricing and an availability date for the six-foot-two, 200-pound robot have yet to be revealed.

Beyond spinning its head and hands around freely, Boston Dynamics has shown how Atlas can manipulate car parts and even perform slick breakdancing moves.

“Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works, and it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children,” Playter boasted on stage.

Yet many questions remain about the tech’s long-term viability. For one, not everybody agrees that they make the most sense when it comes to actually replacing human labor. Experts have also warned that humanoid robots could be the next financial bubble.

When or if bipedal robots will be the form factor of choice, particularly when it comes to industrial settings, remains a subject of debate.

“I think the question comes back to what are the use cases and where is the applicability of the technology,” McKinsey partner Alex Panas told NBC News. “In some cases, it may look more humanoid. In some cases, it may not.”

Judging by its latest demo, Boston Dynamics is playing it safe by taking some liberties.

            <h2>“Microslop”: Infuriating Video Sums Up How Microsoft Is Ruining Windows With AI</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/video-microsoft-ruining-windows-ai">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you were already skeptical — if not livid — about Microsoft’s ongoing campaign to drown Windows 11 with useless AI features, you’re really going to hate this video.

In a 30 second clip uploaded over the weekend, programmer Ryan Fleury demonstrates how even using Window 11’s purportedly AI-powered search bar to do exactly what it tells you to do doesn’t come close to working as advertised.

At the start of the video, the settings page search bar, with its gleaming AI icon, recommends searching “My mouse pointer is too small.” This goes against the common search function wisdom that you should look up using keywords, not entire sentences, but whatever: AI magic can take care of that for you, right?

But as it turns out, when Fleury searches “My mouse pointer is too small,” as exactly phrased by the search suggestion, nothing turns up. He waits around ten seconds with no luck, either. But when he looks up “test” afterwards, he gets three results.

“This is not a real company,” Fleury fumed.

He was joined by dozens of netizens who jeered the misfiring feature using a tough-but-fair new pejorative: “Microslop.”

Whether you like it or not, Microsoft isn’t backing off from basting Windows 11 with AI features. It’s ended support for its old operating system, Windows 10, in the hopes that you’ll upgrade and try out its Copilot-integrated successor, its AI chatbot slash virtual assistant.

The AI transformation is intended to be so sweeping that various executives have described the pivot in terms such as turning Windows 11 into an “agentic OS,” or better yet, into a “canvas for AI.” Some of the changes include putting an icon for Copilot in the middle of your taskbar and integrating Copilot into Windows Explorer, allowing you to right-click generate summaries of documents. Other features in the works include Copilot Vision, which lets the AI analyze whatever appears on the desktop display, and Copilot Actions, which lets the AI perform tasks on your behalf.

Many users fear that the deeply woven AI integrations pose a security risk, a fear that is informed by past Windows 11 AI blunders including when earlier versions of its AI “Recall” feature, which creates a history of your computer activity by taking constant screenshots of it, was caught saving sensitive data like Social Security numbers, and storing the screenshots in an unprotected folder.

The backlash against Microsoft’s AI pivot has quickly mounted ever since it announced it’d be ending support for Windows 10, but as anti-AI sentiment at large also heightens, the outrage has recently reached a boiling point with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s recent plea that we should stop using the word “slop,” the new slang for describing low quality text, images, and videos mass produced by AI models. Unfortunately for Nadella, he unwittingly precipitated a classic case of the Streisand effect, and soon after his “slop” comments, the term “Microslop” suddenly went viral online.

“‘AI writes 90% of our code!!!!,&#39;” Fleury mocked, referring to boasts made by Nadella and other tech CEOs. “Don’t worry, we can tell.”

            <h2>CIA Will Neither Confirm Nor Deny Records on 3I/ATLAS</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/cia-neither-confirm-deny-records-3i-atlas">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since it was first spotted hurtling through the solar system, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has maintained that there’s a chance mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a technological object sent by an extraterrestrial civilization.

He’s meticulously catalogued what he claims are anomalous qualities of the object, which most of his peers believe is a natural comet from a different star system, from its unusually large suspected size to a rotation axis almost perfectly perpendicular to the Sun to a “fine-tuned” trajectory that brought it within spitting distance of Mars and Jupiter.

Loeb has also been angered at NASA’s continued insistence that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet — which, again, is the opinion of most experts — accusing them of “arrogance” and ignoring his documented anomalies. He also accused NASA of withholding observations by its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter while 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Red Planet in October, due to last year’s government shutdown. (The images were eventually released in late November.)

NASA isn’t the government institution that Loeb is taking aim at. In a new blog post, the astronomer pointed out that ufologist John Greenewald Jr.’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiry for “any assessments, reports, or communications maintained by the Central Intelligence Agency referencing 3I/ATLAS” had been pointedly shut down.

The CIA told Greenewald in a formal response to his FOIA that it will “neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records” related to the object — a non-answer that could be interpreted in strikingly different ways.

Greenewald is a well-known name in UFO circles. He founded The Black Vault, an enormous archive of millions of pages of government documents he’s uncovered via FOIA inquiries, including declassified videos of what the Pentagon describes as unidentified anomalous phenomena.

Loeb says he found the answer — and the notable level of secrecy — “surprising,” given NASA’s conclusion that “3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin.”

“If this conclusion was clear all along to everyone within government and academia — as NASA officials presented the case, then why would the CIA treat the possible existence of records dealing with a natural comet as sensitive enough to be classified?” he asked rhetorically.

Loeb suggested the government might have investigated whether 3I/ATLAS could pose a threat to national security, perhaps over the possibility of a “black swan event,” which has fascinated the researcher.

If scientists do eventually uncover a probe sent to us by an alien civilization, it could pose a major threat to humanity, Loeb has asserted. He has previously hypothesized that the object could be “akin to a Trojan Horse, where a technological object masquerades as a natural comet.”

Discussions about such a possibility may have been “hidden from public view in order to prevent panic from taking hold for no good reason,” Loeb pondered, especially considering a “black swan event is still regarded as highly unlikely.”

However, this theory presupposes that the CIA even has anything to hide from the public to begin with. After all, in its statement to Greenewald, it didn’t rule out the “nonexistence of records.”

Besides, as more data rolls in, Loeb’s far-fetched theory that 3I/ATLAS is a piece of technology continues to be challenged.

In other words, what would there even to hide if the object does turn out to be a non-threatening lump of ice?

Either way, Loeb isn’t ready to call it just yet. He has advocated for taking a closer look once it makes its closest approach to Jupiter in March.

“Unless we check, we might never know if this swan is white or black,” he concluded in his blog.

            <div id="article-text">“Men do not make laws,” goes a maxim attributed to US president Calvin Coolidge. “They do but discover them.”

If that’s true, then the US attack on Venezuela just uncovered a legislative mother lode. A new law proposed by New York representative Ritchie Torres on Monday would make it illegal for government employees with access to nonpublic information from trading on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.

If that sounds like something that should probably already be illegal, Coolidge might agree, in his own laissez-faire way.

“Laws must be justified by something more than the will of the majority,” he concluded. “They must rest on the eternal foundation of righteousness.”

In any case, the “Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026,” would include new restrictions on elected officials, political appointees, and executive branch staffers, according to Forbes. It would also apply to government employees who have not yet been privy to nonpublic documents, but “may reasonably obtain such material nonpublic information in the course of performing official duties.”

The proposed legislation comes on the heels of compelling evidence that someone with inside information about the recent kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro placed a series of large bets on Polymarket on whether an attack would take place. Just two days before the surprise attack, the account in question invested over $30,000 in a prediction that either Maduro would be “out” or that US troops would set foot “in Venezuela by” January 31st.

The payout was staggering: a profit of $400,000 in less than 24 hours, as sports entrepreneur Joe Pompliano estimated.

“Seems pretty suspicious!” Pompliano wrote. “Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged.”

Beyond the Venezuela attack, prediction markets have raised serious anxiety about geopolitical strife around the world. Recent advances in the sector have made it so that crypto bros can gamble on deadly conflicts in real-time, betting thousands of dollars on questions like “will Russia capture all of Kupiansk by March 31?”

Back in October, Reuters reported that the Trump Media and Technology Group was working with Crypto.com to implement prediction market functionality into Truth Social. That came as dozens of federal investigations into crypto-based price fixing, securities fraud, and regulatory noncompliance have been dropped at the Trump administration’s urging. Two of those cases were against prediction platforms Polymarket —the very same implicated in the Venezuela allegations — and Kalshi, for selling options contracts related to congressional elections.

Whether Torres’ new bill makes it very far remains to be seen. Recent history shows that Congress has little appetite for regulation of insider trading — and for now, there doesn’t yet seem to be a wager on the outcome of the bill on either Polymarket or Kalshi.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Grok, the flagship chatbot created by the Elon Musk-founded AI venture xAI and infused into X-formerly-Twitter — a platform also owned by Elon Musk — continues to be used by trollish misogynists, pedophiles, and other freaks of the digital gutters to non-consensually undress images of women and, even more horrifyingly, underage girls.

The women and girls targeted in these images range from celebrities and public figures to many non-famous private citizens who are often just average web users. As Futurism reported, some of the AI images generated by Grok and automatically published to X were specifically altered to depict real women in violent scenarios, including scenes of sexual abuse, humiliation, physical injury, kidnapping and insinuated murder.

Because Grok is integrated into X, this growing pile of nonconsensual and seemingly illegal images are automatically published directly to the social media platform — and thus are disseminated to the open web, in plain view, visible to pretty much anyone. As it stands, X and xAI have yet to take any meaningful action to stem the tide.

Below is a timeline of how this story has so far unfolded, and which we’ll continue to update as we follow whether X and xAI take action against this flood of harmful content.

A normal company, upon realizing that its platform-embedded AI chatbot was being used at scale to CSAM and unwanted deepfake porn of real people and spew it into the open web, would likely move quickly to disconnect the chatbot from its platform until a problem of such scale and severity could be resolved. But these days, X is not a normal company, and Grok is the same chatbot infamous for scandals including — but not limited to — calling itself “MechaHitler” and spouting antisemitic bile.

The story here isn’t just that Grok was doing this in the first place. It’s also that X, as a platform, appears to be a safe haven for the mass-generation of CSAM and nonconsensual sexual imagery of real women — content that has largely been treated by the losers creating this stuff like it’s all just one big meme. We’ll continue to follow whether X makes meaningful changes — or if it continues to choose inaction.

            <h2>Tesla Loses Trademark to “Cybercab” Due to Its Own Staggering Incompetence</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a blunder that sums up Tesla’s struggling efforts in the self-driving space, Electrek reports that the Elon Musk-owned automaker has badly screwed up trying to get a trademark for its upcoming “Cybercab.”

The Cybercab, for the uninformed, is Tesla’s purpose-built vehicle for giving driverless rides. Right now, its capital-R Robotaxi service, which operates as a comically tiny fleet exclusively in Austin, Texas, uses existing Tesla Model Ys, not specialized cars (and its trademark is itself under peril due to yet more incompetence, as we’ll explain later.) A prototype of the two-passenger, no-steering wheel Cybercab was unveiled at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event over a year ago, and Musk claims it’ll enter production in Q2 this year.

That promise could still end up being fulfilled, if you’re to ignore Musk’s proclivity for making overblown statements. But in the meantime, the fabled Cybercab is in serious danger of losing its name.

According to a US Patent and Trademark Office suspension notice obtained by Electrek, the trademark “Cybercab” has been formally suspended as of November 14, 2025, for two main reasons: a “likelihood of confusion,” the USPTO’s examining attorney wrote, and because another company called Unibev, a French beverage outfit, beat Tesla to the punch.

This wasn’t down to bad luck. Per the reporting, Musk unveiled the Cybercab at the “We, Robot” event on October 10, 2024, but neglected to file an application until November — an astonishing oversight for a company so large and ambitious. Unibev, meanwhile, saw the opening and filed a “Cybercab” application before the end of the month. Tesla had weeks to secure its trademark, even after making the questionable decision of not filing for it before unveiling the new product at a highly covered event.

Unibev is using a tactic called trademark squatting, and it apparently has a vendetta with Tesla, having three trademarks for “TESLAQUILA” in the US, the same name Tesla tried to use for its own line of tequila, Electrek noted.

As we alluded to earlier, this isn’t the only branding blow Tesla has suffered for its self-driving cab efforts. Last summer, the USPTO turned down Tesla’s application for trademarking the term “Robotaxi” for being too generic. Or in the examiner’s words, “merely descriptive,” since the term robotaxi is “used to describe similar goods and services by other companies.” It may as well have tried to trademark its cars as Cars.

With the Cybercab blunder, Tesla has already tried and failed to change the USPTO’s mind, so it looks like it’ll have to cut a deal with Unibev to drop its claim, or argue in court that it can’t hold the trademark since it has no intent to build cars. An Electrek source familiar with the matter says that Tesla and Unibev are in negotiations, but with no agreement reached yet.

            <h2>Caterpillar taps Nvidia to bring AI to its construction equipment</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/caterpillar-taps-nvidia-to-bring-ai-to-its-construction-equipment/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Caterpillar is diving deeper into incorporating AI and automation into its fleet of construction machinery through a partnership with semiconductor giant Nvidia.

The construction equipment giant is piloting an AI assistive system in its mid-size Cat 306 CR Mini Excavator. Dubbed “Cat AI,” the system was built using Nvidia’s Jetson Thor physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday.

Brandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator’s questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services.

One of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out.

“Our customers don’t live in front of a laptop day in and day out; they live in the dirt,” Hootman said. “The ability to get the insights and take the action that they need while they’re doing the work is very important to them.”

Caterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia’s Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar’s machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. This data will help them build these simulations.

The company already has fully autonomous vehicles in the mining sector, and Hootman said that these pilot programs are a great next step as the company looks to bring more automation to its portfolio.

“The reason that we started here was it was a real challenge of our our customers today that needed to be addressed, and also something that we had some some real momentum on and we felt like we could we could bring to market pretty quickly,” Hootman said. “What we also liked is that provided a kind of a technology foundation for us to then build upon.”

Working with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn’t often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia’s physical AI strategy.

Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch in 2025 that the chipmaker considers physical AI to be the next frontier for the company and its powerful GPUs.

During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, which includes open AI models like the company’s Cosmos model family, simulation tools, and developer kits.

While some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today.

“Physical AI is the next wave of AI,” Talla said. “Nvidia is pioneering that with computers that train the models, that do the simulation to test the models and deploy the models into the robots, whether [that’s] an autonomous car or a Caterpillar machine.”

            <h2>How Quilt solved the heat pump’s biggest challenge</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-07</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Smart home startup Quilt introduced a three-zone heat pump on Tuesday that promises to maintain efficiency even in the kinds of demanding conditions that stymie traditional incumbents.

The three-zone unit does what it says on the label: One outdoor unit is now capable of driving three indoor heads, as they’re known in the HVAC world. It’s a product that will make large installations simpler and cheaper while minimizing the footprint outside the home, and it’s key to the startup’s plans for expansion, which were recently turbocharged by a $20 million Series B focused on expanding sales.

But the real story is how Quilt developed the new product.

Since its founding, Quilt has prided itself on the amount of data it collects from its heat pumps. Not only are they internet-connected, they’re also laced with more sensors than typical heat pumps.

By analyzing that data, Quilt engineers have been able to do things that other companies have not. In September, for example, they shipped an over-the-air update to heat pumps in people’s homes that unlocked an additional 20% capacity, which could be directed toward either one or two zones. With the free update, people could be more comfortable during heat waves and cold snaps.

The team also used the data to develop the new three-zone unit and, in the process, solve a vexing challenge that many competitors face.

Like all heat pumps, multi-zone units work best when they’re run at variable speed — that is, when heating or cooling demand is low, the compressor runs at a lower speed to deliver only the amount of heating or cooling that’s needed.

But there are limits to how low they can operate. Compressors become less stable at low speeds, making them harder to control. Matthew Knoll, co-founder and CTO at Quilt, compares it to driving a car a low speeds. Maintaining an even 70 mph is easier than a steady 11 mph. “It’s a little harder,” he said.

To compensate, most systems stop the compressor at a certain point, sacrificing some efficiency and comfort in the process.

Quilt, though, was able to draw on data collected from the thousand or so units already installed in people’s homes and businesses, giving them insights into how the systems were operating in the real world.

“The way most systems are developed, they’re tested in a lab under a couple scenarios because testing’s expensive. And you end up with kind of a you know an average product,” Knoll said.

“We have a thousand units out there in many different climates, and if we see something, we can look at it across a bunch of different units to understand if there’s room to optimize or if we’re seeing a problem in a corner case,” he said

The company also uses a larger copper coil than many competitors, which allows it to spec a smaller compressor. That combination, along with some other tweaks to the design, allows Quilt to deliver nearly 90% of its rated capacity (27,000 BTUs) at -13˚ F (-25˚ C) without sacrificing low-demand performance or efficiency. Quilt says it’s the most efficient three-zone mini-split on the market.

To save power, each indoor head can be controlled individually, supplying as little as 2,210 BTUs of heat or 1,570 BTUs of cooling. If heating or cooling isn’t needed, refrigerant still flows through the lines like it does in other heat pumps. But thanks to the outdoor unit’s low-speed performance, it only releases around 300 BTUs of heat in heating mode. That’s about as much heat as a grown adult throws off.

Where does Quilt go from here? Knoll wouldn’t comment on future plans other than to say that Quilt “wants to be able to have a solution for all homes.” More products are coming, and it’s likely that reams of data will help lead their development.

            <div id="article-text">WhatsApp on Wednesday said it’s rolling out new features to group chats, including member tags, text stickers, and event reminders.

With member tags, you can choose a name that gives others in the group chat more context about who you are and what your role is. For example, you could be “Anna’s Dad” in one group and “Goalkeeper” in another.

As for text stickers, you can turn any word into a sticker by typing your text into Sticker Search. You can also add these newly created stickers directly to your sticker packs without sending them in a chat.

Event reminders let you set custom reminders for your invitees when you create and send an event in a group chat.

These new features come as WhatsApp continues to bolster group chats with capabilities like sharing large files up to 2GB, sending HD media, screen sharing, voice chats, and more.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Spotify is adding even more social features as it seeks to keep users from leaving the app to share music. The company on Wednesday said it is introducing a new Messages feature that will let users see what their friends are streaming in real time and send requests to start Jams, the app’s collaborative listening feature.

Users would first have to navigate to their Settings and turn on the “listening activity” feature in the “Privacy & Social” section. Once that’s done, your listening activity will appear at the top of Messages chats. You can tap a friend’s listening activity to play the track, save it, open the menu, or react with an emoji.

As for starting a Jam, Premium users can tap the “Jam” option in the top-right corner to send a request to their friends. If the other user accepts it, they will become the Jam host, and both users would be able to add tracks to a shared queue and listen to music together.

Listening Activity and Request to Jam will roll out to the iOS and Android apps in markets where Messages is available, and will be broadly available in these markets by early February. Listening Activity is available to all users with access to Messages, while Free users can join a Request to Jam session when invited by a Premium user.

Spotify notes that because both of these new features are available through Messages, they are only available to users 16 and older.

The streaming platform launched Messages in August 2025 in a bid to become a more social app. While users have long shared Spotify links to music and podcasts outside the platform, the new messaging capabilities signal a push to keep more interactions within the app as the company looks to increase user retention metrics and attract more paying users.

Messages on Spotify can only be sent to individual users at the moment, and you can only chat with people you’ve previously shared content with, such as collaborators on a playlist or participants in a Jam or Blend. Messages are encrypted at rest and in transit, but they are not protected by end-to-end encryption.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and its extensive library of hit TV shows and films like “Harry Potter,” “Game of Thrones,” and the DC Comics titles is dragging on.

The studio on Wednesday said its board had unanimously rejected Paramount Skydance’s revised $108.4 billion bid, calling the proposal a “leveraged buyout” that would encumber the company with $87 billion in debt.

In a letter to shareholders, WBD urged them to reject the offer, saying the “extraordinary amount” of debt Paramount would need to raise heightens the risk of the deal falling through, and instead recommended they vote in favor of its earlier, $82.7 billion deal with Netflix for its film and TV studio assets.

Paramount, which was rumored to be in the running to buy WBD before the Netflix deal was announced, went directly to WBD’s shareholders with an all-cash, $30-per-share offer in early December after Warner Bros.’ board decided to sell to Netflix. But WBD rejected Paramount’s bid, calling the offer “illusory” and saying Paramount did not have the cash to back up its claims, and instead recommended Netflix’s cash-and-share deal.

Paramount then came back with a $40 billion guarantee from its CEO David Ellison’s billionaire dad, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and said it would raise $54 billion in debt to fund the deal.

WBD doesn’t seem convinced. “[Paramount] is a company with a $14 billion market capitalization attempting an acquisition requiring $94.65 billion of debt and equity financing, nearly seven times its total market capitalization […] This aggressive transaction structure poses materially more risk for WBD and its shareholders when compared to the conventional structure of the Netflix merger,” WBD wrote in a statement.

Warner Bros. also called into question Paramount’s ability to function well if the deal goes through, arguing that raising such amounts of debt would further worsen Paramount’s current “junk” credit rating.

Warner Bros. was particularly concerned about Paramount’s negative free cash flow, which would be exacerbated by any acquisition. “In contrast, Netflix is a company with a market capitalization of approximately $400 billion, an investment grade balance sheet, an A/A3 credit rating and estimated free cash flow of more than $12 billion for 2026,” WBD wrote.

Netflix welcomed WBD’s decision, saying after the merger the companies would “bring together highly complementary strengths and a shared passion for storytelling.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Spotify is lowering its eligibility criteria for podcasters to monetize their videos on the platform, dropping the minimum episode requirement to three, minimum consumption hours to 2,000, and engaged audience member threshold to 1,000 over the last 30 days.

When the company introduced its partner program to monetize video content last year, creators needed to have published 12 episodes, hit 10,000 consumption hours over the prior 30 days, and had at least 2,000 people stream their content in the last 30 days to be part of the program.

The program pays podcasters according to the number of premium users who watched their videos on Spotify, alongside a share of ad revenue earned from users on the free tier.

The company is also introducing new sponsorship tools that would allow creators to update, schedule, and measure sponsorship spots read by hosts in video ads. These tools are coming to the Spotify for Creators app, and Megaphone, the company’s podcast hosting and monetization suite, in April.

Doubling down on its video strategy in a bid to compete better with YouTube, Spotify is now launching a new API that would let creators use their existing platforms to publish and monetize video podcasts on Spotify. At launch, tools like Acast, Audioboom, Libsyn, Omny, and Podigee have adopted this API, the company said.

The new moves come as Spotify’s been looking to new avenues to attract users and build on its streaming subscription revenue. The company said since the launch of the partner program, the consumption of video podcasts on the app has nearly doubled, and that the average Spotify podcast user streams twice as many video shows per month as they did before the program was launched.

But that could simply be a result of the streaming service surfacing more video content.

The company is also opening a studio for recording podcasts and videos in West Hollywood. Spotify said the studio would serve as a base for the Ringer podcast network, and it would open the studio to select creators from the partner program. The company already has studios across the art district in LA, New York, Stockholm, and London.

            <h2>Trump’s Heathen Heart</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-hegseth-venezuela-military/685530/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rudyard Kipling’s “Recessional” shocked its readers in 1897, when he wrote it for the complacent celebrations of Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee. The poem read differently and more ominously after 1898, when Britain entered a wretchedly difficult and brutal three-year war in South Africa that shook imperial self-confidence as nothing had since the American Revolution.

President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth may have heard of Kipling, although it is doubtful that they have read him or any other versifier. But his words apply to them no less:

If, drunk with sight of power, we loose    Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe, Such boastings as the Gentiles use,    Or lesser breeds without the Law— Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget—lest we forget!

Naked imperialism is an ugly thing, and that contemptuous phrase, “lesser breeds without the Law,” unsettles any contemporary reader of “Recessional.” But for all of its ugliness, the poem also captured Kipling’s belief that imperial power was transitory, and that when exercised for nothing but ruthless self-interest, it was not only foolish, but dangerous and impious. George Orwell, whose opinion of Kipling was mixed (he called him a “good bad poet”), believed that by “lesser breeds without the Law” Kipling meant the Germans, and that the poem as a whole was “a denunciation of power politics, British as well as German.”

The American president has admitted that he has an addictive personality, which is why, to his credit, he is a teetotaler. But he and his aides are undoubtedly intoxicated with military power. “This was one of the most stunning, effective, and powerful displays of American-military might and competence in American history,” he said at the press conference following the seizure of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro. “No other country on planet Earth, and it’s not even close, could pull this kind of operation off,” Hegseth added. “And no other president has ever shown this kind of leadership, courage, and resolve. The most powerful combination the world has ever seen.” And Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller later told CNN’s Jake Tapper that “what we’ve witnessed under President Trump’s leadership this last week is one of the greatest foreign-policy and military victories this country has ever had.”

Read: Trump seizing Greenland could set off a chain reaction

The Maduro snatch was, unquestionably, a remarkable feat of arms, and no tears need be shed about the removal of a man who was an enemy of the United States, a troublemaker in the region, and a tyrant at home. It is entirely conceivable that the outcome will be beneficial, leading to the eviction of Cuban and Iranian agents from Venezuela, much-increased pressure on the Cuban dictatorship, and even, by an unforeseen chain of events, some relief from oppression for the people of Venezuela.

The concerning thing is not Maduro’s removal, but rather the view of military power that Trump, Hegseth, and others seem to be forming. Hegseth boasted, understandably, that there were no American fatalities. There were, however, plenty of Venezuelan casualties and, according to Havana, 32 Cuban intelligence and military operatives killed. The administration’s expensively trained lawyers, high on credentials if low on scruples, may call this a law-enforcement operation, but blowing up buildings, shutting down Caracas’s electrical grid, and killing lots of uniformed people is about as warlike as it gets. And judging by what they later said, Trump and his lieutenants reveled in the combat they observed from the luxurious setting of Mar-a-Lago.

Commando raids of this type, and the units that execute them, fascinate politicians. The people are extraordinary, their actions spectacularly skilled, the hazards immense, and the immediate political payoffs great—if the raids succeed. Small wonder that the Trump White House put out its own Mar-a-Lago version of the famous Obama-administration picture of the president and his top advisers keenly watching the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. In that case, as in this one, there was precisely nothing the president and his entourage could do to affect the outcome, but it made them look like they were in charge—which, once the bullets began to fly, they were not.

Something similar holds true in limited air campaigns. Bombing offers gratification without commitment, a thing akin to the dating patterns of dissolute men, of whom the administration also has a few. These are ways of war that seem clean, limited, precise, and brief.

And so they are until they are not. The Trump administration no doubt thinks, as the Obama administration did, that by fighting this way, it can avoid getting bogged down in the kinds of counterinsurgency campaigns that the U.S. waged in Iraq and Afghanistan. The result in Barack Obama’s case was the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq—and then a new commitment to fight a deeply destructive third Iraq war against a resurgent Islamic State, and a 2011 intervention in Libya that opened the way to chaos spreading far beyond Tripoli and Benghazi.

The Trump administration also believes—a lesson, again, learned from Democratic presidents, such as Bill Clinton and Obama—that one can avoid consulting Congress before ordering U.S. forces to begin killing people. The Yugoslav wars and the Libya interventions were not preceded by authorizations of military force from Congress, unlike operations in either Afghanistan or Iraq conducted by the George W. Bush administration.

This is all dangerous stuff. Avoiding the deployment of 100,000 troops into Venezuela is no guarantee that American military action will not continue and expand, whether in response to terror counterpunches; attempts to break a de facto, if limited, blockade of Venezuela; or mere refusal to cooperate with the president’s desire to cop the profits from Venezuelan oil sales. In war, one thing leads to another.

Hubris is one of this administration’s deepest weaknesses, as is its predilection for bombast and chest-thumping. In a White House that insists on public sycophancy (and no doubt gets a full dose in private, too), the resulting chances of a misjudgment are considerable. Worse is the deliberate disconnection of the use of force from any kind of moral purpose. Miller gave the game away in his CNN interview. Americans, he said, must be “able to assert ourselves and our interests without apology,” before decrying “this whole period that happened after World War II, where the West began apologizing and groveling and begging and engaging these mass reparations schemes.”

Think about that. The United States should acknowledge no restraints, whether of law or morality, on what it does, and the policies that got us through the Cold War, the institutions we created, and the norms we asserted—unevenly, even hypocritically at times—were all for suckers. It is not surprising that Trump and his subordinates immediately began threatening a host of countries, including two of our allies, Colombia and Denmark.

Their statements, and others like them, are nothing less than a paean to force, applied when and as the United States sees fit, unconstrained by anything other than presidential whim. The situation is unlikely to end well.

For heathen heart that puts her trust    In reeking tube and iron shard, All valiant dust that builds on dust,    And guarding, calls not Thee to guard, For frantic boast and foolish word— Thy mercy on Thy People, Lord!</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">My friendships exist in silos. Each hangout is a feverish one-on-one where we share fries and eye contact, confessions, rants, gossip, and mutual attempts at amateur therapy. This patchwork of get-togethers structures my week: a Wednesday happy hour with one friend, a Saturday-morning walk-and-talk with another, a Sunday coffee date with a third. It’s exhilarating—we genuinely want to know how each other’s moms are doing.

Some days, though, I feel strangely lonely. While my social life looks like a loose archipelago of individuals, other people seem to operate in warm, robust units. I’m jealous when I see a circle of friends that looks like a miniature community. Groups seem like the norm if you watch sitcoms or use social media or just eat brunch at a restaurant. I too want to be forever laughing with half a dozen pals in one of our apartments on a random weekday, or squeezed into a dive-bar booth together.

If friend groups seem ubiquitous, so does a quiet underclass of people like me, bemoaning their lack of them. “I get really sad about it sometimes,” the lifestyle influencer Carly Silverman admitted on TikTok. A slew of companies have popped up to manufacture group hangs—essentially matchmaking strangers who are seeking a circle of friends, not just one-on-one connections. The common assumption appears to be that people with friend groups live fuller lives, or that they must have some superior qualities that attract hordes of people. “Most people who are happy have a close-knit, supportive friend group (or the equivalent like supportive/sprawling family),” one X post informed me, as I scrolled alone in a park on a sunny day, surrounded by groups of friends crowded onto picnic blankets. “Most people who are unhappy don’t.”

That sort of assertion had led me to believe that my constellation of one-on-one hangouts represented a failure to establish a crucial piece of adulthood. But friend groups, it turns out, are not the norm—research on how adult friendships are organized suggests that being part of one is a matter of luck, circumstance, and personal characteristics, such as extroversion and openness. Friend groups are real, of course. It’s just that they’re not the one and only way to avoid feeling lonely. In fact, in reporting this article, I came to realize that my lack of a friend group wasn’t making me lonely—it was more that I felt lonely because I feared that I was missing out on something everyone else had.

Loneliness is a feeling, which can make the source of it hard to pin down. It can mean different things to different people, which is one reason the highly publicized “loneliness epidemic” may not be an epidemic at all. Public conversations about loneliness tend to collapse a distinction between feeling lonely and being socially isolated—the latter is an objective state that doesn’t inevitably mean a person feels the negative emotions of loneliness. By some measures, it’s not clear that Americans are more isolated than in the past; some research suggests that they have just as many friends as they’ve always had. In 2024, the American Friendship Project, a research initiative tracking national trends in friendship over time, reported that a majority of respondents to its surveys said that they had five or more friends, which is similar to reported friendship numbers from 1970 to 2015.

Still, social scientists consider the feeling of not belonging to a friend group to be a notable contributor to loneliness. One of the most popular research tools for assessing loneliness is the UCLA Loneliness Scale, which—among other questions—asks participants to indicate how often they “feel part of a group of friends.” Cigna used the scale for a 2018 survey, which found that “most Americans are considered lonely” and that less than a third of respondents “always” felt part of a group of friends, which might indicate that a lack of friend groups can be a factor in people’s loneliness. In this sense, sweeping surveys such as this might count people like me—someone who has close friends but lacks friend groups—among the lonely.

People can experience different types of loneliness, Letitia Anne Peplau, the retired psychology professor who co-created the UCLA Loneliness Scale, told me. In the sociologist Robert Weiss’s 1973 book about loneliness, he distinguishes between “the loneliness of emotional isolation,” which he characterizes as “the absence of a close emotional attachment,” and “the loneliness of social isolation”—that is, “the absence of an engaging social network.” You might have a deeply meaningful relationship with your spouse, for example, and still feel lonely for lack of community. And the longing for a social network, he writes, “can be remedied only by access to such a network.”

Yet most friendships in the U.S. are unlikely to be the kind that involve regular, in-person hangouts with a wider group. According to the American Friendship Project, few people live with their friends, and nearly half live in a different city or state than their friends. Respondents, these data suggest, are not typically living in a Seinfeld-ian endless hang. “Friend groups seem to be increasingly rare—particularly because more people than ever leave their hometowns for college, and then leave college for hinterlands, forcing them to spread out,” Jaimie Krems, a professor and the director of the UCLA Center for Friendship Research, told me. “And yet, we study adult friendship so little, we don’t have a great handle on the extent to which this is true, for whom, and the impact.”

What some research does show is that certain personalities are more likely to seek out a crew: people who are extraverted, agreeable, and otherwise emotionally secure. Introverts, meanwhile, are more likely to cultivate friendships with fewer, but also closer, friends, because they “are very risk averse,” Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist who studies social bonds, told me. “When they go and knock on Jemima’s door in the middle of the night and say, ‘My world has fallen apart. Can you do something for me?’ they want to be absolutely certain that Jemima is going to say yes.”

The way people organize their friendships, researchers have found, tends to break down along gendered lines. In general, men seem more likely to form loose groups, while women seem more likely to have deeper, one-on-one relationships. “What matters for women’s friendships is who you are as an individual, not what you are, whether it’s what you do, or what ‘club’ you belong to,” Dunbar said. “Whereas for men’s friendships, what’s important is what ‘club’ you belong to, not who you are as an individual.”

Those who are lamenting the absence of a huge friend group should consider that the average number of close friends a person has is “very conspicuously five,” Dunbar said. The eponymous “Dunbar’s number” is his theory that there is a limit to the number of relationships a person can keep up, given the size of the human brain, and that this limit is consistent—though he’s not sure how many people have organized these five close relationships into a single circle, versus how many have created what he calls a “hub-and-spokes version” of mostly one-on-one friendships.

If friend groups aren’t required to abate loneliness, and apparently aren’t the standard, the question is why so many people still seem to want them. Some people, friendship researchers told me, could be mourning a version of friendship that exists predominantly on social media and TV. “As a general rule,” Peplau said, “feeling that we are not doing as well as others can increase our current level of distress.” This sense of FOMO is not exclusive to social-media scrollers. In the 1960s, Weiss, the sociologist, published research on married couples who moved to the Boston area from another state. The men established relationships through work, but the wives had “newcomer blues.” They wanted a version of what their husbands had, Weiss later wrote: “access to a network of women with whom they might establish and then discuss issues of common concern.”

That said, Peplau pointed out that it’s worth distinguishing between a brief pang of loneliness that comes from lingering on an influencer’s post about partying all night with their best friends and a calcified, recurring feeling of loneliness. That transient discomfort is not in the same category as feeling an aching sense of exclusion and disconnection.

Although people without friend groups aren’t automatically more lonely, having access to one can certainly help alleviate loneliness. Group friendships can offer benefits that some individual friendships cannot, social scientists told me. Dunbar cited research on social networks that suggests people in interconnected friend groups are more likely to be generous to one another, possibly out of fear of being outed as miserly to an entire group. If two people in a friend group have a conflict, in other words, the group may have enough structural support to withstand splintering. A friendship duo doesn’t always have those reinforcements.

Dunbar did tell me, though, that if you have been holding out hope for a friend group, then as long as you’re still alive, it is never too late. “There’s nothing to stop a group forming, coming together, and gelling really well at any stage,” he said. “It might be in your 80s; it might be in your 30s.” The pod, and the Sunday-night dinners, and the group trips: All of this is always possible—you might just have to engineer it. I still think it would be fun to have a friend group. But I also treasure the fact that I have versions of Dunbar’s example of close friendship: When I knock on a friend’s door in the middle of the night, I know they’ll let me in for gossip, mutual therapy, and to catch up on each other’s moms.</div>

            <h2>Kids Deserve Better Than Goody Bags</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2026/01/goody-bags-kids-birthday-party-favor/685524/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For most of my adult life, I tried to live lightly on the planet. I kept my small apartment uncluttered and generally strove to have less. This approach worked pretty well—until I had kids. Now my twins are 4, and though they’ve finally outgrown all of the bottles, bouncers, sippy cups, and pull-ups, a steady stream of stuff still flows into our home. The dentist offers a toy after every appointment. My mom sends them home with art supplies and bubble wands. Recently, a five-foot inflatable snowman arrived in the mail because my dad thought it would delight his grandkids. It did, and now Frosty is living on our balcony until we can find room for him in our storage closet.

The worst offenders, though, are the goody bags. This year, my kids received them at Valentine’s Day, Ramadan, Easter, Halloween, and many birthday parties. Every time they bring one home, they dump its contents on the living-room floor and pick through their treasures with glee. But soon enough, the tiny fire truck has lost its wheels and a fight has broken out over whose Care Bears keychain is cooler, though neither of my children has ever owned a key.

Read: An alternative to overspending on presents

When I complain about these gifts, I feel like the worst kind of parent: ungrateful, no fun, and critical of other families’ choices. I know that the gifts are a gesture of celebration. But it’s also true that plastic takes at least a century to decompose (and typically far longer) and that the goodies are, as Chip Colwell, an anthropologist and the author of So Much Stuff, told me, commonly the product of extraordinarily cheap labor. That broken fire truck will almost certainly outlive my children, either in a landfill or, worse, in the ocean—all for a few minutes of play.

Still, it’s understandable why so many parents give out goody bags. No one wants to disappoint their child or be seen as ungenerous. Generosity—including doling out tokens of appreciation at the end of a party—is an important way people create reciprocity and show their friends they care. Plus, even the littlest kids seem to love giving: In a 2012 study, researchers reported that toddlers appeared happier when they gave treats to a puppet than when they received a treat themselves. Lara Aknin, a professor of social psychology at Simon Fraser University and one of the authors of that study, told me that a growing body of research shows that “kids overwhelmingly prefer to give than receive.”

Goody bags are, in theory, a low-stakes way for children to practice gift-giving. But for kids to gain any of the benefits, they need to at least participate in picking out the items and putting the bags together. Much of the time, parents seem to be the ones doing all the work. Even if kids are involved in the process, the bags still run the risk of feeling more perfunctory than personal, as though the primary goal is to check an item off the to-do list.

I’d like to propose an alternative: Dispense with goody bags, and replace them with other types of party favors. Goody bags full of quick-grab, mass-produced plastic are obviously convenient for harried parents, but they also reinforce the idea that celebrations are about the accumulation of stuff. Small, thoughtfully chosen or homemade favors have the potential to do so much more—to let kids take the lead and learn how, by investing time into their friends, they can actually strengthen their relationships.

The broader world of gift-giving advice suggests what this could look like. And because party favors are small, they offer givers more flexibility to try something unconventional. For example, kids could draw pictures or make treats. When Aknin’s son’s friend was 4 years old, he took this approach, collecting pine cones for all of his guests; now, at age 7, he has graduated to making word-search puzzles (tailored to his friends’ specific interests) and personalized bracelets. But even an invitation to hang out again, perhaps paired with a gift card to a local lunch spot, could do the trick.

My friends had suggestions too. For instance, one friend, Jill, told me that at her daughter Harper’s eighth birthday party, instead of offering goody bags to guests, Harper and her friends filled bags with food, relay-race style, to donate to families struggling with food insecurity. Another friend, Kristin, was inspired by our conversation to turn her 3-year-old’s birthday into a toy swap. My kids traded away a couple of books, and Kristin’s daughter gave them a puzzle they’d enjoyed at her house; the fact that she remembered what they liked to play with made them feel noticed.

Last year, for my kids’ fourth birthday, I told guests that we were having a “no gifts” party, including no goody bags. But I’ve since realized that my children might want the chance to thank their friends for being part of their lives. So this year, I’ll leave it to them to offer a party favor of their choice: maybe handmade cards, maybe the promise to meet up at their favorite ice-cream spot. I’m pretty sure they’ll pick the ice cream. But what matters is that they’re the ones who get to decide.

            <div id="article-text">As president, George Washington received visitors once a week, for exactly half an hour. These “levees,” as they were called, were not loose occasions. Washington stood by the fireplace in a dining room cleared of its chairs. Dressed in a black velvet suit, hair powdered, hat in hand, he greeted guests with a formal bow. Handshakes, familiar and egalitarian, were prohibited. Conversation was sparse. The president, per Alexander Hamilton’s instructions, might talk “cursorily on indifferent subjects,” but nothing more. Then, after having been seen by the guests, he was to promptly “disappear.”

If little was said at Washington’s levees, much was said about them, beginning with the fact that the entire practice was imported from the royal courts of Europe. For Hamilton and others close to Washington, this was precisely the point. The public needed to appreciate the full “dignity of the office,” a goal best accomplished by setting a “high tone in the demeanour of the Executive.”

For those opposed to Washington’s administration, the tone was entirely too high. The president’s bows were aloof and stiff. The guests were sycophantic, exhibiting the “cringing servility” of courtiers. All of it reeked of royalty. After attending a levee in December 1790, Senator William Maclay of Pennsylvania confessed to his diary the hope that Washington might just die. “If there is treason in the wish, I retract it,” he wrote. But if the president “were in Heaven,” he continued, “we would not then have him brought forward as the constant cover to every unconstitutional and irrepublican act.”

A senator in 1790 would seem to have had larger worries than the choreography of presidential receptions. The United States was deeply in debt, vulnerable on the international stage, and operating under a new, controversial Constitution. But to Maclay and his opponents alike, great problems of policy were inseparable from small matters of ritual. Some, like Hamilton, strained for legitimacy in the rites and practices of monarchy. Others feared the dire effects of what Maclay derided as “all the fooleries, fopperies, fineries, and pomp of royal etiquette.”

From the October 2015 issue: America’s fragile Constitution

Washington, of course, would come to be remembered for his restraint—his reluctance to take power, his keen awareness of his own stature, and his willingness to step away after two terms. Yet in the moment, none of that felt assured, and his presidency was marked by a fierce struggle over symbols and ceremonies—over how nearly a republic should allow its first president to resemble the monarch it had only recently cast off.

It was not hard to imagine Washington as a king. Many Americans already did, if not exactly in title. Going back to the early years of the Revolution, Washington occupied the position left vacant by the English monarch, one George succeeding another. In October 1775, the poet Phillis Wheatley concluded an ode she sent him, “A crown, a mansion, and a throne that shine, / With gold unfading, WASHINGTON! Be thine.” Wheatley made her offer before he’d even succeeded in expelling the British from Boston. The triumph of the War of Independence would only affirm his elevation; Americans adapted monarchical practices such as celebrating the leader’s birthday and singing “God Save Great Washington.”

Still, some worried that the indispensable man was too indispensable. The people, John Adams noted during the war, had come to “idolize an image which their own hands have molten.” When Washington famously refused the power that could have come with such popular esteem, the move only elevated that esteem. In the 1780s, one Mary Meanwell told a Philadelphia newspaper, “I respect our great general, but let us not make a GOD of him.”

The ambiguities surrounding Washington haunted the Constitution’s definition of the presidency. At the Convention in 1787, during which Benjamin Franklin noted “a natural inclination in mankind to kingly government,” the very suggestion of an executive seemed a provocation in light of the Revolution. Washington’s presence there, however, gave the delegates confidence to endow the presidency with vague and expansive powers. As one wrote, the Constitution would not have bestowed such great authority on the executive “had not many of the members cast their eyes toward General Washington, and shaped their ideas of the powers to be given a President by their opinions of his virtue.”

The ratification of the Constitution in 1788 and Washington’s unanimous election the following year did little to resolve the tensions around the man and the office. As he prepared to leave for New York City, then the capital, following his election, his former aide James McHenry told him, “You are now a king, under a different name.” Washington’s journey to New York affirmed the sentiment. He was greeted everywhere with the peals of church bells, the firing of cannons, and cheers of “Long live George Washington,” a royalist acclamation repeated by the official who administered the oath of office to him. Washington was sensitive enough to the implications of such fanfare that he included (and later cut, at James Madison’s suggestion) an assurance in his inaugural address that, because he was childless, he could have no heirs to his power.

If the public seemed ready to crown him, Congress was forced to confront what that might mean in practice. After the inauguration, the Senate was snarled for nearly a month on the mere question of what to call the president. Whatever misgivings Adams may have previously entertained about Washington’s lofty status, he told his colleagues that “a royal or at least princely title will be found indispensably necessary to maintain the reputation, authority, and dignity of the President.” Human minds, Adams said, simply could not recognize authority “without a Splendor and Majesty, in some degree.” Adams argued for “His Highness” or “His Most Benign Highness” at the minimum; others suggested possibilities including “His Majesty” and “His Elective Highness.”

From the November 2025 issue: What the Founders would say now

Similar anxieties surfaced in 1792, as the House considered what symbols should represent the new government on its coins. When Hamilton moved to create the United States Mint, he argued that coins were “vehicles of useful impressions” and that they ought to be “emblematical” in their use of symbols. The implication was hardly in doubt. Washington, the most powerful national emblem, had already appeared on privately issued coins and would of course grace the first national coins under the new Constitution. When the matter came before the House of Representatives, a fierce opposition noted that putting living people on coins was the stuff of flattery and the “idolatrous practice of monarchies,” or, perhaps worse, the tyrants of ancient Rome. One congressman suggested that Washington should sooner cut off his own hand than sign a bill that would see his likeness on a coin, a move that would put him in the company of Nero and Caligula.

As it happened, Washington didn’t have to choose between signing the bill and cutting off his hand. The House defeated the measure, and the now-familiar female figure of liberty found her way onto American coins. Nor was Washington ever addressed as “His Highness” or, as he reportedly preferred, “His High Mightiness, the President of the United States and Protector of Their Liberties.” Despite the wishes of Adams (whom opponents came to call “His Rotundity” during the debate), the Senate ultimately settled on the spare and republican address that we still use: “Mr. President.”

The fights over who and what Washington was continued to define his presidency, and many in the public still celebrated him as something like a king. But determined opposition, combined with Washington’s own restraint, tamed the presidency’s regal inheritance. Adams, Washington’s successor, possessed monarchical impulses, but not a monarchical aura. His pretensions—riding around in a grand coach and continuing the weekly levees—as well as his administration’s notorious effort to enforce deference in the 1798 Sedition Act, fell flat. His failure cleared the way for Thomas Jefferson, who rejected royal trappings altogether. He walked to his inauguration, abandoned formal receptions, and favored plain dress.

From the October 1996 issue: Thomas Jefferson, radical and racist

Jefferson’s triumph was so complete that the conflict over Washington’s image and authority is largely forgotten. Although Americans continue to debate the extent of presidential authority, they take for granted the unassuming republican rituals of power. Now, though levees may not exactly be back, royal affectations and the disputes that go with them are. The Oval Office has been got up in Louis Quatorze decor. Meetings there unfold with throne-room theater—Donald Trump seated at his desk, with visitors made to stand beside him in supplication. At Trump’s orders, the East Wing is giving way to a massive ballroom, funded through courtly patronage, while the mint contemplates a $1 coin with his likeness.

When the House debated putting Washington’s visage on a coin in 1792, Representative John Page of Virginia called for “republican cautions” against such kingly notions. Members of Congress had a duty, he said, to “keep the eyes of their constituents open, and to watch over their liberties” before they were lost. Such vigilance has mostly been absent from the current Congress. The deference with which that body has bowed to presidential fiat would make Page and William Maclay shudder. We unlearned the habits of monarchy once; we may need to do it again.

            <h2>The Giant, Voracious Sea Lions That Humans Cannot Stop</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/01/sea-lion-salmon-euthanasia-columbia-river/685523/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Of all the schemes that humans have devised to keep sea lions from gorging on the salmon of the Columbia River basin, none has worked for long. Local officials and researchers have chased sea lions with boats and peppered them with rubber bullets; they’ve detonated noisy explosives. They’ve outfitted the docks where the animals like to rest with uncomfortable spinners, electrified mats, flailing tube men, and motion-activated sprinklers. (“Very surprisingly, they don’t like to get wet on land,” Casey Clark, a marine-mammal biologist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, told me.) At one point, the Port of Astoria dispatched a 32-foot fiberglass replica of sea lions’ primary predator, the orca, outfitted with real orca sounds, that almost immediately capsized. Scientists have captured sea lions and released them thousands of miles away, as far as Southern California. No matter the tactic, the result is largely the same: Within weeks, or sometimes even hours, the sea lions swim right back.

The waterways of the Columbia River basin, full of dams that corral salmon in tight spaces, are just too easy of a hunting ground for the sea lions to spurn. In especially hard-hit sections of the Columbia River, sea lions have eaten close to half of the spring Chinook run. “That’s a devastating amount of fish,” Jeremy Cram, the salmon-recovery coordinator at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, told me—both for the region’s highly vulnerable fish and for the humans who want to catch and eat them.

So in recent years, officials made sea-lion removals more permanent, which is to say, more deadly. Since 2020, the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, as well as a handful of local tribes, have trapped and euthanized more than 200 sea lions in and around the Columbia River—and have still fallen short of the limits allowed by federal law. With sea lions still eating thousands of salmon each spring at sites such as the Bonneville Dam, near Portland, some local fishers, tribal members, and politicians are pushing for the mammals’ body count to rise. “Ask yourself: Why? Why are these numbers so small?” Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, who represents Washington’s Third Congressional District, said at a hearing about the sea lions last month.

Not everyone agrees that more kills are needed. But at this point, all else has failed. To preserve the region’s salmon, more sea lions must go.

Sea lions have never been salmon’s primary threat: That honor belongs to us. More than a century of overfishing, industrialization, and hatchery mismanagement has brought several populations of salmon and their close relative the steelhead to critically low levels in the Pacific Northwest. To spawn, salmon must swim hundreds or even thousands of miles upstream from the ocean, and in the Columbia River and its many tributaries, their path is obstructed by a massive network of hydroelectric dams. Ladders can help fish circumvent these obstacles, but learning to navigate them can take the animals days. In a highly built world, salmon have a far harder time reproducing and surviving than they used to have.

Over the past 40 years, the United States has poured $9 billion into reversing the basin’s salmon and steelhead declines and currently spends more on those efforts than on any other endangered animal in the country. But efforts to mitigate human harms—restricting harvests, remodeling dams, breeding salmon in hatcheries—are yielding diminishing returns. Climate change has made habitat-restoration efforts more challenging, as have pollution from pesticides and even toxic tire dust. Conservationists aim to restore the annual number of returning adult salmon and steelhead to 5 million, but the population, on average, has been stagnant at around 2 million for decades.

Rehabilitating a river can take years to produce an effect, but cull a few sea lions from a dam, “and there’s a benefit the next day,” Clark said. In 2017, winter steelhead populations at Oregon’s Willamette Falls seemed almost certain to soon go extinct, Michael Brown, the marine-mammal program leader at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, told me. But after agency officials euthanized 33 adult male sea lions at the falls, the number of steelhead reaching their destination went from hundreds to thousands.

Plus, killing a handful of sea lions can steer many more away from a site. In the same way that they quickly deduce that tube men can’t hurt them (in fact, some animals end up simply cuddling the warm fans that power them), sea lions notice when their peers venture upstream and fail to come back. After the lethal removals at Willamette Falls and the Bonneville Dam began, far fewer sea lions returned to the sites than the number that researchers expected. Nathan Pamplin, the director of external affairs at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, told me the department estimates that sea-lion removal costs $203 for each fish saved—pricey, but no more expensive than other salmon-recovery efforts.

Still, the process of lethal removal is cumbersome. Under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, sea lions must be euthanized by a trained professional—a process that requires trapping the animals, which can weigh up to 2,000 pounds, then herding them onto a barge for transfer to a nearby facility. Robert DeLong, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researcher who has studied sea lions for decades, told me that removal teams, which must activate the traps manually, could at first snare the animals during daylight hours. But some sea lions began sneaking out before the sun rose, requiring teams to entrap and handle them under low-light conditions—“a human-safety issue,” he said. A crew of about eight people, working from around 4:30 a.m. until the early afternoon, might be able to trap, kill, and necropsy just two to five sea lions in this manner, Doug Hatch, a fisheries scientist at the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, told me.

Gluesenkamp Perez told me she thinks the sea-lion-removal process should be simpler. Her preferred alternative is firearms—“engaging with these animals as animals, and not treating it like a petting zoo,” she said. Currently, shooting sea lions is illegal, but that hasn’t stopped locals from trying. Of the many sea-lion corpses that DeLong has necropsied for research, “the majority of those animals have pieces of buckshot or bird shot or rifle slugs in their musculature,” he told me. In the mid-aughts, Hatch said, firearms were quickly dismissed as a removal method at the Bonneville Dam because using them would have meant shutting down the interstate highway that runs past the dam, as well as clearing people out of the site, which is open to the public. But some tribes in the Pacific Northwest have been discussing using firearms to harvest sea lions and other pinnipeds for subsistence, as Alaskan Natives do, Cecilia Gobin, a conservation-policy analyst at the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, told me. Ultimately, Gobin argues, like Gluesenkamp Perez does, “If we are going to take these animals, the most humane way seems to be not to trap them, remove them to some off-site location, and euthanize them, but to have more of a targeted kill.”

Before the Marine Mammal Protection Act passed, in 1972, sea lions were in trouble, too. Years of overfishing had depleted their prey, and humans killed them for sustenance or in disputes over fish. But over the past half century, many local populations have rebounded, in large part by chasing their favorite foods inland.

The fact that sea lions are faring better than salmon has made it easier for humans to side with the fish. But regardless, salmon seem to hold more intrinsic value to us. In the state of Washington alone, the annual salmon harvest is worth roughly $14 million. Many Pacific Northwest tribes have subsisted on the fish for millennia and have woven them into their religions and languages. The right to harvest fish is enshrined in their treaties, but “there’s no way that somebody can sustain themselves as a fisher anymore,” Aja DeCoteau, the executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, told me. Some tribes in the region that traditionally hold First Salmon feasts to welcome the arrival of spring salmon from the ocean have waited for their catch in vain, forcing them to ask other tribes to donate a fish, Gobin said.

Sea lions are also ecologically essential, but not as much as salmon are. Researchers estimate that roughly 140 other species depend on salmon for food; among them are the Pacific Northwest’s critically endangered southern resident orcas—making sea-lion removals “management of a protected species to benefit a protected species, which may then benefit a protected species,” Clark told me.

From the July 1946 issue: The salmon rise

By law, the number of sea lions that can be lethally removed from the Columbia River basin is far below the number that researchers think would impede the animals’ recovery. But some scientists are hesitant to scale up to even those allowable levels. Although sea lions do appear to be measurably depleting salmon at some sites, including the Bonneville Dam and Willamette Falls, the evidence is shakier elsewhere in the region. Plus, removing sea lions from this delicate system may simply allow another predator to swoop in, including the many birds and other fish that also prey on salmon working their way through ladders. Alejandro Acevedo-Gutiérrez, a biologist at Western Washington University, told me he worries that pinnipeds have become an inadvertent scapegoat for salmon’s larger issues, simply because sea-lion-on-salmon predation events—loud, violent affairs in which the mammal beats the fish on the surface of the water, then noisily gnaws its flesh—are more visible than the effects of climate change.

Perhaps the sea lions’ greatest crime is indulging in salmon that humans would rather be feasting on. “We invested so much into all of this,” John North, the deputy fish-division administrator at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, told me. Decades of work and billions of dollars deep into salmon recovery, humans cannot allow the fish’s comeback to fall apart just because hungry sea lions have swum too far upstream. But salmon protection has never been only about keeping the fish safe. If salmon levels rebound, we can and will eat more of them, Cram said: “The real predator that those fish would go to is us.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ayear ago, I can remember exactly where I was standing when I was considering a familiar but newly significant question in the aisles of Santa Monica’s Angel City Books & Records. I was holding a slender, charmingly illustrated volume from 1938 called Carmen: The Story of Bizet’s Opera. Should I buy it or leave it behind?

I had weighed that exact yes-or-no question untold thousands of times across my 60-some years of book collecting. This time was different. Weeks earlier, excepting a few hastily grabbed items, my entire collection of something like 4,000 volumes, acquired one by one over all those decades, had turned to smoke and ash in the Palisades fire. The question before me was not just about this particular book, but about whether it made sense, in my late 70s, to begin collecting all over again.

I’d owned so many books in so many collecting areas that no one but me knew the extent of what I’d had, and even I’d forget the specifics from time to time. My film-book collection, no surprise given my nearly 30-year stint as a Los Angeles Times film critic, covered an entire wall. But I also had shelves upon shelves of hard-boiled crime fiction, including an impeccably jacketed first edition of James M. Cain’s The Postman Always Rings Twice. I had many shelves more of Yiddish literature in translation, with an emphasis on Isaac Bashevis Singer, who’d personally signed a copy of his Nobel Prize speech to me.

There were also hundreds of Grosset & Dunlap’s Photoplay editions, books about the history of Montana (my wife’s home state), and the many volumes I’d bought while researching my joint biography of MGM titans Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg. Then there were the one-off books I’d gotten because they had spoken to me. A first edition of George Eliot’s philo-Semitic Daniel Deronda; a colorful jacketed first of Zane Grey’s Rogue River Feud, bought to celebrate a family boat trip; a book on avian diseases by Robert Stroud, the “Birdman of Alcatraz.” All of it gone, suddenly, overnight. Book blogs mourned my loss, a distinction that was both affirming and heartrending.

Read: The house where 28,000 records burned

My books had almost defined me, providing comfort and order in a chaotic world. Almost a year on, I find myself fantasizing that my collection still exists in another dimension, like a book heaven, intact but eternally out of reach.

Perhaps the fire had been a sign, the universe trying to teach me about the impermanence of objects and the futility of collecting. Maybe the virtuous minimalists who mocked possessions were right. I’d read stories of people using the fire as an opportunity to start over. One couple we knew found in their loss a chance to live in central Paris—where, Notre Dame notwithstanding, the potential for a catastrophic fire was close to nil.

My wife and I were planning to stay in West Los Angeles, which made the prospect of collecting again feel like rebuilding a house in a floodplain. I was also a lot older than my late friend Ricky Jay had been when, at 45, he began a new collection of magic-related memorabilia after he lost an earlier one. Regardless of how much time I had, I knew I would never be able to replace the many one-of-a-kind items I had so lovingly amassed, such as a gorgeous Soviet first of Isaac Babel’s Red Cavalry in a custom clamshell case.

All of this and more went through my head in that should-I-or-shouldn’t-I moment in the Santa Monica bookstore.

The book in question was not particularly rare or noteworthy, but something about it appealed to me. Finally, I listened to my emotions: I wanted it, I could afford it, so I went ahead and bought it. I’d deal with those larger questions later.

But I didn’t ponder; I didn’t reckon; I simply kept buying. On a long-planned trip to New Zealand a couple of months later, I skipped trekking and camping and took in the country’s exemplary used-book stores instead. I found a Bashevis Singer book that had started its journey in a Singapore bookstore, or so the imprint on its elaborate plastic dust jacket claimed. I replaced some of my incinerated Anthony Trollopes with an Everyman’s Library set of his beloved Chronicles of Barsetshire—though the cost of shipping these six volumes home made the frugal Wellington dealer blanch.

One of my oldest friends, an artist in Greece who collects inexpensive paperbacks with vivid covers, parted with “the prize” of his own collection—a beautiful Penguin edition of Cain’s Serenade—to help me along with mine. He wrote that he hoped that the book would serve as “a kind of ‘talisman’” for me, “carrying with it all the best into the future.” A friend in Los Angeles returned the copy of Babel’s Benia Krik: A Film-Novel that I had given him years earlier. Dealers I knew offered discounts, subsidies, even books for free. In December, a box of books arrived unexpectedly from our legendary Montana landscaper and tree specialist, who’d heard about our loss and wanted to “help build back” our library.

These touching gestures reminded me that books were restorative, bringers of joy as well as knowledge. They recalled a talk I once gave to book collectors at UCLA, in which I invoked the Jewish concept of tikkun olam, the restoration of a shattered world. Though book collecting is often a solitary activity, I came to see that gathering so many voices and far-flung volumes into a unified collection is “a way to heal the world one book at a time.”

Gifts from friends and colleagues also forced more practical considerations about what I actually wanted for this new collection, and where I would put it. Among the first pieces of furniture we got for our new rental home were sizable bookcases. Yet they are still modest compared with what I was used to, and I didn’t want to fill them up too quickly. My previous collecting goals had been encyclopedic, but this “the more the merrier” aesthetic would now be impractical, for reasons of both space and time.

Casting about for inspiration about a sustaining collecting path, I remembered an impulse purchase made just after returning from New Zealand: The Miniature Library of Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House, a book that describes everything you ever wanted to know about the nearly 600 miniature books, none taller than a few centimeters in the renowned dollhouse created in the 1920s for the wife of King George V. This tiny library, which had gardening books, the complete works of Shakespeare, and some 200 handwritten volumes by the likes of Thomas Hardy and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, was not meant to be comprehensive. It was meant to “reflect the literary landscape of the time.”

Though no one is handwriting any books for me, tiny or otherwise, this dollhouse library helped me see how to proceed. My new collection would be spare and potent, a miniature version of my former enormity.

Read: ‘I’ve never seen anything like this’

I turned to stalwart websites such as Bookfinder to locate works that had been particularly painful to lose, including Abraham Joshua Heschel’s magisterial The Sabbath and Alfred Kazin’s memory piece A Walker in the City. I replaced old friends and made new ones. My miniature Montana collection, which fits snugly on a single shelf, mixes beloved classics such as The Last Best Place anthology with newfound gems, including Copper Camp: Lusty Story of the Richest Hill on Earth, a colorful 1943 history of the booming mining town of Butte.

If a shelf becomes too tight, I feel more comfortable culling now than I ever had been before the fire. There turned out to be something satisfying about the discipline involved in creating a personally meaningful collection within these constraints.

The damage of loss, of course, is not so easily overcome. Whenever I see a photograph in a newspaper or magazine of someone else’s still-intact library, I wince and have to turn the page, and it will be that way for a while. But when I enter my office and experience my new collection, admiring the trimness and focus of what I’ve done, I feel something like the calm I felt before.

The fire did not release me to become someone else. It did not liberate me from my past so that I could try on a new kind of life. Instead, it helped me see what it is about my life and myself that I very much want to keep, regardless of the circumstances. And it turns out that managing to stay myself amid the chaos of the past year was more of an accomplishment than I’d realized. Maybe not miraculous, but something of value nevertheless.</div>

I only buy mice that have all configuration in the mouse itself and do not require any app or driver on the computer. Since I use both Linux and Windows machines via a KVM switch, that was a really easy decision. It was harder finding ones that match that requirement.

Obviously you need software, like a mouse driver.But, shouldn&#39;t all these features essentially be buttons. Shouldn&#39;t the OS be providing standardized interface to this?

I left windows for linux such a long time ago that news like this confuse me...

I was thinking about changing my phone, the first thing I wanted to know how to avoid AI, how to disable AI, how to make sure there is no AI on my equipment. Thank you.

Not possible. Even the slowest processor can run AI algorithms, just a lot slower. No way to avoid it.

Browsers and apps can run simple inference or access remote services. This shit is going to be everywhere.

A tech company with some early displays of a return to common sense.

That&#39;s mostly true.  I&#39;ve run some LLMs locally: they&#39;re slow and not very powerful, but there are times when having it local is nice for privacy.

I do expect this to change over time, with more operations being practical to run locally.  I would really like to have voice input be a local task, for example.

If I am getting a device that is AI enabled, what do I get? Does it do more for me? Not right now as a far as I can tell. I don&#39;t have any apps that require AI running on my device. It&#39;s because with AI the industry is putting the cart before the horse. If you buy the next gen graphics card or double memory, you know what the result is going to be. What if your device comes with an NPU? What capability does that bring to the device for a consumer? I&#39;m a techie and I know what a NPU does, but I have no reaso

            <div id="article-text">This is why it&#39;s so important to use Windows with a local-only login, if you must use Windows.

They&#39;re continuously making it harder to set up a new Windows computer without a Microsoft account.  At this point, someone without extensive experience and patience would be unable to do it.

Yes, they&#39;re making it almost impossible to do, but you can set it up with a Microsoft account then immediately create a local-only account, if necessary.

I disagree. What it needs is some patience and time. But it does not need deep understanding of Windows to do it. Yes, you may have to try several things and Windows installation is still surprisingly clunky and incredibly slow. But given what you win, investing a couple of  hours into it is well worth the time.

Really?  I have done just fine: what I do is have OneDrive (and Google Drive) as the default locations for my data.  There have been occasions when I&#39;ve had to move things from one laptop to another, and having it all on OneDrive saves me the trouble of moving things there.  Only thing I have to do is install the applications that I used on the old computer over to the new one.  Oh, and I back all of that up on an SSD, just in case....

The other thing that people miss is that OneDrive is not a backup: it&#39;s

The TikTok that prompted the original article doesn&#39;t provide any screenshots, and I can&#39;t replicate the behavior he says happened. If you disable OneDrive Backup it clearly and simply asks you where you want to keep your files - online or local.

I understand everyone wants to hate the evil empire, but there are plenty of legitimate reasons to do so. You don&#39;t have to make stuff up.

If you have no problem with all your files being known to and used by Microsoft and being hung out to dry when their cloud has problems (again), sure.

Exactly. No such crap without a regular MS account. The additional work to install without MS account is well worth it for reliably disabling One Drive alone. Apparently other methods of disabling OneDrive are not reliable or complex.

Microsoft is really deep into enshittification these days. The crap they pull is incredible. In a sane world they would have no customers.

makes me so fucking angry... i mean it&#39;s already obviously illegal under existing laws, except that the legal system is too fucking stupid to recognize it

it&#39;s called theft, and just because it&#39;s happening on a computer doesn&#39;t mean that doesn&#39;t apply.  it&#39;s in my house, you&#39;re not allowed to come in and take shit.  Words cannot describe the level of contempt this deserves

OneDrive wouldn&#39;t really be an effective synchronized cloud storage service if it didn&#39;t replicate a deletion.

Rather than resolving the issue by deleting files and expecting it to magically know that you&#39;re only looking to delete the online copies, you need to make sure all files are kept locally and then disable the backup (or remove your account from OneDrive). It won&#39;t delete the local files then.

I&#39;m not defending Microsoft&#39;s pushy attitude at all; that sucks.

Rather than resolving the issue by deleting files and expecting it to magically know that you&#39;re only looking to delete the online copies, you need to make sure all files are kept locally and then disable the backup And hope that a future update doesn&#39;t re-enable the backup.

cloud services, generally, are retarded at the consumer level - i can manage my own files, thanks fuckheads

Good. Because that&#39;s exactly the way it behaves, and needs to be called out as.

I have long ago moved my personal folders OUT of the stock provided directories (photos, documents, etc), initially out of convenience as I had a D: drive and wanted to keep stuff there rather than on the OS drive, but more recently it&#39;s been advantageous to stop MS from snooping around and trying to auto index my content for personal reasons or even auto-move it to OneDrive.

The most irritating thing about this is the repeated advertisements on the start bar that I can&#39;t block (Hey!  LIssen!  Time to backup

OneDrive has been around a lot longer than the technology being marketed as AI.

It doesn&#39;t delete your files when you turn it off either. At least, it never has in my experience. When you disable OneDrive backup, it clearly asks you where you want the files to be kept. If you remove your account entirely, it leaves all local files in place. I find it really interesting that the TikTok at the root of the original article has no demonstration of the supposed behavior. It&#39;s just some dude ranting. I&#39;d really li

The funny part of this is - OneDrive on MacOS is great. Seamless. Runs in the background. No issues. OneDrive on Linux - also great! Seamless. Runs in the background. Totally invisible. Never given me ANY issues at all.

It would be tragic if it wasn&#39;t so terribly funny.

I need a new computer and it is definitely going to be a Linux machine.

I still have no MS account on my 3 remaining Win11 installations. One of the direct benefits is that OneDrive does not work and does not mess with your files. I would remain without MS account even if that was the only benefit, because it is a pretty significant one.

Incidentally, if you pronounce &quot;OneDrive&quot; in German, it essentially becomes &quot;ohne Drive&quot;, which means &quot;without drive&quot;. Fitting somehow.

The entire point is you can argue over the definition, so if there&#39;s an argument to be had, what do you expect when betting on it? One can&#39;t argue about a number, but we can sure argue over what is the definition of the word &quot;invasion&quot;. Yet another reason why prediction markets are bound for shit like this. I cannot imagine why somebody would choose to bet over something in which the book holder gets to decide what constitutes a successful prediction (I mean, other than being a compulsive gambler, of course .. just another industry taking advantage of people who have problems to exploit)

Also for these open ended predictions, &#39;insider knowledge&#39; is supremely likely to get gamed...

If you have orders to get ready to strike a country, well then you can turn that knowledge around pretty easily...

It&#39;s hard enough to contend with insider knowledge in more regulated contexts, it&#39;s just utterly impossible in these sorts of offerings.

right now the control is still in the same people, it just changed the president...Even if the USA manage to change the government, without troops in the ground to control it, that also do not match a invasion, that is just pressure to a peaceful  government change (or a civil war if it is not that peaceful)

so i&#39;m on the Polymarket &quot;side&quot; (not that i support betting, i actually think it is the most dump thing to do and everyone that bets deserve to lose their money always)

Even if the USA manage to change the government, without troops in the ground to control it, that also do not match a invasion,There were troops on the ground.  They just left already.  Presumably what Polymarket intended the word &quot;invade&quot; to mean is &quot;occupy&quot;, i.e. invade the country and then continue to keep troops there long-term to stabilize the country.  However, as a general matter of law, the word &quot;invade&quot; does not require occupation, but rather occurs when you have two factors: entry and enmity. Entry: The presence of foreign troops on another country&#39;s soil.  Clearly, U.S. troops were on Venezuelan soil, because they captur

I am seeing the definition of invasion being to occupy or subjugate and Cheeto Benito says we&#39;re going to run Venezuela, so the latter absolutely applies.

In the best case this is a ploy to unmask the anonymous bettor, who they believe had inside information. In order to get paid they will have to sue, and then their identity will be revealed. If the other bets don&#39;t amount to a hill of beans compared to that 400k, it&#39;s a good plan.

hey, money talks! no one wants to lose the american market access... or be a target for Trump ego... all will fade away after Trump lose next elections anyway

Also, central/south america is USA playground, just as old URSS countries are Russia playground. Ukraine would never happened if Europe and USA didn&#39;t see Russia as fragile and weak... but they were not that weak after all (and also not as strong as they imagine themselves too)

With Russia busy, Europe economically dependent of the USA, we have China...

Refusing to to unload American flagged ships at your ports would be one way countries to react. Cancellation of business licenses of American-owed corporations is another. I think ultimately countries would have to act in concert to avoid retaliation. If Yemen does it, that&#39;s not going to be effective. If Belgium or Australia does it, then there is potentially a peaceful resolution. Even a week long boycott on trade with the US would disrupt supply chains enough to make some important people sweat.

that base is useless to start any attack, it is mostly radar stationon the other hand, Greenland have so few people that a few helis and naval unload are enough for a military take over

Now calling NATO to respond to one attack could be possible, it could require USA expulsion first... but the UK nukes are really controlled by USA, i suspect UK would never vote for it (UK is really a vassal of USA at this point)

According to International law, crossing the border of a sovereign nation with a military force and conducting an operation constitutes an invasion.

Insurance policies have definitions to refer to.Invasion is bit vague.  In common English, an invasion can mean something larger, intending to take territory, as Polymarket says.  Its not a word I&#39;d have used for what happened.But in formal legal and military language an invasion is &quot;the unconsented entry of one state&#39;s armed forces into the territory of another.&quot;So unless they defined it otherwise, it *was* an invasion.

One of the things that makes these such Interesting Times is that while your statement would normally make perfect sense, these days the government has a financial conflict of interest in this situation, so I think they should be completely disqualified from defining anything!

They&#39;re just addicted to the scams, they can&#39;t stop skimming money no matter how much they make.  It&#39;s never enough, greed to the point that it&#39;s a medical condition.  These people were already millionaires/billionaires.

Trumps crypto venture is the POTUS building their own bribery system, Trump Jr started a &quot;club&quot; that charges $500k for access to the cabinet, Jared Kushner both gets to negotiate on behalf of the nation while also making international deals all while not having an actual job, unconfirmed.

... bettors will object to this decision.

At least not yet.  There was a military action, sure.  No different than all of the Presidents in the last 20+ years have done in places like Syria, Yemen, etc.  It&#39;s military action, not an occupying force.  Just because the U.S. is telling the current Venezuelan government what to do (&quot;run Venezuela&quot;,) does not mean we have invaded.

I know some people don&#39;t like to distinguish this because it&#39;s inconvenient for some people&#39;s narrative, but there is no objective way one can considers this action an invasion

invasion: an instance of invading a country or region with an armed force

invasion: an instance of invading a country or region with an armed force

As USA&#39;s putin-in-charge puts it, &quot;special military operation&quot; was biggly successful but all bets are off about what next.

Has Trump said they invaded Venezuela? Or any of his cabinet? Has the term been used?

Here&#39;s my question in all this - why is Venezuela doing anything he asks? How has he &#39;gained control&#39; of the country, and as he says, is going to &#39;run it for a while&#39;?

Sure, he kidnapped their leader, but the rest of their country remains untouched.

What happens if they say no to Trump? The US kidnaps the next in charge as well?

How long will this be tolerated by the rest of the world?

If someone kidnapped Trump, does that mean

Trump should do the same thing in the USA. Free bleached yellow toupees so people can look like him.

Propecia is a lower dose of the drug they use to neuter sex offenders.  It can crush libido and cause erectile disfunction and depression, and the affects are permanent for a lot of people even after they stop taking it.

Yeah, this is slashdot and we&#39;re all old and already bald.  So tell your kids not to mess with their hormones.

I&#39;m pretty sure this statement is false and the hormone that causes baldness in men has nothing to do with the reproductive system.

DHT is an offshoot of testosterone. DHT also plays a role in some of the same sexual functions and physiological processes as testosterone, but it’s actually much stronger. DHT can bind to an androgen receptor longer, increasing the impact of testosterone production throughout your body.

Brazilians don&#39;t even have it, and they famously can fuck just fine.

I&#39;m pretty sure this statement is false and the hormone that causes baldness in men has nothing to do with the reproductive system.It (DHT) actually affects fertility in men, though not always.I thought that was well-known and established.Maybe you&#39;re joking though.The hormone DHT definitely has a lot to do with the reproductive system and male secondary sexual characteristics.Eunuchs were known to have great hair and longer life spans.Some that are intersex, that have XY-chromosomes but look like women instead of men, have DHT-insensitivity.So, basically, without responding to that hormone, nobody would see any difference between you

Beware, I heard the project to port GrapheneOS to the Samsung Galaxy SmartToupee has run into a lot of driver problems.

But it will definitely keep you from getting laid!

Not really, no. I&#39;ve been balding since age 21 and was half bald by age 27. I still have some somewhat embarrasing pictures of that era. I started shaving my hair down to 5mm and less at age 29. My string of epic sex and affairs started almost a decade later at age 38 when I was basically bald and already had been for more than 10 years. It carries on until today.

If you&#39;re in shape, dress well, keep clean and your home stylish, wear some fitting and fashiona

I decided to look as ugly as possible, to grow my hair out and have an ugly skullet. Pretty much as a social experiment.

It absolutely is way easier getting laid now than ever.

Though they might confuse you not caring about being ugly, with having confidence.

Also, getting stronger compliments now about looks than ever by strange women, despite that.

And pretty much every guy I&#39;ve seen that&#39;ve done that, I see is being chased by women. (I bet most are totally repulsed though.) It sounds like a joke. It is prett

On Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Adela Flores de Maduro were arraigned in a federal courthouse in New York City on charges of drug trafficking, continuing what has been a stunning first few days of 2026. The criminal proceedings—and likely trial—ahead are sure to be rocky and closely watched around the world. How exactly, though, will the Justice Department’s charges against the Maduros play in a court of law? We talked to an expert to find out.

“This is not a trumped-up case. This appears to be a real solid indictment,” Adam Pollock, a former assistant attorney general of New York and now a managing partner of the law firm Pollock Cohen, told me. Pollock believes the U.S. government has built an impressive case against the Maduros, with the indictment suggesting there are cooperating witnesses, recordings of drug deals, and direct links between the Maduros and Venezuelan drug-trafficking networks.

Still, the disturbing and complex facts of the Maduros’ arrest—during an apparently illegal military raid of the country Maduro was leading—makes this case anything but a slam dunk. While entering a plea of not guilty on Monday, the Venezuelan leader told the court that he had been “kidnapped.” “I am innocent. I’m a decent man,” Maduro said during his arraignment. The couple did not seek bail, and were transferred to a New York City jail. Their next court hearing is on March 17.

What comes next? What are all of the charges the indictment makes? What kind of defense could the Maduros use? I spoke with Pollock to get some answers to these questions and to understand the full breadth of the DOJ’s indictment. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: After reading the entire indictment, how strong of a case do you think the DOJ has here against the Maduros?

Adam Pollock: This is a really robust indictment. You’re dealing with the Southern District of New York, the United States Attorney’s Office, which is a really serious office that doesn’t bring trumped-up political charges. If you compare this to the indictments of James Comey or Letitia James, that were super stamped-on details, very bare-bones, hard to know what the charges were. Why? Because those were vindictive political prosecutions. Here, we have a robust indictment full of detail, meetings, descriptions of events, and going back for, I think, almost two decades. And how do you get this information? You typically have to have either wiretaps or recording in the rooms, or what appears to be the case here is a witness who is cooperating.

There are quite a bit of allegations of actual meetings, payments, and involvement of the Maduros. This does not appear to be a case of him and his wife sitting up at the top of government and turning a blind eye to drug trafficking. To the contrary, there actually seems to be direct involvement.

Let’s start with Count 2, cocaine importation conspiracy. I was a little bit surprised here, because the State Department estimated 200 to 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela annually. That’s a lot of cocaine, but doesn’t strike me as a giant number. In general, the United States has had a long-held view that if you commit a crime abroad that affects Americans, then you’re subject to our jurisdiction. You can think about that in many areas, not just drugs, but financial crimes or child abuse. You can think of many areas where merely sitting abroad is not going to immunize you from the reach of American prosecution. And certainly we’ve had a long-held view that drug trafficking that affects Americans is subject to American jurisdiction. So that’s Count 2.

With Count 1, narcoterrorism conspiracy, basically what they are talking about is that the Maduro government apparently supported these rebel groups in Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia and the National Liberation Army. Those are designated terrorist groups within the United States, and it is long-standing American policy to oppose those groups and designate them as terrorists. The indictment is saying that the Maduro government supported them through helping them with drug trafficking. Count 3, possession of machine guns, sort of collapses back on itself and also gets to the question everyone’s asking: Is it lawful to arrest the sitting president of a country? Traditionally, there’s been a view in international law that it is not, and certainly that is a defense that Maduro will raise pretrial. In that trial, the United States is going to say that he was not the legitimate leader for two reasons. First, they’ll say Maduro was illegitimate because he was a drug trafficker—that is kind of a tautological argument, but it’s one that will be made. Second, they will say he stole the last two elections.

Is it lawful for heads of states to have armies that have machine guns? Probably. But if they’re really not legitimate heads of states, but actually drug traffickers, and they’re using those machine guns as part of a drug conspiracy, then that adds on as a charge. And then the last charge is the conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices, which is effectively, the same thing.

The indictment also charges Maduro’s son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra; two Venezuelan government officials; and a leader of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan transnational gang, as part of this narcoterrorism conspiracy. What exactly happens to them now?

Now you start to intersect politics with prosecution. Clearly there was a political motive to bring a large Army force to arrest Maduro and his wife. You don’t expect that a similar military operation would be mounted to arrest the other defendants. Instead, they’ll now lead a more constrained life, where they’ll need to be concerned that, if there’s a change of government, whether they’ll be continued to be protected if they travel abroad and where they can travel to. Life as an indicted felon is harsh, even if you’re abroad; you can kind of continue to live in sanctuary in Venezuela until the government changes. But eventually, there’s going to be a government, whether it’s next month or next year or next decade, that’s more friendly to the United States, and the United States will pressure that government to hand over the suspects.

Numerous times throughout the indictment, the DOJ references that the alleged crimes were committed as far back as 1999. Is there a statute of limitations the U.S. government has to work within? What should we make of this?

I noticed that, but the answer is not particularly anything to note, for two reasons. One is they’re going to argue that it’s an ongoing conspiracy. And second, even if they were unsuccessful in arguing that, they still have enough overt acts of the conspiracy within the statute limitation over the last five or six years.

What strategy do you think the prosecution will take and how do you expect the Maduros to defend themselves?

The latter is slightly more interesting, which is clearly the Maduros will argue that he should receive head-of-state immunity. They might argue that he was illegally kidnapped from Venezuela, but that’s a loser argument because the Supreme Court has been very clear since at least 1886. There is a case called Ker v. Illinois where the defendant was forcibly kidnapped from Peru and brought out to a U.S. Navy ship and then brought back to the United States for prosecution—sounds kind of familiar. The Supreme Court basically said that they’re not going to concern themselves with how the defendant reached the United States’ shores; as long as they’re here, they can be prosecuted. This Supreme Court has reaffirmed that time and time again. So can Maduro make that argument? Sure, but it’s going to lose. I think that he’ll have stronger grounds for making the head-of-state immunity argument, which is interesting when you consider ultimately how far can that argument take you. I guess to the Supreme Court, but what’s this conservative Supreme Court going to do with that? I wouldn’t expect great results for Maduro on that.

I think his best possible strategy is to challenge the evidence at trial. You’ve got to wonder; putting together a criminal drug-trafficking conspiracy case in Venezuela is a technically hard case to put together. They’ve got one cooperator, but you can cross-examine the cooperator, who’s cooperating in hopes of a more lenient sentence. Sounds like the prosecution has some recordings, and you can guess that they probably have some electronic intercepts, but my guess is that kind of old-fashioned trial defense is going to be their strategy here. Now, the prosecution strategy is the converse of that, which is roll up your sleeves and put on the evidence in the way that you would with any other drug conspiracy.

What happens next? How quickly do you foresee this case moving forward?

Not that long, although it depends a whole heck of a lot on how much evidence the government has collected. You’ll start to see that on the docket as the government makes disclosures of evidence to the defendants, known as discovery disclosures. There are cases where there are millions of pages and the defendant needs significant time to review millions of pages of emails, text messages, and listen to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. I suspect that this case is going to be light on paper, emails, and text messages, and my guess is there are not a ton of recordings, because it’s a bit more technologically challenging to get recordings in the room in drug deals in Venezuela. I think that this could be a case with relatively light evidence discovery, in which case you might see this go to trial within a year or so.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has a hard-earned skip in his step. After nearly a decade of obsequious, showy servility to the president he once warned would be the death knell of the Republican Party, Graham is getting what he wants: an interventionist Republican president merrily drawing up a list of baddies to take down, starting with captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Graham was one of the first to recognize, long ago, that Donald Trump’s policy views are determined mostly by the flattery of the last person to speak with him before a decision. For both of Trump’s presidencies, Graham has worked to flatter Trump at every turn, and to be the final person to do so. While Graham has his hands in a lot of policy jars, his passion is an interventionist foreign policy. That’s led to an ever-running proxy battle for Trump’s sympathies between himself and an ascendant noninterventionist “America First” foreign policy wing, as best represented in the Senate by Kentucky’s Rand Paul.

Graham couldn’t contain his glee on Sunday aboard Air Force One as he stood inches from Trump, shortly after the Venezuela operation.

The president was rattling through a list of countries in the Americas that would go down next. Mexico? “You have to do something with Mexico.” What about a mission in Colombia? “It sounds good to me.” And as for the big, bad hemispheric archnemesis of 70 years Cuba: “Looks like it’s ready for fall.”

“Yes!” Graham said, beaming with the glow of someone whose life had been leading to this very moment.

Aboard Air Force One, in his own remarks—which the president frequently interrupted with stray thoughts about how, for example, he would’ve taken out bin Laden before 9/11—Graham laid it on extra thick.

“We had Venezuela, we have Cuba, we have Colombia in our backyard. And these three countries have been condemned ever since I’ve been in politics,” Graham said. “Joe Biden put a $25 million bounty on Maduro’s head.” And “this commander in chief,” he added, “he did something people talked about doing.”

Graham isn’t just thinking about the “backyard” (a whole hemisphere), though. Also on Sunday—the senator was everywhere on Sunday—he appeared on Fox News with a message for another, more distant regime that he has long believed in changing. And he brought a prop.

“I pray and hope that 2026 will be”—here he paused to put on a baseball cap bearing the slogan he would then utter—“the year that we make Iran great again.”

Graham has been waiting for a moment like this for a while, ever since the failures of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars soured the public on the wisdom of nation-building. For a long time, Graham hitched his wagon to the celebrity of his friend and fellow hawk John McCain. Since McCain’s death, and with the rise of an isolationist element in the MAGA movement, Graham has been trying to work Trump in his direction. The kidnapping of one hostile foreign leader is, for Graham, a good start.

But not all is joyous in the Senate Republican conference. Just as much as Graham might sound as if he’s won the long fight for Trump’s foreign-policy orientation, Rand Paul is sounding as if he’s lost.

Paul reflected on Trump’s tenure Monday, speaking with reporters.

“Whenever I had misgivings about something else, I’d always come back and say, ‘Well, he’s the best we’ve ever had,’ much better than the Bushes, who were war-mad and wanted to be involved in all these crazy wars overseas and were going to make the world safe for democracy—I never liked any of that,” he said. “And I thought Trump was different. And so it disappoints me that he’s under the thrall of Lindsey Graham.

“There should be a law,” Paul continued, “that Lindsey Graham can only go to the White House every other week.”

How much credit does Graham give himself for persuading Trump to move in a more interventionist direction? I asked Graham this on Tuesday. He was smart enough not to bite, awarding credit for all critical thinking to the president.

“I’m just reinforcing what he told me in January 2025,” he said. “I had a talk with him. We have a drug caliphate in our backyard—look at it as a caliphate. Instead of complaining about it, let’s get rid of it. These are not, you know, unbeatable foes. And I think the American people would appreciate somebody finally stopping those who are poisoning Americans and making billions of dollars.” (Also: Get rid of Iran.)

Both Graham and Paul had throngs of reporters following them in the Capitol Tuesday, getting their sides of the long-running foreign-policy feud that had now swung dramatically in one direction. Paul was talking on the level of legality, and about how the administration’s arguments that Maduro’s capture was a law-enforcement operation, and thus not a military operation requiring congressional input, made no sense.

“If you say that we don’t have to declare war because this is a criminal” case, he told reporters, “it would basically be an argument you could go to any country where you had a beef, that you could get an indictment for them” and run a military operation to decapitate the state.

Rand Paul might have the law, but Lindsey Graham has Trump. I asked Graham if he felt that he had won the battle against Paul in favor of interventionism. Graham took issue with the term itself.

“This is not intervention,” he said. “This is protecting America. It’s not like ‘Hey, what are you doing today? Let’s go to Venezuela. Seems like nice beaches, good-looking people. Let’s take it.’ This is protecting America from threat.”

“Rand Paul”—he paused for a second and ever so slightly rolled his eyes, considering his words—“doesn’t believe that radical Islam is a threat. He would withdraw, he’d be America Fortress, America Fortress. There’d be no troops anywhere. Trump wants to protect the country.

“America First,” he summed it up, “is taking countries that hurt America and change them. Interventionism is going somewhere without a real good reason.”

That’s his story, and he’s sticking to it.

Since the demise of Roe v. Wade, red-state lawmakers have been looking for political cover for unpopular criminal abortion bans, and a simple strategy has emerged: stressing that bans in theory afford access in exceptional cases that voters overwhelmingly support, such as medical emergencies. The goal of this maneuver is straightforward. For voters who are conflicted about abortion, a focus on exceptions makes bans moderate and reasonable. But a major decision on Tuesday by the Wyoming Supreme Court striking down the state’s abortion ban suggests that abortion exceptions are fast becoming a Catch-22 for the GOP—a potential political lifeline that can create real trouble in court.

To appreciate why abortion exceptions can create legal headaches for Republicans, it helps to understand the Wyoming litigation. A group of patients, doctors, and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the state’s abortion bans under Article 1, Section 38 of the Wyoming Constitution, passed as part of the backlash to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The amendment recognizes a right to make health care decisions. The plaintiffs argued that this right was fundamental and encompassed people’s decision to terminate a pregnancy. The state responded that abortion wasn’t health care—it was the intentional taking of human life—and that even if abortion were health care, the state’s interest in protecting prenatal life was enough to justify its ban. This focus on protecting life made strategic sense; all five justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court were appointed by Republicans, and polls suggest that even Americans who support legal abortion think fetal life has value, despite their opposition to the sweeping criminalization of decisions about pregnancy.

That’s where the plaintiffs pointed to the state law’s abortion exceptions: If the state really valued protecting fetal life, and if abortion wasn’t health care, the plaintiffs argued, these specific exceptions were a funny way of showing it.

Take the state’s exceptions for fatal fetal abnormalities, which apply only if a physician expects that a newborn’s death will occur within days of a live birth. The court asked how this exception made any sense. How did the state protect life by making women in other cases when death of the newborn was just as certain—but who had a longer timeline to sit with that doomed outcome—carry their pregnancies to term? Given that pregnancy could pose risks to abortion seekers, the justices thought the fetal-abnormality exception threatened patients’ health without advancing the state’s supposed goals.

The same was true of Wyoming’s exceptions for medical emergencies, which explicitly excluded mental health crises, such as depression or psychosis, during pregnancy. The state presented no evidence that mental health wasn’t an issue during pregnancy—and no wonder: Mental health conditions accompany a significant number of pregnancies and can lead to seriously adverse outcomes.

Even the state’s rape and incest exception was a problem. The court’s justices didn’t see any connection between the state’s supposed goal of protecting all life in the womb and allowing abortions in cases of sexual abuse, and neither should anyone else. If the state believes that life or even rights begin at fertilization, it’s hard to comprehend why that wouldn’t be true in instances of sexual assault too.

That Wyoming’s abortion exceptions were weird and incoherent shouldn’t be a great surprise. In recent years, any abortion-ban exception reflects an inherently odd compromise between the demands of anti-abortion lobbyists and the electoral needs of GOP lawmakers. Republicans want to win election. That requires keeping a lid on the most heartbreaking stories, narratives that can shape the vote well outside the state where a tragedy has occurred. Abortion opponents want as many abortions as possible stopped, with the exception of a vanishingly small number of serious threats to life.

Conservative lawmakers thus propose exceptions to make abortion bans seem less harsh. Exceptions, ultimately, are a mere messaging strategy, one that undermines the legal case for abortion bans.

That’s reflected in the oddball design of many exceptions. Medical-emergency exceptions, for example, are meant not so much to give physicians real discretion in addressing urgent conditions as to rule out certain cases (such as threats to mental health) that abortion foes dismiss as “abortion on demand.” Rape-and-incest exceptions, like Wyoming’s, often contain reporting requirements intended to ferret out patients who “cry rape,” a solution in search of a problem in a culture in which sexual violence is massively underreported and rarely prosecuted. In a big-picture sense, exceptions are intended to broadcast that abortion bans are far less harsh than they appear, but on closer examination, they’re designed as much to reassure conservative lawmakers that people won’t be able to get abortions anyway.

And exceptions don’t work—by design. Historically, very few patients have sought out abortions under exceptions. That trend has continued—so much so that red states like Texas and Kentucky have passed laws said to clarify that some abortions are justified under state law. That state of affairs suits conservative lawmakers, who seek the political benefits of exceptions with none of the real abortion access they might afford.

The Wyoming Supreme Court’s ruling in State v. Johnson sends a message that this have-it-both-ways strategy on exceptions won’t always work as Republicans expect. The court saw the very same inconsistencies of exceptions as a sign that they didn’t deliver on the state’s purported goals.

It’s not clear what will come next in fights about abortion exceptions. More challenges like Johnson might come before state supreme courts, given that a number of conservative states, including Oklahoma, Ohio, Alabama, and Florida, have similar health amendments in their constitutions. But Republicans are doubling down on exceptions as a strategy: In Missouri, for example, voters will decide on whether to repeal a reproductive rights amendment passed in 2024. GOP lawmakers have tried to package the repeal amendment as allowing abortion in exceptional cases, like medical emergencies.

Republicans may think this strategy is working; some polls suggest that supporters of abortion rights are less passionate about the issue than they once were. That likely has much more to do with conservatives’ struggles to enforce abortion bans—abortion seems more, not less, common in many ban states since the fall of Roe—than with exceptions. But even when voters are willing not to look hard at what an exception really says and does, the Wyoming decision shows that the same might not be true of courts.

The Trump administration’s justifications for bombing Venezuela and arresting its president shifted in real time this weekend. Was this a national security–related counternarcotics operation, an oil heist, or a regime-change play to topple a dictator?

That lack of clarity—combined with the administration’s propensity to, well, tell a lot of lies—only added to the mass confusion over what’s really going on. After all, Donald Trump’s Venezuela adventure isn’t an isolated incident, and it’s best understood in proper historical context: the long tail of U.S. intervention in Latin America.

To help make sense of what just happened, and to get answers on what might happen next, I turned to Tiziano Breda. He’s a senior analyst covering Latin America and the Caribbean at ACLED, the independent conflict-monitoring organization that tracks political violence and protests worldwide. Breda has spent more than a decade studying Latin American politics and security.

In our conversation, he unpacks how this operation fits into the long arc of U.S. intervention in the region, the internal dynamics of Venezuela’s ruling “Chavista” coalition, the role of oil, and why the most dangerous consequence of this moment may not be what happens next in Caracas, but what it signals across the world. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Aymann Ismail: There’s so much in flux right now. What are the most important things we still don’t know about what’s happening between the United States and Venezuela?

Tiziano Breda: There are at least three variables that remain unclear. The first is how this will play out inside Venezuela now that Maduro has been removed. What has this generated within the Chavista power structure—in the government, the military, and across different sectors of society? What comes next depends on factors like whether Delcy Rodríguez [Venezuela’s acting president] can ensure continuity for the Chavistas while at the same time becoming somewhat more lenient toward U.S. interests.

The second is how this strike is being received in the United States. There has been backlash from Congress. The Trump administration has framed it as a law enforcement operation, but lawmakers say they were bypassed and are questioning the legality of the operation. The key question is how this lands with a Trump support base that is, in principle, uninterested in foreign interventions.

And third, at the international level, it’s still unclear how other major powers are interpreting this—whether they oppose it or see an opportunity. For countries like Russia and China, the question is whether this represents the loss of an ally, a precedent that could be applied in their own spheres of influence. For China in particular, it would mean not recovering the billions of dollars it still has as credit with Venezuela.

This didn’t come out of nowhere. There were months of escalating tensions. How does this moment fit into the longer U.S.–Venezuela standoff? Were you surprised when Trump announced the U.S. captured Maduro?

When Trump took office, his administration was mostly focused on immigration. Marco Rubio struggled with Richard Grenell over whose voice would be more influential in the White House on Venezuela. For the first few months Grenell seemed to have the upper hand: There were prisoner exchanges, deportation flights, Chevron’s license was renewed. But in 2025, Rubio established himself as a key strategic adviser on Venezuela. There was a noticeable shift: military buildup in the Caribbean, harsher rhetoric and labeling organized crime groups as terrorist organizations, allegations tying Maduro to some of them.

That framing was used to justify strikes against suspected drug-trafficking vessels—at least 34 so far with over 110 confirmed fatalities—not only in the Caribbean, but also in the Pacific. When that didn’t produce cracks within Maduro’s administration, we saw an escalation: oil tankers seized or chased, and a blockade on Venezuelan oil. That caused much more damage to the Maduro government’s ability to keep revenues afloat, yet there were still no cracks in Maduro’s network of alliances. So Trump was left with two options: either back down and strike some kind of deal or escalate. There had already been a CIA strike in late December, but I did not expect an operation of this kind.

The U.N. has already said this violates international law. Is there any real ambiguity here?

I’m not an expert on international law, but it’s my understanding that the U.S. does have the right to try someone in the United States for crimes that may have affected the U.S., such as drug trafficking. Thousands of drug traffickers have gone through this process. But I’m much less sure that this means the U.S. has the authority to go and extract Maduro from another country. Usually, the United States would request the extradition of a person believed to have committed a crime in the U.S. I’d say there are serious deficiencies in the legality of the operation.

The closest precedent, at least in Latin America, is the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989, to capture and extract President Noriega on drug-trafficking charges. That operation was on a much larger scale and far more costly in terms of lives, duration, and scope. But it occurred in the context of the Cold War—a moment in history that preceded the era of multilateralism, international governance, and the development of international human rights norms. I’m concerned, seeing a return of this practice in 2026. It suggests much of what was built after that period is now unraveling, or being dismantled by the United States.

So what does the future of Venezuela look like? Rodríguez seems to be in control. Rubio is saying that she’s illegitimate. Do you see regime change on the horizon? Not in the short term, unless Rodríguez is unable to do two things. She needs to avoid taking a confrontational stance toward the United States, and instead strike deals and make concessions in the oil sector. Simultaneously, she needs to project an image of someone who remains loyal to Chavismo principles—respect for national sovereignty, resistance to excessive U.S. imperial practices, and so on. If she manages this balancing act, avoiding further U.S. strikes while preventing fractures within the Chavista ranks—both in the military and in social networks—Venezuela can stabilize in the short term. But if either of these fails, I think more violence is likely.

The United States has declared they intend to run the country. How will that complicate Rodríguez’s ability to stabilize Venezuela?

The U.S. is looking to ensure that this removal leads to more functional agreements with the Venezuelan government—guaranteeing U.S. companies can get in more freely, invest, settle, and sell all the oil they can pump. A full-fledged regime change does not seem to be the main goal of the Trump administration in the short term. They are aware that the [Venezuelan, anti-Maduro] opposition may have popular support, but they do not have the buy-in of the military in particular. Installing a government without military support would carry the risk of throwing the country into chaos.

Is there something about the way that the Venezuelan government is set up that will make it particularly challenging for Rodríguez to consolidate?

Like all governments and political forces, the Maduro government—the Chavistas—has its own internal currents and branches. Maduro, and particularly Cilia Flores, are relevant here. Their removal matters because Maduro and Cilia Flores had managed to pacify the different factions within Chavismo and build a system in which elites could extract wealth from Venezuela.

For example, the military benefited from revenues from the gold-mining sector. The security sector, some would say, participated in illegal drug trafficking, and of course benefited from oil and shipping. There was a balance, and wealth was distributed among military, economic, and political elites in a way that kept the system stable. Rodríguez may try to replicate this, but she will be dealing with a very different level of U.S. pressure than Maduro faced. There may also be Maduro loyalists who obstruct her government. So even if the overall architecture remains in place, simply replacing the person at the top will have repercussions across the entire government.

What role does oil actually play in all of this? I look at a country like Saudi Arabia and think, Wow, they got lucky they have so much oil. Why was this not necessarily possible for a place like Venezuela?

The key difference between Maduro and Chávez is that Maduro politicized the oil sector too heavily. When Chávez was in power, Venezuela benefited from a boom in energy prices in the mid-2000s. He also appointed people with technical expertise to manage the oil sector. When Maduro came to power in 2013, in a quest to consolidate his authority, he replaced almost all the Chavistas he didn’t trust—including the minister of oil—and replaced them with loyalists who lacked knowledge of the sector. That lack of understanding began to create problems with maintenance, delays, production failures, and so on.

Then you had the plummeting of oil prices about 10 years ago, which hurt Venezuela’s revenue. Even before the U.S. sanctioned the oil sector in 2019, under the first Trump administration, the sector was already collapsing due to corruption and overall mismanagement. They could still maintain significant production—almost a million barrels a day—but that was down from 3 million about 15 years earlier. With that, they had enough money to sustain the elites, but the rest of society and the broader economy collapsed. That’s why you had around 8 million Venezuelans fleeing the country, as the government itself remained intact.

Up until last week, Nicolas Maduro was challenging the United States to invade, publishing videos of his military conducting drills. I know a little bit about his background, that he was originally a bus driver. What can you tell me about his character?

The role of Cilia Flores [Maduro’s wife, who was also arrested] is often overlooked. Some people refer to her as the power in the shadows, operating behind the scenes. Maduro did not reach his position alone. Flores was a key figure in liaising with the different branches of the Chavismo project. She has been head of the National Assembly, a deputy, and a minister. Her political trajectory was similar to Maduro’s, even though it was Maduro who was appointed by Chávez as his political heir. Maduro relied heavily on Cilia Flores, who played a key role in holding his government together.

Maduro also made use of humor and self-parody as a political tactic. He presents himself as a funny, silly, good guy. He even created a cartoon version of himself called “Súper Bigote,” or “Super Mustache.” I can’t think of another leader who has leaned so heavily into laughing at himself. He uses that strategy to conceal the authoritarian nature of his government, to soften accusations of massive human rights violations, suppression of dissent, waves of political arrests, extrajudicial killings, and so on.

And then you see the images of him being detained in the United States. He has a big grin, giving two thumbs up. What explains that?

There was also an attempt to keep the character going, to play on the empathy of the audience, watching a guy who, in another context, might greet you with a thumbs-up and say “Happy New Year.” He appears certain of his innocence, as though he believes he will be released once the truth comes out. While the aim of the United States might have been to show that a man who had been in power since 2013—so for over a decade—who had seemed untouchable was being brought down to the level of a common criminal.

I haven’t seen much from inside Venezuela. How are Venezuelans reacting inside the country?

At ACLED, we have so far recorded only two protests inside Venezuela, and both were in favor of Maduro. It’s not only that there are no protests, there has also been a decrease in traffic and economic activity over the past couple of days. Inside the country, the government has imposed a state of emergency and deployed military forces to the streets, which has disincentivized mobilization. Uncertainty is also playing a key role. There have been mixed messages coming from the United States—the sidelining of María Corina Machado [prominent opposition leader and recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize], the attempt to reach an agreement with Rodríguez, who is part of the same system as Maduro, and the broader fear that if this doesn’t work out, it could trigger chaos within the Chavista ranks and lead to violence. So I think people are avoiding the public sphere.

And what about abroad? How are Venezuelans in the diaspora reacting to this?

The vast majority of Venezuelans abroad have celebrated Maduro’s removal from power, though not as many agree with the way it happened through the bombing of Caracas. Most Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years did so either because of political persecution or because of the economic collapse caused by the Maduro administration.

It’s strange to see people celebrating the bombing of their own country.

It is. But it’s a testament to the level of discontent and anger toward an administration that has effectively dismantled the country’s economy. Twenty years ago, Venezuela was the wealthiest country in South America. Today, roughly a quarter of the population has been forced to leave because the economy collapsed. The relief—if not outright celebration—among many Venezuelans reflects that deep discontent with the Maduro administration.

How are other leaders and peoples in Latin America reacting to this?

There has been a mixed reaction. Leftist governments like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico have strongly condemned the U.S. action. On the other hand, more right-wing governments like Argentina, Ecuador, and the newly elected president of Honduras have been more supportive, and in some cases even enthusiastic about the operation. The divisions have been quite clear along ideological lines.

For people particularly in countries that have been most affected by the influx of Venezuelan migrants and refugees—Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Chile—the arrival of Venezuelans has strained public resources, and in some cases it has been instrumentalized by xenophobic political figures, creating a stigma.

Maduro is widely perceived as the main cause of Venezuelan migration and is deeply unpopular. There was polling showing that, across Latin America, and particularly in the countries most affected by Venezuelan migration, many people were already in favor of major intervention in Venezuela, even before this happened.

The U.S. seems to be configuring the reasoning for capturing Maduro in real time, offering conflicting information. What do you think is really driving the U.S. here, and what’s bullshit?

There are three reasons. First, reasserting U.S. dominance in the hemisphere, especially actors seen as being in cahoots with the U.S.’s main global competitors, Russia and China. Second, widening U.S. access to energy and other resources. Venezuela is rich in gas, minerals, and gold, and expanding U.S. access to those sectors is strategically important for the American economy. Third is migration. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans live in the United States, and millions more across the region. By removing what is perceived to be the country’s main problem—Maduro—and projecting the image that the U.S. will now invest in Venezuela, the administration is trying to create a picture that things have improved and encourage Venezuelans living in the U.S. without legal status to return.

The BS part is drug trafficking, which is paradoxically the legal rationale being used to bring Maduro to justice. He’s being charged with drug trafficking, terrorism, and weapons offenses. But the narrative that Maduro himself is a central drug-trafficking threat—and that attacks on drug vessels or even Maduro’s trial will significantly reduce the flow of drugs to the U.S. or elsewhere—doesn’t really hold up.

This is a return to a more assertive U.S. approach toward Latin America. It’s something that had waned over the years and been replaced by a greater emphasis on regional cooperation through institutions like the Organization of American States, and by U.S. soft power projected through development projects. This attack marks a clear end to that era and a return to one in which the United States is willing to use its full power—economic, diplomatic, and military—to ensure that its preferences materialize in the region. It’s somewhat anachronistic, but it’s a renewed version of the Monroe Doctrine, which held that the U.S. has a responsibility to influence and direct political, economic, and military developments in the hemisphere, and to keep external forces from undermining its interests.

Does the speed at which Donald Trump pivoted to Greenland and Mexico reveal anything about how he might be thinking about Venezuela?

Trump may feel emboldened because it has cost the United States little in terms of human lives and equipment, which he emphasized repeatedly during his press conference on Saturday. Let’s see what the U.N. Security Council says and what comes next, but for now the international cost also appears limited. Whether more action happens in the immediate future will depend on how the situation in Venezuela unfolds. If it triggers domestic turmoil, violence between different factions of Chavismo, or broader social unrest, then it becomes less likely that this approach would be applied elsewhere. Paradoxically, if it works, there is a risk that it could be repeated in other contexts.

            <div id="article-text">With less than a month to go until NASA attempts to send astronauts around the Moon, the agency is demolishing facilities that got it there the first time around.

Twenty-five structures at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama are slated for removal, with two test stands set for controlled implosion no earlier than sunrise on January 10, 2026.

Propulsion and Structural Test Facility (credit: MSFC, photographer: Fred Deaton)

The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility - also known as the T-tower - was built in 1957 by the US Army Ballistic Missile Agency and transferred to NASA in 1960. It played a role in the development of the F-1 engine, which powered the first stage of the Saturn V, as well as the S-IC itself. It was also used to test the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters.

Also on the chopping block is the Dynamic Test Stand, which, at 360 feet, was tall enough for full-scale tests of the Saturn V rocket and was the first location where all Space Shuttle elements – the external tank, solid rocket boosters, and orbiter – were integrated.

Crews have already begun demolition of the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator – a 1960s-era underwater facility where astronauts could be dunked to simulate near-weightlessness and test hardware procedures (including those required for servicing the Hubble Space Telescope). It&#39;s long been replaced by a facility at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

All three were designated National Historic Landmarks in 1985, but maintaining them is no longer economically viable.

&quot;These structures are not safe,&quot; said acting center director Rae Ann Meyer. &quot;By removing these structures that we have not used in decades, we are saving money on upkeep of facilities we can&#39;t use.&quot;

The facilities have been documented in detail, but it&#39;s still a loss of a tangible connection to NASA&#39;s past.

NASA warned communities near Redstone Arsenal to expect a &quot;loud noise associated with the demolition on the morning of Jan. 10.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Fancy having an AI system packed with Nvidia H200 GPUs that you can take with you from place to place? According to hardware maker Odinn, now you can, so long as you don&#39;t mind carrying a 35 kg (77 pound) box around.

At CES this week, Odinn is showcasing its Omnia system that combines AMD EPYC 9965 CPUs with up to four Nvidia H200 NVL GPUs and 6 TB of memory, all in a single enclosure with a 23.8-inch display – and carry handles.

This it describes as &quot;roughly the size of a carry-on suitcase,&quot; though we wouldn&#39;t like to try lifting a 77 pound weight up to an overhead locker and wedging it in, and we doubt there are many airlines that would let you.

But Odinn isn&#39;t pitching Omnia as a portable PC or even a mobile workstation. Instead, it styles the system as a portable datacenter.

&quot;As the laptop freed the desktop, Omnia frees the datacenter,&quot; its website proclaims.

This is pushing things a bit far, as most datacenters have hundreds, if not thousands, of servers in them, and any single AI server is likely to have double the maximum number of GPUs that the Omnia can have fitted.

It does, however, have built-in cooling and a redundant power supply unit (PSU) configuration with Platinum-rated units, so it is definitely workstation or server-grade hardware.

Who would want a portable datacenter, and why? Odinn lists four potential configurations of the box on its website, covering AI, Creator, Search, or Omnia X, the most powerful. The uses for these include mission-critical inferencing at the edge, film crews and postproduction houses who need a self-contained mobile workstation, military AI missions, and enterprise-grade simulations.

And there is more. The firm says that, for anyone needing even greater scale (What? More than one datacenter?), Omnia is designed to work as a building block. Multiple units can be clustered to form Infinity Racks, it claims, delivering large GPU clusters on-site.

None of this will come cheap - a single Nvidia H200 is estimated to set you back around $32,000. It&#39;s hard to imagine many companies would let employees walk out with something so valuable and easily stolen.

However, Odinn doesn&#39;t offer any hint of pricing on its website. We asked, and will update the article if it responds.

With its built-in screen and flip-down keyboard, the Omina reminds us of something from the early days of portable computing: the famous Osborne 1 or the Compaq Portable.

Neither of those weighed anything close to 77 pounds, despite containing a CRT screen, but were arm-stretching enough to be regarded as &quot;luggables&quot; rather than true portables. Perhaps the Omnia should be seen as the successor to these – only much, much more powerful. ®

            <h2>Microsoft scraps Exchange Online spam clamp after customers cry foul</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/exchange_online_recipient_rate/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has backed away from planned changes to Exchange Online after customers objected to limits designed to curb outbound email abuse.

In its cancellation announcement, Microsoft said: &quot;Customers have shared that this limit creates significant operational challenges, especially given the limited capabilities of bulk sending offerings available today.

&quot;Your feedback matters, and we&#39;re committed to solutions that balance security and usability without causing unnecessary disruption.&quot;

The plan, announced in 2024, would impose daily restrictions to Exchange Online. New tenants&#39; cloud-hosted mailboxes would face an external recipient rate (ERR) limit of 2,000 recipients per 24 hours, applied per user/mailbox to &quot;help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources.&quot;

The restrictions also aimed to curb spam flowing from compromised Exchange Online accounts.

The original blueprint targeted newly created tenants starting January 1, 2025, with existing tenants&#39; cloud-hosted mailboxes facing limits between July and December 2025. As customers struggled to adapt, however, Microsoft repeatedly delayed the timeline into 2026. Now, the company has scrapped those plans entirely as it develops a better approach to the issue.

The problem is that customers have legitimate reasons to exceed the limit - some integrations would fail under the restrictions, making the proposal a blunt instrument.

Nevertheless, Microsoft isn&#39;t abandoning the effort. &quot;We plan to address these issues in ways that are less disruptive to your business workflows,&quot; the company said.

&quot;This means smarter, more adaptive approaches that protect the service while respecting your operational needs.&quot;

Exchange Online already enforces a recipient rate limit of 10,000, and the 2,000 external recipient limit was designed as a sub-limit within that.

Other email vendors have also imposed limits to curb abuse. In 2024, Google added requirements for senders of 5,000+ daily messages to Gmail accounts, including mandatory unsubscribe options for marketing emails.

Microsoft deserves credit for responding to customer concerns – it suggested Azure Communication Services for Email as an alternative, but that clearly didn&#39;t meet every customer&#39;s business needs. The counting method also proved problematic. Microsoft said: &quot;If you sent 100 emails to the same 5 external recipients, it would count as 500 external recipients,&quot; which could easily cause integration headaches for sysadmins.

So while the company gets a thumbs-up for stepping back from its initial plans, it gets two thumbs down for a lack of detail on what it will do next. Administrators with solutions that violate the service restrictions should consider themselves warned. This problem isn&#39;t going away, and Microsoft will be back with an alternative strategy soon enough. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US state of Virginia forfeited $1.6 billion in tax revenue through datacenter exemptions in fiscal 2025 – up 118 percent on the prior year – as the AI-driven construction boom accelerates.

Good Jobs First, a nonprofit promoting corporate and government accountability, warns these incentives have become essentially automatic.

Virginia&#39;s qualification threshold requires just $150 million in capital investment and 50 new jobs, which is modest compared to the billions spent on today&#39;s hyperscale facilities. The exemptions cover retail sales and use taxes on computer equipment, software, and hardware purchases.

The disclosure is detailed in Virginia&#39;s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report [PDF], which covers the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.

Good Jobs First claims the tax breaks are getting out of hand as the criteria to become a qualifying recipient are set at a low bar.

Greg LeRoy, executive director at the nonprofit, said: &quot;Like 35 other states, Virginia is losing control of its spending by enacting virtually automatic sales and use tax exemptions, and sometimes other subsidies, for datacenter building materials and equipment.&quot;

Recipients may qualify for local property tax reductions on top, he added.

Virginia has the highest datacenter count globally – more than 600 according to some estimates – equating to more than 10 percent of estimated global hyperscale capacity.

The Register has asked the government of Virginia to comment.

Good Jobs First highlighted last year that more than half of US states offer economic development subsidies for datacenters exempting them from sales and use taxes.

LeRoy argues these breaks should end: &quot;Given that every state that has studied its return on investment for datacenter subsidies has found a sharply negative result, we recommend that states now eliminate all datacenter tax exemptions.

&quot;Trillion-dollar internet giants don&#39;t need the tax breaks, and taxpayers cannot afford them with massive federal budget cuts coming.&quot;

Meanwhile, grassroots opposition to the datacenter construction frenzy is mounting. The Washington Post reported this week on public campaigns in Arizona, Indiana, and Maryland challenging new facilities over water and electricity consumption and their visual impact on rural landscapes.

In December, Democrat senators were questioned datacenter companies about rising energy bills driven by grid infrastructure costs often passed to consumers, while Senator Bernie Sanders called for a nationwide construction moratorium. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Ever since Linux got a graphical desktop, you could middle-click to paste – but if GNOME gets its way, that&#39;s going away soon, and from Firefox too.

More proof, if you will, that the traditional keyboard and multi-button mouse config is boring legacy tech to the hipsters in charge these days. GNOME developer Jordan Petridis has submitted the code to remove middle-click paste behavior from GNOME defaults, which he considers &quot;an X11ism.&quot; The merge request concludes &quot;Goodbye X11.&quot;

It&#39;s not just in GNOME – he&#39;s additionally filed bug 1747207 against Firefox, also proposing to remove this behavior. There, he says:

This is a little known feature and behavior that leads into user confusion when they click the middle mouse button without knowing about its functionality. Most of the time, its [sic] also clicked by accident, and its [sic] very weird o [sic] have the clipboard dumped on such occasions.

The feature is also not discoverable at all, and even on the Freedesktop wiki page, the entirity [sic] of the &quot;PRIMARY&quot; selection is refferred [sic] to as an &quot;easter egg&quot;.

The spelling and punctuation errors are in the original, but they aren&#39;t the only mistake: it doesn&#39;t dump the clipboard. The clipboard is a separate thing. Middle-clicking pastes any currently selected text at the insertion point, including in a terminal emulator, without affecting the clipboard. That&#39;s why we like it. For instance, you can select and copy the title of a webpage, then select the URL, then switch to another window, paste the title with Ctrl+V, and then paste the URL with a middle-click, without two round trips between the apps.

There is one element of truth to this proposal, though. Middle-click to paste is not as well-known as it should be, which is why we wrote about how to use the middle button in 2023.

However, this is a very long-standing feature. Linux.com published an article about using it in 2004. A 2005 Mozilla bug says: &quot;Middle-click paste is the default behavior on Unix systems.&quot; The Reg FOSS desk discovered it in his first experiments with Linux 30 years ago, on the Lasermoon Linux/FT distro – the first POSIX.1 certified Linux.

Before Linux, it was in SunOS – it&#39;s mentioned in the docs for the IRAF tool from 1995. We suspect that, as per this Stack Overflow answer, it predates the X window system and may go back to SunView, released in 1985, which also crops up in the FreeBSD docs.

This is ancient Unix technology, inherited from systems released when this vulture was still in school. We like it a great deal, and badly miss it on macOS, as well as on Windows, where as we noted in 2022 even the excellent Taekwindow can&#39;t help. Taekwindow does bring another handy Linux use of the middle button to Windows: middle-click the title bar of any window to put it behind all the other windows, and other window-management improvements – but sadly, that&#39;s all. GNOME&#39;s growing use of &quot;client side decorations&quot; instead of proper title bars already broke the handy send-to-back feature years ago.

Call us paranoid, but we feel attacked. Once again, it feels to us very much like the GNOME developers – quite a few of whom are relative youngsters – simply don&#39;t know how to make the best use of what are apparently old-fashioned input devices like multi-button mice. As a result, they see useful facilities as unnecessary, and want to take them away from those of us who value them.

We implore the GNOME team: please, spend a weekend on a Windows desktop PC with no pointing device and learn to drive it with the keyboard alone. Start with a blank installation of Win 10 LTSC, use Ninite to install a bunch of FOSS apps. Configure Firefox and Thunderbird for keyboard use. It&#39;s like Vim but for the entire OS. It is so fast and efficient and capable, you will feel as if you are a god-like superhero of computing. You&#39;ll be amazed. You&#39;ll pick up skills you&#39;ll be able to use every day for the rest of your life, and it&#39;s fun. Please. Just try it. And then maybe you will see why we object to you removing these facilities.

We suspect that Petridis will have scornful words for this article. In an earlier blog post, Rust in Peace, he mentions:

There has been a lot of concerned trolling and misinformation specifically around this topic sadly from people that don&#39;t care about it and have been abusing the discourse as a straw man argument.

We suspect, from some comments on Mastodon and other places, that this comment refers personally to this vulture and his accessibility advocacy. For instance, our story on Apple accessibility in 2025 along with previous criticisms of Linux accessibility. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/post_office_horizon_rollout/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Post Office&#39;s Horizon computer system may have been deployed earlier than thought, potentially affecting which convictions get automatically quashed under legislation introduced to speed up justice in one of the biggest scandals in recent British history, MPs heard yesterday.

Amanda Pearce, casework operations director at the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) - an independent public body that reviews possible miscarriages of justice - told the Commons Business and Trade Committee that new Post Office information suggested Horizon was installed earlier than originally believed.

This could mean some convictions previously thought to predate the system may now qualify for automatic quashing under the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024.

Pearce told MPs she was investigating possible miscarriages of justice under computer systems prior to Horizon&#39;s introduction, but the Post Office continued to provide new details.

&quot;We&#39;ve recently had the information on one of the pre-Horizon cases, which suggests that, in fact, Horizon was installed earlier than had originally been thought, and that case may be one that benefits from the Horizon legislation. It&#39;s complex to try and pin down the information in these cases,&quot; she told MPs.

Horizon is an EPOS and back-end finance system that was first implemented by ICL, a UK tech firm majority-owned by Fujitsu in the 1990s and fully acquired in 1998. It has undergone two subsequent upgrades.

From 1999 until 2015, around 736 subpostmasters were wrongfully prosecuted and convicted over Horizon errors, devastating lives in the process. A statutory inquiry into the mass miscarriage of justice launched in 2021 and is ongoing.

Its first report found that senior Post Office staff in the UK – and those working for suppliers Fujitsu and ICL – knew or should have known about the defects causing errors in the Horizon system. It also found that 13 suicides were recorded, most likely linked to the Post Office prosecutions, in which Fujitsu provided technical support.

The Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 was introduced to fulfill the commitment made by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in January 2024 to quash convictions that resulted from errors in the Horizon system. The legislation applies to &quot;certain offences alleged to have been committed while the Horizon system was in use by the Post Office.&quot;

Pearce said that, due to the age of the cases, there was a significant lack of reliable information from the Post Office. The Department for Business and Trade had provided a list of 480 convictions in the 1990s. There is a separate scheme for redress for the pre-Horizon Capture computer system, designed to provide fair compensation for those who suffered financial shortfalls as a result of the faulty system.

The CCRC was reviewing a number of prosecutions, while a case had also been referred to the Court of Appeal.

A 2019 judgment in a case brought by subpostmasters found Horizon was introduced in late 1999 and 2000. The court ruled the Post Office&#39;s insistence that the system could not cause discrepancies was inconsistent with evidence of bugs in both the original and later versions.

At the same hearing, Fujitsu boss Patterson was forced to defend accusations that the company continued to profit from the UK public sector despite its role in the miscarriage of justice.

Chairing the committee, Labour MP Liam Byrne questioned Fujitsu&#39;s decision not to put aside money or contribute to the compensation scheme until the public inquiry had reported.

&quot;You&#39;re trying to present Fujitsu as a changed and ethical company. There doesn&#39;t appear to be a problem with cash flow, there doesn&#39;t appear to be a problem with profitability. There is definitely culpability. But your refusal to tell us how much Fujitsu will pay into a £1.8 billion bill for taxpayers leads people to the conclusion that, frankly, Fujitsu is behaving like a parasite on the British state without [stepping] up to its obligations,&quot; Byrne said.

&quot;We&#39;re not a parasite,&quot; Patterson responded. &quot;The government has got an option as to whether they wish to extend those contracts or not. If [it wishes us] to walk away from those contracts, we&#39;ll walk away from those contracts. I think that would be detrimental to society [and] the UK government.&quot;

He said Fujitsu had won around £500 million in re-procurement and contract extensions from the UK government since it promised not to bid for new government work in 2024. ®

            <div id="article-text">Buying an LED skincare mask is a minefield, but this is a smart take on science and wearability

Buying an LED skincare mask is a minefield, but this is a smart take on science and wearability

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

I hate when friends and family ask me which LED face mask to buy.

That’s because LED face masks are another prime example of the wild wellness west. There’s compelling science behind using red and infrared light therapy to address skin concerns, particularly wrinkles. However, wellness influencers have taken that concept and absolutely ran away with it.

While it’s a legitimate treatment you can get from a dermatologist, you’ll also see at-home masks touted on TikTok, in wellness spas, and even gyms as a cure-all for this and that ailment. Every year at CES, I see plenty of companies jumping in on the trend with their own versions. Some flash nine different colors, some falsely advertise “FDA approval.” It’s such a crapshoot that for most people, I generally don’t recommend purchasing the device.

So I was pleasantly surprised when I got to see L’Oréal’s LED Face Mask at CES this year.

The number one rule of wearable tech is simple: it must be wearable. You can have all the science in the world, but your wearable gadget ain’t worth shit if it’s not comfortable to wear. The vast majority of LED face masks on the market are bulky, uncomfortable to wear, and make you look like a Temu version of Jason Voorhees. Admittedly, L’Oréal’s mask does look uncanny in these pictures, but there’s a crucial difference. They take their inspiration from sheet masks. There are two iterations: one for your entire face, and smaller masks that build off the reusable silicone eye masks that’ve boomed in popularity over the past few years.

This is savvy. Sheet masks are a beauty treatment that is not only widely available, but they’re also often an existing part of skin care nerds’ routines. In essence, L’Oréal isn’t introducing a whole new step — it’s potentially condensing them.

I didn’t get to wear the prototype masks myself for hygienic reasons. That said, I did get to handle them and view them on Guive Balooch, L’Oréal’s global vice president of tech and open innovation. They’re made of lightweight, thin, and flexible material. And, unlike the hard, rigid masks flooding the market, this mask sits directly on top of your skin, which helps penetration. A user only has to wear it for five to ten minutes. Five, if they want to address fine lines. Ten if they want to target deeper wrinkles. Existing LED masks generally require users to wear them for ten to 20 minutes. Plus, another benefit of a flexible material means that it could one day also be applied to other areas that are challenging to treat, like the neck and decolletage.

Another gripe I have with LED light masks is that red and infrared light therapy only works at certain wavelengths. A ton of available LED masks don’t tell you that information — and for the ones boasting eight or nine different colors, there’s not a ton of evidence proving efficacy.

Balooch tells me that to make its mask, L’Oréal partnered with a startup called iSmart, which is also behind the tech in another popular mask by Omnilux.

“They have lots of clinicals, and working with them we found a way to bring a flexible electronic that has the same power with two wavelengths: 630nm and 830nm,” Balooch says, noting that iSmart has an extensive 20 years of conducting peer-reviewed research in this area. “We wanted to work with a clinically driven science team, and there are not very many out there.”

Balooch is also frank when I ask whether the mask’s design could potentially help make existing skincare routines more effective using existing products like serums and moisturizers.

“Not all formulas are activated by certain wavelengths of light. To activate something, you need to design the molecule and that’s what we’re doing with our labs — figuring out what molecules are activated by the wavelengths we have so we can design a particular formula for it. So could it synergize? Yes if you can create the right product. Will it reduce any effectiveness? No,” says Balooch. He noted it was possible that the fact that the mask sits on the skin itself could help with absorption as well, but that would have to be studied further to know for sure.

Another thing I appreciate is that L’Oréal is making the effort to get 510(k) FDA clearance for the mask. Obtaining this kind of FDA clearance doesn’t necessarily mean the mask is more effective, but it does assert the product is safe to use and isn’t making false marketing claims. It can be a lengthy and expensive process, which in this space, generally means a company is willing to go through extra hoops instead of defaulting to “wellness.”

I’m not about to straight up say that “This is the LED mask you should buy.” That sort of endorsement requires testing and research. Plus, we don’t yet know how this will be priced. On top of that, this device isn’t slated to hit shelves until 2027, pending FDA clearance. However, if I were in the market for such a device, these are the criteria I’d want to see from an LED mask maker when making an educated choice.

Sony’s first PlayStation announcement of 2026 is all about color. The new Hyperpop Collection includes colorful neon console covers and controllers that really add a pop of color to a PS5. Sadly, if you own a PS5 Pro then you won’t be able to enjoy the RGB in your living room fun.

There are three colors available: techno red, remix green, and rhythm blue (RGB!). All three are very different to the console covers that Sony has shipped for the PS5 so far, and they certainly look like they’d fit in well with RGB lights. Sony says the collection is designed with RGB in mind and to “take over” your room. “Inspired by the glow of the RGB lights of your impressive gaming setups, these new colors go LOUD in the best possible way,” says Leo Cardoso, from Sony’s color, material, and finish design team.

The Hyperpop Collection launches on March 12th, with preorders kicking off at 10AM local time on January 16th at Sony’s PlayStation Direct website and retailers. The PS5 console covers are priced at $74.99 and only available in limited quantities, and the DualSense controllers are $84.99.

The show may be best known for the debut of high-end, budget-busting TVs — of which there was no shortage this year — but in recent years many companies have used CES to announce their latest charging innovations. Unlike CES 2025 where several companies embraced built-in charging cables, there’s no unifying theme to the hardware revealed at CES 2026. But the new chargers and power banks are getting more powerful, more portable, more functional, and more stylish… even though all some of us want is a return to basic and inexpensive.

Here are our picks for the standout chargers and power banks making their debut at CES this year.

Does every charger need a screen? Probably not, but Anker is justifying the addition of a display to its new $39.99 45W Nano Charger with some unique functionality. The charger identifies recent iPhone and iPad models and displays additional information as they charge including their current battery level and temperature, alongside cute animations. There’s just a single USB-C port, but the Nano Charger’s folding prongs now rotate 180 degrees to make the port always accessible.

The problem with nearly all 3-in-1 wireless charging stands is that they only support the Apple Watch. Belkin’s new UltraCharge Modular Charging Dock is designed to accommodate other wearables, too, including Samsung’s smartwatches and the first- and second-gen Google Pixel watches. You just need to supply your own charging puck and install it in a pop-out support on the back of the stand using a collection of included spacers to ensure it securely fits. It’s expected to launch in Q1 2026 for $64.99 and includes an adjustable 25W Qi2.2 wireless charging pad for smartphones and a smaller pad for wireless earbuds.

If it’s actually as small as the promotional images make it seem, Baseus’ new PicoGo power bank could become this year’s must-have travel accessory. It features a 10,000mAh battery squeezed into an accessory that looks nearly as small as your wireless earbuds’ charging case. Pricing and availability haven’t been revealed, but the PicoGo comes with a 45W USB-C port so you can even charge some laptops and a built-in USB-C cable for charging a pair of devices simultaneously.

If you like the idea behind Clicks’ keyboard cases but don’t want a BlackBerry-style keypad always hanging off the bottom of your phone (or don’t use one of the limited number of smartphones it supports) its new magnetic wireless power bank is a clever alternative. On the back of the 2150mAh battery is a slide-out compact keyboard that connects to your smartphone over Bluetooth. You can extend it only when needed, and because it uses magnets, it can attach to any smartphone that’s compatible with the Qi standard. The Clicks Power Keyboard is expected to be available in the Spring for $109, but discounted preorders are now available for $79.

What if your wireless charger didn’t look like one? That’s the question Twelve South has tried to answer with its new $179.99 Valet. It’s essentially a stylish leather-covered tray with a metal frame and both can be customized to match your aesthetic or decor. You can drop your keys, wallet, and pocket change on one side when you get home, while the other side has a raised 15W Qi charging pad to top off your phone. There’s also an additional 15W USB port on the side for charging another device, and Twelve South includes a 36W power supply.

Instead of putting a towering hub or docking station on your desk to expand your accessible power ports, Anker’s $69.99 Nano Power Strip is designed to clamp to the edge and keep part of it hidden beneath. It makes two AC jacks, two USB-A, and two 70W USB-C ports accessible from on top of your desk, plus four additional AC outlets on the underside.

With Loona’s DeskMate charging hub, your smartphone doesn’t become an inanimate glass slab while it recharges. Launching through a crowdfunding campaign in March for “below $300,” the hub pairs three USB-C ports and a USB-A port with a Qi2 wireless charging pad. It should charge any Qi2-compatible smartphone, but the DeskMate is specifically designed for the iPhone, automatically activating a cute AI companion when your phone is docked. A pair of expressive eyes will follow you around the room as the stand rotates and tilts, but the DeskMate isn’t just about having an AI-powered desk companion, it also has practical features including Slack integration.

Belkin’s UltraCharge Pro Power Bank 10K with Magnetic Ring is a run-of-the-mill portable charger with a built-in display, 25W Qi2.2 wireless charging support, and up to 30W of power delivery through its USB-C port. What might make the $99.99 a tempting alternative to other power banks when it launches in Q1 2026 is that it won’t replace a PopSocket or other magnetic accessory while you use it. Belkin put an extra ring of magnets on the back so you can keep using a MagSafe wallet or a pop-up grip while your phone charges.

When you demand more than just power from your charger, Baseus’ new Spacemate RD1 Pro could fit the bill when it launches in April for $259.99. On top you’ll find a tilting Qi2.2 25W charging pad so you can adjust the angle of your smartphone while it charges, while down below is a plethora of ports. There are two HDMI ports so you can use the RD1 Pro as a hub to connect a laptop to a pair of 4K displays, plus four USB-C ports, four USB-A ports, 1Gbps ethernet, and memory card slots. Its total power output maxes out at 160W so you can easily charge multiple devices simultaneously, including a laptop.

Belkin’s original Charging Case for Nintendo Switch 2 is barely seven months old after debuting alongside the console last June, but the company has already announced an improved Pro version with a handful of welcome upgrades. For starters, you no longer need to open the case to charge its internal 10,000mAh battery. There’s now an external USB-C port for connecting power, next to a small display showing the battery’s remaining charge level. The battery itself has also been redesigned and now has an integrated adjustable stand that connects the Switch 2 to a USB-C port, similar to the console’s own charging dock. The Charging Case Pro for Nintendo Switch 2 is now available for $99.99.

The X5 Alteron works with smartphones and tablets, and it can replace faulty Joy-Cons on your Nintendo Switch.

Hyperkin announced a new clamp-on style wireless controller created in collaboration with GameSir. The X5 Alteron features similar functionality to GameSir’s GameSir G8 Plus that debuted in 2024 with an expanding telescopic mechanism that can clamp onto smartphones, tablets, and several versions of the Nintendo Switch, replacing the Joy-Cons. What sets the X5 Alteron apart is a modular design allowing most of the controls on the front to be swapped out with alternate layouts, buttons, and joysticks.

Neither company has announced when the X5 Alteron will be available, how much it will cost, or how the alternate control modules will be sold. But there’s already quite a few of them to cater to various gaming preferences. You can configure the controller with symmetrical or asymmetrical thumbsticks, change the location, number, and layout of the action buttons, and even customize the look and feel of the D-pad to your preference. There are also modules that re-create the N64 and GameCube’s controllers for a more authentic experience when playing older titles on Nintendo Switch Online and a module with a track pad for replicating a mouse.

The X5 Alteron connects to various devices over Bluetooth, which means you can also use it as a standalone controller with consoles and PCs. But you’ll also have to remember to regularly charge it over USB-C, and batteries do add some weight. On the back of the controller you’ll find Hall effect analog triggers that can be switched to a shorter travel to improve reaction time, and there’s rumble motors providing force feedback effects.

The company is also adding a Request to Jam option to mobile chats.

Since almost day one, Spotify has offered the ability to creep on your friends’ listening habits — but you could mostly only uncover those guilty pleasures on the desktop app. The company experimented with a community feature on the mobile app back in 2022, but it never officially launched. Now the company is finally bringing Listening Activity to the mobile app for real.

Listening Activity is opt in, rather than opt out, which is nice. To turn the feature on, you’ll need to go into your privacy settings on the mobile app. You can even choose which of your friends to share your listening activity with, just in case you don’t want to unfriend your old college buddies, but don’t need them to know how much you listen to Caspar Babypants now that you’re a dad of two.

In the mobile app, you’ll see what people are listening to in your sidebar alongside your chats. And, if something sparks your interest, you can quickly tap the song to add it to your library, or react with an emoji.

As part of this update, Spotify is also adding a Request to Jam feature. Premium users can tap the Jam button in a chat to send a request and, if the person accepts, their listening is remotely synced. From there, you can both queue up songs and chat to share your reactions. Spotify will even suggest songs based on your shared tastes. If you’re a free user, you can join a jam if you’re invited, but you can’t initiate a request.

Both features are rolling out on iOS and Android now in markets where messages are available. But Spotify appears to be taking its time with this launch, saying it will be “broadly available” in early February.

The appearances, absences, and trends we didn’t expect.

There are some things you can reliably expect to see at the Consumer Electronics Show every year. Companies will announce big splashy TVs, there’s going to be a bunch of new gadgets for charging your other gadgets, and the odds are good that a robot or two is going to hilariously malfunction.

But CES always manages to sneak in a few surprises, whether with what has been announced, what hasn’t made an appearance, and trends that no one saw coming. We’ve rounded up the biggest CES 2026 curveballs so far.

Motorola has really gotten into a groove with its clamshell-style flip phones over the past few years. They’re a natural fit with the Razr legacy, and Moto has done some really fun stuff with them. Years went by and it seemed like the company was content to focus on flip phones, but that hasn’t turned out to be the case. Almost as surprising: the book-style fold carries Razr branding, too. I guess Motorola is ready to move beyond the nostalgia factor with its brand and embrace the future. — Allison Johnson

Despite Asus, Broadcom, and MediaTek announcing Wi-Fi 8 routers and chipsets at CES 2026, the IEEE 802.11bn successor to Wi-Fi 7 isn’t fully ratified and won’t be until late 2028. Nevertheless, they plan to start selling hardware built on the draft spec later this year. It’ll be truly bleeding-edge stuff, likely requiring a firmware upgrade to be compliant with the final 2028 standard. Hopefully, it won’t be a repeat of the “Draft-N” fiasco suffered from 2007–2009, when the draft 802.11n Wi-Fi spec changed significantly over that same two-year timeframe, leaving some devices orphaned. — Thomas Ricker

Robot vacuums with arms? You don’t even need to remind me that those came out in 2025. It’s now 2026, and we live in the future, one where robot vacuums have legs. Roborock’s new Saros Rover prototype swapped appendages, trading the ability to pick up socks for some very compelling locomotion. It can climb stairs! This alleviates my biggest concern about setting my little robot vacuum free near my cat-hair-coated stairs: that it’ll fall to its death (which, ironically, I’ll have to clean up with a different vacuum). Like my colleague Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, I also look forward to whenever Roborock can put both arms and legs on a robot vacuum. — Cameron Faulkner

CES is always a showcase for huge TVs, but it’s also been a way to see the more reasonable TVs we should expect in the following year. In 2025, TCL came out of the gate with the QM6K — its most affordable of the QM line — and teased the QM7K, LG showed off the G5 with a brand new OLED panel technology (even if we needed Panasonic to confirm what it was), and both Samsung and Hisense showed off a range of reasonably sized TVs. There was a lot for regular consumers to look forward to. But this year has been almost exclusively about big and expensive TVs. Sure, Amazon is showing off their affordable Ember Artline, LG has the C6 and G6 on the floor, and a bunch of people will buy the Wallpaper TV. But companies aren’t focusing on sets people can actually afford. We have no information from Hisense, TCL put the QM8L on the floor with zero information, Sony TVs are (per usual) absent from CES, and Samsung focused on a bigger RGB LED instead of the smaller sizes. It’s fun to be aspirational, but it’s also good to know your options for a new, more sensible TV. — John Higgins

I expected this to come at some point, but not at CES this year. Samsung had a demo of a creaseless folding display, which means we might be getting even closer to foldable phones that mainstream consumers will actually buy. Why this matters: Samsung provides displays for Apple, and Bloomberg reported in November that Apple’s folding iPhone is set to launch sometime in the fall. Samsung, which pulled the demo from its CES booth, told The Verge that the screen at CES was an R&D concept with no current timeline or plan for commercialization. Still, my guess is Apple won’t launch a folding phone until the crease is invisible. So, this may have been our first look at that screen. — Todd Haselton

CES used to be one of the world’s biggest car shows. But this year, the cars have been replaced by AI chatbots and humanoid robots. Hyundai, one of the biggest EV sellers, brought out a production version of Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot. BMW announced it was integrating Alexa Plus. Mercedes revealed its new Nvidia-powered driver-assist. The only concept car to grace the stage was Sony and Honda’s Afeela SUV — and this was from a company that hasn’t even sold any cars yet. CES used to be a showcase for weird movable machines, but there was a noticeable absence this year. Blame the EV doldrums or trade anxiety or whatever. Let’s hope next year we can get back to the cars. — Andrew J. Hawkins

            <h2>Deploying a hybrid approach to Web3 in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129490/deploying-a-hybrid-approach-to-web3-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the concept of “Web 3.0” first emerged about a decade ago the idea was clear: Create a more user-controlled internet that lets you do everything you can now, except without servers or intermediaries to manage the flow of information.

Where Web2, which emerged in the early 2000s, relies on centralized systems to store data and supply compute, all owned—and monetized by—a handful of global conglomerates, Web3 turns that structure on its head. Instead, data and compute are decentralized through technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.

What was once a futuristic concept is quickly becoming a more concrete reality, even at a time when Web2 still dominates. Six out of ten Fortune 500 companies are exploring blockchain-based solutions, most taking a hybrid approach that combines traditional Web2 business models and infrastructure with the decentralized technologies and principles of Web3.

Popular use cases include cloud services, supply chain management, and, most notably financial services. In fact, at one point, the daily volume of transactions processed on decentralized finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion.

Among the advantages of Web3 for the enterprise are greater ownership and control of sensitive data, says Erman Tjiputra, founder and CEO of the AIOZ Network, which is building infrastructure for Web3, powered by decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), blockchain-based systems that govern physical infrastructure assets.

More cost-effective compute is another benefit, as is enhanced security and privacy as the cyberattack landscape grows more hostile, he adds. And it could even help protect companies from outages caused by a single point of failure, which can lead to downtime, data loss, and revenue deficits.

But perhaps the most exciting opportunity, says Tjiputra, is the ability to build and scale AI reliably and affordably. By leveraging a people-powered internet infrastructure, companies can far more easily access—and contribute to—shared resource like bandwidth, storage, and processing power to run AI inference, train models, and store data. All while using familiar developer tooling and open, usage-based incentives.

“We’re in a compute crunch where requirements are insatiable, and Web3 creates this ability to benefit while contributing,” explains Tjiputra.

In 2025, AIOZ Network launched a distributed compute platform and marketplace where developers and enterprises can access and monetize AI assets, and run AI inference or training on AIOZ Network’s more than 300,000 contributing devices. The model allows companies to move away from opaque datasets and models and scale flexibly, without centralized lock in.

Despite the promise, it is still early days for Web3, and core systemic challenges are leaving senior leadership and developers hesitant about its applicability at scale.

One hurdle is a lack of interoperability. The current fragmentation of blockchain networks creates a segregated ecosystem that makes it challenging to transfer assets or data between platforms. This often complicates transactions and introduces new security risks due to the reliance on mechanisms such as cross-chain bridges. These are tools that allow asset transfers between platforms but which have been shown to be vulnerable to targeted attacks.

“We have countless blockchains running on different protocols and consensus models,” says Tjiputra. “These blockchains need to work with each other so applications can communicate regardless of which chain they are on. This makes interoperability fundamental.”

Regulatory uncertainty is also a challenge. Outdated legal frameworks can sit at odds with decentralized infrastructures, especially when it comes to compliance with data protection and anti-money laundering regulations.

“Enterprises care about verifiability and compliance as much as innovation, so we need frameworks where on-chain transparency strengthens accountability instead of adding friction,” Tjiputra says.

And this is compounded by user experience (UX) challenges, says Tjiputra. “The biggest setback in Web3 today is UX,” he says. “For example, in Web2, if I forget my bank username or password, I can still contact the bank, log in and access my assets. The trade-off in Web3 is that, should that key be compromised or lost, we lose access to those assets. So, key recovery is a real problem.”

Although such systemic challenges won’t be solved overnight, by leveraging DePIN networks, enterprises can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, without making a wholesale switch. This can minimize risk while harnessing much of the potential.

AIOZ Network’s own ecosystem includes capacity for media streaming, AI compute, and distributed storage that can be plugged into an existing Web2 tech stack. “You don’t need to go full Web3,” says Tjiputra. “You can start by plugging distributed storage into your workflow, test it, measure it, and see the benefits firsthand.”

The AIOZ Storage solution, for example, offers scalable distributed object storage by leveraging the global network of contributor devices on AIOZ DePIN. It is also compatible with existing storage systems or commonly used web application programming interfaces (APIs).

“Say we have a programmer or developer who uses Amazon S3 Storage or REST APIs, then all they need to do is just repoint the endpoints,” explains Tjiputra. “That&#39;s it. It’s the same tools, it&#39;s really simple. Even with media, with a single one-stop shop, developers can do transcoding and streaming with a simple REST API.”

Built on Cosmos, a network of hundreds of different blockchains that can communicate with each other, and a standardized framework enabled by Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), AIOZ Network has also prioritized interoperability. “Applications shouldn’t care which chain they’re on. Developers should target APIs without worrying about consensus mechanisms. That’s why we built on Cosmos and EVM—interoperability first.”

This hybrid model, which allows enterprises to use both Web2 and Web3 advantages in tandem, underpins what Tjiputra sees as the longer-term ambition for the much-hyped next iteration of the internet.

“Our vision is a truly peer-to-peer foundation for a people-powered internet, one that minimizes single points of failure through multi-region, multi-operator design,” says Tjiputra. “By distributing compute and storage across contributors, we gain both cost efficiency and end-to-end security by default.

“Ideally, we want to evolve the internet toward a more people-powered model, but we’re not there yet. We’re still at the starting point and growing.”

Indeed, Web3 isn’t quite snapping at the heels of the world’s Web2 giants, but its commercial advantages in an era of AI have become much harder to ignore. And with DePIN bridging the gap, enterprises and developers can step into that potential while keeping one foot on surer ground.

Europe’s drone-filled vision for the future of war

Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers deployed an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” as part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog in the damp forests of Estonia’s eastern territories.The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How one controversial startup hopes to cool the planet

Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change—for a price.The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.

But numerous solar geoengineering researchers are skeptical that Stardust will line up the customers it needs to carry out a global deployment in the next decade. They’re also highly critical of the idea of a private company setting the global temperature for us.

Inside the decades-long fight over Yahoo’s misdeeds in ChinaWhen you think of Big Tech these days, Yahoo is probably not top of mind. But for Chinese dissident Xu Wanping, the company still looms large—and has for nearly two decades.In 2005, Xu was arrested for signing online petitions relating to anti-Japanese protests. He didn’t use his real name, but he did use his Yahoo email address. Yahoo China violated its users’ trust—providing information on certain email accounts to Chinese law enforcement, which in turn allowed the government to identify and arrest some users.Xu was one of them; he would serve nine years in prison. Now, he and five other Chinese former political prisoners are suing Yahoo and a slate of co-defendants—not because of the company’s information-sharing (which was the focus of an earlier lawsuit filed by other plaintiffs), but rather because of what came after.

            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. You can read more from the series here.

I am writing this because one of my editors woke up in the middle of the night and scribbled on a bedside notepad: “What is a parameter?” Unlike a lot of thoughts that hit at 4 a.m., it’s a really good question—one that goes right to the heart of how large language models work. And I’m not just saying that because he’s my boss. (Hi, Boss!)

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

Think back to middle school algebra, like 2a + b. Those letters are parameters: Assign them values and you get a result. In math or coding, parameters are used to set limits or determine output. The parameters inside LLMs work in a similar way, just on a mind-boggling scale.

Short answer: an algorithm. When a model is trained, each parameter is set to a random value. The training process then involves an iterative series of calculations (known as training steps) that update those values. In the early stages of training, a model will make errors. The training algorithm looks at each error and goes back through the model, tweaking the value of each of the model’s many parameters so that next time that error is smaller. This happens over and over again until the model behaves in the way its makers want it to. At that point, training stops and the values of the model’s parameters are fixed.

In theory! In practice, because LLMs are trained on so much data and contain so many parameters, training them requires a huge number of steps and an eye-watering amount of computation. During training, the 175 billion parameters inside a medium-size LLM like GPT-3 will each get updated tens of thousands of times. In total, that adds up to quadrillions (a number with 15 zeros) of individual calculations. That’s why training an LLM takes so much energy. We’re talking about thousands of specialized high-speed computers running nonstop for months.

There are three different types of parameters inside an LLM that get their values assigned through training: embeddings, weights, and biases. Let’s take each of those in turn.

An embedding is the mathematical representation of a word (or part of a word, known as a token) in an LLM’s vocabulary. An LLM’s vocabulary, which might contain up to a few hundred thousand unique tokens, is set by its designers before training starts. But there’s no meaning attached to those words. That comes during training.

When a model is trained, each word in its vocabulary is assigned a numerical value that captures the meaning of that word in relation to all the other words, based on how the word appears in countless examples across the model’s training data.

Yeah. But there’s a bit more to it. The numerical value—the embedding—that represents each word is in fact a list of numbers, with each number in the list representing a different facet of meaning that the model has extracted from its training data. The length of this list of numbers is another thing that LLM designers can specify before an LLM is trained. A common size is 4,096.

Yup, that’s an embedding. And each of those numbers is tweaked during training. An LLM with embeddings that are 4,096 numbers long is said to have 4,096 dimensions.

It might look like a strange number. But LLMs (like anything that runs on a computer chip) work best with powers of two—2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. LLM engineers have found that 4,096 is a power of two that hits a sweet spot between capability and efficiency. Models with fewer dimensions are less capable; models with more dimensions are too expensive or slow to train and run.

Using more numbers allows the LLM to capture very fine-grained information about how a word is used in many different contexts, what subtle connotations it might have, how it relates to other words, and so on.

Back in February, OpenAI released GPT-4.5, the firm’s largest LLM yet (some estimates have put its parameter count at more than 10 trillion). Nick Ryder, a research scientist at OpenAI who worked on the model, told me at the time that bigger models can work with extra information, like emotional cues, such as when a speaker’s words signal hostility: “All of these subtle patterns that come through a human conversation—those are the bits that these larger and larger models will pick up on.”

The upshot is that all the words inside an LLM get encoded into a high-dimensional space. Picture thousands of words floating in the air around you. Words that are closer together have similar meanings. For example, “table” and “chair” will be closer to each other than they are to “astronaut,” which is close to “moon” and “Musk.” Way off in the distance you can see “prestidigitation.” It’s a little like that, but instead of being related to each other across three dimensions, the words inside an LLM are related across 4,096 dimensions.

It’s dizzying stuff. In effect, an LLM compresses the entire internet into a single monumental mathematical structure that encodes an unfathomable amount of interconnected information. It’s both why LLMs can do astonishing things and why they’re impossible to fully understand.

A weight is a parameter that represents the strength of a connection between different parts of a model—and one of the most common types of dial for tuning a model’s behavior. Weights are used when an LLM processes text.

When an LLM reads a sentence (or a book chapter), it first looks up the embeddings for all the words and then passes those embeddings through a series of neural networks, known as transformers, that are designed to process sequences of data (like text) all at once. Every word in the sentence gets processed in relation to every other word.

This is where weights come in. An embedding represents the meaning of a word without context. When a word appears in a specific sentence, transformers use weights to process the meaning of that word in that new context. (In practice, this involves multiplying each embedding by the weights for all other words.)

Biases are another type of dial that complement the effects of the weights. Weights set the thresholds at which different parts of a model fire (and thus pass data on to the next part). Biases are used to adjust those thresholds so that an embedding can trigger activity even when its value is low. (Biases are values that are added to an embedding rather than multiplied with it.)

By shifting the thresholds at which parts of a model fire, biases allow the model to pick up information that might otherwise be missed. Imagine you’re trying to hear what somebody is saying in a noisy room. Weights would amplify the loudest voices the most; biases are like a knob on a listening device that pushes quieter voices up in the mix.

Here’s the TL;DR: Weights and biases are two different ways that an LLM extracts as much information as it can out of the text it is given. And both types of parameters are adjusted over and over again during training to make sure they do this.

No, neurons are more a way to organize all this math—containers for the weights and biases, strung together by a web of pathways between them. It’s all very loosely inspired by biological neurons inside animal brains, with signals from one neuron triggering new signals from the next and so on.

Each neuron in a model holds a single bias and weights for every one of the model’s dimensions. In other words, if a model has 4,096 dimensions—and therefore its embeddings are lists of 4,096 numbers—then each of the neurons in that model will hold one bias and 4,096 weights.

Neurons are arranged in layers. In most LLMs, each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the layer above. A 175-billion-parameter model like GPT-3 might have around 100 layers with a few tens of thousands of neurons in each layer. And each neuron is running tens of thousands of computations at a time.

When an LLM processes a piece of text, the numerical representation of that text—the embedding—gets passed through multiple layers of the model. In each layer, the value of the embedding (that list of 4,096 numbers) gets updated many times by a series of computations involving the model’s weights and biases (attached to the neurons) until it gets to the final layer.

The idea is that all the meaning and nuance and context of that input text is captured by the final value of the embedding after it has gone through a mind-boggling series of computations. That value is then used to calculate the next word that the LLM should spit out.

It won’t be a surprise that this is more complicated than it sounds: The model in fact calculates, for every word in its vocabulary, how likely that word is to come next and ranks the results. It then picks the top word. (Kind of. See below …)

That word is appended to the previous block of text, and the whole process repeats until the LLM calculates that the most likely next word to spit out is one that signals the end of its output.

LLM designers can also specify a handful of other parameters, known as hyperparameters. The main ones are called temperature, top-p, and top-k.

Temperature is a parameter that acts as a kind of creativity dial. It influences the model’s choice of what word comes next. I just said that the model ranks the words in its vocabulary and picks the top one. But the temperature parameter can be used to push the model to choose the most probable next word, making its output more factual and relevant, or a less probable word, making the output more surprising and less robotic.

Top-p and top-k are two more dials that control the model’s choice of next words. They are settings that force the model to pick a word at random from a pool of most probable words instead of the top word. These parameters affect how the model comes across—quirky and creative versus trustworthy and dull.

That’s one of the hottest questions in AI right now. There are a lot of different ways it can happen. Researchers have found that the amount of training data makes a huge difference. First you need to make sure the model sees enough data: An LLM trained on too little text won’t make the most of all its parameters, and a smaller model trained on the same amount of data could outperform it.

Another trick researchers have hit on is overtraining. Showing models far more data than previously thought necessary seems to make them perform better. The result is that a small model trained on a lot of data can outperform a larger model trained on less data. Take Meta’s Llama LLMs. The 70-billion-parameter Llama 2 was trained on around 2 trillion words of text; the 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 was trained on around 15 trillion words of text. The far smaller Llama 3 is the better model.

A third technique, known as distillation, uses a larger model to train a smaller one. The smaller model is trained not only on the raw training data but also on the outputs of the larger model’s internal computations. The idea is that the hard-won lessons encoded in the parameters of the larger model trickle down into the parameters of the smaller model, giving it a boost.

In fact, the days of single monolithic models may be over. Even the largest models on the market, like OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini 3, can be thought of as several small models in a trench coat. Using a technique called “mixture of experts,” large models can turn on just the parts of themselves (the “experts”) that are required to process a specific piece of text. This combines the abilities of a large model with the speed and lower power consumption of a small one.

But that’s not the end of it. Researchers are still figuring out ways to get the most out of a model’s parameters. As the gains from straight-up scaling tail off, jacking up the number of parameters no longer seems to make the difference it once did. It’s not so much how many you have, but what you do with them.

You want to see a parameter? Knock yourself out: Here&#39;s an embedding.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129748/aadhaar-nandan-nilekani-india-digital-biometric-identity-data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nandan Nilekani can’t stop trying to push India into the future. He started nearly 30 years ago, masterminding an ongoing experiment in technological state capacity that started with Aadhaar—the world’s largest digital identity system. Aadhaar means “foundation” in Hindi, and on that bedrock Nilekani and people working with him went on to build a sprawling collection of free, interoperating online tools that add up to nothing less than a digital infrastructure for society. They cover government services, digital payments, banking, credit, and health care, offering convenience and access that would be eye-popping in wealthy countries a tenth of India’s size. In India those systems are called, collectively, “digital public infrastructure,” or DPI.

At 70 years old, Nilekani should be retired. But he has a few more ideas. India’s electrical grid is creaky and prone to failure; Nilekani wants to add a layer of digital communication to stabilize it. And then there’s his idea to expand the financial functions in DPI to the rest of the world, creating a global digital backbone for commerce that he calls the “finternet.”

“It sounds like some crazy stuff,” Nilekani says. “But I think these are all big ideas, which over the next five years will have demonstrable, material impact.” As a last act in public life, why not Aadhaarize the world?

Today, a farmer in a village in India, hours from the nearest bank, can collect welfare payments or transfer money by simply pressing a thumb to a fingerprint scanner at the local store. Digitally authenticated copies of driver’s licenses, birth certificates, and educational records can be accessed and shared via a digital wallet that sits on your smartphone.

In big cities, where cash is less and less common (just trying to break a bill can be a major headache), mobile payments are ubiquitous, whether you’re buying a TV from a high-street retailer or a coconut from a roadside cart. There are no fees, and any payment app or bank account can send money to any other. The country’s chaotic patchwork of public and private hospitals have begun digitizing all their medical records and uploading them to a nationwide platform. On the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), people can do online shopping searches on whatever app they want, and the results show sellers from an array of other platforms, too. The idea is to liberate small merchants and consumers from the walled gardens of online shopping giants like Amazon and the domestic giant Flipkart.

In the most populous nation on Earth—with 1.4 billion people—a large portion of the bureaucracy anyone encounters in daily life happens seamlessly and in the cloud.

At the heart of all these tools is Aadhaar. The system gives every Indian a 12-digit number that, in combination with either a fingerprint scan or an SMS code, allows access to government services, SIM cards, basic bank accounts, digital signature services, and social welfare payments. The Indian government says that since its inception in 2009, Aadhaar has saved 3.48 trillion rupees ($39.2 billion) by boosting efficiency, bypassing corrupt officials, and cutting other types of fraud. The system is controversial and imperfect—a database with 1.4 billion people in it comes with inherent security and privacy concerns. Still, in the most populous nation on Earth, a big portion of the bureaucracy anyone might encounter in daily life just happens in the cloud.

Nilekani was behind much of that innovation, marshaling an army of civil servants, tech companies, and volunteers. Now he sees it in action every day. “It reinforces that what you have done is not some abstract stuff, but real stuff for real people,” he says.

By his own admission, Nilekani is entering the twilight of his career. But it’s not over yet. He’s now “chief mentor” for the India Energy Stack (IES), a government initiative to connect the fragmented data held by companies responsible for generating, transmitting, and distributing power. India’s grids are unstable and disparate, but Nilekani hopes an Aadhaar-like move will help. IES aims to give unique digital identities not only to power plants and energy storage facilities but even to rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles. All the data attached to those things—device characteristics, energy rating certifications, usage information—will be in a common, machine-readable format and shared on the same open protocols.

Ideally, that’ll give grid operators a real-time view of energy supply and demand. And if it works, it might also make it simpler and cheaper for anyone to connect to the grid—even everyday folks selling excess power from their rooftop solar rigs, says RS Sharma, the chair of the project and Nilekani’s deputy while building Aadhaar.

Nilekani’s other side hustle is even more ambitious. His idea for a global “finternet” combines Aadhaarization with blockchains—creating digital representations called tokens for not only financial instruments like stocks or bonds but also real-world assets like houses or jewelry. Anyone from a bank to an asset manager or even a company could create and manage these tokens, but Nilekani’s team especially hopes the idea will help poor people trade their assets, or use them as loan collateral—expanding financial services to those who otherwise couldn’t access them.

It sounds almost wild-eyed. Yet the finternet project has 30 partners across four continents. Nilekani says it’ll launch next year.

Nilekani was born in Bengaluru, in 1955. His family was middle class and, Nilekani says, “seized with societal issues and challenges.” His upbringing was also steeped in the kind of socialism espoused by the newish nation’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

After studying electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, in 1981 Nilekani helped found Infosys, an information technology company that pioneered outsourcing and helped turned India into the world’s IT back office. In 1999, he was part of a government-appointed task force trying to upgrade the infrastructure and services in Bengaluru, then emerging as India’s tech capital. But Nilekani was at the time leery of being viewed as just another techno-optimist. “I didn’t want to be seen as naive enough to believe that tech could solve everything,” he says.

Seeing the scope of the problem changed his mind—sclerotic bureaucracy, endemic corruption, and financial exclusion were intractable without technological solutions. In 2008 Nilekani published a book, Imagining India: The Idea of a Renewed Nation. It was a manifesto for an India that could leapfrog into a networked future.

And it got him a job. At the time more than half the births in the country were not recorded, and up to 400 million Indians had no official identity document. Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, asked Nilekani to put into action an ill-defined plan to create a national identity card.

Nilekani’s team made a still-controversial decision to rely on biometrics. A system based on people’s fingerprints and retina scans meant nobody could sign up twice, and nobody had to carry paperwork. In terms of execution, it was like trying to achieve industrialization but skip a steam era. Deployment required a monumental data collection effort, as well as new infrastructure that could compare each new enrollment against hundreds of millions of existing records in seconds. At its peak, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the agency responsible for administering Aadhaar, was registering more than a million new users a day. That happened with a technical team of just about 50 developers, and in the end cost slightly less than half a billion dollars.

Buoyed by their success, Nilekani and his allies started casting around for other problems they could solve using the same digitize-the-real-world playbook. “We built more and more layers of capability,” Nilekani says, “and then this became a wider-ranging idea. More grandiose.”

While other countries were building digital backbones with full state control (as in China) or in public-private partnerships that favored profit-seeking corporate approaches (as in the US), Nilekani thought India needed something else. He wanted critical technologies in areas like identity, payments, and data sharing to be open and interoperable, not monopolized by either the state or private industry. So the tools that make up DPI use open standards and open APIs, meaning that anyone can plug into the system. No single company or institution controls access—no walled gardens.

Of course, another way to look at putting financial and government services and records into giant databases is that it’s a massive risk to personal liberty. Aadhaar, in particular, has faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned about the potential for surveillance. Several high-profile data breaches of Aadhaar records held by government entities have shaken confidence in the system, most recently in 2023, when security researchers found hackers selling the records of more than 800 million Indians on the dark web.

Technically, this shouldn’t matter—an Aadhaar number ought to be useless without biometric or SMS-based authentication. It’s “a myth that this random number is a very powerful number,” says Sharma, the onetime co-lead of UIDAI. “I don’t have any example where somebody’s Aadhaar disclosure would have harmed somebody.”

One problem is that in everyday use, Aadhaar users often bypass the biometric authentication system. To ensure that people use a genuine address at registration, Aadhaar administrators give people their numbers on an official-looking document. Indians co-opted this paperwork as a proof of identity on its own. And since the document—Indians even call it an “Aadhaar card”—doesn’t have an expiration date, it’s possible for people to get multiple valid cards with different details by changing their address or date of birth. That’s quite a loophole. In 2018 an NGO report found that 67% of people using Aadhaar to open a bank account relied on this verification document rather than digital authentication. That report was the last time anyone published data on the problem, so nobody knows how bad it is today. “Everybody’s living on anecdotes,” says Kiran Jonnalagadda, an anti-Aadhaar activist.

In other cases, flaws in Aadhaar’s biometric technology have caused people to be denied essential government services. The government downplays these risks, but again, it’s impossible to tell how serious the problem is because the UIDAI won’t disclose numbers. “There needs to be a much more honest acknowledgment, documentation, and then an examination of how those exclusions can be mitigated,” says Apar Gupta, director of the Internet Freedom Foundation.

Beyond the potential for fraud, it’s also true that the free and interoperable tools haven’t reached all the people who might find them useful, especially among India’s rural and poorer populations. Nilekani’s hopes for openness haven’t fully come to pass. Big e-commerce companies still dominate, and retail sales on ONDC have been dropping steadily since 2024, when financial incentives to participate began to taper off. The digital payments and government documentation services have hundreds of millions of users, numbers most global technology companies would love to see—but in a country as large as India, that leaves a lot of people out.

The usually calm Nilekani bristles at that criticism; he has heard it before. Detractors overlook the dysfunction that preceded these efforts, he says, and he remains convinced that technology was the only way forward. “How do you move a country of 1.4 billion people?” he asks. “There’s no other way you can fix it.”

The proof is self-evident, he says. Indians have opened more than 500 million basic bank accounts using Aadhaar; before it came into use, millions of those people had been completely unbanked. Earlier this year, India’s Unified Payments Interface overtook Visa as the world’s largest real-time payments system. “There is no way Aadhaar could have worked but for the fact that people needed this thing,” Nilekani says. “There’s no way payments would have worked without people needing it. So the voice of the people—they’re voting with their feet.”

That need might be present in countries beyond India. “Many countries don’t have a proper birth registration system. Many countries don’t have a payment system. Many countries don’t have a way for data to be leveraged,” Nilekani says. “So this is a very powerful idea.” It seems to be spreading. Foreign governments regularly send delegations to Bengaluru to study India’s DPI tools. The World Bank and the United Nations have tried to introduce the concept to other developing countries equally eager to bring their economies into the digital age. The Gates Foundation has established projects to promote digital infrastructure, and Nilekani has set up and funded a network of think tanks, research institutes, and other NGOs aimed at, as he says, “propagating the gospel.”

Still, he admits he might not live to see DPI go global. “There are two races,” Nilekani says. “My personal race against time and India’s race against time.” He worries that the economic potential of its vast young population—the so-called demographic dividend—could turn into a demographic disaster. Despite rapid growth, gains have been uneven. Youth unemployment remains stubbornly high—a particularly volatile problem in a large and economically turbulent country.

“Maybe I’m a junkie,” he says. “Why the hell am I doing all this? I think I need it. I think I need to keep curious and alive and looking at the future.” But that’s the thing about building the future: It never quite arrives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Water shortages in Southern California made an indelible impression on Evelyn Wang ’00 when she was growing up in Los Angeles. “I was quite young, perhaps in first grade,” she says. “But I remember we weren’t allowed to turn our sprinklers on. And everyone in the neighborhood was given disinfectant tablets for the toilet and encouraged to keep flushing to a minimum. I didn’t understand exactly what was happening. But I saw that everyone in the community was affected by the scarcity of this resource.”

Today, as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities around the world, Wang is leading MIT’s effort to tackle the interlinked challenges of a changing climate and a burgeoning global demand for energy. Last April, after wrapping up a two-year stint directing the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E), she returned to the campus where she’d been both an undergraduate and a faculty member to become the inaugural vice president for energy and climate.

“The accelerating problem of climate change and its countless impacts represent the greatest scientific, technical, and policy challenge of this or any age,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a January 2025 letter to the MIT community announcing the appointment. “We are tremendously fortunate that Evelyn Wang has agreed to lead this crucial work.”

MIT has studied and worked on problems of climate and energy for decades. In recent years, with temperatures rising, storms strengthening, and energy demands surging, that work has expanded and intensified, spawning myriad research projects, policy proposals, papers, and startups. The challenges are so urgent that MIT launched several Institute-wide initiatives, including President Rafael Reif’s Climate Grand Challenges (2020) and President Kornbluth’s Climate Project (2024).

But Kornbluth has argued that MIT needs to do even more. Her creation of the new VP-level post that Wang now holds underscores that commitment.

Wang is well suited for the role. The Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT and former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, she joined the faculty in 2007, shortly after she completed her PhD at Stanford University. Her research centers on thermal management and energy conversion and storage, but she also works on nano-engineered surfaces and materials, as well as water harvesting and purification. Wang and her colleagues have produced a device based on nanophotonic crystals that could double the efficiency of solar cells—one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017. And the device she invented with Nobel laureate Omar Yaghi for extracting water from very dry air was named one of 2017’s top 10 emerging technologies by Scientific American and the World Economic Forum, and in 2018 earned her the Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water. (See story on this water harvesting research in the January/February issue of MIT Technology Review.)

Wang has a deep knowledge of the Institute—and even deeper roots here. (See “Family Ties,” MIT Alumni News, March/April 2015.) Her parents met at MIT as PhD students from Taiwan in the 1960s; they were married in the MIT chapel. When Wang arrived at MIT in 1996 as a first-year student, her brother Alex ’96, MEng ’97, had just graduated and was working on a master’s degree in electrical engineering. Her other brother, Ben, would earn his PhD at MIT in 2007. She even met her husband, Russell Sammon ’98, at MIT. Apart from her time at ARPA-E, a very brief stint at Bell Labs, and sabbatical work at Google, she has spent her entire professional career at the Institute. So she has a rare perspective on the resources MIT can draw on to respond to the climate and energy challenge.

“The beating heart of MIT is innovation,” she says. “We are innovators. And innovation is something that will help us leapfrog some of the potential hurdles as we work toward climate and energy solutions. Our ability to innovate can enable us to move closer toward energy security, toward sustainable resource development and use.”

The prevailing innovative mindset at MIT is backed by a deep desire to tackle the problem.Many people on campus are passionate about climate and energy, says Wang. “That is why President Kornbluth made this her flagship initiative. We are fortunate to have so many talented students and faculty, and to be able to rely on our infrastructure. I know they will all step up to meet the challenges.” But she is quick to point out that the problems are too large for any one entity—including MIT—to address on its own. So she’s aiming to encourage more collaboration both among MIT researchers and with other institutions.

“If we want to solve this problem of climate change, if we want to change the trajectory in the next decade, we cannot continue to do business as usual,” she says. “That is what is most exciting about this problem and, frankly, is why I came back to campus to take this job.”

The coupling of climate and energy in Wang’s portfolio is strategic. “Energy and climate are two sides of the same coin,” she explains. “A major reason we are seeing climate change is that we haven’t deployed solutions at a scale necessary to mitigate the CO2 emissions from the energy sector. The ways we generate energy and manage emissions are fundamental to any strategy addressing climate change. At the same time, the world demands more and more energy—a demand we can’t possibly meet through a single means.”

“Zero-emissions and low-carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate … We need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

What’s more, she contends that switching from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, while fundamental, is only part of the solution. “Zero-emissions and low-­carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate,” she says. “We need to consider the environmental impacts of these new fuels we develop and deploy. We need to use data analysis to move goods and energy more efficiently and intelligently. We need to consider raising more of our food in water and using food by-products and waste to help sequester carbon. In short, we need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

That challenge seems destined to grow more daunting in the coming years. There are still, Wang observes, areas of “energy poverty”—places where people cannot access sufficient energy to sustain their well-being. But solving that problem will only drive up energy production and consumption worldwide. The explosive growth of AI will likely do the same, since the huge data centers that power the technology require enormous quantities of energy for both computation and cooling.

Wang believes that while AI will continue to drive electricity demand, it can also contribute to creating a more sustainable future.“We can use AI to develop climate and energy solutions,” she says. “AI can play a primary role in solution sets, can give us new and improved ways to manage intermittent loads in the energy grid. It can help us develop new catalysts and chemicals or help us stabilize the plasma we’ll use in nuclear fusion. It could augment climate and geospatial modeling that would allow us to predict the impact of potential climate solutions before we implement them. We could even use AI to reduce computational needs and thereby ease cooling demand.”

MIT was humming with climate and energy research long before Wang returned to campus in 2025 after wrapping up her work at ARPA-E. Almost 400 researchers across 90% of MIT’s departments responded to President Reif’s 2020 Climate Grand Challenges initiative. The Institute awarded $2.7 million to 27 finalist teams and identified five flagship projects, including one to create an early warning system to help mitigate the impact of climate disasters, another to predict and prepare for extreme weather events, and an ambitious project to slash nearly half of all industrial carbon emissions.

About 250 MIT faculty and senior researchers are now involved in the Climate Project at MIT, a campus-wide initiative launched in 2024 that works to generate and implement climate solutions, tools, and policy proposals. Conceived to bolster MIT’s already significant efforts as a leading source of technological, behavioral, and policy solutions to global climate issues, the Climate Project has identified six “missions”: decarbonizing energy and industry; preserving the atmosphere, land, and oceans; empowering frontline community action; designing resilient and prosperous cities; enabling new policy approaches; and wild cards, a catch-all category that supports development of unconventional solutions outside the scope of the other missions. Faculty members direct each mission.

With so much climate research already underway,a large part of Wang’s new role is to support and deepen existing projects. But to fully tap into MIT’s unique capabilities, she says, she’s aiming to foster some cultural shifts. And that begins with identifying ways to facilitate cooperation—both across the Institute and with external partners—on a scale that can make “something truly transformational” happen, she says. “At this stage, with the challenges we face in energy and climate, we need to do something ambitious.”

In Wang’s view, getting big results depends on taking a big-picture, holistic approach that will require unprecedented levels of collaboration. “MIT faculty have always treasured their independence and autonomy,” she says. “Traditionally, we’ve tried to let 1,000 flowers bloom. And traditionally we’ve done that well, often with outstanding results. But climate and energy are systems problems, which means we need to create a systems solution. How do we bring these diverse faculty together? How do we align their efforts, not just in technology, but also in policy, science, finance, and social sciences?”

To encourage MIT faculty to collaborate across departments, schools, and disciplines, Wang recently announced that the MIT Climate Project would award grants of $50,000 to $250,000 to collaborative faculty teams that work on six- to 24-month climate research projects. Student teams are invited to apply for research grants of up to $15,000.“We can’t afford to work in silos,” she says. “People from wildly diverse fields are working on the same problems and speaking different professional languages. We need to bring people together in an integrative way so we can attack the problem holistically.”

Wang also wants colleagues to reach beyond campus. MIT, she says, needs to form real, defined partnerships with other universities, as well as with industries, investors, and philanthropists. “This isn’t just an MIT problem,” she says. “Individual efforts and 1,000 flowers alone will not be enough to meet these challenges.”

Thinking holistically—and in terms of systems—will help focus efforts on the areas that will have the greatest impact. At a Climate Project presentation in October, Wang outlined an approach that would focus on building well-being within communities. This will begin with efforts to empower communities by developing coastal resilience, to decarbonize ports and shipping, and to design and build data centers that integrate smoothly and sustainably with nearby communities. She encouraged her colleagues to think in terms of big-picture solutions for the future and then to work on the components needed to build that future.

“As researchers, we sometimes jump to a solution before we have fully defined the problem,” she explains. “Let’s take the problem of decarbonization in transportation. The solution we’ve come up with is to electrify our vehicles. When we run up against the problem of the range of these vehicles, our first thought is to create higher-density batteries. But the real problem we’re facing isn’t about batteries. It’s about increasing the range of these vehicles. And the solution to that problem isn’t necessarily a more powerful battery.”

“Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom … The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing?”

Wang is confident that her MIT colleagues have both the capacity and the desire to embrace the holistic approach she envisions. “When I was accepted to MIT as an undergraduate and visited the campus, the thing that made me certain I wanted to enroll here was the people,” she recalls. “They weren’t just talented. They had so many different interests. They were passionate about solving big problems. And they were eager to learn from one another. That spirit hasn’t changed. And that’s the spirit I and my team can tap into.”

Wang believes MIT and other institutions working on climate and energy solutions also need to change how we talk about the challenge. “Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom,” she says. “The underlying issue here is our well-being. That’s what we care about, not the climate. The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing? How can we create conditions of resilience, sustainability, and prosperity? That is the framework I would like us to build on.” For example, in areas where extreme weather threatens homes or rising temperatures are harming human health, we should be developing affordable technologies that make dwellings more resilient and keep people cooler.

Wang’s colleagues at MIT concur with her assessment of the mission ahead. They also have a deep respect for her scholarship and leadership. “I couldn’t think of a better person to represent MIT’s diverse and powerful ability to attack climate,” says Susan Solomon, the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies at MIT and recipient of the US National Medal of Science for her work on the Antarctic ozone hole. “Communicating MIT’s capabilities to provide what the nation needs—not only in engineering but also in … economics, the physical, chemical, and biological sciences, and much more—is an immense challenge.” But she’s confident that Wang will do it justice. “Evelyn is a consummate storyteller,” she says.

“She’s tremendously quick at learning new fields and driving toward what the real nuggets are that need to be addressed in solving hard problems,” says Elsa Olivetti, PhD ’07, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering and director of the MIT Climate Project’s Decarbonizing Energy and Industry mission. “Her direct, meticulous thinking and leadership style mean that she can focus teams within her office to do the work that will be most impactful at scale.”

Wang’s experience at ARPA-E is expected to be especially useful. “The current geopolitical situation and the limited amount of research funding available relative to the scale of the climate problem pose formidable challenges to bringing MIT’s strengths to bear on the problem,” says Rohit Karnik, director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) and a collaborator with Wang on numerous projects and initiatives since both joined the mechanical engineering faculty in 2007. “Evelyn’s leadership experience at MIT and in government, her ability to take a complex situation and define a clear vision, and her passion to make a difference will serve her well in her new role.”

Wang’s new MIT appointment is seen as a good thing beyond the Institute as well. “A role like this requires a skill set that is difficult to find in one individual,” says Krista Walton, vice chancellor for research and innovation at North Carolina State University. Walton and Wang collaborated on multiple projects, including the DARPA work that produced the device for extracting water from very dry air based on the original prototype Wang co-developed. “You need scientific depth, an understanding of the federal and global landscape, a collaborative instinct and the ability to be a convener, and a strategic vision,” Walton says—and she can’t imagine a better pick for the job.

“Evelyn has an extraordinary ability to bridge fundamental science with real-world application,” she says. “She approaches collaboration as a true partnership and not as a transaction.”

Climate scientists explore broad swaths of time, tracking trends in temperature, greenhouse gases, volcanic activity, vegetation, and more across hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years. Even average temperatures and precipitation levels are calculated over periods of three decades.

But in the realm of politics, change happens much faster, prompting sudden and sometimes startling shifts in culture and policy. The current US administration has proposed widespread budget cuts in climate and energy research. These have included slicing more than $1.5 billion from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), canceling multiple climate-related missions at NASA, and shuttering the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the agency responsible for publishing the National Climate Assessment. The Trump administration submitted a budget request that would cut the National Science Foundation budget from more than $9 billion to just over $4 billion for 2026. The New York Times reported that NSF grant funding for STEM education from January through mid-May 2025 was down 80% from its 10-year average, while NSF grant awards for math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and materials science research were down 67%. In September, the US Department of Energy announced it had terminated 223 projects that “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Among the agencies affected is ARPA-E, the agency Wang directed before returning to MIT. Meanwhile, MIT research programs that rely on government sources of funding will also feel the impact of the cuts.

Acknowledging the difficulties she and MIT may face in the present moment, Wang still prefers to look forward. “Of course this is a challenging time,” she says. “There are near-term challenges and long-term challenges. We need to focus on those long-term challenges. As President Kornbluth has said, we need to continue to advocate for research and education. We need to pursue long-term solutions, to follow our convictions in addressing problems in energy and climate. And we need to be ready to seize the opportunities that reside in these long-term challenges.”

Wang also sees openings for short-term collaboration—areas where MIT and the current administration can find common ground and goals. “There is still a huge area of opportunity for us to align our interests with those of this administration,” she says. “We can move the needle forward together on energy, on national security, on minerals, on economic competitiveness. All these are interests we share, and there are pathways we can follow to meet these challenges to our nation together. MIT is a major force in the nuclear space, in both fission and fusion. These, along with geothermal, could provide the power base we need to meet our energy demands. There are significant opportunities for partnerships with this or any administration to unlock some of these innovations and implement them.”

While she views herself as a researcher and an academic, Wang’s relevant government experience should prove especially useful in her VP role at MIT. In her two years as director of ARPA-E, she coordinated a broad array of the US Department of Energy’s early-stage research and development in energy generation, storage, and use. “I think I had the best job in government,” she says. Designed to operate at arm’s length from the Department of Energy, ARPA-E searches for high-risk, high-reward energy innovation projects. “More than one observer has called ARPA-E a moonshot factory,” she says.

Seeking out and facilitating “moonshot”-­worthy projects at a national and sometimes global scale gave Wang a broader lens through which to view issues of energy and climate. It also taught her that big ideas do not translate into big solutions automatically. “I learned what it takes to make an impact on energy technology at ARPA-E and I will be forever grateful,” she says. “I saw how game-changing ideas can take a decade to go from concept to deployment. I learned to appreciate the diversity of talent and innovation in the national ecosystem composed of laboratories, startups, and institutions. I saw how that ecosystem could zero in to identify real problems, envision diverse pathways, and create prototypes. And I also saw just how hard that journey is.”

MIT researchers are tackling climate and energy issues from multiple angles, working on everything from decarbonizing energy and industry to designing resilient and prosperous cities. Find out more at climateproject.mit.edu.

While MIT is already an important element in that ecosystem, Wang and her colleagues want the Institute to play an even more prominent role. “We can be a convener and collaborator, first across all of MIT’s departments, and then with industry, the financial world, and governments,” she says. “We need to do aggressive outreach and find like-minded partners.”

“Although the problems of climate and climate change are global, the most effective way MIT can address them is locally,” said Wang at the October presentation of the MIT Climate Project. “Working across schools and disciplines, collaborating with external partners, we will develop targeted solutions for individual places and communities—solutions that can then serve as templates for other places and communities.” But she also cautions against one-size-fits-all solutions. “Solar panels, for example, work wonderfully, but only in areas that have sufficient space and sunlight,” she explains. “Institutions like MIT can showcase a diversity of approaches and determine the best approach for each individual context.”

Most of all, Wang wants her colleagues to be proactive. “Because MIT is a factory of ideas, perhaps even a moonshot factory, we need to think boldly and continue to think boldly so we can make an impact as soon as possible,” she says. She also wants her colleagues to stay hopeful and not feel daunted by a challenge that can at times feel overwhelming. “We will build pilots, one at a time, and demonstrate that these projects are not only possible but practical,” she says. “And that is how we will build a future everyone wants to live in.”

            <div id="article-text">Few people, if any, contemplate stars—celestial or cinematic—the way Aomawa Shields does.

An astronomer and astrobiologist, Shields explores the potential habitability of planets beyond our solar system. But she is also a classically trained actor—and that’s helped shape her professional trajectory in unexpected ways.

Today, Shields is an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine, where she oversees a research team that uses computer models to explore conditions on exoplanets, or planets that revolve around stars other than the sun. But while searching for life many light-years away is her day job, creative endeavors round out her purpose on Earth.

In 2023 Shields published a memoir, Life on Other Planets: A Memoir of Finding My Place in the Universe. She has started an influential educational program that encourages young girls to explore space, given a hugely popular TED Talk about how we’ll find life on other planets, and won a string of prestigious academic awards, honors, and grants. She also plays the violin, cooks, practices yoga, and is a mom. And as what she calls a “rest leader”—a professional proponent of slowing down—Shields has somehow managed the seemingly impossible: She makes time.

Her unorthodox path began on the screen, in the realm of make-believe.

“I wanted to become an astronaut. That dream started very early in my life, at the age of 12, after seeing a movie that dramatized kids getting launched into space,” she says, referring to SpaceCamp, an ’80s kids’ comedy about an accidental space shuttle flight.

The next bit of cinematic inspiration cemented her interest.

“Charlotte Blackwood was an astrophysicist, and she was very glamorous, too,” Shields says, smiling at how she was captivated by the heroine in Top Gun. “There’s an iconic scene where she’s walking down the aisle between Tom Cruise and other pilot trainees, and she just kind of whips off her glasses and just looks like such a badass.”

A high-achieving student while growing up in California, Canada, and Massachusetts, Shields made her way to Phillips Exeter Academy, in large part drawn by its state-of-the-art astronomical observatory. Once there, she got pulled into acting in a serious way. “Enter a new dream,” she says.

Throughout high school her astronomy and acting aspirations “kind of danced beside each other,” Shields remembers. “But I held firm to the first one and went to MIT because I understood that it’s the best science school in the country. I learned that at the age of 12—that’s where I’m going to go.”

At MIT, Shields struggled academically at first and took refuge in the creative arts. She was chosen to participate in the Burchard Scholars Program, whose monthly dinner seminars bring faculty members together with students who excel in the arts, social sciences, and humanities. She sang in the a cappella group the Muses and performed in lots of plays. At the end of her senior year, she found herself wondering: “Do I go to grad school in acting or astronomy?”

“There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD.”

The latter won out, but not for long. Shields headed to a graduate program in astronomy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “During that year, I had a white male professor tell me to consider other career options, and that was hard to hear,” she says. She remembers thinking, “I’m going to the other dream because clearly someone’s telling me that I don’t belong here. Maybe they’re right.”

So she applied to UCLA, where she got an MFA in acting, leaving astronomy for more than a decade. But then, when Shields was working odd jobs to supplement her acting gigs, a mentor from her undergraduate years encouraged her to look on a Caltech-operated job website. She saw an opening for a help desk operator at the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that is particularly adept at viewing the formation of young stars—and it only required a bachelor’s degree. “I’d refer the harder questions to the PhDs,” she says. “But by taking that job, I got to go to astronomy talks again … This field of exoplanets had just exploded during the time I’d been away.”

Shields had some success in acting, including a part in a film called Nine Lives, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. But a big break—and then heartbreak—came after she was cast as the host of the show Wired Science, only to lose the job when the producers decided to change presenters. It was a “devastating moment,” she says.

Soon after, she emailed the astrophysicist and science communications luminary Neil deGrasse Tyson, whom she’d been introduced to over email by an astronomer working with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and relayed what had happened. He replied that he’d seen her in the pilot and told her that “without a PhD you don’t have that street cred if you want to do science television,” she recalls. Meanwhile, she had applied to NASA’s astronaut candidate program but didn’t make it past the first level. (She did, however, get to play an astronaut in a recent Toyota ad.) “There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD,” she says. So she did, earning her doctorate in astronomy and astrobiology in 2014 from the University of Washington.

Astrobiology, Shields explains, is a relatively new field that studies the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe: “It’s about how life got started on Earth.”

Astrobiologists might focus on the habitability of planets, or on methods for exploring life on other planets, or on liquids other than water that could support life. It’s a highly interdisciplinary field. “There are astronomers that are looking for these planets and are using their particular field of expertise to answer that question: Are we alone?” Shields explains. Some of them are “also chemists and biologists and oceanographers and geologists who tackle these questions from their own lens and specific area of expertise,” she says. “That’s why I love it. As an astrobiologist, we don’t have to get 15 PhDs. We get to collaborate with people in different departments who lend their own expertise … on those science questions.”

Shields is trying to answer a question sparked by the night sky—one that’s deeply personal yet universal in both the astronomical and the colloquial sense. “Ever since I was a little girl, I would look up at the sky and wonder what was out there,” she says. “It comes from a sense of wonder for me. I still have that feeling when I look up at the night sky and I see these little pinpoints of light. I wonder: Is there anyone looking back at me? … How far does space go?”

There are, she explains, 100 billion stars in our galaxy, most orbited by at least one planet, and over 100 billion galaxies beyond ours. That’s about 1022 stars in the universe. The likelihood that only Earth was able to produce life “I think is pretty low,” Shields says.

“I’m looking for planetary environments that could be conducive to life beyond Earth,” she says. “And my team does that largely using climate models. These are the same kinds of models that can predict climate and weather on Earth.”

Shields plugs information gathered by observational astronomers into such models, along with different potential combinations of other, unknown variables—like the type of light a planet receives from its host star, the composition of its atmosphere and surface, and certain orbital information. “There’s only so much that you can really tell about a planet from the telescope information that you get,” she explains. “We can explore that parameter space with climate models and say: Okay, if it has this surface composition, this is what the temperature would be like on this planet. If it has this atmospheric composition, this type of orbit, this is what the climate would be like, and this is how habitable it would be across its surface.”

Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered 6,000 exoplanets. Shields says those in Earth’s size range—in which she’s most interested—number in the hundreds. A smaller subset of those are orbiting in what’s called the “habitable zone” of their star, creating warm enough conditions to maintain water in liquid form—the key to life. So far, as many as 100 or so planets that fall into that category have been identified, but the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, could find even more potentially habitable planets by detecting “biosignatures” suggesting a biological presence, such as particular gases in their atmospheres or glints that might be reflections of water on the planetary surface.

Being able to detect more of these sorts of signals, Shields says, is the next “big mission” in astronomy.

Today, in her academic work, her mind hurtles to the farthest reaches of the universe. But in her precious hours outside of academia, she has learned to be still. When her work schedule started to overwhelm her, Shields’s health began to suffer. Then she discovered the practice of yoga nidra—an ancient form of meditation in which practitioners are guided into a deeply restful “yogic sleep.” Shields read the book Do Less: A Revolutionary Approach to Time and Energy Management for Ambitious Women, which claims that 20 or 30 minutes of yoga nidra “feels like three hours of sleep in your body,” she says. “And as the mother of a young child, I was like: Okay, sign me up!”

Last year she trained with Karen Brody, author of Daring to Rest: Reclaim Your Power with Yoga Nidra Rest Meditation, and became a certified facilitator. “It’s been important to me to share it broadly and to really try to do my part to introduce the culture of academia, in particular, to this notion of resting as a daily practice,” she says. Now she’s at work on a book about her attempt to moderate—to resist the temptation to take on too much. She has learned to decline invitations and put firm boundaries between her work and personal life.

Shields has realized that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Combining them makes her a more effective educator.

On a weekday in August, an ayurvedic soup simmers on her kitchen stove. A music stand occupies the corner of a room where she sometimes picks up her violin and plays fiddle tunes. (Her parents, both professional musicians, derived her name from a chant of vowel sounds they made up.) She mentions the poem “swim | women of color”by Nayyirah Waheed and recites it in a soft, rich voice. Part of it goes: “This structure counts on your inability to say no. mean no. they take no from our first breath. go back and return it to your mouth. your heart. your light.”

“I need to graciously let go or say no—make room for someone else to say yes,” Shields says. “That allows me to have more spaciousness in my schedule, because one thing I’ve discovered is that women of color, as we proceed up the academic ladder, the requests just exponentially increase, and so saying no is not simply an important skill—it’s a survival skill.”

Along the way, Shields has come to realize that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. In fact, combining them—and sharing her passion for both—makes her a more effective educator. Her training as an actor helps her craft lectures that keep students engaged and animates her presentations, including her TED Talk, in a way that resonates with nonscientists.

Shields is also tapping into her love of acting to inspire the next generation of scientists who will help answer astronomy’s big questions. As part of a postdoctoral fellowship through the National Science Foundation, she was asked to design an educational outreach component. “I was like: Is there a scenario in which I could use acting to teach astronomy?” she says. “And I looked it up. There was precedent for that. Astronomy education journals had shown that when you involve girls in creative arts—theater, writing—and you incorporate that into astronomy education, you increase girls’ confidence in both asking and answering questions.”

The finding resonated with her own experience. After all, it was acting—which she turned to when her professor discouraged her from studying astronomy—that gave her the confidence to pursue astronomy again. “I looked at acting as this outlet, this safe space,” she says. “Nobody could tell me that I was wrong as an actor.”

With that in mind, Shields launched Rising Stargirls, which holds workshops using the creative arts to teach astronomy to ­middle-school-aged girls of all backgrounds. She and her colleagues have since published a study showing that girls who attended the program reported being more excited to take science classes and were more likely to believe they could do well in science.

“We want them to know that who they are is inherently pivotal and critical to their study and practice of astronomy,” Shields says. “The sciences are incredibly creative, and they get to bring that creative imagination and creative inspiration they find through the arts into learning about the universe.”

That same exchange has played out in Shields’s life, but it’s only recently that she’s come to see similarities between her roles as an astronomer and an actor. “They’re both about story,” she says.

Actors have to convey the arc or evolution of a story through the lives of their characters. “Stars, ­planets—they have lives, too,” Shields says. “They have births, they have evolution, and they die. It’s my job as a scientist to unveil the story—to discover the story of whether there’s life elsewhere.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.
