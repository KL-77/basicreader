            <h2>Russia is about to do the most Russia thing ever with its next space station</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/russia-is-about-to-do-the-most-russia-thing-ever-with-its-next-space-station/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For several years now, in discussing plans for its human spaceflight program beyond the International Space Station, Russian officials would proudly bring up the Russian Orbital Station, or ROS.

The first elements of ROS were to launch in 2027 so it would be ready for human habitation in 2028. Upon completion in the mid-2030s, the station would encompass seven shiny new modules, potentially including a private habitat for space tourists. It would be so sophisticated that the station could fly autonomously for months if needed.

Importantly, the Russian station was also to fly in a polar orbit at about 400 km. This would allow the station to fly over the entirety of Russia, observing the whole country. It would be important for national pride because cosmonauts would not need to launch from Kazakhstan anymore. Rather, rockets launching from the country’s new spaceport in eastern Russia, the Vostochny Cosmodrome, would easily reach the ROS in its polar orbit.

That was the plan, at least until this week, when a Russian official dropped a bombshell.

Oleg Orlov, director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said ROS will no longer be composed of entirely new modules. Rather, its core will be the Russian segment of the International Space Station.

“The Scientific and Technical Council of Roscosmos supported this proposal and approved the deployment of a Russian orbital station as part of the Russian segment of the ISS,” Orlov reportedly said.

Orlov’s announcement sheds light on a statement earlier in December from First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov on the station’s orbit, which now makes more sense. “We’ve decided on a 51.6-degree inclination angle for our ROS space station,” he said. “Previously, we were considering a 96-degree inclination angle.” The International Space Station is situated in a 51.6-degree inclination orbit, easily accessible from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

Essentially, then, in 2030, the Russian segment of the International Space Station will separate from the American-controlled side. A SpaceX Dragon spacecraft will then maneuver the aging US segment to reenter the atmosphere in a controlled manner and splash down into a remote area of the Pacific Ocean.

Meanwhile, the Russian core will fly onward. Some elements will have been in orbit for more than 30 years.

In a scathing article on the decision, the Russian newspaper New Izvestia explored its consequences. The article, translated for Ars by Rob Mitchell, recalled comments from Orlov in 2022 about the dangerous bacteria and fungi that have accumulated on the International Space Station over its extended lifetime. Because of these microorganisms from hundreds of visiting astronauts, he said, there is danger to both humans and degraded electrical components. At the time, Orlov was seeking to justify funding for a new station. “Have bacteria and fungi suddenly become less dangerous over the past three years?” the Russian article asks.

There also may not be much time for new research. Russian cosmonauts on the space station currently spend about 50 percent of their time on station maintenance, given the aging infrastructure.

So at a time when China will have its own Tiangong space station, NASA should have one or more privately operated space stations to visit, and India may also begin the construction of its own orbital outpost, Russian cosmonauts will be left with what, exactly?

“Russia, meanwhile, will be left to carry on the legacy of the ISS, with all its problems,” the New Izvestia article states. “We won’t have a new orbital station with modern capabilities yet, and the Vostochny Cosmodrome is losing much of its significance, meaning investments in a launch pad for manned flights could go down the drain. But let’s be happy for Kazakhstan—its authorities will continue to receive rent from Baikonur.”

This is clearly a money-saving move for Russia. Given its war-strapped economy, the country cannot afford major investments in civil space projects. It has been clear for some time that ROS was largely a vaporware project. However, basing a new station on decades-old elements of the space station, which have shown signs of cracking and leaking, is remarkable even for Russia’s threadbare space program.

Russia’s justification for the change is amusing. Manturov and the chief of Roscosmos, Dmitry Bakanov, have said that putting ROS at an inclination of 51.6 degrees would enable interaction with an Indian station, which may fly in a similar orbit. So maybe there can be some collaboration in the time before Russia’s station falls apart and India’s begins to fly?

That is thin gruel, indeed, upon which to justify such a monumental decision.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.23 of the Rocket Report! Several new rockets made their first flights this year. Blue Origin’s New Glenn was the most notable debut, with a successful inaugural launch in January followed by an impressive second flight in November, culminating in the booster’s first landing on an offshore platform. Second on the list is China’s Zhuque-3, a partially reusable methane-fueled rocket developed by the quasi-commercial launch company LandSpace. The medium-lift Zhuque-3 successfully reached orbit on its first flight earlier this month, and its booster narrowly missed landing downrange. We could add China’s Long March 12A to the list if it flies before the end of the year. This will be the final Rocket Report of 2025, but we’ll be back in January with all the news that’s fit to lift.

As always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

Rocket Lab delivers for Space Force and NASA. Four small satellites rode a Rocket Lab Electron launch vehicle into orbit from Virginia early Thursday, beginning a government-funded technology demonstration mission to test the performance of a new spacecraft design, Ars reports. The satellites were nestled inside a cylindrical dispenser on top of the 59-foot-tall (18-meter) Electron rocket when it lifted off from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility. A little more than an hour later, the rocket’s upper stage released the satellites one at a time at an altitude of about 340 miles (550 kilometers). The launch was the starting gun for a “proof of concept” mission to test the viability of a new kind of satellite called DiskSats, designed by the Aerospace Corporation.

Stack ’em high… “DiskSat is a lightweight, compact, flat disc-shaped satellite designed for optimizing future rideshare launches,” the Aerospace Corporation said in a statement. The DiskSats are 39 inches (1 meter) wide, about twice the diameter of a New York-style pizza, and measure just 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) thick. Made of composite carbon fiber, each satellite carries solar cells, control avionics, reaction wheels, and an electric thruster to change and maintain altitude. The flat design allows DiskSats to be stacked one on top of the other for launch. The format also has significantly more surface area than other small satellites with comparable mass, making room for more solar cells for high-power missions or large-aperture payloads like radar imaging instruments or high-bandwidth antennas. NASA and the US Space Force cofunded the development and launch of the DiskSat demo mission.

SpaceX warns of dangerous Chinese launch. China’s recent deployment of nine satellites occurred dangerously close to a Starlink satellite, SpaceX’s vice president of Starlink engineering said. Michael Nicolls wrote in a December 12 social media post that there was a 200-meter close approach between a satellite launched December 10 on a Chinese Kinetica-1 rocket and SpaceX’s Starlink-6079 spacecraft at 560 kilometers (348 miles) altitude, Aviation Week and Space Technology reports. “Most of the risk of operating in space comes from the lack of coordination between satellite operators—this needs to change,” Nicolls wrote.

Blaming the customer... The company in charge of the Kinetica-1 rocket, CAS Space, responded to Nicolls’ post on X saying it would “work on identifying the exact details and provide assistance.” In a follow-up post on December 13, CAS Space said the close call, if confirmed, occurred nearly 48 hours after the satellite separated from the Kinetica-1 rocket, by which time the launch mission had long concluded. “CAS Space will coordinate with satellite operators to proceed.”

A South Korean startup is ready to fly. Innospace, a South Korean space startup, will launch its independently developed commercial rocket, Hanbit-Nano, as soon as Friday, the Maeil Business Newspaper reports. The rocket will lift off from the Alcântara Space Center in Brazil. The small launcher will attempt to deliver eight small payloads, including five deployable satellites, into low-Earth orbit. The launch was delayed two days to allow time for technicians to replace components of the first stage oxidizer supply cooling system.

Hybrid propulsion… This will be the first launch of Innospace’s Hanbit-Nano rocket. The launcher has two stages and stands 71 feet (21.7 meters) tall with a diameter of 4.6 feet (1.4 meters). Hanbit-Nano is a true micro-launcher, capable of placing up to 200 pounds (90 kilograms) of payload mass into Sun-synchronous orbit. It has a unique design, with hybrid engines consuming a mix of paraffin as the fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer.

Ten years since a milestone in rocketry. On December 21, 2015, SpaceX launched the Orbcomm-2 mission on an upgraded version of its Falcon 9 rocket. That night, just days before Christmas, the company successfully landed the first stage for the first time. Ars has reprinted a slightly condensed chapter from the book Reentry, authored by Senior Space Editor Eric Berger and published in 2024. The chapter begins in June 2015 with the failure of a Falcon 9 rocket during launch of a resupply mission to the International Space Station and ends with a vivid behind-the-scenes recounting of the historic first landing of a Falcon 9 booster to close out the year.

First-person account… I have my own memory of SpaceX’s first rocket landing. I was there, covering the mission for another publication, as the Falcon 9 lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. In an abundance of caution, Air Force officials in charge of the Cape Canaveral spaceport closed large swaths of the base for the Falcon 9’s return to land. The decision shunted VIPs and media representatives to viewing locations outside the spaceport’s fence, so I joined SpaceX’s official press room at the top of a seven-floor tower near the Port Canaveral cruise terminals. The view was tremendous. We all knew to expect a sonic boom as the rocket came back to Florida, but its arrival was a jolt. The next morning, I joined SpaceX and a handful of reporters and photographers on a chartered boat to get a closer look at the Falcon 9 standing proudly after returning from space.

Roscosmos targets quick fix to Soyuz launch pad. Russian space agency Roscosmos says it expects a damaged launch pad critical to International Space Station operations to be fixed by the end of February, Aviation Week and Space Technology reports. “Launch readiness: end of February 2026,” Roscosmos said in a statement Tuesday. Russia had been scrambling to assess the extent of repairs needed to Pad 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan after the November 27 flight of a Soyuz-2.1a rocket damaged key elements of the infrastructure. The pad is the only one capable of supporting Russian launches to the ISS.

Best-case scenario… A quick repair to the launch pad would be the best-case scenario for Roscosmos. A service structure underneath the rocket was unsecured during the launch of a three-man crew to the ISS last month. The structure fell into the launch pad’s flame trench, leaving the complex without the service cabin technicians use to work on the Soyuz rocket before liftoff. Roscosmos said a “complete service cabin replacement kit” has arrived at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, and more than 130 staff are working in two shifts to implement the repairs. A fix by the end of February would allow Russia to resume cargo flights to the ISS in March.

Atlas V closes out an up-and-down year for ULA. United Launch Alliance aced its final launch of 2025, a predawn flight of an Atlas V rocket Tuesday carrying 27 satellites for Amazon’s recently rebranded Leo broadband Internet service, Spaceflight Now reports. The rocket flew northeast from Cape Canaveral to place the Amazon Leo satellites into low-Earth orbit. This was ULA’s fourth launch for Amazon’s satellite broadband venture, previously known as Project Kuiper. ULA closes out 2025 with six launches, one more than the company achieved last year. But ULA’s new Vulcan rocket launched just once this year, disappointingly short of the company’s goal to fly Vulcan up to 10 times.

Taking stock of Amazon Leo… This year marked the start of the deployment of Amazon’s operational satellites. There are now 180 Amazon Leo satellites in orbit after Tuesday’s launch, well short of the FCC’s requirement for Amazon to deploy half of its planned 3,232 satellites by July 31, 2026. Amazon won’t meet the deadline, and it’s likely the retail giant will ask government regulators for a waiver or extension to the deadline. Amazon’s factory is hitting its stride producing and delivering Amazon Leo satellites. The real question is launch capacity. Amazon has contracts to launch satellites on ULA’s Atlas V and Vulcan rockets, Europe’s Ariane 6, and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. Early next year, a batch of 32 Amazon Leo satellites will launch on the first flight of Europe’s uprated Ariane 64 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

A good year for Ariane 6. Europe’s Ariane 6 rocket launched four times this year after a debut test flight in 2024. The four successful missions deployed payloads for the French military, Europe’s weather satellite agency, the European Union’s Copernicus environmental monitoring network, and finally, on Wednesday, the European Galileo navigation satellite fleet, Space News reports. This is a strong showing for a new rocket flying from a new launch pad and a faster ramp-up of launch cadence than any medium- or heavy-lift rocket in recent memory. All five Ariane 6 launches to date have used the Ariane 62 configuration with two strap-on solid rocket boosters. The more powerful Ariane 64 rocket, with four strap-on motors, will make its first flight early next year.

Aiming high… This was the first launch using the Ariane 6 rocket’s ability to fly long-duration missions lasting several hours. The rocket’s cryogenic upper stage, with a restartable Vinci engine, took nearly four hours to inject two Galileo navigation satellites into an orbit more than 14,000 miles (nearly 23,000 kilometers) above the Earth. The flight profile put more stress on the Ariane 6 upper stage than any of the rocket’s previous missions, but the rocket released its payloads into an on-target orbit. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

ESA wants to do more with Ariane 6’s kick stage. The European Space Agency plans to adapt a contract awarded to ArianeGroup in 2021 for an Ariane 6 kick stage to cover its evolution into an orbital transfer vehicle, European Spaceflight reports. The original contract was for the development of the Ariane 6’s Astris kick stage, an optional addition for Ariane 6 missions to deploy payloads into multiple orbits or directly inject satellites into geostationary orbit. Last month, ESA’s member states committed approximately 100 million euros ($117 million) to refocus the Astris kick stage into a more capable Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV).

Strong support from Germany… ESA’s director of space transportation, Toni Tolker-Nielsen, said the performance of the Ariane 6 OTV will be “well beyond” that of the originally conceived Astris kick stage. The funding commitment obtained during last month’s ESA ministerial council meeting includes strong support from Germany, Tolker-Nielsen said. Under the new timeline, a protoflight mode of the OTV is expected to be ready for ground qualification by the end of 2028, with an inaugural flight following in 2029. (submitted EllPeaTea)

Another Starship clone in China. Every other week, it seems, a new Chinese launch company pops up with a rocket design and a plan to reach orbit within a few years. For a long time, the majority of these companies revealed designs that looked a lot like SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. Now, Chinese companies are starting to introduce designs that appear quite similar to SpaceX’s newer, larger Starship rocket, Ars reports. The newest entry comes from a company called “Beijing Leading Rocket Technology.” This outfit took things a step further by naming its vehicle “Starship-1,” adding that the new rocket will have enhancements from AI and is billed as being a “fully reusable AI rocket.”

Starship prime… China has a long history of copying SpaceX. The country’s first class of reusable rockets, which began flying earlier this month, show strong similarities to the Falcon 9 rocket. Now, it’s Starship. The trend began with the Chinese government. In November 2024, the government announced a significant shift in the design of its super-heavy lift rocket, the Long March 9. Instead of the previous design, a fully expendable rocket with three stages and solid rocket boosters strapped to the sides, the country’s state-owned rocket maker revealed a vehicle that mimicked SpaceX’s fully reusable Starship. At least two more companies have announced plans for Starship-like rockets using SpaceX’s chopstick-style method for booster recovery. Many of these launch startups will not grow past the PowerPoint phase, of course.

            <h2>ByteDance confirms TikTok will be controlled by US owners</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a year of stalled negotiations, TikTok owner ByteDance has reportedly agreed to Donald Trump’s deal giving US owners majority ownership of the app.

By signing the agreements, ByteDance has ended a prolonged period of uncertainty for millions of Americans who rely on TikTok for news, entertainment, social connection, and income. Under a law that Trump declined to enforce—which lawmakers convinced the Supreme Court was critical for national security—TikTok risked a US ban next year if the sale did not go through.

According to Reuters, terms of the deal match what was reported in September when Trump controversially confirmed that ByteDance would keep the algorithm. Under the deal, US investors and allies—including cloud computing firm Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX—will likely license the algorithm.

Together, those owners will control 80.1 percent of TikTok while China-based ByteDance retains a 19.9 percent stake, as well as one of seven board seats. To ensure that China has no access to US data to spy on Americans or tweak the algorithm to indoctrinate users with political propaganda, Oracle will serve as a “trusted security partner,” Reuters reported.

In a memo to staff reviewed by Reuters, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew confirmed that all US data “will be stored in a trusted and secure cloud environment in the United States run by Oracle,” with Oracle ultimately responsible for safeguarding US data.

Describing the deal as a “joint venture,” he confirmed that the US company would “operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.” But ByteDance would separately “manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.”

According to Trump, the deal ensures that TikTok complies with the divest-or-ban law, but the White House is still not providing more details. Instead, the Trump administration “referred questions about the deal to TikTok,” Reuters reported.

If the deal closes as expected on January 22, the new US company will have an estimated value of $14 billion, Vice President JD Vance noted in September.

At that point, the deal will likely face mounting scrutiny from lawmakers, including Republicans, who aren’t yet sure if the US operation resolves all national security concerns. Chinese control of the algorithm was a particular sticking point for critics, who claimed that Trump was giving China exactly what it wanted: international recognition for exporting leading technology to the US.

In September, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R.-Iowa) vowed to take a “hard line” and oppose the deal’s framework if it violates the divest-or-ban law. Already, Representative John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), chair of the House Select Committee on China, is planning to hold a hearing next year with US TikTok leadership.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has accused Trump of handing over “even more control of what you watch to his billionaire buddies,” through the TikTok deal, which she likened to enabling a “billionaire takeover of TikTok.” Many TikTokers likely share her concerns, after Trump suggested he’d like to see his hand-picked investors tweak the algorithm to be “100 percent MAGA.”

Questions remain until the exact terms of the deal become public, Warren said.

ByteDance did not respond to Ars’ request to comment.

With the terms obscured, it’s unclear how quickly TikTok may change in 2026 under US ownership. Back in July, the Information reported that when approximately 170 million US users get ported over to the new US-owned app, it could be buggy.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As The Guardian reports, AI chatbots are constantly stealing bits and pieces of their culinary insights and mashing them together into a statistical stew.

Even setting aside the question of whether the resulting recipes actually produce tasty food, the bots are biting the hand that feeds by destroying the business model behind the content they’re stealing: clicks that would be going to their food blogs are being diverted to the chatbots instead, depriving the actual recipe creators of eyeballs — and ad revenue — that historically kept them afloat.

“There are a lot of people that are scared to even talk about what’s going on because it is their livelihood,” Jim Delmage who runs the blog and YouTube channel Sip and Feast with his wife Tara, told The Guardian.

Matt Rodbard, the founder and editor-in-chief of the website Taste, wasn’t afraid to doomsay.

“For websites that depend on the advertising model,” he told the newspaper, “I think this is an extinction event in many ways.”

One of the main offenders is Google’s notoriously wonky AI Overviews, which provide a summary of search results that appear above the actual links to sites. Its most notable contribution to the culinary world was infamously recommending to put glue on pizza, an epicurean nugget of wisdom it sourced from a facetious Reddit comment.

The AI Overviews have been around for two years now, but recipe creators say they started seeing a nosedive in traffic since Google launched its “AI Mode” for search in March, through which it started offering full-blown AI-generated recipes, according to The Guardian.

And they’re disasters. Karen Tedesco, the author of the blog Familystyle Food, tested the AI Mode by searching for “Italian meatballs,” and was given a “synthesized” recipe that included hers and nine other sources, including a Washington Post recipe for Greek — not Italian — meatballs. Too many cooks, as they say, spoil the broth.

Rodbard, at Taste, acknowledges that food blogs weren’t doing themselves any favors by barraging visitors with too many ads — which, whatever you think of AI aggregators, they spare you the trouble of plodding through.

“Ad tech on these recipe blogs has gotten so bad, so many pop-up windows and so much crashing, we kind of lost as publishers,” Rodbard said.

Maybe, he suggests, the old-fashioned cookbook may be due for a comeback.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ozempic and similar weight loss drugs have been found to cut risks for a variety of health issues — ranging from heart to kidney disease — netting the pharma companies behind them billions of projected dollars in revenue over the next decade.

But in rare cases, this class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists can come with a debilitating side effects. Chief among them is blindness, which as Reuters reports has prompted patients who lost their eyesight to file more than 70 lawsuits against Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the two major drug companies behind Ozempic and Mounjaro, respectively.

The lawsuits, in both federal and state courts, allege that these drugs gave patients a condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, in which blood flow to the optic nerve stops and causes a person to lose vision.

Earlier this week, a federal judicial panel approved the consolidation of these lawsuits and that a Pennsylvania federal judge will preside over these cases — setting the stage for a legal showdown that could have immense implications for the future of the drugs, which have exploded in popularity over the past few years.

And the suits aren’t the only storm clouds on the horizon for GLP-1 manufacturers: they’re separate from another batch of litigation that alleges that these drugs can cause gastroparesis, in which the gastrointestinal tract stops moving food along for digestion.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first GLP-1 agonist drug back in 2005 to treat diabetes. Fast forward to 2021, and the FDA gave Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk the greenlight to make and manufacture Wegovy, which works the same way as Ozempic but is geared towards people who want to lose weight.

That monumental decision, along with a rush of positive press, kicked off the current craze for these weight loss drugs, which has seen celebrities like Oprah and Rebel Wilson shed pounds over a short amount of time.

But in the last couple of years, a growing number of people have reported severe side effects from using these medications, dampening the buzz around drugs that have often been touted as a miracle cure for a wide variety of conditions — even aging.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a year of record gains for the crypto industry, recent forces have sent itinto a tailspin. Bitcoin, for example, reached dazzling heights of more than $120,000 in October — before crashing back down to around $88,000 today, about 12 percent down from where it was a year ago.

While that might be bad news for crypto bros or Robinhood day traders, one economist argues that the decline is actually good news for the rest of us.

Co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research Dean Baker argued in his blog Beat The Press this week that as the major cryptocurrencies fall, purchasing power for the rest of us goes up. In his analysis, he compares crypto to counterfeit currency — fake money that allows shady gangs to buy up all kinds of scarce goods, like houses and sports tickets.

When they buy up those goods with funny money, they help drive prices up, making them less affordable for those of us who don’t play the game.

“If some supersleuth detective figured out a way to recognize the counterfeit bills, they could then remove trillions of dollars of fake money from circulation,” Baker explains. “This would benefit the general public by reducing demand in the economy and reversing the run-up in the price of housing and Superbowl tickets. It is the same story with plunging crypto prices.”

From this reading, crypto — which infamously has no real value — allows people to suck up “large chunks” of the economy with a currency that’s built on thin air. When their share of fake money shrinks, it eases pressure on the rest of us. “To put it simply: there’s more for everyone else,” Baker explains.

We’re not talking small, intangible changes, either. By Baker’s count, the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Etherium have shed over $1.2 trillion in market cap, or “enough to send every household in the United States a check for $10,000.”

In his thinking, everybody who doesn’t own it should be cheering for crypto’s ongoing downfall to continue.

“The only possible impact of lower crypto prices on production is that we will make less crypto,” says Baker. “The horror! The horror!”

            <h2>Netflix acquires gaming avatar maker Ready Player Me</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/netflix-acquires-gaming-avatar-maker-ready-player-me/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After shifting its gaming strategy to focus more on games played on the TV, Netflix announced it’s acquiring Ready Player Me, an avatar creation platform based in Estonia. The streamer said Friday it plans to use the startup’s development tools and infrastructure to build avatars that will allow Netflix subscribers to carry their personas and fandom across different games.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed; Ready Player Me had raised $72 million in venture backing from investors including a16z, Endeavor, Konvoy Ventures, Plural, and various angels, including the co-founders of companies like Roblox, Twitch, and King Games.

Netflix told TechCrunch the startup’s team of around 20 people will be joining the company, including the founders Rainer Selvet, Haver Jarveoja, Kaspar Tiri, and Timmu Toke. It doesn’t have an estimate of how long it will be until avatars launch. Nor does it detail which games or types of games will be first to get avatars.

Following the acquisition, Ready Player Me will be winding down its services on January 31, 2026, including its online avatar creation tool, PlayerZero.

“Our vision has always been to enable avatars and identities to travel across many games and virtual worlds,” Ready Player Me CEO Timmu Toke said in a statement. “We’ve been on an independent path to make that vision a reality for a long time. I’m now very excited for the Ready Player Me team to join Netflix to scale our tech and expertise to a global audience and contribute to the exciting vision Netflix has for gaming.”

Netflix’s deal represents the company’s changing approach to games.

When it moved into the market four years ago, the company offered mobile games to its subscribers, who would log in using their Netflix accounts. At the time, Netflix explained that it saw gaming as another new category, similar to its other expansions into original films, animation, and unscripted TV.

Netflix acquired numerous gaming studios and titles, and licensed others, under the leadership of Mike Verdu, the company’s VP of games who formerly worked at EA and Kabam. That strategy saw mixed results. While some of its larger, more well-known titles may have attracted some customers, like GTA: San Andreas, others were virtually unknown. (The company recently said the GTA game was on its way out, too, alongside dozens of other titles.)

Netflix also shut down many of its studio acquisitions or returned them to their founders.

To some extent, these changes could have been anticipated. Going into this, Netflix knew that moving into gaming would be an experiment, and it would have to adapt as it discovered what worked and what didn’t.

As part of its strategy shift, Netflix last year brought in a new executive, Alain Tascan, formerly of Epic Games, as its President of Games. Verdu, who was then VP of generative AI for games, left seven months later.

Under Tascan, Netflix has expanded its gaming lineup for TV and begun focusing on party games, kids’ games, narrative games, and more mainstream titles.

Recently, the streamer released a slate of party games for TVs and mobile, including Netflix Puzzled, PAW Patrol Academy, plus WWE2K25, Red Dead Redemption, and Best Guess, a live party game with hosts Hunter March and Howie Mandel, and a $1 million jackpot. This week, it also announced a new FIFA title would be coming to TVs in time for the World Cup in 2026.

At TechCrunch Disrupt’s event this October, Netflix CTO Elizabeth Stone said the company was introducing interactive real-time voting for live content, which it was already testing with a live cooking show and would soon bring to its reboot of the talent show “Star Search.”

In this way, Netflix is now more closely following how the TV industry embraced mobile, interactive experiences by allowing audience voting for “American Idol” contestants or favorite couples on reality shows like “Love Island.”

Whether or not Netflix can convince its audience to think of its brand — traditionally associated with passive, lean-back viewing — as something to turn to for interactive activities like gaming, still remains to be seen.

            <div id="article-text">It’s all hands on deck at Meta, as the company develops new AI models under its superintelligence lab led by Scale AI co-founder, Alexandr Wang. The company is now working on an image and video model codenamed “Mango” along with a new text-based model internally known as “Avocado,” The Wall Street Journal reported.

The tech giant plans to release the new models in the first half of 2026, the publication said, citing an internal Q&A at Meta on Thursday, where Wang and chief product officer Chris Cox unveiled the new roadmap.

Wang had said Meta aims to make the text-based model better at coding while also exploring new world models that understand visual information and can reason, plan, and act without needing to be trained on every possibility.

Meta has more recently fallen behind its rivals, like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, in the AI race. The company’s AI division saw significant restructurings this year, which included leadership changes and the poaching of researchers from other top companies. However, several of the researchers who joined Meta SuperIntelligence Labs (MSL) have already left the company.

Last month, the company’s chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, also announced that he’s leaving to create his own startup.

Meta doesn’t have a winning AI product as of yet. Instead, Meta AI assistant’s numbers are buoyed by the company’s existing social networks spanning billions of users, since the company places the assistant in the search bar of its apps.

This means the first projects and models coming out of MSL will have a lot riding on them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Krafton, the South Korean gaming company behind hit titles such as PUBG and Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), is launching a growth investment fund focused on India, stepping up its push into the world’s largest internet user base.

Called the Unicorn Growth Fund, the investment vehicle is a collaboration between Krafton and South Korean internet conglomerate Naver, and investor Mirae Asset. It aims to deploy up to ₹60 billion (around $669.3 million) over four years, Krafton confirmed to TechCrunch.

The fund, which will be managed by Mirae Asset Venture India, is expected to be established in January and begin operations with an initial size of more than ₹30 billion (about $334.6 million). Krafton will contribute ₹12.3 billion (approximately $137.2 million) at the first close, the company said.

Naver’s capital commitment is expected to be “broadly comparable” to Krafton’s $137 million investment, a Krafton spokesperson told TechCrunch. The fund will not operate with rigid country-allocation thresholds, and typical investment sizes are expected to range between $10 million and $30 million, the spokesperson said.

Krafton said investments through the new fund would primarily be treated as financial positions rather than strategic bets, though the level of engagement with portfolio companies could vary depending on the opportunity and long-term potential of each business.

To date, Krafton has invested more than $200 million in India, backing companies in the gaming, content and fintech spaces. Recent investments include fintech Cashfree and venture fund IMM Investment, alongside earlier bets on gaming and content platforms such as Nodwin Gaming, Loco, Pratilipi, and Kuku FM. The company also launched a gaming incubator in India in 2023, and acquired a controlling stake in Indian gaming studio Nautilus Mobile for $14 million earlier this year.

Krafton’s expansion in India has not been without setbacks. New Delhi banned BGMI, the company’s flagship local title, in 2022, before allowing it to return in 2023 following a three-month trial approval. Krafton subsequently announced a $150 million investment commitment in the country.

BGMI, which has surpassed 240 million downloads, launched in 2021 as a revamped, localized version of PUBG Mobile, another popular title that was banned by the Indian government in mid-2020 over national security concerns. Since then, Krafton has made a series of operational changes in the country — including cutting ties with Tencent as its publisher and migrating its India servers to Microsoft’s Azure cloud — to address regulatory concerns.

With the new fund, Krafton is looking to extend its India strategy beyond gaming, channeling capital into a wider set of technology startups as it seeks to build a long-term presence in one of Asia’s fastest-growing digital markets.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2025/12/books-briefing-alternate-venice-james-applebaum/685335/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of the Books Briefing, our editors’ weekly guide to the best in books.

Venice is a city so globally famous that even those who have never been there tend to hold opinions about it. In my experience, those are frequently negative: It’s too expensive, too hot, too crowded with tourists. Calling it overrated has almost become a cliché; people love to remind one another that it’s sinking—fast. At the same time, few places have had as strong, or as enduring, a hold on the artistic imagination. John Singer Sargent, Claude Monet, and Isabella Stewart Gardner, among many others, have long been inspired by Venice’s rich cultural history and captivating views.

First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

Henry James was part of that group. He visited Venice 10 times between 1869 and 1907, and made it the setting of his 1888 novella The Aspern Papers, which was serialized in The Atlantic. The book’s narrator goes to Italy on a hunt for letters by the late poet Jeffrey Aspern to a former lover, Juliana, which he believes the now-elderly lady has secreted away in her palazzo. This year, we sent Anne Applebaum on a related quest: She showed up in Italy searching for the city James got to know—the Venice that inspired a substantial part of his work.

James’s Venice doesn’t dwell among oppressive crowds and opulent halls; it lurks in deserted squares, on less-traveled islands, and within cool, dark churches that hold Renaissance masterpieces. Venice was already becoming a tourist hot spot when James was alive, but he gloried in another city, and that city still exists. Even now, “if you take an odd turn down a narrow pathway and head away from the main attractions,” Applebaum writes, “the crowds thin out, and eventually you can find yourself quite alone.” James wrote appealingly about exploring the city’s “campos—the little squares formed about every church—some of them most sunnily desolate, the most grass-grown, the most cheerfully sad little reliquaries of a splendid past that you can imagine.”

Applebaum’s trip helped me think of Venice differently. She enjoyed the same “perfect light” on the island of Torcello that James saw, the same gold mosaic that covers one wall of the Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta; she even walked through the same palazzo on which James modeled the one in The Aspern Papers. She stood on the balcony of the Palazzo Barbaro, another house where James frequently stayed, looking out at the Grand Canal just as the author did almost 150 years ago. If you know where to look, she argues, and if you take the time to do so, the old Venice is always there.

In James’s The Aspern Papers, an American uses “duplicity” to access a palazzo. Fortunately, there are easier ways to discover the writer’s beloved Venice.

This novel is so packed with plot that Quentin Tarantino adapted it into the extra-long film Jackie Brown, in 1997. If you’ve seen the movie, you might imagine Pam Grier sauntering across the page, but this is a breakneck novel in its own right: Characters make and shatter alliances at dizzying speed, and nobody’s motives are ever quite what they seem. A middle-aged flight attendant, Jackie Burke, finds herself trapped between the FBI and an ambitious gunrunner when she gets caught moving his merchandise across international borders. Shoot-outs, sting operations, and boatloads of blow: This book has it all. It’s a terrific beach read, but it has enough substance to keep you sustained no matter where you pick it up.  — M. L. Rio

A Daring New Take on Shakespeare’s Most Famous Soliloquy

The “To be, or not to be” soliloquy sets a particularly tricky trap. On-screen, the speech’s prestige can overwhelm its existential subject matter, and the passage tends to get overacted. “Because it’s a beautiful speech,” Peter Kirwan, a professor of Shakespeare and performance at Mary Baldwin University, told me, “the beauty of the speech kind of takes away from what it actually means for someone to be working through this.” The fact that any soliloquy halts dramatic action also poses a challenge. Onstage, an actor can naturally hold an audience’s attention, being in the same physical venue. Cinema’s visual language, though, has the potential to undermine the words’ meaning. The sentiment can become a spectacle more than an interior reflection made exterior.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For Avatar fans, I have great news: The latest installment of James Cameron’s magical-alien adventure saga is here, and you’re going to love it. Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third entry in a franchise that has consumed the attention of Hollywood’s greatest action-movie director for the past two decades, is a giddy bundle of familiar sights: willowy blue warrior-aliens; Day-Glo beasts of air, land, and sea; eminently jeer-worthy humans trying to invade a celestial paradise. The bad news for anyone not already on board: This film has no interest in you.

The sense of exclusivity is the one big charge I can level against Fire and Ash, which furthers the fable of Pandora, the fantastical moon that’s home to the Na’vi. The focus remains on Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington), a soldier who has permanently ported himself into a Na’vi body; he’s now raising a family with his warrior-queen wife, Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña). The previous chapter in their tale, 2022’s The Way of Water, felt like a newcomer-friendly reinvention for the series. Its sequel is a straightforward continuation by comparison, mostly keeping to previously introduced environments and enemies. But Cameron has spent ample time building out this sci-fi world, whose nooks, crannies, and philosophical limits are still delightful to examine.

Fire and Ash makes clear up front that it’s different from the previous Avatar films, though, by opening on a downbeat note. It picks up directly after The Way of Water, which is a cheerful romp through a reef-side Na’vi community that ends in tragedy: Jake’s oldest son dying in a fight against an army of human colonizers. Thus, Fire and Ash has a dark pall over its proceedings; the protagonists are still in mourning and planning courses of vengeance. It contains less of the sense of discovery that makes the prior entries so thrilling, such as their navigation of an ecosystem and all of the intricately designed creatures within it. Instead, the movie devotes itself to weighing the cost of Jake’s arrival on Pandora, and his transformation into a member of its native species. The heavier tone is appropriate for the story Cameron is trying to tell. It’s just also a little less joyful.

Read: Hollywood learned all the wrong lessons from Avatar

Meanwhile, as ever with Avatar (and most of the director’s works), the screenwriting is direct to the point of clunkiness. All of the dialogue is geared toward communicating plot or plainly stating a character’s emotional state. The straightforwardness is in the service of Cameron’s real preoccupation, however: exploring and further building out this strange utopia. This film’s best invention is the “ash people,” a Na’vi clan that lives in the volcanic mountains. Although the other Na’vi are very tapped into large Mother Gaia notions of flora and fauna, and the belief that everyone is connected on Pandora, the ash people have a much more nihilistic worldview. Their disdain for their home is somewhat frightening, as is their eagerness to take up human arms—yet they’re refreshingly novel too.

The ash people’s perspective allies them with the group looking to strip-mine Pandora’s resources. They get on particularly well with the franchise’s knottiest figure, the villainous Quaritch (Stephen Lang). He’s a wonderfully perverse creation, an invading warrior now trapped in the form of his enemy; after dying in the first Avatar, Quaritch had his consciousness cloned into a Na’vi body. As usual, Lang plays the brute’s Heart of Darkness–esque descent into madness with gleeful relish. Quaritch finds a twin soul in the form of the ash people’s leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin). The two pretty quickly embark on a lot of drug-fueled campfire happenings, as if they’re at Burning Man. Theirs is the kind of loopy side quest that only Cameron has the guts to cram into a Christmastime blockbuster.

Narrative turns such as this are why I find it impossible to be bored by these movies. There’s always some bizarre new sci-fi consideration among the extravagant bits of combat. One of the most notable ideas that Fire and Ash throws around is the relationship between Sully’s adopted teenagers: Kiri (Sigourney Weaver, playing a dreamy pseudo-clone of the actor’s human character in the first Avatar) and Quaritch’s son, Spider (Jack Champion), who has miraculously adapted to life on Pandora like some space-age Tarzan. Each of them represents evolutionary concepts, such as adaptation, through which Cameron expands an already-mystical universe; their paths pave the most intriguing ground for future stories to develop on.

Their subplot also represents Avatar at its most complex. Playing the hits—Jake, Neytiri, and company doing glorious battle with men in mech suits—would have been easy, and Fire and Ash still serves up plenty of impressive warfare. Yet the Na’vi are just as often seen plugging their ponytail into an animal, or even into the roots of trees, to share their consciousness. That’s Avatar’s potent, if polarizing, cocktail: Hippie-ish spirituality comfortably exists alongside absurd action scenes, such as when Jake nerfs Marines with a carbine rifle while flying on the back of a dinosaur. I have no clue whether Cameron wants to keep working on the series; he’s been somewhat demure about the possibility of additional sequels, having already devoted a huge chunk of his career to the skies and seas of Pandora. The director clearly isn’t trying to win people over in the meantime, but I’ll never turn down a chance to delve into this gigantic, goofy world.</div>

            <h2>The Color of the Year Is an Exercise in Absurdity</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/pantone-color-of-the-year-cloud-dancer/685316/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, many attractive people filled a room in Lower Manhattan. They drank elaborate cocktails and gazed upon Instagram-y art installations and left with a gift bag that contained, among other things, earbuds studded with Swarovski crystals. The vibe was high-end, sophisticated, arty. The guest of honor was a color.

Pantone throws a party like this one annually, in conjunction with the announcement of its “Color of the Year.” For 2026, it’s “Cloud Dancer,” which, the company notes in a press release, “serves as a symbol of calming influence in a frenetic society rediscovering the value of measured consideration and quiet reflection.” The color, the release continues, also helps peel “away layers of outmoded thinking,” “making room for innovation,” and, of course, reminds us that “true strength lies not just in doing, but also in being.” (It’s white.)

The choice was controversial in the banal way that everything is controversial now. Some people noted, pointing to the news, that this was maybe not the year to publish a press release about how awesome whiteness is, and some other people found that argument to be a very serious symptom of the woke mind virus. People took to Instagram to call the choice tone-deaf, or to label it trolling, or, in a few cases, to announce that they were “rejecting” Cloud Dancer, as though the color itself were an unsavory ideology and not a band of light visible to the human eye. Other people reacted to the reaction by suggesting that critics of Cloud Dancer were terminally offended hysterics looking for racism where absolutely none exists. Credulous news stories about the debate filled my feeds. I began to seriously worry that this frenetic society might not, in fact, rediscover the value of measured consideration and quiet reflection.

Read: Rage bait is a brilliant word of the year

White—like all colors, but maybe more than most—is loaded with meaning. Throughout history, it has carried with it commanding associations: with elitism, purity, nobility, wealth, moral superiority. (The architect Adolf Loos, in his seminal 1908 essay arguing that ornamentation was “degenerate,” hoped for a world where “the streets of the city will glisten like white walls.”) It is certainly not neutral, as Pantone has suggested in the Cloud Dancer rollout. If you ask a physicist, white isn’t even technically a color, because it does not exist on a single wavelength. The choice is strange by almost any measure. But then again, so is the concept of a color of the year.

As companies go, Pantone is an odd one. It does not sell paint, despite its association with paint swatches. It does not sell any of the machinery needed to make paint or produce fabric, either. It does not invent new colors, because that’s not (generally) possible. What it sells is a standard: For more than 60 years, it has categorized, named, and numbered more than 10,000 different shades, each rendered into format-specific formulas. The idea is that any designer in the world can be sure that the pinky purple in an ad on their computer screen will perfectly match the pinky purple that appears in the ad when it is printed in a magazine, and will perfectly match the pinky purple that appears on the packaging for the product the ad is for, because they are all Pantone 246 C. Much of Pantone’s business is selling color-swatch guides to designers, artists, and marketers to ensure this uniformity, which is hugely important to their jobs. The company is, in other words, in the intellectual-property business, and it has an effective monopoly over its particular field.

Pantone offers a genuine utility in the same way that the dictionary does. But it’s a fairly boring one, with a fairly limited audience. Over the years, the company has expanded its remit, finding new and impressionistic ways to sell color, and itself as the arbiter thereof. (“God created the world in seven days. And on the eighth day, he called Pantone to put color into it,” the company’s founder, Lawrence Herbert, once said.) In 1986, Pantone opened a consulting arm, through which its experts advise companies on how to use color in packaging and logos—a decade ago, it worked with Universal to develop and trademark Minion Yellow (13-0851 TCX). These days, the company also sells trend-forecast reports, and licenses its name and colors to other companies: You can now buy Pantone-branded sneakers, key chains, and mugs in its robust online store, and for a period of time in the 2010s, you could stay in a Pantone-branded hotel in Brussels.

From the February 2025 issue: What not to wear: The false promise of seasonal-color analysis

The most absurd invention, however, is the color of the year, which the company started announcing at the turn of the millennium, ostensibly to “draw attention to the relationship between culture and color,” though practically it just drew attention to Pantone. The annual color is apparently meant to reflect humanity’s deep yearnings—for “closeness and connection” (peach, 2024), or “a new narrative” (magenta, 2023)—but also to predict its future tastes. And the color’s very announcement has become a massive cultural and commercial occasion—a global news event created out of thin air, and a coup of publicity and corporate synergy unlike anything else I can think of. (Imagine Oxford University Press licensing its word of the year—incidentally, rage bait—for use in products.) The color of the year takes something available to everyone, in nature, and sells it back to us.

This year, the high-end hotel chain Mandarin Oriental is incorporating Cloud Dancer into its properties. The furniture company Joybird is making sofas in it. For the people who can’t stand to use off-trend Command hooks, 3M has unveiled a Cloud Dancer line, and for the serenity-seeking preschooler, Play-Doh has released a special edition of its signature Doh. The controversy has abated, but the stuff to buy will stick around.</div>

The soil in the greenhouses where enrichment is used may have less lead in it, because it&#39;s usually only used for cannabis and that is generally grown in containers when in greenhouses.

I mean, from a horticultural perspective, there is some potential to gain more of other nutrients, in that if you have more energy, you can develop a larger root system, or generally more effectively, better feed mycorrhizal associations (fungal hyphae are much finer than root hairs, so can get into smaller cracks, and fungi can &quot;acid mine&quot; nutrients out of mineral grains - as an example, here&#39;s a microscopic image showing what they did to a garnet  [researchgate.net])

Scientists constantly revise their facts, while conspiracy theorists never revise anything.

The Scientists look at these revisions as masterpieces and proof they are right.

The Conspiracy idiots look at revisions and call them mistakes that prove the scientists are wrong.

The conspiracy idiots never realize the problem with their own thought.

When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. convened a panel on Monday to discuss “chronic Lyme,” many leading researchers of the disease were genuinely excited. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services promised to allocate more resources to understanding the disease. There was hope, among experts, that this would mean an important new chapter for Lyme research.

But there’s a problem: Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist with seemingly little understanding of how modern science works. It didn’t emerge in Monday’s roundtable, but Kennedy, for example, once claimed Lyme disease was developed by the U.S. military as a bioweapon in the ’70s. He still maintains that the medical community has “gaslit” the public over Lyme and even asserted, without evidence, that during the Biden years, there were top officials within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who, due to political motivations, were “saying Lyme disease did not exist.”

This is not an ideal mindset to bring to any medical topic, but it’s particularly troubling for Lyme, given that it is already one of the most controversial diseases.

Active Lyme disease, identified in the 1970s, is not a particularly mysterious illness. The tick bite that transfers the bacteria typically causes an easily identifiable bullseye rash; once spotted, symptoms, which can include fever, headaches, stiffness, and fatigue, can be resolved with a round of antibiotics. The treatment of active Lyme is fairly straightforward. But the aftermath of active Lyme remains a deeply unsettled area of science. A subset of Lyme patients go on to complain of arthritis-like joint pain, fatigue, and neurological issues for years afterward. For a smaller population, the symptoms become debilitating. Some patients grow desperate and even suicidal.

Until recently, many mainstream medical professionals disputed the idea of “chronic Lyme” altogether, insisting that Lyme was done once it was treated with antibiotics. Any complaints the patients had afterward, they argued, likely resulted from other conditions or from psychiatric disorders, which can indeed cause severe physical symptoms. But patients don’t like being told something is all in their head, particularly when their lives are falling apart over a maddeningly persistent illness. As a result, a “Lyme community” began to form of patients who felt forced to become their own champions and validate one another’s suffering. Many looked for answers outside conventional medicine.

The rush of pseudoscientists, grifters, wellness influencers, and celebrity advocates into the space only made the chronic Lyme debate more fraught. Even the term “chronic Lyme” was, and is, highly charged: In medical literature, doctors call it Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, in part to clarify that they are not referring to a continuous, chronic infection with the bacteria but only to a constellation of symptoms that develop and linger after confirmed bouts of Lyme disease. The people this term doesn’t include are those—often self-diagnosed laypeople or the patients of anti-scientific practitioners—who believe that they have insidious Lyme infections missed by blood tests and persistent beyond any normal antibiotic treatment. (The research does not show any evidence for a chronic Lyme infection, experts said.) These patients never developed the rash or had any other concrete evidence of Lyme infection. These are the cases that caused many in the mainstream medical community to dismiss “chronic Lyme” as nonsense.

But mainstream scientists weren’t entirely ignoring the possibility of both undetectable and chronic Lyme, as much as Kennedy may insist otherwise. Many researchers agreed there was a need for better testing and that it was possible that real Lyme sufferers were going undiagnosed. And even in the earliest Lyme studies, experts said, the National Institutes of Health had attempted to suss out longer-term damage. The problem, said Dr. Brian Fallon, the director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, was that most Lyme research dealt primarily with “well-defined” patients—those with telltale rashes and active infection that showed on blood tests—in order to have clean, careful studies. Those patients were those with the easiest cases, with easy diagnostics and prompt treatment. The potentially messier cases, without rashes, or with long periods of infection without treatment, were not taken into account. The pace of the research moved relatively slowly, given that Lyme was never such an urgent problem. It is not deadly or contagious like Ebola or AIDS. For many patients, it’s more like a temporary inconvenience.

But two things changed. First, climate change has made Lyme an increasingly visible and pressing issue. As the tick population explodes across North America, Lyme has become a virtually inescapable threat in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. Second, a global pandemic struck. In its aftermath, research institutions turned their resources to questions about COVID’s long-term effects. As they did, they began to bring those same questions to other infectious diseases that might result in chronic conditions.

“It shouldn’t come as any surprise to the world right now that infections can cause chronic problems, because of what we have learned from long COVID,” Fallon said. “I think it’s helped tremendously in changing the conversation. … There’s a great deal of interest in looking at something that’s been ignored.”

It is now a potent moment for Lyme research. If scientists can get the funding and resources they need to develop better diagnostics and unlock the mechanism that explains what is making chronic Lyme patients sick, it could bring profound relief to hundreds of thousands of Americans, allowing them to get the care they need. But a large part of pursuing a major medical breakthrough is separating science from pseudoscience in order to allow the scientific process to proceed with its dispassionate methods. And Kennedy has shown that he is incapable of that—and is steering his HHS accordingly.

There are urgent reasons, beyond the success of future research, for the leading medical institutions in the country to try to purge the lingering anti-scientific elements in the Lyme conversation: They may actually put patients’ health at risk. When confusion meets desperation, as it does when the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health cannot provide any clarity, patients and doctors may seek out unconventional answers.

“A lot of these patients undergo bizarre, unapproved therapies, like extended intravenous antibiotic therapies, for months or even years,” Dr. Durland Fish, the chief executive officer of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, told Slate. “A lot of them are bogus.”

These treatments, Fish said, can be expensive, as they usually aren’t covered by insurance. And they can be deeply dispiriting when they don’t work. Some patients, he said, can become depressed and even suicidal.

And perhaps even more worryingly, if a patient becomes convinced they have chronic Lyme based on an influencer’s videos, they may be diverted from identifying something else. Part of the reason chronic Lyme has always been controversial is that its symptoms are so nonspecific. Fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and joint pain can be caused by anemia, sleep disorders, mental illnesses, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, ALS, fibromyalgia, cancer, and many other conditions.

“From my perspective, I think the misdiagnosis and mistreatment is a bigger problem than the actual Lyme disease,” he said.

Now, as chronic Lyme emerges from its era of hazy theories and pseudoscience, it continues to be tainted with its previous associations. As an example, New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who attended Monday’s hearing, slipped a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed Wednesday, requiring the Government Accountability Office to investigate whether Lyme disease was bioengineered by the U.S. military. (Lyme disease, it should be noted, predates the United States itself by millennia.) During Monday’s hearing, he complained that mainstream news media, including the Washington Post, had portrayed him and his allies “like we have a tinfoil hat on our heads.” Smith is a Republican, but conspiratorial thinking on Lyme is a bipartisan problem.

And few are as damaging to chronic Lyme’s reputation among skeptics as Kennedy himself. As head of HHS, Kennedy has baselessly attributed deaths to the COVID vaccine, connected both Tylenol and circumcision to autism, and linked SSRIs to mass shootings. In one throwaway comment in the hearing, he claimed that the antiretroviral drug developed during the AIDS epidemic under Anthony Fauci’s NIH killed more people than AIDS itself.

The panel he convened was similarly questionable. Participants were largely not the leading experts in Lyme research but instead patients, medical technology business owners, politicians, and people with out-there theories about the disease. One person claimed there was a connection between Lyme disease and autism—something no mainstream researcher seems to find credible. Another person, who is a patient and an HHS official, asserted that had she followed standard medical Lyme treatments, “I would be dead today.” Lyme disease is not a fatal disease.

Still, Fish, like the other experts, said that Kennedy’s NIH putting more resources into understanding chronic Lyme could be extremely helpful for the thousands of Americans struggling with mysterious symptoms. These patients, he said, need answers and better diagnostic tools.

“These patients have serious illnesses, and I don’t blame them for raising hell about the situation,” he said.

Lyme is a disease that makes sense as a target for Kennedy, as obsessing over chronic illnesses is a core tenet of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Kennedy has said one of his sons developed Bell’s palsy from Lyme and that one son developed severe, debilitating chronic Lyme. Kennedy is also, fittingly for his family’s reputation for being full of robust outdoorsmen, a big proponent of getting outside into the woods—advice being made dangerous by the ticks. He noted the “spiritual” value of the outdoors in his address Monday.

Lyme also makes some sense as a target for the moment, when there is no epidemiological crisis such as SARS or COVID or AIDS consuming all the oxygen in the conversation. Leading experts in Lyme say people are beginning to understand the “insidious epidemic” of Lyme, as Dr. John Aucott, the director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center, put it. He and Fallon expressed the need not just for studies and testing but an entire built-out academic infrastructure around it. Right now, most academic programs are struggling under federal budget cuts; Lyme research is one area where Kennedy’s personal interest may be of use.

For countless Americans, this could be great news. Aucott noted that he watched AIDS go from a death sentence to a manageable condition—proof that painstaking, rigorous research can revolutionize the understanding and treatment of a new disease. Today, he said, some of his Lyme patients are sicker than the AIDS patients were at the end of his time treating them.

Hopefully, Kennedy’s anti-science approach will not impede the evidence-based Lyme research that comes. His sloppiness, as when he repeatedly during panel discussions conflated Lyme disease and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, may not carry through to actual policy. And in at least one way, experts gave Kennedy credit on something else: He’s right, they said, that most people are not just sick from psychosomatic causes. “These are complex illnesses we’re just starting to understand,” Aucott said. “They’ve got a hard-to-explain illness. That doesn’t mean it’s just in their heads.”

But when diseases are particularly complex, and when the medical understanding of a topic shifts rapidly, it’s particularly damaging to have a man who consistently undermines the mainstream scientific community as the face of its public health response. The public needs clarity from its government, not just disruption. In this case, clarity doesn’t just mean validating suffering patients’ frustrations. It means acknowledging the limits of our knowledge while having an open mind—and focusing not on heated feelings but on the scientific process.

A striking convergence of events this week should have shaken the Pentagon’s overseers but so far hasn’t. On Wednesday, the Senate passed a $900 billion defense bill by an overwhelming 77–20 margin. A few days earlier, the New York Times devoted its entire 13-page Sunday Opinion section to argue that much of that budget is a colossal waste of money.

Titled “Overmatched: Why the U.S. Military Needs to Reinvent Itself,” the package catalogs the many ways in which the country’s war machine “is ill prepared for today’s global threats and revolutionary technologies.”

Its findings are based largely on an exclusive leak of a classified, comprehensive review of U.S. military power prepared and briefed in 2021 by the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment—an analytical center that Donald Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has since eliminated. The review not only analyzed recent war games, mainly against China, but also traced “a decades-long decline in America’s ability to win a long war with a major power.”

The Times article attributes this decline—which many intelligence agencies and private defense analysts have also been following for many years—to several factors. Chief among them is the post–Cold War consolidation of more than 50 weapons manufacturers, some of them nimble competitors, into a handful of sluggish, overfed megacompanies. This trend has been matched by the calcification of the Pentagon bureaucracy supposedly monitoring the companies—and by the vested interests of legislators whose districts profit off the companies’ contracts and who therefore want to protect their monopoly status.

The piece details two symptoms of the resulting stagnation, one large, one small. In 2020 the leadership of the U.S. Navy—which has focused these past decades on building a small number of large, overly complex, increasingly vulnerable warships—outlined a plan to buy a fleet of small warships, based on ready-made European designs. Then, the big contractors and their allies in the bureaucracy and Congress took over the project, resisted all innovations, and lapsed into the same patterns. Last month, after five years, $3.5 billion, and zero ships built, the project was canceled.

On a more mundane and thus in some ways more gasp-worthy scale, the Times detailed the Army’s plan in 2011 to get its soldiers new pistols. It should have been simple, but the officers found themselves embarking on a soul-crushing “odyssey” entailing “a 350-page list of technical specifications, years of testing, and a protracted battle on Capitol Hill between competing gun makers.” The Pentagon now estimates that the weapon will be delivered to troops in the field in 2027 “at the earliest.” It will have taken at least 16 years to develop, build, and deploy a pistol.

Meanwhile, despite the hundreds of billions of dollars in the defense budget (much of it spilled on large warships, warplanes, nuclear missiles, and other “legacy” weapons), defense industries find themselves unable to build large numbers of weapons that in wartime are used in large numbers.

For instance, in June’s attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, the U.S. fired 30 Tomahawk cruise missiles. Each missile will cost $2 million to replace. Just one company, Raytheon, makes them, and these days, it’s unable to build new ones as fast as the military is firing them against some target or other.

Last year, the Pentagon was close to negotiating a partnership deal with a Japanese firm so the two together could make a lot more cruise missiles. Early on in the Trump administration, the deal fell apart, mainly because Raytheon, which wanted to retain sole ownership, found allies in the White House and the Pentagon who wanted to preserve the “America First” monopoly.

The same resistance is blocking co-production of ships (South Korea has more shipyards than the United States, but there’s no appetite politically to farm out shipbuilding contracts to non-American firms) and even of artillery shells. The war in Ukraine is showing a need for millions of these shells to sustain a long battle. European countries are cooperating to supply Ukrainian soldiers with these munitions, but the Pentagon is ignoring the lesson for long-term production demands.

The Times series overstates some points. Most broadly, simulated war games, such as the ones that informed the Pentagon’s Net Assessment study, are designed not so much to predict the outcome of a war as to highlight vulnerabilities, shortcomings, and imbalances so that commanders can make adjustments.

Still, the games and the study, which the Times package summarizes, emphasized a lot of shortcomings—and noted that the Pentagon is doing little to make adjustments because the bureaucracy, the defense industry, and Congress, often working in tandem, make it hard to do so.

The Times also overstates other, smaller matters. For instance, it correctly notes that China has more warships than the United States, but the firepower of the U.S. ships—the number and range of their missiles and aircraft, the training of their crews and pilots—far surpasses China’s. Then again, the United States has global missions, and it doesn’t have enough ships to fight a major war in more than one of the world’s regions at a time.

More to the point, America’s warships are vulnerable. Deploying an aircraft carrier, like the USS Gerald R. Ford, into a tense area conveys a potent message; it’s a powerful tool of “gunboat diplomacy.” But it’s questionable whether commanders would want to send it into an active war theater, especially against China, which is ready to launch swarms of accurate drones and anti-ship missiles to disable even a mighty carrier—and to turn on cyber-weapons to jam the high-tech sensors and guidance systems that make the carrier and its escort ships so powerful.

Many analysts have noted these problems for some time. A small branch of the Defense Department, called the Defense Innovations Unit, has actually been evading and overcoming many of the bureaucratic obstacles, especially in streamlining military supply chains and developing autonomous drones. Hegseth announced several reforms designed, at least on paper, to apply some of the DIU’s breakthroughs to larger weapons systems. But it’s one thing to make an announcement, another to enforce it—and the secretary of defense lacks the personnel in the Pentagon, the commitment from the White House, and the supply from Capitol Hill to get much done.

The Times’ special section was very unusual—in its devotion to a single issue, its depth of analysis, and its range of prescriptions. Newspaper editorials, of course, rarely have much impact, especially these days, when no newspaper, not even the Times, struts the stage of mass media with the august authority it once held.

Still, in this season of big budgets and a world of looming threats, this passage from the Times section is worth pondering:

It is an ancient and familiar pattern. Despite ample warnings, military and political leaders trained in one set of assumptions, tactics and weapons fail to adapt to change. … That’s where the United States risks finding itself. The Trump administration wants to increase defense spending in 2026 to more than $1 trillion. Much of that money will be squandered on capabilities that do more to magnify our weaknesses than to sharpen our strengths.

In other words, this is not just a budget story. It’s a story, and potentially a crisis, about global power—and how our own political-economic system, which has been a source of our power in the past, is confining and limiting our power in the new era.

In the past year, a short video was pinned to the social media feed of Chabad Rabbi Eli Schlanger, of Sydney. In that video, filmed last Hanukkah, Schlanger steps out of his home, smiling, announcing: “Here’s the best response to combat antisemitism!” As a song—“Just a Little Bit of Light”—plays, he lifts a large menorah from his car, fastens it onto the roof, lights it, and dances beside it, out in the street. It is a moment of joy, confidence, and trust in the idea that anyone facing bigotry can bring their full self into the public square. This year, at a Hanukkah gathering at Bondi Beach, Schlanger was murdered together with another 14 Jews who had assembled to publicly celebrate the holiday.

Schlanger’s video and his killing point to a question that reaches beyond the Jewish community: Who is able to bring their full identity into public civic life, and what does that say about the society in which we live?

For minority groups—religious, ethnic, racial—public visibility is not merely expressive. It is a measure of belonging. The ability to appear as oneself in shared civic spaces signals confidence that one’s neighbors see that expressed identity as legitimate, accepted, and safe. When visibility becomes dangerous, it is not simply an indication that the minority community is at risk. It’s a sign that the social contract itself has begun to fray.

This is not a theoretical or faraway concern for Americans. As Yair Rosenberg reported in the Atlantic this month, recent surveys show that the generation now coming of age in the United States reflects levels of hostility toward Jews unmatched in any other recent generation. In a 2024 survey of nearly 130,000 Americans, one-quarter of voters under 25 reported an “unfavorable opinion” of Jewish people—with negligible differences between left and right. The Yale Youth Poll found an identical pattern: Younger respondents were dramatically more likely to say that Jews have “too much power” or a “negative impact” on the country.

Across polls, the same curve appears again and again—age, not ideology, is now the strongest predictor of anti-Jewish sentiment. This is not about fringe extremists. It is about the cohort that will shape campuses, media, technology, politics, and public norms in the coming decades. By default, then, this is the cohort that determines Jewish safety in public spaces. Notably, the killers at Bondi Beach were a 24-year-old man and his father.

This all matters because public space is not neutral. It is built and maintained by the people who inhabit it. If younger Americans increasingly view all Jews with suspicion, then the simple act embodied in Schlanger’s video—a Jew standing visibly and joyfully as a Jew—will become harder, not easier, to express in the next generation. His murder forces us to confront the dangers Jews face today, not just in Australia but in the shifting American landscape that now forces us to ask who will feel safe tomorrow.

Jews have been grappling with the relationship between visibility and belonging for generations. In 1978 Rabbi Joseph Glaser, a Reform leader, argued that Jewish rituals should remain confined to private property. Public space, he insisted, should be religiously neutral—a buffer protecting minorities from majoritarian dominance. His approach reflected an era in which safety seemed to lie in discretion.

The Chabad movement, of which Schlanger was a part, came to wider prominence in Judaism under the leadership of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson in the last half of the 20th century and argued the precise opposite: Jews should not disappear themselves, and public religious expression strengthened both Jewish identity and America’s pluralistic character. A menorah in the public square was not a breach of neutrality but a sign that the country belonged equally to all.

These were not theological disagreements. They were different assessments of a democratic society’s capacity to welcome difference. Glaser’s caution and Schneerson’s confidence each assumed something radically different about the U.S.: its norms, its protections, its willingness to embrace or merely tolerate Jewish presence.

Neither view alone determines whether Jews feel safe in public. That depends on society.

Minority visibility is not a minority decision. It is a majoritarian responsibility.

When Jews can gather openly, when they can sing and celebrate without fear, it signals that the country’s commitments—to equality, pluralism, and mutual care—are holding. When they cannot do so, it indicates the opposite—and not just for one group alone.

Only one year ago, Schlanger believed he could answer hatred with light. He believed that public joy was not only permissible but meaningful. His belief did not fail. Society failed him. And that failure raises broader questions: Who gets to feel safe while visible? Whose identities are treated as unexceptional in public life? Which communities must negotiate their presence as a risk?

These questions become even more pressing when set against the growing antisemitism among young Americans. It is tempting to read these trends as destiny, but they are not. Prejudice is not merely a matter of sentiment; it is shaped by the norms that a society chooses to reinforce or neglect. These shifts do not simply describe a generational change—they pose a civic challenge. If belonging in public space can erode, it can also be rebuilt. The responsibility lies not only in confronting hatred, but in strengthening the democratic norms that make visibility safe in the first place.

A healthy democracy does not ask its minorities to calculate whether they can appear as themselves in shared spaces without risking their safety, or even their lives. It does not demand that visibility be balanced against survival. When that comes into question, it signals that something deeper is unsettled: that the norms meant to protect the vulnerable have weakened, and that belonging itself has become conditional.

The burden of ensuring Jewish safety—or in fact the safety of any minority—should never fall on the minority alone. It belongs to all of us. History has taught Jews to protect themselves when others won’t. But the real measure of a society is whether it makes that instinct unnecessary.

Schlanger’s final message remains clear: People flourish when they are able to stand fully as themselves. The question his murder forces upon us is whether the countries Jews call home will choose to affirm or deny that possibility.

            <div id="article-text">The University of Sydney is ringing around thousands of current and former staff and students after admitting attackers helped themselves to historical personal data stashed inside one of its online code repositories.

In a message published on December 18, the vice president of operations at the University of Sydney, Nicole Gower, said the university was alerted last week to &quot;suspicious activity in one of our online IT code libraries.&quot;

She said this had triggered an emergency lockdown of the system. While the repository was meant for software development, Gower acknowledged that &quot;there were also historical data files in this code library containing personal information about some members of our community.&quot;

The university was quick to stress that the incident was unrelated to a separate student results issue reported a day earlier and said there is currently no sign that the data has been misused.

According to an accompanying FAQ, the compromised system contained historical data extracts used for testing during earlier development work, rather than live production databases.

Officials said the unauthorized access was limited to a single platform and that other university systems were not affected. Even so, the files were accessed and downloaded, and the university has brought in external cybersecurity partners while notifying government authorities as the investigation continues into the new year.

The university estimates that the accessed data includes personal information for approximately 10,000 current staff and affiliates and around 12,500 former staff and affiliates active as of September 4, 2018. On top of that, historical datasets spanning 2010 to 2019 include records linked to roughly 5,000 alumni and students, as well as six supporters.

For staff linked to one of the retired systems involved in the incident, the exposed information may include names, dates of birth, phone numbers, home addresses, and basic employment details such as job titles and dates of employment. Gower confirmed that &quot;the data has been accessed and downloaded,&quot; while insisting there is &quot;no evidence it has been used or published.&quot;

The University of Sydney said it began sending notifications to affected individuals on December 18, though it warned that the process will drag into January 2026 as it finishes reviewing the files and checking contact details. The institution says it has purged the identified datasets from the code library and is assessing further remediation under its Privacy Resilience Program.

While the university maintains there is no evidence of harm so far, the episode is another reminder of how long-forgotten data can come back to bite. ®

            <div id="article-text">Already £1.4 billion over budget and four years late, a tech transformation project at a UK state-owned bank is outside HM Treasury spending limits and timetable under a revised plan from systems integrator Capgemini.

Speaking to MPs this week, Dax Harkins, chief executive of National Savings and Investments (NS&I), said he could not guarantee the troubled project would not be hit by further setbacks requiring the extension of a contract with incumbent supplier Atos, which is due to end in 2028.

&quot;We are working through the first version of the integrated plan we hoped would give us that [assurance]. I can tell you now that [plan] goes beyond March 2028 and it goes beyond our cost profile, and we are working to improve that,&quot; he told the Public Accounts Committee, a Parliamentary public spending watchdog.

&quot;I think we&#39;ve got some real options that will help to do that and do it in a considered and thoughtful way to still get the outcomes that we want. But we&#39;ve got to do that work to validate [it].&quot;

Harkins said NS&I, which handles £240 billion in customer investments, has the capacity and the resources to deliver the plan on budget when it is finalized.

&quot;We&#39;ve got some options to bring that [cost] in that we&#39;re working through at the moment. Until we&#39;ve done all of that work, we won&#39;t know exactly where that takes us. But HM Treasury have been really clear. We need to get an option to work within the budget. We just don&#39;t know the makeup of that,&quot; he said.

Earlier this year, the National Audit Office, a public spending watchdog, slammed the NS&I transformation program, which includes new customer-facing technology and a new banking engine.

In 2020, NS&I began a business transformation program called Project Rainbow, which aimed to reduce the bank&#39;s running costs, make NS&I a self-service digital business, and replace its 20-year outsourcing deal with Atos by splitting the work into five separate contracts.

In 2014, the bank awarded Atos a new contract to run until 2021, and then extended it until 2024 and again until 2028 without competition, handing the French outsourcer another £474.4 million. The total cost of the program is expected to hit £3.0 billion until 2030-31, including its contract with Atos and other running costs. The total cost increase is set for £1.3 billion compared to the 2020 business case, the NAO said in November.

Matthew Smith, the transformation program&#39;s senior responsible owner, said Capgemini – which was awarded the £48 million SI contract in July – had worked with NS&I and the program&#39;s other suppliers to pull the integrated plan together.

&quot;We have never had that before,&quot; he said.

Among the proposals under consideration to cut costs and speed up the program was cutting the step of building a new website and mobile app linked to the legacy banking application. &quot;It&#39;s one of the initiatives that we&#39;re looking at to bring that plan forward to actually not incur that nugatory cost and time of building to the legacy, but to build to the new capabilities of the new banking engine first,&quot; he said.

The NAO report [PDF] points out that the replacement of the core banking engine &quot;carries an extremely high level of risk.&quot;

As well as being the incumbent supplier for the legacy system, Atos was awarded a £474.4 million ($612 million) contract without competition to build systems including modernizing the core banking engine, as well as running payment, reporting, and business-to-business services from 23 December 2024 until 31 March 2028.

NS&I had originally gone to market to kick off the competition for a new core banking, payments and reporting system, which together with business-to-business services for government payments was worth £480.3 million over nine years.

In a procurement note, the government-owned bank said that the award was made to Atos without competition because &quot;as the incumbent service provider Atos and its key sub-contractor(s) are the providers of the existing NS&I core banking platforms, which rely on interdependent leveraged technology and resources.

&quot;The process of dis-aggregating these at the same time as building and deploying a new core banking instance would be sufficiently complex that it can only be practicably carried out by Atos IT Services UK without very significant disruption to NS&I customers,&quot; it said.

Smith told MPs that the Atos contract has the option for an additional one-year extension, although NS&I would need to &quot;take approvals before we can exercise that option.&quot;

&quot;And there&#39;s a further period beyond that for transition assistance,&quot; he said.

Since its relationship with Atos (previously Siemens) began in 1999, NS&I can look forward to a 30-year relationship with the French outsourcer with no end currently in sight. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new pearOS distro is a Romanian project that picks up the concepts behind the original Pear Linux from 2011 and updates them. It&#39;s not going to turn the distro world upside down, but it&#39;s fun, interesting, and a showcase for the versatility and customizability of the Linux desktop.

Pear Linux was a French distro by David Tavares, based on Ubuntu and GNOME but heavily themed with custom fonts, icons, menu layouts, and more, all intended to make it visually resemble Apple&#39;s Mac OS X as closely as possible. As DistroWatch records, it went through some seven releases between 2011 and 2013, before Tavares announced that an unnamed company had bought it, and the distro vanished. Some contemporary reviews of PearOS 3.0 (2012), PearOS 7.0, and PearOS 8.0 (both 2013) – especially their screenshots – will give you an idea of how well it accomplished that. The idea has enduring appeal. After it disappeared, there were attempts to revive it, including Pearl Linux and Clementine OS, both in 2014, but neither got far.

pearOS is back, replacing Ubuntu with Arch and GNOME with the latest KDE Plasma

Over a decade later, a young Romanian developer called Alexandru Balan has released a new pearOS distro, rebuilt on a new basis of Arch Linux and the latest KDE Plasma 6.5.4. The release announcement calls this basis NiceC0re, and as the screenshots there show, this pearOS is styled to look like this year&#39;s macOS 26 &quot;Tahoe.&quot;

This is more than just a custom theme slapped onto a default KDE Plasma setup. There&#39;s a working global menu bar, with a pear menu in place of an apple menu at top left. This contains a single-column Settings app, which resembles the iOS style Settings app of macOS 13 Ventura and above. Within is an optimistic array of macOS-like features, many of which, such as Focus Mode, don&#39;t open and instead display:

This feature is currently not available. Please check back later for updates.

There&#39;s a Pear Piri option (in place of Siri) with a Pear Intelligence feature, the desktop is called &quot;Pinder,&quot; there&#39;s a pCloud section, and &quot;Wallet and Pear Pay,&quot; and so on. We certainly can&#39;t fault the ambition here. Since quite a bit of its functionality is yet to be implemented, it&#39;s a good thing that this is in addition to KDE&#39;s standard System Settings app.

Rather than KDE&#39;s Dolphin file manager, it uses the GNOME Files app, but most of the accessories are KDE ones: the Kate text editor, Discover app store, and so on. It ships with Flatpak installed, but no Flatpak apps. The default browser is the latest Firefox, and there&#39;s no office suite, just KWrite.

It&#39;s not a lightweight distro. It takes about 12 GB of disk and 1.2 GB of RAM at idle. The installation medium&#39;s boot menu offers a choice of using the latest Nvidia drivers, or FOSS drivers. With the latter, it was able to bring up the second screen on our testbed ThinkPad W520, although it&#39;s attached to a long-unsupported GPU. We weren&#39;t able to install it on that machine, though.

The installer is custom and one of the more unfinished areas of the distro. It comes up with a choice of just three languages: Romanian, Czech, or English. However, selecting them won&#39;t help you, as there is no Next or Continue button. It took us considerable experimentation to determine that the only way to get the button to display was to press the Tab key to move the selection, and then a big right-facing arrow became visible. This quickly revealed a very significant limitation. Much like that other FOSS macOS-like, the Hello System, the installer will only let you select a whole drive. There&#39;s no way to dual-boot with another OS unless you have two separate physical drives – and we could tell that this was unexpected, because when we tried again on another machine with two SSDs, the icon for the second appeared completely off the bottom of the installer window and floating over the desktop. It doesn&#39;t show its best under VMs either.

With that hiccup overcome, it installed fine and ran well. It uses X11 rather than Wayland and adding a user account is postponed until post-installation like in Fedora.

From the project&#39;s GitHub page, it looks to have been under construction for several years, and we found traces on the Internet Archive of several earlier versions of this restarted project. Even so, there are a number of sections in the Settings app that clearly aim to resemble Apple features that Linux doesn&#39;t really do just yet.

Compatibility-wise, it&#39;s Arch with the latest KDE. Pretty much everything you could want is here or in the AUR repository. Functionally, it&#39;s KDE, but it&#39;s a lovely and very functional take on KDE. Appearances are of course subjective, but The Reg FOSS desk isn&#39;t fond of any of the modern themes or looks included with KDE, and it lacks anything as simple as Xfce&#39;s Panel Profiles to load different desktop layouts with a single click. It&#39;s a bit of fun in the bleak midwinter (for those of us in the northern hemisphere). We rather like it. ®

            <div id="article-text">Budget-friendly smartphones and memory-hungry AI PCs might have higher price tags next year.

Budget-friendly smartphones and memory-hungry AI PCs might have higher price tags next year.

Your next smartphone or PC might cost more amid a global memory shortage that the International Data Corporation expects to “persist well into 2027.” A new report from the research firm lays out the potential impact of the RAM crunch, saying it “signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage” — for now, at least.

The price of RAM has skyrocketed over the past few months as the world’s biggest memory makers — Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix — allocate more resources for AI companies, which are buying up tons of memory for their massive data centers. Though PC gamers looking to upgrade their build’s RAM may have been the first to feel the impact of this crunch, it’s coming for other devices, too.

As noted by the IDC, the cost of a smartphone “is heavily dependent” on the type of memory it uses, with soaring RAM costs leading phonemakers to “raise prices significantly, cut specifications or both.” Budget-friendly smartphones from brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Honor, and Huawei will “have no other option” but to pass along these higher costs to consumers, according to the IDC. These manufacturers have already optimized the parts they use to keep prices low and have little room to swap out existing parts for cheaper ones. Xiaomi and Honor have already started raising prices on their tablets, while Xiaomi has warned about price increases coming for its smartphones, too.

Samsung and Apple, on the other hand, might have a bit more leeway, as they’re able to “secure memory supply 12-24 months in advance,” the IDC says. They may not add more than 12GB of RAM in their flagship smartphones, an upgrade both the iPhone 17 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra came with this year. Altogether, the IDC expects the average selling price of phones to rise by 3 to 5 percent if the “moderate” scenario plays out, or by 6 to 8 percent with a “pessimistic” outlook.

Moving to PCs, the IDC says the memory shortage creates a “perfect storm” for the PC industry, coming at the same time Microsoft ends support for Windows 10 and pushes memory-hungry AI PCs. Several PC and laptop makers have already confirmed incoming price hikes, including Dell, HP, Acer, and Asus.

Meanwhile, the makers of AI-heavy devices like Microsoft’s Copilot Plus PCs may have to raise prices or reduce the amount of RAM they put in their PCs. That may prove difficult as Copilot Plus PCs come with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. Though the IDC isn’t changing its official PC market forecast for 2026, it says the average selling price of PCs could rise by 4 to 6 percent in a moderate scenario, or 6 to 8 percent in a “pessimistic” one.

﻿They deliver great sound and ANC performance, and they should arrive before Christmas.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

If you value peace and quiet, particularly when traveling, Bose’s first-gen QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are worth checking out. They’re our favorite noise-canceling headphones for travel, and right now, you can snag a pair for an all-time low of $279 ($150 off) in select colors from Amazon, Best Buy, and Bose. All three retailers estimate that shipments should arrive before Christmas, with Bose saying its cutoff for free two-day shipping is December 22nd at 12PM ET.

The QC Ultra offer top-tier noise cancellation, allowing you to block out the chaos of the holidays. They also feature some of the best comfort you’ll find in this category, which is fitting considering the name. The design is lightweight, the ear cushions are nice and soft, and the headband features a relatively gentle clamping force, making them comfortable to wear over extended periods. They can also fold down for easy storage, while the battery can last up to 24 hours, so you don’t have to worry about charging while on the go.

In his review, former senior reviewer Chris Welch said the headphones put a bit more emphasis on bass than Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, which the first-gen QC Ultra replaced. The overall sound is more detailed and preserves the lows and highs even when the volume is dialed down. The QC Ultra also support high-end features like wear detection, which will automatically pause your audio when you take them off, and a natural-sounding transparency mode that pipes in ambient noise to keep you aware of your surroundings.

It’s worth flagging that Bose introduced a new version of the QC Ultra Headphones a few months ago with a higher starting price of $449 (though you can currently snag a pair at Amazon, Best Buy, and Bose for $50 off). While the latest model resembles the original, the second-gen headphones offer better battery life and several new features, including support for lossless audio over USB-C and an enhanced transparency mode that can filter out sudden noises. The first-gen version is still a great buy, though, and at just $279, a much better value right now.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Where’s the Trump Phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week, except next week, when we take a break until the new year. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump Phone’s whereabouts. As usual, we’re still waiting for a response. In the meantime, we’re wondering who’s actually behind the mobile company.

Yesterday’s announcement that one of the Trump companies is merging with TAE Technologies raised an unexpected prospect: Is the company that gave up on building phones in the US about to try making a nuclear fusion power plant instead?

The simple answer is no. The longer answer is that we don’t actually know who’s behind Trump Mobile — but it doesn’t come from Trump Media & Technology Group, the wing of the Trump empire that’s suddenly really into fusion power.

Trump Mobile was announced in June by The Trump Organization, with splashy quotes and media appearances from Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., both executive vice presidents in the company.

The Trump Organization is run by the Trump children, but owned by the US president via a trust, and it houses myriad more privately owned Trump subsidiaries. Trump Media isn’t among those — it’s a publicly traded company, founded when Trump left office as a vehicle for the Truth Social network. Trump previously owned a majority stake in the company, though that too is now in a trust — managed by Don Jr., who’s also on the Trump Media board of directors.

So Trump Media does social networks and nuclear fusion, while The Trump Organization is making the Trump phone, right? Not quite. It may have announced the Trump phone, but it did so “alongside the team from Trump Mobile,” according to the company’s press release, suggesting a degree of separation. The small print at the end hammers the point home further:

Trump Mobile, its products and services are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals. T1 Mobile LLC uses the “Trump” name and trademark pursuant to the terms of a limited license agreement which may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.

So we have Trump Mobile, and now T1 Mobile LLC, neither of which are seemingly part of The Trump Organization. Trump Mobile’s site has its own small print, which says much the same:

TRUMPSM and all associated designs are trademarks of DTTM Operations LLC. TrumpSM Mobile, its products and services are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The TrumpSM Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals. T1 Mobile LLC uses the TRUMPSM name and trademark pursuant to the terms of a limited license agreement which may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.

But now there’s another company in the mix: DTTM Operations LLC. That is part of The Trump Organization and is simply the company Trump uses for registering trademarks. It was DTTM Operations that applied for the trademarks for “T1” and “Trump” in the mobile space and owns similar Trump trademarks for sneakers, perfume, spring water, and more.

There’s still more we don’t know than we do about Trump Mobile’s ownership

So The Trump Organization owns the Trump Mobile trademarks, via DTTM Operations. And it licenses those trademarks to T1 Mobile LLC, the company that actually operates Trump Mobile. So who’s behind T1 Mobile LLC?

Registered in Florida in April, state records only give an address in Palm Beach. There you’ll find an office building that houses a local bank, an air duct cleaning company, and a urologist — plus the offices of Stuart Kaplan, the attorney who’s listed as the registered agent of T1 Mobile.

Kaplan hasn’t kept his involvement with Trump Mobile on the down-low. He helped announce the mobile company in June, posting on X that he had “partnered with Eric and Don Jr. Trump,” before repeating the familiar line — since rescinded — that the phones would be manufactured in the US.

Kaplan also runs a risk management company, Kaplan & Sconzo, offering risk assessment, investigation, and private security services. Kaplan claims to have been an FBI special agent from 1995 to 2006, a fact he frequently leverages in appearances on local and national news, including CNN, CBS, and Fox. Just this week he appeared on Fox News to discuss the investigation into the Brown University shooting and over the past 12 months has appeared on TV to discuss National Guard deployments, Charlie Kirk’s death, and Kash Patel’s performance as head of the FBI, with years of appearances before that.

He’s been happy to talk Trump too. Kaplan spoke to CNN in 2022 about the FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago, to CBS a year later about the arraignment, and has repeatedly popped up in the news to discuss other aspects of the president’s legal situation, always presented as a former FBI agent and defense attorney. As far as I can tell Kaplan hasn’t popped up in the media to discuss Trump specifically since the paperwork for T1 Mobile LLC was filed on April 25, 2025, but did appear on Florida station WPTV to discuss Trump’s charges as recently as last December, complaining about the FBI being weaponized to “do the dirty work” of Trump’s adversaries.

There’s still more we don’t know than we do about Trump Mobile’s ownership. We don’t know what Kaplan’s role in T1 Mobile LLC is, beyond being the lawyer who registered the company, nor when his relationship with the Trumps began. We don’t know who owns T1 Mobile LLC, or who runs the company. We don’t know how closely linked the Trump sons or The Trump Organization are with day-to-day operations, other than a small print suggestion that they’re doing no more than licensing the Trump name.

But at least we know, as best as we can tell, that the people who’ve repeatedly failed to release a smartphone on time aren’t the same ones tasked with building the world’s first commercial nuclear fusion reactor next year.

None of Trump Mobile, The Trump Organization, nor Stuart Kaplan replied to my latest request for comment.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real.

            <h2>China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/18/1130148/china-ev-battery-recycle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <h2>Is ChatGPT’s New Shopping Research Solving a Problem, or Creating One?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.
