            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/microsoft-vows-to-cover-full-power-costs-for-energy-hungry-ai-data-centers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, Microsoft announced a new initiative called “Community-First AI Infrastructure” that commits the company to paying full electricity costs for its data centers and refusing to seek local property tax reductions.

As demand for generative AI services has increased over the past year, Big Tech companies have been racing to spin up massive new data centers for serving chatbots and image generators that can have profound economic effects on the surrounding areas where they are located. Among other concerns, communities across the country have grown concerned that data centers are driving up residential electricity rates through heavy power consumption and by straining water supplies due to server cooling needs.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global data center electricity demand will more than double by 2030, reaching around 945 TWh, with the United States responsible for nearly half of total electricity demand growth over that period. This growth is happening while much of the country’s electricity transmission infrastructure is more than 40 years old and under strain.

It’s a big enough issue that in December, US senators launched a probe demanding tech companies explain how they plan to prevent data center projects from increasing electricity bills.

Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote in the company’s blog post about the announcement that the company will “set a high bar” for responsible data center development, making promises that seem targeted to quell the growing criticism surrounding AI data center construction.

The company’s plan to address the issues includes five commitments: covering full electricity costs to prevent rate increases for residents, minimizing water use while replenishing more than the company withdraws, creating local jobs, paying full property taxes, and investing in AI training programs for data center communities.

In the Microsoft blog post, Smith acknowledged that residential electricity rates have recently risen in dozens of states, driven partly by inflation, supply chain constraints, and grid upgrades. He wrote that communities “value new jobs and property tax revenue, but not if they come with higher power bills or tighter water supplies.”

Microsoft says it will ask utilities and public commissions to set rates high enough to cover the full electricity costs for its data centers, including infrastructure additions. In Wisconsin, the company is supporting a new rate structure that would charge “Very Large Customers,” including data centers, the cost of the electricity required to serve them.

Smith wrote that while some have suggested the public should help pay for the added electricity needed for AI, Microsoft disagrees. He stated, “Especially when tech companies are so profitable, we believe that it’s both unfair and politically unrealistic for our industry to ask the public to shoulder added electricity costs for AI.”

On water usage for cooling, Microsoft plans a 40 percent improvement in data center water-use intensity by 2030. A recent environmental audit from AI model-maker Mistral found that training and running its Large 2 model over 18 months produced 20.4 kilotons of CO2 emissions and evaporated enough water to fill 112 Olympic-size swimming pools, illustrating the aggregate environmental impact of AI operations at scale.

To solve some of these issues, Microsoft says it has launched a new AI data center design using a closed-loop system that constantly recirculates cooling liquid, dramatically cutting water usage. In this design, already deployed in Wisconsin and Georgia, potable water is no longer needed for cooling.

On property taxes, Smith stated in the blog post that the company will not ask local municipalities to reduce their rates. The company says it will pay its full share of local property taxes. Smith wrote that Microsoft’s goal is to bring these commitments to life in the first half of 2026. Of course, these are PR-aligned company goals and not realities yet, so we’ll have to check back in later to see whether Microsoft has been following through on its promises.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s Veo video AI made stunning leaps in fidelity in 2025, and Google isn’t stopping in 2026. The company has announced an update for Veo 3.1 that adds new capabilities when you provide the model with reference material, known as Ingredients to Video. The results should be more consistent, and output supports vertical video and higher-resolution upscaling.

With Ingredients to Video, you can provide the AI with up to three images to incorporate into the generated video. You can use that to provide the robot with characters to animate, backgrounds, and material textures. When you do that, the newly upgraded model will allegedly make fewer random alterations, hemming closer to the reference images. You can also generate multiple clips and even prompt for changes to the setting or style while keeping other elements consistent.

Google is also expanding its support for mobile-first video in Veo. When using Ingredients to Video, you can now specify outputs in a 9:16 (vertical) ratio. That makes it ideal for posting on social apps like Instagram or TikTok, as well as uploading as a YouTube Short. So get ready for even more phone-centric slop. Google added support for vertical videos via a text prompt last year.

Enhanced support for Ingredients to Video and the associated vertical outputs are live in the Gemini app today, as well as in YouTube Shorts and the YouTube Create app, fulfilling a promise initially made last summer. Veo videos are short—just eight seconds long for each prompt. It would be tedious to assemble those into a longer video, but Veo is perfect for the Shorts format.

The new Veo 3.1 update also adds an option for higher-resolution video. The model now supports 1080p and 4K outputs. Google debuted 1080p support last year, but it’s mentioning that option again today, suggesting there may be some quality difference. 4K support is new, but neither 1080p nor 4K outputs are native. Veo creates everything in 720p resolution, but it can be upscaled “for high-fidelity production workflows,” according to Google. However, a Google rep tells Ars that upscaling is only available in Flow, the Gemini API, and Vertex AI. Video in the Gemini app is always 720p.

We are rushing into a world where AI video is essentially indistinguishable from real life. Google, which more or less controls online video via YouTube’s dominance, is at the forefront of that change. Today’s update is reasonably significant, and it didn’t even warrant a version number change. Perhaps we can expect more 2025-style leaps in video quality this year, for better or worse.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Trump asked Elon Musk to get Starlink working more reliably in Iran to thwart the Iranian government’s Internet shutdown. Starlink operator SpaceX was apparently already working on the problem before Trump reached out to Musk.

Iran severed Internet connections and phone lines last week as the government conducted a violent crackdown on anti-government demonstrators, according to numerous reports, which say that thousands of people have been killed.

Starlink hasn’t been completely disabled. The government’s jamming technology has reportedly caused Starlink packet loss of anywhere from 30 to 80 percent.

It appears that SpaceX has been trying to bypass the jamming for days. NasNet, a group that helps Iranians access Starlink, said in an X post on Saturday that it collaborated with the Starlink technical team on an update that reduced packet loss to about 10 percent. But the group described Starlink availability as “an ongoing game of cat and mouse; therefore, conditions may change again or even worsen,” according to a translation.

Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One that he wants Starlink to be available in Iran. “We may get the Internet going, if that’s possible,” Trump said, according to The Washington Post. “We may speak to Elon, ‘cause as you know, he’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company. So we may speak to Elon Musk. And in fact, I’m going to call him as soon as I’m finished with you.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday that Trump “has spoken to Elon” about Internet service in Iran.

SpaceX’s satellite Internet service has been used during protests despite the Iranian government “never authorizing Starlink to function, making the service illegal to possess and use,” The Associated Press wrote. Iranian authorities started “searching for and confiscating Starlink dishes in western Tehran” over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal wrote yesterday.

In 2022, during a previous round of protests in which the Iranian government cracked down on demonstrators and cut off Internet access, the Biden administration issued a general license to let US companies make Internet services available to Iranians.

The Iranian government’s jamming of Starlink has apparently gotten more sophisticated, degrading uploads to make it hard for users to distribute information and images of protests. “I believe that they are using some military-grade jamming tools to jam the radio frequency signals, particularly jamming any videos, any content, any reports coming out of Iran,” Ahmad Ahmadian, executive director of US-based nonprofit Holistic Resilience, told The Washington Post.

“You don’t need a global kill switch to cripple the network,” Kimberly Burke, director of government affairs at consulting firm Quilty Space, told the Post. “You just make it unstable, slow and unreliable enough that it barely even works. Think intermittent dial-up speeds.”

Internet monitoring group NetBlocks told Reuters that Starlink access is reduced but not eliminated in Iran. “It is patchy, but still there,” NetBlocks founder Alp Toker said.

NetBlocks has been posting updates on Mastodon, saying that Iran’s connectivity to the outside world has remained at about 1 percent of ordinary levels. “Iran has now been offline for 120 hours,” NetBlocks said today. “Despite some phone calls now connecting, there is no secure way to communicate and the general public remain cut off from the outside world.”

Cloudflare’s monitoring reached similar conclusions. “In the last few days, Internet traffic from Iran has effectively dropped to zero,” Cloudflare Head of Data Insight David Belson wrote in a blog post today.

Although connectivity was restored for brief periods on January 9, “no significant changes have been observed in Iran’s Internet traffic since January 10,” he wrote. “The country remains almost entirely cut off from the global Internet, with internal data showing traffic volumes remaining at a fraction of a percent of previous levels.”

A fundraising page for sending Starlink terminals to Iran and covering subscription costs says that “over 100,000 people in Iran are already using Starlink to bypass censorship.” Since the government can’t fully block the service, it has used bans and banking sanctions to make it “extremely difficult for users inside Iran to pay for their subscriptions,” the fundraising page says.

NasNet said today that service is now being made available for free. “After weeks of continuous efforts, negotiations, and discussions with the Starlink team and United States authorities, we have successfully provided access to Starlink for free to serve the revolution,” NasNet wrote on X, according to a translation. “All you need to do is turn on the device. Don’t forget physical camouflage, hiding the Starlink IP, and changing the wireless network name!”</div>

            <h2>EPA moves to stop considering economic benefits of cleaner air</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/epa-axes-benefits-from-cost-benefit-analysis-for-air-pollution-limits/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you were to do a cost-benefit analysis of your lunch, it would be pretty difficult to do the calculation without the sandwich. But it appears that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving in this same direction—removing the benefit—when it comes to air pollution regulations.

According to a New York Times report based on internal emails and documents—and demonstrated by a recently produced analysis on the EPA website—the EPA is changing its cost-benefit analysis process for common air pollutants. Instead of comparing the economic cost of a certain pollution limit to an estimate of the economic value of the resulting improvements in human health, the EPA will just qualitatively describe health benefits while carefully quantifying economic costs.

Cost-benefit analysis has been a key component of EPA regulations. Any decision to raise or lower air quality standards or pollution limits includes evaluations of the cost that change, like the addition of new pollution control equipment at power plants, would incur, for example.

That cost gets compared to the economic benefits of reduced pollution, which is obviously a bit harder to calculate. At the more tractable end of the spectrum, they can calculate things like health care costs and lost economic productivity for people whose health worsens. Even this requires an estimate of how much of a health impact to expect for a given change in pollution.

But what’s the intrinsic dollar value of someone’s health? Attempts to tackle that thorny question in some practical way result in estimates known as “value of a statistical life.” The EPA has described this as “how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying from adverse health conditions that may be caused by environmental pollution.” Having this number gives us something to hold up next to the cost of that pollution control equipment.

The move to exclude the estimated benefits relates specifically to fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (known as PM2.5) and ozone. This particulate matter, commonly produced by combustion, is small enough to make it through your respiratory system and into your bloodstream. For this reason, it is associated with a host of health impacts even beyond respiratory conditions. That has made research on those impacts the target of anti-regulation advocates who claim scientists exaggerate the harm.

Ozone is also a familiar enough pollutant in smoggy areas to be mentioned in weather forecasts as a warning for people with conditions like asthma. Ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere results from reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by various anthropogenic sources.

The new EPA language claims that past analyses have failed to adequately represent the scientific uncertainty of the economic value of reducing these pollutants. The new economic impact analysis for stationary combustion turbines, for example, says this “leads the public to believe the Agency has a better understanding of the monetized impacts of exposure to PM2.5 and ozone than in reality.” It continues, “Therefore, to rectify this error, the EPA is no longer monetizing benefits from PM2.5 and ozone but will continue to quantify the emissions until the Agency is confident enough in the modeling to properly monetize those impacts.”

A 2024 regulatory impact analysis for stationary combustion turbines had estimated those benefits at $27–$92 million per year for a tightening of emissions limits.

This is not the first time that these numbers have become political targets. Between 2004 and 2008, the Bush administration reduced the EPA’s value of a statistical life by around 11 percent. But instead of moving numbers to the lower end of scientific estimates, the Trump administration is more aggressively weaponizing scientific uncertainty. Functionally, the logic is that since estimates of benefits vary from large to extremely large, the EPA will default to a value of zero. Only the costs will be calculated, and those numbers are sure to be highlighted as justification for loosening pollution limits.

Currently, documentation for how the EPA previously calculated pollution regulation benefits based on research—including transparent assessments of scientific uncertainties—is still available on the EPA website.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s professional creative apps have been slower to jump on the subscription bandwagon than those from Adobe or some of its other competitors, but the company is taking a step in that direction today. Starting on January 28, Apple will offer an Apple Creator Studio subscription for $13 a month, or $130 a year. Subscribers will get access to the Mac and (where applicable) iPad versions of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage, as well as “intelligent features and premium content” for the Mac, iPad, and iPhone versions of Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform.

Apple says it will also offer a one-month free trial for the subscription and a discounted version for students at $3 a month, or $30 a year.

Most of the apps also seem to be getting small feature updates to go along with the Creator Studio announcement. Final Cut will get a new Transcript Search feature that will allow you to dig through video footage by searching for specific dialogue, and a new Montage Maker feature “will analyze and edit together a dynamic video based on the best visual moments within the footage.” An updated Logic Pro “helps creators deliver original music for their video content” and adds a synth player to the app’s lineup of “AI Session Players.”

The biggest update is probably a new version of Pixelmator Pro for the iPad, designed around the Apple Pencil accessory. When Apple announced it was acquiring Pixelmator in late 2024, the image and vector editing app was only available for the Mac.

As for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers—in another lifetime, the apps formerly known as “iWork&quot;—the core apps remain free, but the Creator Studio subscription adds “premium templates and themes” for the apps, as well as access to a Content Hub that provides “curated, high-quality photos, graphics, and illustrations” for the apps. Apple is also offering a handful of OpenAI-powered generative features, including upscaling and transformation for existing images, the ability to generate images from text, and a Keynote feature that will create a slide deck from a text outline.

Unlike Adobe, Apple doesn’t offer lower-end subscription tiers that only give you access to individual apps. The Creator Studio package is the best value for creators who use more than one of these apps and who split their time between the Mac and iPhone/iPad versions. Anyone else will inevitably be paying for at least a handful of things you don’t use.

Apple’s subscription prices look reasonable based on what you would pay for an all-access subscription to Adobe’s Creative Cloud apps, though Adobe’s apps also cover web design, photo editing, and some other use cases that Apple’s subscription doesn’t—$780 a year, $105 a month, or $70 a month if you pay for one year’s subscription a month at a time. Apple also allows up to six people to share a single Creator Studio subscription via Family Sharing.

The good news for people who only want one or two apps (or who have already bought the apps, or who simply don’t want yet another subscription) is that the Mac versions of Final Cut Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Logic Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage remain available as standalone App Store purchases. Often, when apps shift to a subscription model, it means the standalone perpetually licensed versions go away—Adobe hasn’t offered standalone versions of Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, or its other apps since 2013.

The iPad versions of the apps, including Pixelmator Pro, appear to be subscription-only. Each of the apps has slightly different system requirements, all outlined in a long list of footnotes at the bottom of Apple’s announcement.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip, died today of prostate cancer at 68.

Adams satirized the world of cubicle-based IT and engineering in Dilbert, which at its height appeared in 2,000 daily newspapers and was later anthologized in numerous books.

Dilbert was an engineer with few social skills, but he always knew more than his pointy-haired boss, a caricature of terrible supervisors everywhere who managed to make the life of those who actually knew what they were doing—the engineers—much harder than it needed to be.

In his last two decades, Adams shifted increasingly from the world of comics to politics, where he became increasingly vocal—and abrasive—about his conservative views and his support for Donald Trump.

In the final years of his life, these attitudes cost him most of what he had built with Dilbert. For instance, in 2022, as Rolling Stone recounts, “over 75 newspapers dropped Dilbert after Adams introduced the strip’s first Black character, which he then used as a prop to mock ‘wokeness’ (the character identified as white and LGBTQ+ for work purposes).”

The next year, Adams lost far more papers when he offered commentary on a poll finding that just 53 percent of black Americans agreed with the phrase “It’s OK to be white.” (The phrase appears to have originated from alt-right users of 4chan.)

Adams took to his podcast to discuss the poll. The New York Times summed up his remarks:

“If nearly half of all Blacks are not OK with white people,” [Adams] said on the podcast episode, then they are a “hate group.” He added, “I don’t want to have anything to do with them. And I would say, based on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from Black people.”

This resulted in Dilbert‘s cancellations from most major papers. Adams later insisted on his website that he was not, in fact, a “big ol’ racist” and that he was speaking “hyperbolically, of course, because we Americans don’t have an option of staying away from each other.”

But he did still “recommend staying away from any group of Americans that identifies your group as the bad guys, because that puts a target on your back.”

Adams eventually relaunched the strip as the subscription-only Dilbert Reborn, which he said was “too spicy for the general public.” He focused more on his business and political books, including one on Donald Trump and the importance of “persuasion” over facts. He also spent significant time hosting the “Real Coffee with Scott Adams” community he created online.

Adams appeared on Real Coffee streams even as his health collapsed over the past year and he lost feeling in his legs; he was on a Real Coffee stream just two days ago, looking quite ill but still up for joking with his guests about how dumb liberal women must be to go protest right in front of heavily armed, amped-up police.

In a statement published after his death today—and read aloud on his Real Coffee channel by his ex-wife—Adams wrote little about Dilbert. Instead, he focused on his other books, saying that he had tried hard to be “useful” and encouraging his followers to do likewise.

“I had an amazing life,” Adams concluded. “I gave it everything I had.”

He also noted that many of his friends had encouraged him to “find Jesus before I go.” Despite not being a believer, Adams noted that the “risk-reward calculation for doing so looks attractive” and so he included a statement claiming to “accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior.”

“The part about me not being a believer should be quickly resolved if I wake up in heaven,” he added.</div>

            <h2>NASA Union Says Space Agency’s New Administrator Is a Straight-Up Liar</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During the government shutdown in November, the Trump administration suddenly accelerated its plans to shutter over a dozen buildings and around 100 laboratories at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).

The decision angered Democratic lawmakers, who accused them of going ahead with the “consolidation” effort without even consulting them.

In a November 10 letter addressed to Sean Duffy, who served as NASA’s interim administrator at the time, representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) noted that her staff had received “disturbing reports that NASA is directing the imminent closure of laboratories and facilities hosting mission-critical capabilities” at the GSFC.

Of particular concern is the campus’ main library, which was unceremoniously shut down last month, as the New York Times reported on December 31. NASA officials tried to downplay these concerns seemingly to no avail — as former and current staffers, advisors, and union representatives continue to watch in horror as the GSFC closures go on.

NASA insiders cried foul following the library’s closure, warning that critical and still-undigitized materials could be thrown out in what they said were reckless efforts by the Trump administration.

NASA’s new administrator, Jared Isaacman, who was confirmed by the Senate on December 17, was angered by the NYT‘s framing, accusing the newspaper of not fully reflecting the “context NASA shared.” He argued that “at no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials.”

That’s despite later admitting that “some materials with no historical or technical value may not be retained” following a “deliberate review” over a period of 60 days.

NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens chimed in as well, describing the moves at Goddard as a “consolidation, not a closure.”

Isaacman’s comments have seemingly done little to reassure rattled NASA staffers. In a January 7 response spotted by Astronomy, Matt Biggs, the president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) — a union that represents thousands of NASA scientists and engineers — accused Isaacman of making “patently false” statements.

“The rapid and haphazard shutdown of the library at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, reported on by The New York Times, decimated this valuable collection housed at NASA’s largest research library,” Biggs wrote.

The labor union boss also took issue with Isaacman’s argument that the consolidation efforts were part of the 2022 Goddard Master Plan, which dates back to the Biden administration.

“This was not part of some ‘long-planned facilities consolidation’ as Isaacman claims,” Biggs wrote. “The Goddard Master Plan, written in 2022, does not call for the library’s closure. Building 21, which houses the library, was scheduled for renovation, not elimination.”

Futurism has reached out to NASA for clarification. The agency failed to reply to a previous request for comment regarding details of the 2022 Master Plan.

Biggs also accused Isaacman of misleadingly stating on X that “NASA researchers will continue to have access to the scientific information and resources they need to do their work.”

“That’s simply not true,” he wrote. “Much of the material that was available in the library in Greenbelt, Maryland, is copyrighted or unique out-of-print material that cannot or has not been digitized and will no longer be available to researchers.”

It’s a precarious moment, as NASA’s future continues to be debated in Congress. If it were up to the White House, the historic agency would face the largest budget cuts in its 67-year history. Lawmakers, however, have since passed a counteroffer that would leave the agency’s science budget largely unaffected for the fiscal year of 2026 — which technically started in October, as the chaos has dragged on.

It’s a major test of Isaacman’s leadership after taking control of an agency in crisis last month. Insiders remain highly skeptical of the Trump administration’s approach. They say NASA should be opening doors, not closing them, especially as the United States looks to return astronauts to the Moon in the coming years.

“Where is the consolidation?” Biggs wrote. “The material is not being consolidated with other holdings; it is simply being lost to Goddard and to the broader research community, much of it is being sent to storage or to the dumpster.”

“NASA’s scientists and engineers shouldn’t have to be dumpster divers to do their work,” he added. “We expect better from NASA and its managers.”

            <h2>NASA Deploys Orbital Telescope Designed to Do Something Incredible</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Sunday, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket stuffed with cargo carried a brand new NASA telescope into space, where it was observed deploying in Sun-synchronous orbit, the agency later confirmed.

Dubbed Pandora, the orbital observatory is designed to hunt for distant worlds called exoplanets orbiting other stars. And though not nearly as large or expensive as the James Webb Space Telescope, the 17-inch lens packs a specialized punch that’ll help astronomers do something that was unthinkable just a decade or two ago: glean clues from individual exoplanets too remote for even the mighty Webb to pick up on.

Pandora’s mission will last a year, during which it’s expected to complete observations of at least 20 exoplanets — as well, in a novel development, of the stars they orbit.

This will “shatter a barrier,” according to University of Arizona astronomer Daniel Apai, whose team helped build the telescope — helping “remove a source of noise in the data that limits our ability to study small exoplanets in detail and search for life on them,” he wrote in a new piece for The Conversation.

Exoplanets are incredibly difficult to find, and even harder to study. Look up into the night sky, and you will effortlessly spot millions of stars. The first exoplanet, in contrast, wasn’t confirmed until 1992; to this day, astronomers have found only around 6,000 planets around other stars, a task hindered because the little-if-any light they reflect is blown out by that of nearby stars.

To espy distant worlds, astronomers look for when a planet passes in front of its star from our perspective. This is called a transit, and it produces a noticeable dip in the starlight. What’s more, astronomers can analyze the light to tease out properties of the planet it passes through, like the chemicals in its atmosphere. Apai, who is also co-investigator of Pandora, compares this to holding a glass of wine up to a candle: “The light filtering through will show fine details that reveal the quality of the wine.”

Likewise, “by analyzing starlight filtered through the planets’ atmospheres,” he continued, “astronomers can find evidence for water vapor, hydrogen, clouds and even search for evidence of life.”

Astronomers have relied on this clever trick for decades, but recent research, some of it spearheaded by Apai and his colleagues, has shown that it can have a serious flaw. Cooler, volatile regions on the surface of stars, called starspots, can fudge the signals astronomers see, even tricking them into mistaking the water vapor around a star for being present on the planet. Essentially, “we were trying to judge our wine in light of flickering, unstable candles,” Apai said.

That’s where Pandora comes in. Being purpose-built for exoplanet hunting, it can spend far more time observing them than Webb, whose precious time is always in hot demand. Even better, Pandora will observe the stars themselves for 24 hours at a time with infrared and visible light sensors, closely monitoring how the starspots form and evolve. Over the course of its year-long mission, the telescope will revisit each star ten times, racking up hundreds of hours of observations.

“With that information, our Pandora team will be able to figure out how the changes in the stars affect the observed planetary transits,” Apai wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In less time than it takes to get bored of your new year’s resolution, the planet’s wealthiest people had already blown through their yearly ration of carbon emissions.

We’re not speaking figuratively, either. A new analysis by the Oxfam Foundation found that the world’s richest 1 percent exceeded their fair share of annual carbon emissions just 10 days into the year.

The global “carbon budget” is based off the amount of carbon dioxide that humankind can collectively spew while keeping us within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial temperatures. According to Oxfam, the CO2 emissions of the richest 1 percent in just one year will result in an estimated 1.3 million heat-related deaths by the end of the 21st century.

“To stay within the 1.5 degrees limit, the richest 1 percent would have to slash their emissions by 97 percent by 2030,” the study’s press release reads.

Meanwhile, it only took the top 0.1 percent until January 3rd to use up their allotment. Another recent Oxfam report using data from the Stockholm Environment Institute found that the richest 0.1 percent of individuals produce more CO2 pollution in a day than the poorest 50 percent do in a year.

“If everyone emitted like the richest 0.1 percent, the carbon budget would be used up in less than three weeks,” Oxfam implores.

These outrageous figures aren’t just a measure of individual consumption, but of economic power. Since 2024, the top 1 percent has owned more wealth than 95 percent of humanity — not just in cash, but through ownership of powerful assets like mega-corporations and real estate holdings.

The real issue, in other words, isn’t finger wagging about individual consumer choices. The global economy has been built around a vast over-consumption that’s rapidly leading the planet into ecological catastrophe, and the world’s wealthiest are profiting massively. In 2019 for example, an analysis by The Guardian found that just20 fossil fuel companies were responsible for 35 percent of all CO2 and methane pollution since 1965.

Staving off environmental collapse, in other words, will require a difficult confrontation with some of the world’s richest people and the powerful corporations that built their fortunes.

“Time and time again, the research shows that governments have a very clear and simple route to drastically slash carbon emissions and tackle inequality: by targeting the richest polluters,” said Oxfam’s climate change policy lead, Nafkote Dabi. “By cracking down on the gross carbon recklessness of the super-rich, global leaders have an opportunity to put the world back on track for climate targets and unlock net benefits for people and the planet.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Monkeys are incredible escape artists, known to break out of research labs and even trucks that crashed on the highway.

Private enclosures are also no match for the dexterous and scheming simians. Last week, multiple Vervet monkeys, which are native to sub-Saharan Africa, were spotted roaming the streets of St. Louis, Missouri, alarming officials.

Nobody knows how many of them there are, or where they even came from. It’s also illegal to own Vervet monkeys in the city, so if they’re escaped pets, the owner may not own up to having lost them.

“This is the first time we’ve had a situation dealing with monkeys at large in the city of St. Louis,” Department of Health environmental bureau chief Justen Hauser told NBC News-affiliate KSDK on January 9.

But besides the innate challenges of capturing the agile mammals — as well as an escaped goat also on the loose in the Mound City — the St. Louis Department of Health is being frustrated by a novel hindrance: generative AI slop.

As the Associated Press reports, AI-generated images are complicating rescue efforts because residents have been posting fake images online, claiming to have spotted the monkeys.

“It’s been a lot in regard to AI and what’s genuine and what’s not,” city Department of Health spokesperson Willie Springer told the AP. “People are just having fun. Like, I don’t think anyone means harm.”

AI-generated images circulating on X-formerly-Twitter show the monkeys joining a local gang and hanging out on the stoop. Another shows them drinking out of 40-ounce malt liquor bottles.

While many of the images were intended as a joke, AI-based image generators have advanced to the point where they could easily come up with realistic-looking images of escaped monkeys as well, leading officials on a goose chase.

Springer admitted that they don’t even know how many monkeys are on the loose, saying that there could be up to four of them.

“Original reports suggested there were four animals, but we cannot confirm an actual number at this time, only that there is more than one,” Hauser told the BBC.

Experts at the St. Louis Zoo have since joined the efforts, warning that residents should leave the monkeys alone.

“The monkeys can be intelligent but also unpredictable at times,” Hauser told KSDK last week.

Apart from complicating escaped monkey rescue efforts, generative AI has already turned into a major headache for officials. Case in point, police were forced to issue a warning in October after kids started sending their parents AI-manipulated pictures of them welcoming homeless men into their houses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the final waves of Gen Z — the youngest of whom are currently around 14 — make their way through high school and into colleges and trade schools, some higher education instructors are noticing a severe lack of reading comprehension skills in their students. Schools, in turn, are finding the only path forward is to drastically lower their expectations, for better or worse.

As Pepperdine University literature professor Jessica Hooten Wilson told Fortune in a recent interview, “it’s not even an inability to critically think. It’s an inability to read sentences.”

Wilson is one of the professors who’s had to quietly lower her academic benchmarks thanks to the rise in barely literate Gen Zers graduating American high schools.

Rather than assigning reading outside of class, the literature professor told Fortune she’s adopted a kind of in-class popcorn reading, reciting passages together and discussing them “line by line.” Even that, unfortunately, might be a bit of a stretch for students these days.

“I feel like I am tap dancing and having to read things aloud because there’s no way that anyone read it the night before,” Wilson admitted. “Even when you read it in class with them, there’s so much they can’t process about the very words that are on the page.”

It’s worth pausing here to point out that you can’t really blame younger people for struggling at what were once seen as academic basics. The school system is in shambles, their education was bisected by the COVID pandemic, and they’re been reared in a world that’s increasingly deemphasized reading in favor of videos, voiceovers, and other emerging forms of communication.

Still, the situation is creating practical problems. Timothy O’Malley, professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, told Fortune that students showing up unprepared for class isn’t necessarily new, but the lowered expectations are.

In the past, O’Malley said he’s assign anywhere from 25 to 40 pages of reading per class. Students would either do it, or they wouldn’t. Nowadays, that much reading would be unthinkable.

“Today, if you assign that amount of reading, they often don’t know what to do,” he explained to Fortune, adding that most Gen Z students are skating by on AI summaries. “They’ve been formed in a kind of scanning approach to reading.”

The news of Gen Z’s waning literacy comes along with a substantial decline in literary acumen among Americans more broadly. Over the last 20 years, for example, the amount of adults reading recreationally in the US has fallen by 40 percent. Meanwhile, a survey of the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) found that 59 million Americans are reading at a level one competency or below — the lowest level on the PIAAC’s five-point scale.

Whichever way you slice it, younger Americans are barely able to grapple with the written word. Short of major structural changes to the US education system, it’s likely Gen Z won’t be the last generation to experience worse literacy rates than the one that came before.

            <div id="article-text">Commander of multi-trillion dollar computing hardware empire Jensen Huang thinks everyone should stop being so negative about AI and all the ways it could potentially upend civilization, because it’s a “doomer narrative” that’s “not helpful to society,” TechSpot reports.

The Nvidia chief made these remarks during a recent episode of the No Priors podcast, in which he more or less dismissed dire predictions for AI’s future as nothing but science fiction.

“I think we’ve done a lot of damage with very well-respected people who have painted a doomer narrative, end of the world narrative, science fiction narrative,” Huang said. “And I appreciate that many of us grew up and enjoyed science fiction, but it’s not helpful. It’s not helpful to people. It’s not helpful to the industry. It’s not helpful to society. It’s not helpful to the governments.”

“Doomer messages causes policy, and that policy may affect the industry in some way,” he added.

Scrambling his take somewhat Huang then caveated that he doesn’t totally dismiss everything that AI critics have to say.

“It’s too simplistic to say that everything that the doomers are saying are irrelevant,” Huang said. “That’s not true. A lot of very sensible things are being said,” he added, neglecting to provide any examples.

Nvidia’s chips are essential for training AI models, and the rabid demand for them has catapulted the chipmaker to a nearly $5 trillion valuation. To keep the gravy train going, Huang has sometimes been even more of an AI booster than the actual AI companies themselves. When Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could erase half of entry-level white collar jobs in the next five years, Huang countered that Amodei was just fearmongering to make it seem like Anthropic was the only company responsible enough to build AI.

And to be fair to Huang, it’s a good point, with a lot of apocalyptic-sounding warnings of AI risks tending to distract from its more mundane issues. Nonetheless, Huang has made plenty more outlandish AI claims himself, such as reportedly telling his employees that they’re “insane” if they don’t use AI to do everything — nevermind his out-of-touch proclamation that AI won’t take your job, but will instead make you work even harder.

            <h2>Microsoft announces glut of new data centers but says it won’t let your electricity bill go up</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/microsoft-announces-glut-of-new-data-centers-but-says-it-wont-let-your-electricity-bill-go-up/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Although public backlash against data centers has been intense over the past 12 months, all of the tech industry’s biggest companies have promised additional buildouts of AI infrastructure in the coming year. That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, announced what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.

Microsoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to spend billions to expand its AI capacity. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.

On Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.

“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”

The company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers accused of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other environmental concerns. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering questions around the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.

It’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has observed that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.

This backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company abandoned plans for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township have recently inspired locals to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, an op-ed in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently developing several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.

Concerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “major changes” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. Trump said the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.”

In short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide.

            <h2>A consumer watchdog issued a warning about Google’s AI agent shopping protocol — Google says she’s wrong</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/a-consumer-watchdog-issued-a-warning-about-googles-ai-agent-shopping-protocol-google-says-shes-wrong/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Shortly after Google announced its new Universal Commerce Protocol for AI-powered shopping agents, a consumer economics watchdog sounded the alarm.

In a now viral post on X viewed nearly 400,000 times, Lindsay Owens on Sunday wrote, “Big/bad news for consumers. Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”

Owens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank Groundwork Collaborative. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as well as delving into some of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.

She also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai described when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.

After TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.

In a post on X, Google responded that, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”

In a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.

Owens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents on handling a shopper’s identity say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”

The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.

Even if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.

She is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”

Although Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered Google to change a number of search business practices after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.

While many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.

The problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.

That means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like Dupe, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and Beni, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.

Until then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ammonia might be the world’s most underappreciated chemical. Without it, crops would go unfertilized and billions of people would starve.

Humans started making ammonia in large amounts just over a century ago, and since then the process used to make it, known as Haber-Bosch, hasn’t changed much. A new startup, Ammobia, says that it has tweaked the Haber-Bosch process to lower the cost by up to 40%.

To prove the technology works on a larger scale, Ammobia has raised a $7.5 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Investors include Air Liquide’s venture arm ALIAD, Chevron Technology Ventures, Chiyoda Corporation, MOL Switch, and Shell Ventures.

If the startup succeeds, it could pave the way for ammonia to be used beyond fertilizer.

Ammonia is viewed by some as an alternative to hydrogen to decarbonize a range of industries. Countries like Japan and South Korea have developed industrial and transportation roadmaps that rely on ammonia. Hydrogen, the other leading contender, isn’t as energy dense and its transportation infrastructure isn’t as well developed as ammonia.

“The big advantage of ammonia is that it’s much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,” Ammobia co-founder and CEO Karen Baert told TechCrunch. “That opens up a range of opportunities.”

But those opportunities won’t amount to much if ammonia production doesn’t clean up its act. The Haber-Bosch process is one of the world’s big polluters, producing nearly 2% of global greenhouse gases.

To make ammonia, plants using Haber-Bosch employ an iron catalyst to force one molecule of nitrogen to react with three molecules of hydrogen. The reaction requires high heat (500°C) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi) to sustain, both of which tend to be supplied by burning fossil fuels.

Fossil fuels also provide some of the gas needed as a feedstock. Nitrogen is easy to obtain — the gas makes up nearly 80% of Earth’s atmosphere — but most hydrogen used in ammonia production is made by using steam to break apart methane molecules (CH4) found in natural gas.

Ammobia’s process runs at around 150°C cooler and at 10x lower pressure. As a result, plants that adopt the technology stand to produce less pollution, even if they don’t ditch fossil fuels.

The startup also says its process saves cost up front. Ammobia can use cheaper pumps and equipment because it doesn’t need to hit high temperatures and pressures.

That could give producers an edge. Because nearly every ammonia producer uses Haber-Bosch, they have typically had only two ways to reduce costs: find a cheaper source of heat or a cheaper source of hydrogen. In places like the U.S., few are cheaper than natural gas.

Ammobia isn’t seeking to change that right away. The startup emphasizes that its process works with any source of hydrogen or heat. But it does have some key differences from traditional Haber-Bosch that could encourage cleaner sources of each.

Because Ammobia’s process runs at lower pressure, it’s easier to ramp production up and down, which could allow renewable developers to take advantage of surplus electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia.

“Our technology is very compatible with renewable energy, that leads to an additional cost reduction because you don’t need to store hydrogen or store electricity,” Baert said. “In these situations, we have the strongest cost advantage.”

The reduced temperature and pressure requirements also allow Ammobia to make its equipment smaller than a typical Haber-Bosch plant. Most ammonia facilities today generate between 1,000 and 3,000 tons per day, while Ammobia’s commercial-scale unit will produce 250 tons per day, Baert said. Customers that need more can install multiple units, she said.

Ammobia did not share details on how it tweaked Haber-Bosch to run at lower temperature and pressure, but there are a few hints out there. The company has a patent pending on a reactor system that incorporates a sorbent to remove ammonia as it is formed to free up space on the catalyst for another reaction to take place. Researchers have also been investigating non-iron catalysts, including manganese nitride, which use less energy to keep the chemical reaction going.

The startup has been operating a small unit for about a year, and the new funding will help the company build a pilot plant that contains all the features of the commercial model on a smaller scale, about 10 tons per day.

“With that modular approach, we can build projects faster, and we can start at a medium scale,” Baert said. “We see that a lot of customers are looking for that type of solution, and there’s no solution out there today.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What does it take to bring a burned-out founder back to the company he sold to Amazon? For Jamie Siminoff of the video doorbell maker Ring, it was the potential of AI — and the Palisades fires that destroyed his garage, the birthplace of Ring itself.

Siminoff’s vision: turn Ring from a video doorbell company into an AI-powered “intelligent assistant” for the entire home and beyond. A handful of new features that advance that goal shipped just ahead of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, including fire alerts, alerts about “unusual events,” conversational AI, facial recognition features, and more. Some of these additions have not been without controversy, as consumers have to grapple with how much privacy they’re giving up in favor of convenience and security. But together, they point to Ring’s latest phase of its business.

“Turn AI backwards — it’s IA, it’s an intelligent assistant,” Siminoff explained in a conversation at CES last week. “We keep doing these things together that are making us smarter, and making it so that, for you, there’s less cognitive load.”

By 2023, five years after selling Ring to Amazon, Siminoff had been running at full throttle for so long that he needed out. “I built the company in my garage…I was there for all of it. We then get to Amazon, and I go even faster — like, more throttle,” Siminoff told TechCrunch. “I didn’t get to Amazon and say, ‘I’m an exited entrepreneur, I’ll just chill out,’” he adds. “I blasted the f**king gas.”

When he later decided to depart the retail giant, he said it was because it felt like the time was right — Ring had delivered its products and was profitable. AI’s advances soon had him rethinking his plans.

Though Siminoff could have done anything, he wasn’t motivated to start something new because the things he was most excited about were those he wanted to build on Ring’s platform.

“AI comes out, and you realize, ‘Oh my God, there’s so much we could do,’” Siminoff said. “And then the fires happened,” he adds, referring to the devastating Palisades Fires that impacted Siminoff’s neighbors and burned the back of his house, destroying the garage where Ring was built.

One of Ring’s new additions, Fire Watch, was inspired by this tragedy. In partnership with the nonprofit fire monitoring organization Watch Duty, Ring customers will be able to opt in to share footage when a massive fire event happens, allowing the organization to build a better map that can be used to help deploy firefighting resources more efficiently. The AI will be used in that case to look for smoke, fire, embers, and more in the shared footage.

Another recently launched AI feature, Search Party, also aims to solve real-world problems as it helps people find their lost pets. That feature is now reuniting one family per day with their dogs — a rate higher than Siminoff expected.

“I had hoped to find one dog by the end of Q1…that was my goal. No one’s ever done anything remotely like this, and I just didn’t know how the AI would work,” he admits. The AI, a sort of “facial recognition for dogs,” tries matching a posted image of a lost pet with Ring footage, which users opt into sharing if they get an alert about a possible match.

Other moves, however, have raised concerns, particularly those that saw the company forging deals with law enforcement. In 2024, Ring ended an earlier set of police partnerships that allowed police to request footage from Ring owners after some customer backlash. But this year, the company moved forward with new deals with companies like Flock Safety and Axon, which reintroduced tools that again allow law enforcement to request images and videos from Ring’s customers.

Siminoff defends the company’s decisions in this space, saying that customers can choose whether or not they want to share their Ring footage.

“The requesting agency doesn’t even know that they asked you,” he says. That is, if police are looking for someone who’s been breaking into cars in a certain geographic area, the alert will go out, and customers can respond if they choose. If customers decline, it’s anonymous.

He also points to the Brown University shooting in December. A combination of surveillance cameras — including Ring’s, Siminoff claims, helped to find the mass shooter.

“Scrutiny is fine…I welcome it, but I’m glad that we stood up to it, because in the Brown shooting, the police needed this,” the founder says. “If we had caved to people’s ‘maybe’s,’ and the scrutiny that they were giving us — [that] I don’t think is correct — the police wouldn’t have had a tool to try to help find this [shooter], and the community would not have had the ability to as easily share in what was happening and as fast.”

Despite the successful capture of the shooting suspect, there are still worries about what the mounting collection of data from private customers means for the landscape of the country. Plus, some are concerned that the data could be misused to go after anyone the government decides to target.

Another AI feature, “Familiar Faces,” has also received pushback from the consumer protection organization EFF, along with a U.S. senator.

The facial recognition feature uses AI to allow Ring to identify and store the faces of people who come in and out of the home on a regular basis, including their names, if provided. This way, you could get an alert that “mom” is at the front door, or that the babysitter arrived, or the kids are home from school, for instance. The feature could also be used to help disable alerts about people whose comings and goings don’t need to be watched closely.

Siminoff defends this, too, as a way for Ring to become more personalized to its users and customize the software to adapt to the unique “fingerprint” of their house. That way, the customer has to interact less with Ring’s products, unless it’s something that requires attention.

He argues that this addition builds on trust with Ring’s customers, rather than undermining it.

“Our products will not be on neighbors’ houses if they don’t trust us….There’s no incentive for us to do something that would lose trust with our neighbors in maintaining their privacy,” Siminoff says. “Anyone — and I would respect it — would take their camera off of their home if they felt like we were violating their privacy.”

But with Ring’s expansion into commercial camera systems, including mounted cameras, a line of sensors, and a solar-powered trailer, also introduced just ahead of CES, the company’s customer base won’t just be neighbors protecting their homes but also businesses, job sites, campuses, festivals, parking lots, and everywhere else.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A resident of Springfield, Tennessee, is expected to plead guilty to hacking the U.S. Supreme Court’s electronic document filing system dozens of times over several months.

Prosecutors say between August and October 2023, Nicholas Moore, 24, “intentionally accessed a computer without authorization on 25 different days and thereby obtained information from a protected computer,” according to a court document.

As of this writing, there aren’t any more details about exactly what information Moore accessed, nor how it was accessed. Moore is scheduled to plead guilty in court by video link on Friday.

When reached, a spokesperson for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which brought the charges against Moore, told TechCrunch that prosecutors cannot provide any more information that hasn’t already been made public.

Spokespeople for the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for more information about the case.

Moore’s lawyer, Eugene Ohm, did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The case was first spotted by Court Watch’s Seamus Hughes, a researcher and journalist who monitors court documents.

This is one of several occasions in recent years in which hackers have compromised U.S. court systems. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which oversees the federal judiciary, said in August that it had strengthened its cybersecurity defenses following a cyberattack on its electronic court records system.

Hackers working for the Russian government were blamed for the breach.

            <div id="article-text">Dr. Sina Bari, a practicing surgeon and AI healthcare leader at data company iMerit, has seen firsthand how ChatGPT can lead patients astray with faulty medical advice.

“I recently had a patient come in, and when I recommended a medication, they had a dialogue printed out from ChatGPT that said this medication has a 45% chance of pulmonary embolism,” Dr. Bari told TechCrunch.

When Dr. Bari investigated further, he found that the statistic was from a paper about the impact of that medication in a niche subgroup of people with tuberculosis, which didn’t apply to his patient.

And yet, when OpenAI announced its dedicated ChatGPT Health chatbot last week, Dr. Bari felt more excitement than concern.

ChatGPT Health, which will roll out in the coming weeks, allows users to talk to the chatbot about their health in a more private setting, where their messages won’t be used as training data for the underlying AI model.

“I think it’s great,” Dr. Bari said. “It is something that’s already happening, so formalizing it so as to protect patient information and put some safeguards around it […] is going to make it all the more powerful for patients to use.”

Users can get more personalized guidance from ChatGPT Health by uploading their medical records and syncing with apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal. For the security-minded, this raises immediate red flags.

“All of a sudden there’s medical data transferring from HIPAA-compliant organizations to non-HIPAA-compliant vendors,” Itai Schwartz, co-founder of data loss prevention firm MIND, told TechCrunch. “So I’m curious to see how the regulators would approach this.”

But the way some industry professionals see it, the cat is already out of the bag. Now, instead of Googling cold symptoms, people are talking to AI chatbots — over 230 million people already talk to ChatGPT about their health each week.

“This was one of the biggest use cases of ChatGPT,” Andrew Brackin, a partner at Gradient who invests in health tech, told TechCrunch. “So it makes a lot of sense that they would want to build a more kind of private, secure, optimized version of ChatGPT for these healthcare questions.”

AI chatbots have a persistent problem with hallucinations, a particularly sensitive issue in healthcare. According to Vectara’s Factual Consistency Evaluation Model, OpenAI’s GPT-5 is more prone to hallucinations than many Google and Anthropic models. But AI companies see the potential to rectify inefficiencies in the healthcare space (Anthropic also announced a health product this week).

For Dr. Nigam Shah, a professor of medicine at Stanford and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, the inability of American patients to access care is more urgent than the threat of ChatGPT dispensing poor advice.

“Right now, you go to any health system and you want to meet the primary care doctor — the wait time will be three to six months,” Dr. Shah said. “If your choice is to wait six months for a real doctor, or talk to something that is not a doctor but can do some things for you, which would you pick?”

Dr. Shah thinks a clearer route to introduce AI into healthcare systems comes on the provider side, rather than the patient side.

Medical journals have often reported that administrative tasks can consume about half of a primary care physician’s time, which slashes the number of patients they can see in a given day. If that kind of work could be automated, doctors would be able to see more patients, perhaps reducing the need for people to use tools like ChatGPT Health without additional input from a real doctor.

Dr. Shah leads a team at Stanford that is developing ChatEHR, a software that is built into the electronic health record (EHR) system, allowing clinicians to interact with a patient’s medical records in a more streamlined, efficient manner.

“Making the electronic medical record more user friendly means physicians can spend less time scouring every nook and cranny of it for the information they need,” Dr. Sneha Jain, an early tester of ChatEHR, said in a Stanford Medicine article. “ChatEHR can help them get that information up front so they can spend time on what matters — talking to patients and figuring out what’s going on.”

Anthropic is also working on AI products that can be used on the clinician and insurer sides, rather than just its public-facing Claude chatbot. This week, Anthropic announced Claude for Healthcare by explaining how it could be used to reduce the time spent on tedious administrative tasks, like submitting prior authorization requests to insurance providers.

“Some of you see hundreds, thousands of these prior authorization cases a week,” said Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger in a recent presentation at J.P. Morgan’s Healthcare Conference. “So imagine cutting 20, 30 minutes out of each of them — it’s a dramatic time savings.”

As AI and medicine become more intertwined, there’s an inescapable tension between the two worlds — a doctor’s primary incentive is to help their patients, while tech companies are ultimately accountable to their shareholders, even if their intentions are noble.

“I think that tension is an important one,” Dr. Bari said. “Patients rely on us to be cynical and conservative in order to protect them.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The family at the center of Madeline Cash’s first novel, Lost Lambs, is falling apart. Bud and Catherine Flynn have begun a “nonconsensual nonmonogamous spell.” They are too busy scorching each other’s insecurities to cook dinner, more concerned about their own sleeping arrangements than about the eroding bedtimes of their three wayward daughters. Cash’s characters are believable and specific, but contrary to Tolstoy’s famous adage, this unhappy family is, in key respects, like many others. Hemmed in by selfishness, alienation, and subcultural silos, the fracturing Flynns share a kinship with the casts of unhappy-family classics such as Philip Roth’s American Pastoral, Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections, and Zadie Smith’s White Teeth. But because Lost Lambs is being published in 2026, its unhappiness derives not from Roth’s “indigenous American berserk,” Franzen’s Y2K anxiety, or Smith’s postcolonial pressure cooker, but from the internet.

Online is where Louise, the Flynns’ middle child, meets an Islamic-fundamentalist user named yourstruly. It’s where Harper, the youngest, researches conspiracy theories involving her father’s shadowy tech-billionaire boss, Paul Alabaster. Online discourse lurks behind even offline behavior—Bud and Catherine’s polyamorous phase; the age-gap dalliance of their eldest daughter, Abigail, with an edgy vet nicknamed War Crimes Wes. In Lost Lambs, the internet sabotages a family in much the same way that Napoleon messes things up for the Bezukhovs in Tolstoy’s War and Peace. This makes Cash’s debut one of the first works—and, let’s hope, not the last—to meld the old genre of the unhappy family with a much younger variety: the internet novel.

The proper internet novel, as I see it, is defined by more than just its subject and setting. These are not books in which the internet is a mere plot device, current event, or academic interest (as in Bruce Holsinger’s Culpability and Dave Eggers’s The Circle). Instead, they are fiction about, and often by, people whose offline life is inextricable from their online presence. These are novels that take seriously, and describe intimately, the impact of living with a smartphone and constant access to social media. Such works do not necessarily focus on the experience of scrolling—although they can, as in Jordan Castro’s The Novelist. But they consider the effect of spending four to six hours a day on the same two or three apps (Instagram, TikTok, X). The supremely disaffected narrator of Anika Jade Levy’s Flat Earth, for example, continually cuts her fingers on the broken screen of her phone.

Cash has a great deal of experience with this kind of writing: For a few years, along with Levy, she edited the buzzy literary journal Forever Magazine. Founded in 2020, Forever was consciously built on “the low quality aesthetic of the early digital age” and during Cash’s tenure it sought out writing that reflected it: dry, glib, generally out of conversation with traditional literature. Cash and her colleagues published authors who might have been deemed too rough, too déclassé, and most of all too terminally online for traditional publications. In one short story by Cash, a character rattles off a list of addled misfits that could double as a list of Forever contributors: “temps, sex workers, Satanists, the young and beautiful, intravenous drug users, the people who stand outside of art galleries, industry plants,” and so on until the list ends, provocatively, with “all the same.” Indeed, in those pages, many writers bear evidence of the same flattening affect, probably because their online experiences—often limited to a few apps—are overwhelmingly alike.

Modern fiction can’t make any valid claim to realism without acknowledging that its characters spend perhaps a quarter of their waking hours online. Yet this presents a dilemma: To depict those hours accurately is to risk overfamiliarity, dullness, and disgust. For many, reading is the ultimate offline activity. An internet novel can feel a bit like a soft-serve machine at the gym.

That’s what makes Lost Lambs distinct among internet novels. The reader spends time with someone else’s family, not someone else’s “For You” page. (Even the presence of a family is a change in the genre, in which parents tend to be offstage, nonspeaking, sending money.) We get to see how conspiracy theories and online strangers and vague ideas about open relationships affect the Flynns without the kind of breathless evocations of internet aesthetics and fussy fictional tweets and Instagram posts that afflict novels such as Lauren Oyler’s Fake Accounts and Patricia Lockwood’s No One Is Talking About This. Cash’s prose style has also become emotionally richer: She’s unlikely ever to sound as sincere as Sally Rooney, but she has evolved beyond the cutting stories in her 2023 short-story collection, Earth Angel. She seems to have found a middle distance between dismissiveness and sentimentality.

In addition to sparing readers a confrontation with the luminous now of the Notification Center, Cash also liberates the Flynns from the always-too-late pop-culture references that constrain many internet novels. Instead of Ritalin or Xanax, Abigail takes “blues,” “yellows,” even “purples” (a risky one—originally “manufactured to bring down the rat population”). Instead of investigating Jeffrey Epstein or Peter Thiel, Harper is obsessed with Alabaster, who has his own sinister quirks. Louise meets her Islamist friend, yourstruly, in a chat room for middle children, not on r/redscarepod. (The book is full of fresh coinages: Page Turner’s bookshop, the British pub Olive or Twist, the ice-cream parlor Anne Frank’s Dairy.) This is a novel about the corrosive effect of modern life that doesn’t feel corrosive. Cash is gentle with us—perhaps too gentle.

In classic novels of family crisis, such as John Updike’s Rabbit, Run and Richard Yates’s Revolutionary Road, husbands or wives or children die. Without spoiling too much, there isn’t much to spoil; Lost Lambs has no such mortal stakes. This aversion to physical harm might look at first like fidelity to real life, in which mortal danger is rare. But in Cash’s world, it feels implausible. In the novel’s most preposterous sequence, Bud—who has been continually threatening to kill himself—reveals that he has a long-standing fantasy of being with a woman less attractive than his wife. More head-scratchers follow. Villains, in Cash’s novel, can’t seem to commit to villainy. Irreconcilable differences are resolved by short periods of self-reflection. The overall effect is one of deflation. In the novel, Cash writes: “When a lamb strays, it’s usually lost to wolves, vulnerable without its flock. But sometimes, just sometimes, if it’s lucky, it finds a new one.” That’s not luck—it’s wishful thinking. Cash hasn’t so much tamed the savagery of the internet as turned on parental controls.

Lost Lambs has accomplished something major; it reads to me like the first internet novel with the potential for broad offline appeal. But in joining the Zadie Smiths and Jonathan Franzens of the world, Cash has undermined the tension that makes such novels work. Families can form a strong protective unit, but the price of that bond is that when they fail, they become a grief engine. When a child runs off, when a husband sleeps around, when secrets are whispered or truths shouted, people get hurt in a way they never could have alone. That’s why the stakes in family novels seem so high: because other people get hurt too. Cash flinches from this cascade of consequences.

This is a shame, because a great family novel of the internet would need to take online danger seriously. People really do get lost to conspiracy theories. They get messed up chatting with strangers. The internet has the ability to create assassins and sway elections and destroy families, to waste our time and wreck our life. This is the limitation of Cash’s book, and the lesson for the next novelist who aspires to write a grown-up internet novel: It doesn’t mean anything to be a lost lamb in a world without wolves.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When I first heard of Heated Rivalry, I didn’t think much about it. The words Canadian ice-hockey TV series slid into my brain and slipped right back out. But a week later, approximately everyone I’d ever met wanted to talk about it. People kept telling me that it was fun, sweet, and addicting. Most of all, they emphasized that it was really smutty. Every recommendation seemed to come with a warning to not watch with my parents.

The show, which is based on a set of romance novels by Rachel Reid, follows rival hockey stars: Shane Hollander (played by Hudson Williams), the well-mannered guy next door on Montreal’s team; and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie), a cocky bad-boy Russian playing for Boston. They’re supposed to hate each other—but then they start secretly sleeping together, which gets in the way of the animosity a bit. In the past weeks, Heated Rivalry has become an absolute phenomenon. It’s the most-watched original show for the Canadian streamer Crave since the platform launched in 2014, and after HBO Max acquired the series for U.S. viewing, it became the highest-rated live-action show that streamer has obtained since its start, in 2020. Heated Rivalry and the reasons for its success have been dissected at length by culture, “romantasy,” and LGBTQ critics—as well as on major hockey podcasts. At bars across the United States, live watch parties were packed, squeals resounding.

I can’t say for sure why the show caught on so widely. But since the finale aired last month, I’ve been thinking about one element that I really respect: The series knows the value of good sex scenes—not for thrills or laughs or snapshots of a fleeting moment but for illustrating how the characters’ relationship develops, touch by touch, over time. It takes sex seriously in an era when few shows do.

When I first started watching, I was surprised to find that it wasn’t explicit in quite the way I’d imagined. The viewer never sees anything that graphic; there’s no Game of Thrones–style full-frontal nudity, though one does glimpse a generous amount of butt cheek. What feels unique about Heated Rivalry, rather, is that it lets its sex scenes play out, sometimes sticking with its characters nearly from the beginning of their encounter until the end in real time. Even without showing everything, the series communicates the nitty-gritty of what’s going on: which acts, how long they take, who’s leading whom, whether the lovers are gentle or giggly or a little combative and when that tone subtly shifts. Sometimes you hear no music at all, just the sound of kissing or heavy breathing.

So many shows and movies introduce a sex scene only to cut straight to the next morning, imparting merely the understanding that the deed has been done. Even Sex and the City, which was boundary-pushing when it started in 1998, frequently skipped to Carrie Bradshaw smoking a postcoital cigarette, the expression on her face the first clue as to whether the interaction had gone well or not. Sexual specifics, when they were given, were used most often as a punch line. (The guy with “funky spunk,” needless to say, shows up in only one episode.)

The 2010s series Girls did have plentiful sex scenes with unflinching intimate detail—often featuring main characters, revealing something of their relationship. Much of it was horrible sex, though, there to make viewers cackle or cringe. (A 2017 Slate article helpfully ranked all 53 Girls sex scenes by “how Girls it was.” No. 1 features Lena Dunham’s character, Hannah, struggling to get her tights off; her then-situationship Adam, played by Adam Driver, saying he’ll “consider” putting on a condom; and Hannah talking through the act until Adam suggests that they “play the quiet game.”) Many shows seem more comfortable defining what makes sex memorably bad than what makes it great or complicated or mediocre. And a lot of them, romances included, don’t even go that far.

That’s a shame—because for one thing, to put it plainly, a lot of people have sex. When a TV critic once asked Dunham why Hannah was naked so often on Girls, she responded, “It’s a realistic expression of what it’s like to be alive.” And she’s right: Life doesn’t stop happening when clothes come off; it keeps going, and what occurs in that time tends to be pretty important for how a relationship plays out. It’s worth taking a genuine interest in.

A frank sex scene can provide a wealth of information about two characters and the dynamics between them. On Heated Rivalry, Shane and Ilya’s romantic arc builds sporadically over the course of more than eight years. They live in different cities, and they can meet up—briefly and surreptitiously—only when hockey events bring their teams together. But a lot changes with each hookup. Their first time, Shane has never been with a man before, but Ilya has: He leads gently but firmly, with a thumb in Shane’s mouth and then a kiss on his cheek. In a later scene, when the two still-closeted men have been sneaking around for years and are trying to quash the growing feelings they can’t afford to have, the sex is somewhat kinkier but less emotional. (It starts with Ilya ordering Shane around and ends with Shane leaving the hotel confused, drafting a text he never sends: “we didn’t even kiss.”) Near the end of the season, when the two have confessed to falling for each other, one sex scene is particularly playful—it happens while Shane is on the phone—and Williams has said that it was meant to depict the “humor and levity” you might have with someone you’re really comfortable with. If the viewer knew only that sex happened on these occasions, they’d be missing so much of what’s unfolded between Shane and Ilya—especially because these men are extremely bad at talking openly about their situation. “If you skip the sex scenes,” Williams said in one interview, “you miss the story.”

This was all intentional. The show’s intimacy coordinator, Chala Hunter, has said that part of her job was meticulously diagramming each episode in a master spreadsheet to track “the narrative arc that plays out through the intimacy.” She’d regularly check in with Jacob Tierney, the screenwriter and director, to discuss whether a sensual interaction fit the moment: how long the characters had been together, how they’d be feeling emotionally and physically. And even as a professional intimacy coordinator who’s worked on plenty of sets, she found that actually portraying sex rather than “insinuating or implying it” felt new, she told Elle last month: “I was like, Oh, we’re being very specific and fairly explicit here, but to be honest, I found it refreshing and different.”

The fact of Heated Rivalry’s immense popularity suggests that viewers loved it too. That might seem unexpected: Sex has become less and less common on-screen, according to The Ringer’s 2024 analysis of 40,000 films. The same year, The Economist found that sexually explicit content in the 250 highest-grossing U.S. movies had fallen by nearly 40 percent since 2000, while drug references, violence, and profanity had hovered at stable levels. And some surveys have found that audiences have little appetite for sex scenes. In a 2023 UCLA poll, roughly half of 1,500 respondents, ages 13 to 24, said that sex isn’t needed in most shows and movies; more than half said they want more platonic relationships depicted. The next year, the market-research firm Talker Research surveyed 2,000 Americans and found that 43 percent of respondents think sex scenes don’t add to a story; more than 40 percent of the Gen Z participants said they turn a movie off once they hit a sex scene.

Statistics like these have become part of a discussion about whether the culture is growing prudish and puritanical. Some commentators think that young people are not only having less sex but are also less open to sex altogether. (Others argue that they’re so accustomed to porn that media depictions bore in comparison.) When I read those reports, though, what I sense is largely just fatigue: a frustration with a perceived overreliance on romance and the tropes the genre often entails. Many of the UCLA participants agreed that romantic-relationship depictions “often feel unnatural, forced, or toxic.” They were on guard against what they saw as stereotypes, tired of seeing protagonists always end up together and overfull on love triangles.

On the last front, I can’t relate; personally, I want every movie to resemble Challengers. Generally speaking, though, I understand feeling bored with the same old affairs. Especially in straight romances, the signals are so familiar, you can get up to grab popcorn: the shed clothes draped over an armchair, a shirtless man hovering over his lover, feet tangled at the end of the bed. Then it’s morning; the woman is always inexplicably waking up with a shirt on, or rising to grab a robe.

Perhaps Heated Rivalry is a sign that many people are game for sexy content when it’s done creatively or thoughtfully—when it serves a purpose. If audiences haven’t been enjoying sex scenes, well, maybe that’s because most sex scenes haven’t been doing their job.</div>

            <h2>Julian Barnes Says Goodbye to the Novel</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/02/julian-barnes-departures/685507/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Yes—oh, dear, yes—the novel tells a story,” E. M. Forster wrote. “I wish that it was not so.” Julian Barnes has confessed that as a young man reading Aspects of the Novel, he found this sentiment “feeble” and responded impatiently, “If you aren’t up to telling a story, why write a novel?” Barnes, who turned 80 in January, now sings a different tune, and anyway, Forster’s wish was long ago granted. The literary novel of today is quite free from conventional storytelling, and ironically (irony is one of his specialties), Barnes got busy loosening the bonds early in his career. He’s still at it: His brief new novel, Departure(s), offers only a sketchy storyline, mixed with memoir and thoughts on memory. An extended farewell, an author’s valedictory flourish, the whole package is a culmination of sorts, shimmering with his silky, erudite prose; beneath the suave surface is an earnest investigation into the mysterious ways of the human heart.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

The scant plot in Departure(s)—a “true story” the narrator swore he wouldn’t tell—tracks the two-part romance of Stephen and Jean, friends of his at university who fell in love, broke up when they graduated, then connected again in late middle age after Stephen asked Julian to reach out to Jean. Like many of Barnes’s 14 previous novels—including his most famous, Flaubert’s Parrot (1984), and the Man Booker Prize winner, The Sense of an Ending (2011)—Departure(s) tells a love story filtered through the consciousness of a ruminative, standoffish man preoccupied with something other than the love at stake.

In the earlier novels, Barnes is given a fictional identity; in the new one, the author speaks to us directly, blithely confident that a skeptical realist with a restless mind probing familiar yet essential experiences—how the brain works, what happens as we age—is all the entertainment we require. He shrugs off the romance: “Couple fail to make one another happy, well, turn the page.” But one should never disregard the way love works (or doesn’t) in his books. In the words of Philip Larkin (a Barnes favorite), love is the “element / That spreads through other lives like a tree / And sways them on in a sort of sense.”

When love is absent, bottled up, interrupted, or misdirected, Barnes is at his best. One-tenth of Flaubert’s Parrot is heartache, but it’s buried under the other nine-tenths, a rambling miscellany of Flaubert factoids. The novel reads at times like an eccentric biographical essay, at times like a cranky compendium of pet peeves. Yet the reader is peripherally aware that the narrator, Geoffrey Braithwaite, indulges his literary obsession so as to distract himself (and us) from the tragedy of his wife’s death. After dragging his feet for most of the book, he at last addresses his loss, his despair, in a short chapter called “Pure Story.” A melancholy emotional logic holds Flaubert’s Parrot together, not least the parallels between the unfaithful Ellen Braithwaite and Emma Bovary, whose name is synonymous with adulterous passion.

Geoffrey warns against the smug certainty of those who think that by trawling for facts they can catch the essence of a life, whether Flaubert’s or Ellen’s. (“My wife: someone I feel I understand less well than a foreign writer dead for a hundred years.”) In an oft-quoted passage, he considers a fishing net with Olympian detachment:

He adds, “You can do the same with a biography.” You can do the same with a novel.

Once you start looking for holes in Barnes’s books, they open up everywhere: what’s unknown, withheld, or willfully ignored. Absence itself—absence of love, absence of the beloved—becomes a crucial locus of meaning. In Flaubert’s Parrot, for instance, the longer Geoffrey delays telling us about Ellen, the more we sense how much she meant to him. In Departure(s), there’s a 40-year gap between the first time Stephen and Jean try to love each other (which a young, love-starved Barnes experienced as “romanticism-by-proxy”) and the second, “rekindled” attempt, reluctantly facilitated by Barnes. Both Stephen and Jean tell him, “This will be my last chance of happiness.” They marry—a church wedding!—and then break up for good. A decade or so later, they’re both dead. Breaking his vow, Barnes writes about them, exposing Stephen as a spurned romantic and Jean as incapable of accepting or returning his love. Barnes says it’s what he’s been after “all my writing life: the whole story.”

The whole /hole pun is surely intended. The brief, truncated narrative leaves Barnes space to ruminate on the blanks in our memory. He glides past a truism (“As we age, forgotten memories of childhood often return to us”) and delivers a startling prognosis: “At the same time, our grasp of the middle years decays. This hasn’t happened to me yet, but I can imagine how it might develop as senescence takes hold.” In other words, he adds, if we live long enough, our lives—his, mine, yours—may be reduced (like Stephen’s and Jean’s) “to a story with a large hole in the middle.” Meanwhile, scattered references point to the defining event of those four missing decades, at least in Barnes’s own life: In 1979, he married Pat Kavanagh, a literary agent six years his senior; three decades later she died, just weeks after being diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor.

In 2013, he published Levels of Life, a celebration of his love for her and an anatomy of his mourning. “I was thirty-two when we met, sixty-two when she died. The heart of my life; the life of my heart.” An essay, a short story, and a memoir squeezed together in one slim volume, the book defies formal categorization, but the sum of those disparate parts is an achingly honest dirge:

Her absence imposes a very specific form of loneliness—“not so much loneliness as her-lessness.”

He broods about memory and aging in Departure(s), of course he does: He has a new partner, Rachel, who’s 18 years his junior. He reveals as well that he was diagnosed in 2020 with a rare blood cancer that can be managed with a daily dose of chemo, but not cured. Before he knew his cancer wouldn’t kill him, he began making notes for what he thought would be his final book, to which he gave a provisional, “archly self-pitying” title: Jules Was. He is “heavily afraid,” according to one note, of the grief his demise will “impose on R”—a replay, perhaps, of what he himself experienced.

Read: It’s hard to change your mind. Julian Barnes’s new book asks if you should even try.

Setting aside the pain of Kavanagh’s death, almost 20 years ago now, Barnes acknowledges the luck of his life, particularly his professional success. The oldest in the all-male scrum of his generation’s celebrated British novelists (Martin Amis, Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, Salman Rushdie), he has enjoyed a prize-strewn career. And he has had happy second chances, unlike the unfortunate Stephen and Jean, and unlike Tony Webster, the narrator of The Sense of an Ending, the first book Barnes published after Kavanagh died.

Tony, too, is offered the opportunity to rekindle an old flame. Again, there’s a 40-year gap. A solitary divorced retiree who puzzles over familiar Barnesian preoccupations (time, memory, aging), Tony comes into contact with an ex-girlfriend, Veronica. He can’t let go of their backstory. Soon after they split, she took up with one of his close friends—who shortly thereafter killed himself. Now Tony tries to make sense of two endings: the breakup and the friend’s suicide. But instead of a rekindling, or even a moment of clarity, he’s left with a muddle. “You just don’t get it,” Veronica tells him. “But then you never did.”

“Our life is not our life,” Tony tells himself, “merely the story we have told about our life.” He acknowledges that his own is utterly bland: his career, unspecified; his marriage, tepid; his daughter, emotionally distant. “What did I know of life,” he asks, “I who had lived so carefully? Who had neither won nor lost, but just let life happen to him?” The romance, the life-and-death passion in this sad, sad novel, takes place out of sight, its contours unknown—except that, of course, none of it involves poor Tony, who gradually then suddenly becomes aware of what’s missing. Barnes wrings emotion—sharp, sustained anguish—from remorse at love’s absence.

Even in his nonfiction, Barnes points to the holes all around us. In Nothing to Be Frightened Of (2008), a sophisticated, meandering meditation on mortality and his own timor mortis (published, coincidentally, a few months before Kavanagh’s death), he keeps the “nothing” of death front and center. And in The Man in the Red Coat (2019), a boldly unconventional biography of Samuel Pozzi, a pioneering French gynecologist who was a lifelong friend and sometime lover of the immortal Sarah Bernhardt, Barnes repeatedly taunts us with the limits of our knowledge: “We cannot know.”

What is the string that binds the holes in a biography or a novel? Memory, yes: “We all know that memory is identity,” Barnes writes in Departure(s); “take away memory and what do we have?” Yet he also reminds us that memory is the “place where degradation and embellishment overlap.” To compensate for degradation and to make embellishment pleasing, we call upon imagination and style (that erudite prose), and the comforting continuities of narrative. Add to all of that a kind of attentive engagement—Barnes prefers a more active word, “attending,” a knack for noticing details that beg to be preserved—and you might manage to knit together a coherent pattern of events and images, a history. You might even give shape to a love story. “Writers believe in the patterns their words make,” he tells us in Levels of Life. “We cannot, I think, survive without such belief.”

The big-picture pattern that emerges from Barnes’s shelf of books is the mystery of love, which he addresses directly in 20-odd pages of A History of the World in 10½ Chapters (1989), an early book of linked stories. The half chapter, aptly named “Parenthesis,” has achieved a modest cult following, undoubtedly because of passages as clever and un-saccharine as this one:

In the same unsentimental vein, he insists that we must be “precise” about love, by which he means, “attending to the heart, its pulses, its certainties, its truth, its power—and its imperfections.” That’s a good description of the task that Barnes has taken on as a writer. A final admonition: “We must believe in love, just as we must believe in free will and objective truth.”

At the beginning of Departure(s), Barnes tries out a new perspective. He’s fascinated by an extreme form of what’s known as involuntary autobiographical memory (IAM), in which a particular action triggers a cascade of memories of all the times that action has been performed in the past. Here’s an example: What if saying “I love you,” whether you meant it or not, triggered an IAM? He asks, “How would you face the record—the chronological record—of all your lies, hypocrisies, cruelties?” What if one sexual fantasy triggered an IAM onslaught, including all the “inadmissible, sluttish adulteries of the heart which we have chosen to suppress”?

There are memories we suppress and then there’s the echoing emptiness of everything we’ve simply forgotten, a vanished immensity, the selves we’ve left behind, the many millions of skin cells our body sloughs off every day. Faced with the choice of string or hole—a relentless deluge of recovered memory or the pathos of forgetting, of shedding thoughts that seemed momentous a moment ago—which would you choose?

At the end of Departure(s), Barnes announces, “This will definitely be my last book—my official departure,” and he imagines a “final conversation,” conjuring the image of

“What do you make of that couple,” he asks us: “married, or having an affair?” Spotting an old couple holding hands, he says, “that always gets to me.” He offers other observations, “ordinary, conversational mutterings.” He sees, out of the corner of his eye, that we share his “attendingness.” He rests his hand on our forearm—a brief touch—and slips away. His parting injunction: “No, don’t stop looking.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1928, Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance published a memoir that caused a sensation in the literary world. It opened with his earliest memory: Barely a year old, he was riding in a moss baby carrier on his mother’s back, surrounded by women and horses. His mother’s hand was bleeding, and she was crying. Long Lance wrote that when he’d recounted this memory to his aunt years later, he’d been told that he was remembering the “exciting aftermath of an Indian fight” in which his uncle Iron Blanket had just been killed by the Blackfeet Tribe’s traditional enemies, the Crow. His mother’s hand was bleeding because she had amputated her own finger in mourning.

His next memory was of falling off a horse at age 4. “From this incident on,” he wrote, “I remember things distinctly. I remember moving about over the prairies from camp to camp.” Born to a Blackfeet warrior in the late 19th century, during the final days of the “free” Blackfeet in northern Montana and southern Alberta, Long Lance wrote that his father’s generation was facing “the mystery of the future in relation to the coming of the White Man.”

Long Lance attended the infamous Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, and received a presidential appointment to West Point. Eager to fight in the Great War even before America entered the conflict, he traveled to Montreal in 1916 to enlist in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, fought at Vimy Ridge, and was twice wounded. The second wound knocked him out of combat, but not—he would later boast—before he’d risen to the rank of captain and was awarded the Croix de Guerre.

By the time his memoir came out, Long Lance had traveled a great distance—from the High Plains to New York high society. One night in the winter of 1928, he spotted Natacha Rambova, the ex-wife of the silent-film star Rudolph Valentino, in the Crystal Room of the Ritz-Carlton. According to his biographer, Donald B. Smith, Long Lance approached Rambova and asked her to dance. They began an affair, but she wasn’t the only woman in his life: Long Lance was also linked to the actor Mildred McCoy, the singer Vivian Hart, and Princess Alexandra Victoria of the House of Glücksburg.

Long Lance was shockingly handsome, broad-shouldered and wasp-waisted, with smooth, coppery skin and thick black hair. He did calisthenics and gymnastics every morning and wrestling when he could find partners. He had boxed with the world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey and been a training partner for the legendary Olympian Jim Thorpe, a member of the Sac and Fox and Potawatomi Nations.

When Long Lance’s memoir was published, the planned initial run of 3,000 copies was bumped to 10,000 on the strength of early reads and the endorsement of The Saturday Evening Post ’s Irvin S. Cobb, then one of the most influential journalists in the world. (Cobb also wrote the book’s foreword.) Reviews of the memoir were fulsome. The New Orleans Times-Picayune declared it “the most important Americana offered this year.” The Philadelphia Public Ledger averred that Long Lance had written “a gorgeous saga of the Indian Race.” In the New York Herald Tribune, an anthropologist called the book an “unusually faithful account” of a Native American’s childhood and early manhood. Across the Atlantic, The New Statesman declared that the memoir “rings true; no outsider could explain so clearly how the Indians felt.”

By 1930, Long Lance’s celebrity extended far beyond New York ballrooms and newspaper book reviews: He starred in a feature film, The Silent Enemy, about a famine that strikes a fictionalized version of the Ojibwe Tribe. The B. F. Goodrich Company planned to produce an experimental canvas running shoe modeled after a Plains Indian moccasin like those Long Lance had worn.

But just two years later, he would be found dead on a rich white woman’s estate in California, killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. By this point he was nearly penniless, exiled from high society, and besieged by accusations that he wasn’t who he said he was—that he’d leveraged a bogus identity to rise in the world.

Before I left the Leech Lake Ojibwe reservation in northern Minnesota, I didn’t really think or talk much about being Native. My “Indianness” wasn’t important to me. When I was growing up, my Ojibwe mother—and also my Austrian Jewish father—made sure that I harvested wild rice in the fall, hunted in the winter, tapped maple trees for sugar in the spring, and fished and picked berries in the summer. I hated all that stuff, which I experienced as opportunities for my parents to comment incessantly on my laziness, my poor work ethic, my dearth of skill when jigging rice or boiling down maple sap or sitting stand for deer.

Only after I moved away did questions about being Indian begin to preoccupy me. When I started at Princeton in 1988, I was surprised by how few people had heard of my tribe, let alone my reservation. And as a light-skinned nerd who loved Dungeons & Dragons, grew up middle-class, and didn’t “look” Indian, I failed to scan as Native to most people. I began to feel that a battle was being waged between how I was seen from the outside and what I felt myself to be on the inside—even as I wasn’t yet sure who I felt myself to be on the inside. It became clear to me that, as long as you look iconographically Native—copper skin, black hair, a thousand-yard stare aimed at the past—white people will invariably believe any damn thing you have to say.

From the September 2022 issue: David Treuer on how Reservation Dogs exploded the myths of Native American life

So I tried to build a Native identity from the outside in. I got the belt buckle, wore the bolo tie, grew my hair long, listened to R. Carlos Nakai’s flute recordings and John Trudell’s spoken-word CDs. I began to cultivate “life on the rez” stories that I shared with anyone who would listen. I found myself becoming outspoken—and vicious—about what was Indian and what was not; who was “legit” and who was “fake”; what was “Ojibwe” and what was “not Ojibwe.” I realize now that all of this frenzy around identity was less a politics than a pathology.

But for Native Americans, race is not merely a social construct. It is a legal category from which rights and monetary benefits flow. Whether or not you are enrolled in a federally recognized tribe determines where and how you can hunt, whether you qualify for certain scholarships, where you can live (and whether you get housing subsidies), whether you get a share of tribal profits, and in some cases which academic or government jobs you’re given special consideration for. But to be an enrolled member of a tribe is almost entirely contingent on “blood quantum”—the percentage of one’s lineage that can be traced to tribal ancestors.

I don’t qualify for enrollment in my tribe. To be enrolled in the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, you need a quantum of one-quarter Minnesota Chippewa Tribe blood, as well as one parent who is an enrolled member. (Chippewa is a French corruption of the original Ojibwe.) Even though my mother grew up on Leech Lake and devoted her life to the tribe, first as a nurse and then as a lawyer and tribal-court judge, her official blood quantum is only one-quarter. Her grandmother was recorded as half Ojibwe, even though she was full, and her father was on the rolls as a quarter when he was really half. I should be enrolled. The fact that I should be but am not turned the idea of Native blood into an obsession for me, at least for a while, because it was a measure of my Indianness that I couldn’t change.

Within my lifetime, the question of what constitutes Native identity and qualifies one for enrollment has only grown more fraught. For much of U.S. history, being Indian was not a helpful thing; the opposite, in fact, was true. But in the 1970s, new federal laws changed the experience of Indianness for many Native people. So much so that by the time I was a teenager, having Indian identity was no longer necessarily something that would hold you back, but a material benefit. It might help you find a job, win an arts grant, or entitle you to substantial income from casino profits.

Inevitably, this led to outsiders—verifiably non-Indian folks—trying to claim Indian identity. Jobs, especially in academia, have gone to people feigning Native identity, such as Andrea Smith (who claims to be Cherokee despite no credible evidence that she is) at UC Riverside and Elizabeth Hoover (who claimed to be Mohawk and Mi’kmaq, and later apologized when she discovered she was not) at UC Berkeley. The same is true in publishing: Margaret Seltzer sold her memoir, Love and Consequences, on the basis of its details about her grisly childhood as a Native kid in foster care in Los Angeles—but Seltzer was not Native and grew up with a loving family in Sherman Oaks. Nativeness presented as trauma porn (but with the potential for a hopeful outcome!) can be lucrative.

For Natives, it is enraging that, now that being Indian finally has significant, remunerative opportunities attached to it, imposters have swooped in to take what is—by blood, history, and suffering—rightfully ours. By about 2010, these imposters had come to be known as Pretendians, and they sparked a countermovement of Pretendian-hunting. A coterie of self-styled guardians of Indian identity arose, largely on social media, to call out interlopers. I understood the impulse. I’d done my share of such policing as a young man before I realized that it was the product of insecurity about my own Indian identity, and grew out of it.

The Pretendian hunters were not always interested in a full accounting of the facts before pronouncing a person legitimately Native or a fraud. Many quite authentic Natives were targeted for banishment, and the ugly infighting their work inspired was covered widely—by the standards of Indian affairs—in the American media, which saw the battles as part of the larger identity wars raging across the nation in the new millennium.

For now, the Pretendian hunts have quieted a little, the hunters having lost credibility because of their overzealousness, and the country having grown weary of identity politics. But it’s not just the Pretendian hunters who have culled the rolls. Some small tribes, finding themselves suddenly rich from casino revenue, have been disenrolling members, so as to ensure more money for those who remain. Other tribes—typically large ones with substantial diasporas—have also been cleaning their enrollment records, less to hoard money than to mitigate tribal anxieties about acculturation. One way to feel more “Indian” is by performing a racial alchemy that effectively turns liminal folks into white people. All of this has given new urgency to old and confounding questions: Who gets to be Indian, and who decides?

For a long time, the federal government wasn’t much interested in defining who was and wasn’t Indian. From the country’s birth, Native people were largely outside its embrace. In 1787, the Founders explicitly excluded Native people from the U.S. Constitution. “Congress shall have Power,” Article I declares, to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” We were understood to belong to our own sovereign tribal nations (then numbering well over 750), many of which were geographically inside yet civically separate from the growing American republic. We had our own laws, systems of government, and criteria for citizenship.

The government began bearing down harder on who was or wasn’t Native after the passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which resulted in the Trail of Tears and the forced displacement of about 100,000 Indians from east of the Mississippi to the Indian territories from 1830 to 1850. By 1887, the U.S. government cared a great deal about who belonged to those tribal nations. That year, Congress passed the Dawes Act, otherwise known as the General Allotment Act. It was, even for that time, a remarkably cynical piece of legislation. To solve what the government persisted in calling “the Indian problem,” the president was given permission to break up communally held tribal land into smaller parcels that would be “allotted” to individual Indians and heads of households. The stated reason for the law was that private ownership and farming would induce Indians to give up the tribal cultures and practices that—in the legislators’ thinking—were holding back Native people and the country as a whole, keeping both Indian and white Americans from their full economic potential. In other words, the official rationale for the Dawes Act was economic salvation through assimilation.

But the true intent of the legislation was to allow the state to steal Indian land and escape treaty obligations. At the time, Native nations held roughly 150 million acres in aggregate, but the number of individuals who would receive allotments (generally set at 160 acres each) was so small that millions of acres of “surplus” land would be left open to white settlement. And once all of the Indians became farmers and stopped being Indian, the lawmakers’ thinking went, the tribes would disintegrate. The government would at last be free of its treaty obligations to sovereign Indian nations—because there would be no nations left.

From the May 2021 issue: National parks should belong to Native Americans

To figure out who got an allotment, the government had to determine who was actually Indian. So the government began enrolling Indians in tribes, using blood (gleaned via census data) as a metric.

In 1924, Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act, also known as the Snyder Act, which turned all noncitizen Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States into “citizens of the United States,” but without affecting “the right of any Indian to tribal or other property.”

That final clause of the act was crucial and hard-won. It meant that even after having the mantle of American citizenship thrown over us, whether we wanted it or not, we didn’t have to fully give up being legally Indian. We effectively had dual citizenship: Indians were, finally, American en masse, and yet we remained members of our sovereign Indian nations.

The legislation was controversial among some Native nations. The Onondaga, members of the Iroquois Confederacy, wrote a letter to President Calvin Coolidge declaring that the Snyder Act was treasonous because it compelled their citizens to become American without their consent. For nearly 150 years, Indians had been barred from being part of the American franchise; now we were forced to be American.

In the early 1970s, President Richard Nixon announced a new shift toward tribal self-determination. In theory, this policy meant that tribes could decide for themselves whom to enroll. In practice, this has only complicated matters: Although tribes now have more autonomy to tend to their own collective futures, they must do so in ways that don’t threaten federal recognition. Navigating between autonomy and nonexistence is not straightforward. In 1994, when the Blackfeet Nation in Montana toyed with ending blood quantum as a metric for enrollment, an official from the Bureau of Indian Affairs warned that if the tribe “diluted” its membership, it might discover that it had “ ‘self-determined’ its sovereignty away.”

In November 1928, Long Lance arrived in Ontario to begin shooting The Silent Enemy, a part-talkie film that follows a band of Indians in Canada as they struggle against starvation. During filming, according to Donald Smith’s biography, Long Lance entertained the Ojibwe actors and crew with war dances and traditional storytelling, often accompanied by an assistant director—Ilya Tolstoy, the Russian novelist’s grandson.

One of his co-stars was Chauncey Yellow Robe. Yellow Robe had been born into the Sičháŋǧu Oyáte in 1867, and had been 9 years old at the time of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. His maternal great-uncle was none other than Sitting Bull. In 1883, at age 15 or 16, he, too, had been taken to the Carlisle Indian boarding school. That’s where he was when roughly 300 of his relatives, mostly women and children, were gunned down at Wounded Knee Creek in 1890. Now, as Yellow Robe watched Long Lance, he was disturbed: Something about the Blackfeet chief seemed off. Long Lance’s dancing didn’t look at all to him like the dancing of Plains tribes.

When Yellow Robe returned to New York, he contacted the Bureau of Indian Affairs and told them of his suspicions. It turned out that the office was already investigating questions about Long Lance’s origins.

When Long Lance’s memoir was published, the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation sent a copy to Charles Burke, the U.S. commissioner of Indian affairs. “The emotional reaction of those who have read it is enthusiastically favorable,” the cover letter read. “It would interest us very much to know what you think of ‘Long Lance.’ ”

Intrigued by the book but skeptical about its author, Burke started writing letters. First, he contacted the U.S. Department of War, asking about Long Lance’s career at West Point. Two days later, he heard back that Long Lance had failed the West Point entrance exams, and never attended. Burke wrote more letters. From an Indigenous commissioner in Canada, Burke learned that Long Lance was a Blackfeet chief only in an “honorary capacity.”

Was he Blackfeet at all? Burke received a letter from Percy Little Dog, the interpreter for one of the tribes that make up the Blackfoot Confederacy. “We never saw or heard a thing about ‘Buffalo Child Long Lance’ until the winter of 1922,” Little Dog wrote. “He is not a Blood Indian, and has no tribal rights on the Reserve. We have heard he was a Cherokee Indian, but do not know definitely who he is or where he came from.” The former superintendent of the Carlisle Indian boarding school wrote as well, providing Long Lance’s real name, Sylvester Long, and saying that he had attended the school—but as a Cherokee, not a Blackfeet.

In November 1929, Long Lance gave a talk at the American Museum of Natural History titled “An Indian’s Story of His People.” Two months later, on January 28, 1930, he attended a banquet for the Poetry Society of America at the Biltmore Hotel. After dinner, he regaled America’s literary elite with a performance of Plains Indian sign language, and in front of hundreds, he recited his own Blackfeet death song, which went, in part: “The Outward Trail is no longer dark, / I see—I understand: / There is no life, there is no death; / I shall walk on a trail of stars.”

A week after that, he was at the Mutual Life Building at the corner of Broadway and Liberty, where he had been summoned to meet with William Chanler, a producer and the legal counsel for The Silent Enemy. When Long Lance opened the door to the office, Chanler greeted him by saying “Hello, Sylvester.” Long Lance looked at Chanler steadily. “Sylvester? Who’s Sylvester?” Chanler was enraged: “You’re Sylvester—Sylvester Long. You come from North Carolina, and you’re not a blood Indian.”

The charade was exposed. Long Lance was not Blackfeet. He was not even a full-blooded Indian. He had not grown up on the Plains. He had not hunted bison with his people. He had not been a captain in the Canadian army. He had not won the Croix de Guerre.

As Donald Smith recounts in Long Lance: The True Story of an Imposter, Sylvester Long was born on December 1, 1890, in Winston (today Winston-Salem), North Carolina. In the city registry, his family was listed as Black. His father, Joe Long, a janitor at the West End School, had been born into slavery in 1853. His mother, Sallie Long, had been born into slavery as well. His brother Abe Long was the manager of the all-Black balcony at the local theater. Beginning at age 6, Sylvester had walked two miles each way to the Depot Street School for Negroes. And although it was true that he had attended the Carlisle Indian boarding school, his application said that he was half Cherokee, not Blackfeet.

After that February day in 1930, Long Lance’s life fell apart, at first gradually and then suddenly. He was invited to fewer and fewer society functions and received a lot less attention from princesses and starlets; there would be no more lectures, no more movies, and no more books. Public reaction to his fraudulence was ferocious. When Irvin Cobb, the Saturday Evening Post writer who’d touted his book, got the news, he was incensed. “To think that we had him here in the house,” he said, ever the son of Paducah, Kentucky. “We’re so ashamed! We entertained a nigger.”

As he retreated from public life, Long Lance eked out a quiet existence in New York until the early spring of 1931, when Anita Baldwin, an eccentric millionaire heiress, offered him a job as her secretary and bodyguard on an extended trip to Europe in the fall. Baldwin would later say publicly that while in Europe, Long Lance showed himself to be “a man of estimable character and gentlemanly in all respects.”

But in her private journals and correspondence, she recorded that he drank heavily and made several suicide attempts. When the trip ended, Baldwin left him in New York and continued on to California, where she lived. He wrote pleading letters asking to be rehired. She promised that if he stopped drinking and chasing women, she would pay for flying lessons and give him a plane. He traveled to California, where he rented a hotel room in Glendale and visited Baldwin’s estate often, but he sensed that she was wary of him. He wasn’t wrong: According to Smith, she was having Long Lance followed by a private detective, because he was drinking and womanizing again, and spending time with an unsavory crowd.

On March 19, 1932, after going to a movie, Long Lance told a taxi driver to take him to Baldwin’s estate. He sat with Baldwin in the library. According to her, he seemed “abrupt, very depressed and non-communicative.” Not long after she retired to bed, she heard a gunshot. Baldwin’s watchman ran to the library, where according to Smith’s biography he found Long Lance “slumped on a leather settee,” his legs straight out in front of him, his head flung back, and a Colt .45 revolver in his right hand.

In May 2024, I traveled to East Glacier, Montana, on the western edge of the Blackfeet Nation, for lunch at the Two Medicine Grill. I was there to meet a Blackfeet named Robert Hall. When he arrived, it took him a few minutes to get from the door to where I was sitting because so many people in the restaurant seemed to be a friend or a relative—the server, the cook, a couple of diners.

I wanted to talk with Hall about the scourge of Pretendians. In 2020, Hall had waded into an online trolling battle with anti-Pretendians, concerned that in their zealotry for rooting out fake Indians, these crusaders had become “toxic.” Pretendian-hunting, in his view, “had become this thing where if you don’t agree with the hunters, you’re not Indian anymore.” All of which, in Hall’s view, just deepens Indian wounds regarding identity and tribal belonging.

When Hall got to my table and we started talking, I noted that he spoke in that clipped, laconic way I’d come to recognize as very Blackfeet. He has spent almost his whole life on the reservation. “I’ll die here, I hope,” he said. “My whole paradigm is ‘Blackfeet rez.’ ”

But he dislikes the anti-Pretendian crusading because it deepens the focus on blood quantum. And he has a number of objections to the blood quantum: It’s a colonial system whose purpose was to disappear us, it’s divisive and destructive for the Indian community, and its use erodes tribal sovereignty. Reliance on blood quantum forces us to fight one another, and count our fractions, when we should be fighting together for a healthier future. The issue is also deeply personal for Hall—his tribal council has granted and rescinded his own enrollment, all based on evolving interpretations of old documents about an ancestor. That ancestor, his great-great-grandmother Mary Ground, was originally put down in the rolls as full-blooded Blackfeet. But, according to Hall, the rolls burned in a fire, and when the tribe composed them again, Mary Ground was put down as quarter-blooded. So Hall was deemed unqualified. Not long after that, though, his family found additional documents, and he was finally enrolled.

And then, in January 2024—as it happened, the day after Lily Gladstone, the actor of mixed Blackfeet descent who won a Golden Globe for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon, publicly thanked Hall for the Blackfoot-language instruction he’d given her—the council rescinded his enrollment. After that, Hall obtained still more information and documentation, including an affidavit from his paternal grandfather, whose blood had never been accounted for. “We take that back to the council,” he recalled, “and it passed. And we’re back on.”

“I spent 37 years not enrolled,” Hall told me. “Man, being enrolled was like finally regaining a limb you’d never had. And then the council comes along and chops it off. And they say, ‘Oh, it’s nothing personal.’ But it’s all personal.”

The vagaries of blood quantum mean that it’s possible to be a “card carrying” Indian without ever having lived on a reservation or knowing any other Indians. It’s possible to be an enrolled Indian and have absolutely no knowledge of your culture. It’s possible to be 100 percent Native by blood and not be enrolled. And it’s possible to grow up Indian—steeped in your tribal ways, a speaker of your language, a keeper of cultural knowledge—and yet still be, in the eyes of the government, white.

Hall understands that Pretendianism isn’t some imaginary problem; it’s a real issue. “It’s like, to be in our special-hat club, you need this special hat. And then someone from fucking Pennsylvania finds a hat in their basement and puts it on and is like, ‘Oh, hey, look at me—I’m you!’ and you’re like, ‘Ummmm, are you?’ ” This is the trap we find ourselves in: “Blood matters, even as a spiritual connection to our ancestors.”

As we talked, I felt an old sadness well up in me. By 1900, only a precious few Blackfeet had made it through the gantlet of smallpox, warfare, starvation, and Christianization. Closer to home, my mother’s family survived the effects of Indian boarding schools, abuse, neglect, violence, and crushing poverty. We Natives, collectively, have survived a tremendous amount. Across the nation, many of us won the survival lottery, in some cases with our traditions and our kin in place, and here we are in the 2020s, wasting those winnings measuring one another’s blood quantum and fighting with one another in pointless internecine cultural battles.

After college, I moved back home to Leech Lake. I realized that I had missed harvesting wild rice, and fishing, and tapping maple trees. I learned how to trap beaver and pine marten. I had missed my family, my tribe, the land, all of which meant more to me than the thin regard of white people. My older brother, Anton, who had been a history professor in Wisconsin, moved home as well. He fell in love with, and was quickly dedicated to, our Ojibwe cultural practices, attending Big Drum ceremonies and medicine dances. Both of us started studying the Ojibwe language. Both of us realized, for different reasons and in different ways, that we liked our people, and that we liked being Indian as much as or more than we liked being anything else. And I discovered that the more immersed I felt in Indianness, as a way of life lived in community rather than an imagined construct, the less I worried about what other people thought of how I looked, or whether I was enrolled.

For some—like Robert Hall and my brother and me—the question of whether we are properly Indian or not, tribally enrolled or not, is principally a matter of identity and belonging, of being allowed to be who we really are by dint of our histories and our attachment to the community and our affinity for tribal folkways and culture, as well as our blood. Enrollment status doesn’t directly affect our ability to feed our families, or get medical care, or have a roof over our head in our own community. For others, however, being disenrolled has consequences more tangible than the loss of belonging.

Consider Sally Brownfield, who lived for years as a member of the Squaxin Island Tribe west of Tacoma, Washington, working as a teacher who specialized in Indigenous education. Her mother, Sally Selvidge, spent decades working to ensure access to good health care for the tribe; the tribe’s health clinic is named for Selvidge, who died in 1994. But Brownfield herself, who served on the tribe’s enrollment committee until last year, can no longer get subsidized care at her mother’s clinic, as The Seattle Times reported last spring, because she and dozens of other tribe members were recently disenrolled. In her case, the tribe says that, although she possesses Indigenous blood via her mother, they don’t descend from a select list of Squaxin ancestors, and so never should have been enrolled in the first place. Nor can Brownfield vote in Squaxin elections, or harvest clams on the Salish Sea beaches where her ancestors did so for generations. Others who were disenrolled alongside her lost their subsidized tribal housing.

Something similar unfolded not far away about a decade ago, in Washington’s Cascade Mountains, near the Canadian border, where the Nooksack Tribe disenrolled 306 members. Tribal officials say “the 306” (as they came to be called) were mostly descended from a different tribe, and didn’t meet the one-quarter blood quantum required for enrollment. All 306 lost their official Nooksack enrollment for want of sufficient documentation, even though many had lived in the community for decades, if not their whole life. At least 20 were evicted from their family homes on tribal property.

The irony is that we Natives—who can lay authentic claim to being the first Americans, and who were then deemed officially not American by the Constitution before being forced to be American by American law—are now at the mercy of our own tribal nations when it comes to whether we can be considered truly Indian, with all the psychological and practical benefits that identity confers. We’ve suffered enough over the centuries, at the hands of European powers and then the federal government of the United States. To now endure censure by overzealous anti-Pretendian crusaders, and banishment by bureaucratic tribal decrees and reactionary blood-quantum rules, feels particularly bitter.

I first wrote about Long Lance nearly 20 years ago. I ended that story by revealing his fraudulent Blackfeet identity. In my account, he was Black, not Native. Case closed.

But the case turned out not to be closed. He was Indian after all. The evidence was there, but I’d blinded myself to it because I still saw identity in black and white—or Black and Red.

As Smith detailed in Long Lance: The True Story of an Imposter, Long Lance’s mother, Sallie, had been born into slavery. Her grandfather Robert Carson was “a small-time slave owner.” Carson had been wild in his youth, but evidently “settled down after he bought a handsome Indian woman” at an auction.

Among the 20 children that Indian woman gave birth to was Long Lance’s grandmother Adeline, born in 1848. Long Lance’s maternal grandfather was a North Carolina state senator who visited Carson’s plantation often and fathered Sallie and another child with Adeline.

It turns out that Long Lance’s father, too, had Indian blood. He was born into slavery in 1853 and early on in life was separated from his mother. When Joe Long finally found his mother in Alabama, some 40 years later, she told him that his father was white—and that she herself was Cherokee. When Joe died, his obituary stated that he was “a member of the Catawba tribe of Indians.” In 1887, Joe and Sallie Long moved to Winston, North Carolina, where the racial codes were much more rigid: The only two categories for human beings were “white” and “colored.” The Longs fell squarely into the “colored” category. Were they Native? Yes. Were they Black? Also yes. Were they white? Yes again.

Long Lance elided the Black in favor of the Native. When he entered Carlisle, he was listed as half Cherokee and half Croatan. Over time, he slid away from his “mixed” identity; when he received a West Point appointment from President Woodrow Wilson, he claimed to be full-blooded Cherokee. After settling in Canada following World War I—he genuinely was wounded in battle—he began sliding away from his Cherokee-ness, too, eventually giving it up in favor of being Blackfeet.

I think I can understand the slide, and the lies it entailed. One identity, perhaps the most “authentic” one, is a story of enslavement and rape and subjugation, the details of which would relegate Long Lance to life as a second-class citizen. Another, almost entirely fictive identity would afford him freedom and adulation.

It’s no wonder that Long Lance wanted to be a kind of Indian that didn’t exist—except in dime-store novels and, later, movies—and probably never had; that he mined the mineral of racial nostalgia for a past that never was. He mined it until it was played out for him, and he died alone, unemployed, bereft, and heartbroken. Not as Cherokee or Blackfeet or Black or even white—but as perhaps one of the most American identities of all: self-made.

            <h2>How to Wake the Constitution’s Sleeping Giant</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jill Lepore’s stellar cover story rightly described the Constitution’s amendment provision as a “sleeping giant.” The process is indeed in sound slumber today, but history suggests that it will wake up. Amendments, history shows, come in cycles. The political factors that trigger those cycles always differ. But what precedes each wave of amendments is consistent: worsening polarization that escalates to violence, butting up against conventional wisdom that insists that amendments are not a viable solution. We are sadly at such a point, much as we were a decade or more before the first amendments of the Progressive era were ratified in 1913. Just prior, at the turn of the century, then-scholar Woodrow Wilson, the editorial board of The Washington Post, and the award-winning historian Herman Ames all claimed that the Constitution was unamendable. They were wrong.

We should hope that the violence that finally stirs the giant will be less destructive than in cycles past. But I think we haven’t yet hit the low point in our current spiral. We’re getting closer: The civic pressures causing our descent are foundational, which means we must confront the Constitution as we reach the bottom. Our return ascent will include repair, correction, and hopefully some amendments.

I appreciated Jill Lepore’s call for overdue amendments in “How Originalism Killed the Constitution.” It is clear from our imperial presidency, gridlocked Congress, and captured courts that America suffers from a deep constitutional rot. Potential amendments could include establishing equal rights for women, abolishing the Electoral College, overturning Citizens United, and banning gerrymandering. The United States could even attempt more dramatic revisions, such as establishing an elected attorney general, like many states, or imposing a wealth cap, as theorized by Thomas Paine and Plato.

The article describes the Constitution’s amendment provision as a “sleeping giant.” But how do we wake it? Voters in Missouri, a state referenced in the article for its long history of constitutional amendment, have utilized referenda and initiatives to drive constitutional change for more than a century. Most recently, in November 2024, Missouri voters chose to enshrine women’s fundamental right to reproductive freedom in our state constitution. About 25 states have one or both of these processes, which have been found to promote accountable and responsive government.

In this context, one idea suggested in the 1980s by then-Representative Dick Gephardt of Missouri should be revisited: the national advisory referendum. A proposed amendment, placed on a midterm or presidential ballot by an act of Congress, would not be binding, but the result would gauge whether the amendment has sufficient nationwide support to meet the Constitution’s Article V state-ratification requirement.

Unlike most other modern democracies, America has never held a national vote on a question other than who should occupy the presidency and vice presidency. Perhaps this is one of the sources of the chief executive’s extraordinary power. But what if the solution to our nation’s democratic dysfunction is more democracy, not less?

As I read Jill Lepore’s article, I kept looking for a mention of the one word consistently missed in the Constitution. For years, I have been hoping that the “originalists” would stop and read the first sentence—“We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union …”—and realize they have been overlooking the word more.

The Framers did not believe that America was perfect and that its Constitution ought to be cast in stone, only that America was more perfect than what had come before. They could easily have written “in Order to form a perfect Union,” but they didn’t. Instead, they understood that what they wrote was never going to be perfect and would need to adapt to endure. Thus, Article V.

Only by ignoring that word can originalists conclude that the Constitution is, as Justice Antonin Scalia put it, “dead, dead, dead.”

This summer, while visiting Washington, D.C., with my son, we went inside the Jefferson Memorial and read the inscriptions on the walls out loud. One quote struck me deeply: “I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.”

This excerpt from a letter by Thomas Jefferson resonated with me immediately. Jefferson—the original originalist—would have been appalled at some of our recent Supreme Court decisions.

Jill Lepore states that the more than 400 federal judges appointed by Ronald Reagan were “screened for their views on abortion.” I was Reagan’s last appointment to the United States Court of Appeals, but I was not asked for mine. I was warned that I would be, but the closest his staff got was the following exchange:

“Judge Nygaard, do you have a judicial philosophy?”

“I will. In criminal matters, I am basically Cartesian. And in civil and other matters, I am definitely Aristotelian.”

They asked no follow-up questions. I doubt they knew what I was talking about. In full disclosure, I am not sure even I knew!

Richard L. Nygaard United States Circuit Judge North East, Pa.

In high school I had a wonderfully pudgy and eccentric tenth-grade history teacher. He taught in a second-story room with a wide plate-glass window that looked out at a mountain in the distance, whose silhouette resembled a sleeping giant. In the middle of an especially boring lesson—the accidental presidency of John Tyler, say—he’d lumber across the room and haul himself up onto the radiator beneath the window and lie down on it, exactly lining up his belly with the mountain’s summit, his head and feet with its smaller peaks: he, the giant. He’d sigh, settling in, and then he’d appear to nod off. We’d wait, a little nervously. And then suddenly and in a whirl of motion you could not imagine as within the capacity of so large and old and ungainly a man, he’d roll off the radiator, leap to his feet, and cry, “The giant wakes!” And it would be very thrilling, and we’d all snap to attention, and he’d move on and—somehow, somehow—he’d make the fall of the Whig Party gripping. In short, I heartily agree with these readers, and I hereby offer my assurance that the whole point of my sleeping-giant analogy with reference to Article V of the Constitution, aside from being a nod to a beloved teacher, is that somehow, somehow, and I suspect one day soon, “the giant will wake” !

In this month’s cover story, “Is This What Patriotism Looks Like?”, Jamie Thompson tells the stories of Thomas Webster, a retired New York City policeman who attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and Noah Rathbun, a police officer whom Webster assaulted. (Webster has since been pardoned by Donald Trump.) Thompson also profiles Daniel Hodges, a police officer who was pinned against a doorway and beaten while attempting to prevent the mob from breaching the building. For our cover image, we selected a photograph of a group of officers attempting to hold back a crowd of rioters outside the Capitol.

“Just How Real Should Colonial Williamsburg Be?” (November) originally stated that Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry once lived in the Governor’s Palace in Colonial Williamsburg. In fact, the residence at Colonial Williamsburg is a reconstruction of the original building. “The New German War Machine” (January) originally stated that the Bendlerblock once served as the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. In fact, it served as the headquarters of several divisions of the German military.

            <h2>How the Supreme Court Broke Congress</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/supreme-court-congress-powers/685590/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two dynamics are fundamentally reshaping the structure and functioning of the American government. The first, which is quite well known, is Congress’s decline. The second, perhaps somewhat less appreciated but no less significant, is the Supreme Court’s ascent—its expansion of its power into areas previously thought to be off-limits.

These dynamics share a root cause: the partisan polarization that has reshaped American politics over the past four decades. But the connection is deeper and more complex than that. Whereas polarization weakened Congress, it emboldened the Court to dismantle laws and, in the process, undermine Congress’s ability to make laws at all, reinforcing Congress’s sclerosis.

The citizens and commentators shouting from the sidelines that Congress must act, fix itself, and reclaim its intended role are not wrong. But they miss that the Court has made doing so nearly impossible. The practical result is a Congress caught between paralysis and policing, mostly incapable of translating collective judgment into law and, when it does manage to do so, vulnerable to having its most significant accomplishments—civil-rights enforcement, voting protections, campaign-finance reform, administrative authority—erased by judicial decree. The judiciary, long conceptualized as a check on legislative excess, is now defined by its own excess against legislative charge.

The Court’s usurpation runs deeper than the invalidation of statutes with a liberal cast, though there has been plenty of that. It is curbing a competing source of constitutional interpretation, kneecapping an institution that speaks with its own voice and channels public commitments into durable legal forms. In the name of protecting the balance of powers, the Court is radically refashioning that balance, claiming for itself the final and exclusive authority not only over which laws stand but over who gets to say what the Constitution means.

The relationship between Congress and the Court has never been static. The Framers imagined a system in which “ambition counteracts ambition”—rival institutions checking each other through distinct roles and visions of the public good. That Hamiltonian-Madisonian ideal has waxed and waned over American history. Clashes have at times given way to collaboration. Today it has yielded something new.

The modern Court’s campaign against Congress began in the late 20th century, amid rising partisanship and institutional upheaval. The Gingrich revolution, ushered into Washington by the 1994 midterm election, reshaped Congress, accelerating party sorting into distant ideological camps and normalizing scorched-earth tactics. The Court was not immune to these forces. Following the Bork confirmation debacle—when the Senate, closely split along party lines, rejected Robert Bork’s nomination to the Court—justices tended to reach the bench only after passing ideological screening systems and bruising Senate battles. Some had worked as political operatives during Republican presidencies or, later, in the bitter Florida recount. As interbranch rivalry morphed into systemic partisan competition, a judiciary dominated by Republican appointees began consolidating its authority at Congress’s expense.

This turn against Congress reflected less a principled commitment to limited federal legislative power than an opposition to what Congress was doing through the New Deal and Great Society. Particularly at risk were congressional assertions of its own interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment and efforts to enforce that vision in civil-rights laws, as well as regulations of interstate commerce. These were domains where conservative activists had long sought to roll policies back, yet lacked the public support to do so. Jurisprudence accomplished what democratic politics could not.

In the mid-’90s, the Rehnquist Court broke with half a century of post–New Deal deference to federal legislation. In United States v. Lopez (1995), five Republican-appointed justices struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act, finding that the near-unanimously approved law exceeded Congress’s commerce-clause power. It was the first time since Carter v. Carter Coal Co., issued in 1936 during an epic clash with Franklin D. Roosevelt, that the Court invalidated a federal statute on this basis. Lawmakers had once built bipartisan legislative coalitions; a newly conservative Court now moved to undo them.

Lopez announced an ambition to undercut a larger dynamic separate from the substantive issues of guns and schools: a Congress responsive to public sentiment, attentive to contemporary problems, and transmuting public opinion into concrete action. This ambition grew out of the structural insulation of the Court. Partisan control of Congress rose and fell with elections, whereas control of the Court did not, at least not as directly. As a result, the conservative Court held an advantage in long-game constitutional struggles: its capacity to wait out temporary liberal congressional majorities.

In quick succession, the Court began circumscribing Congress’s ability to define rights and act on its constitutional imagination. Five years after Lopez, in United States v. Morrison (2000), the same five justices struck down important parts of the Violence Against Women Act. Declaring themselves to be “the ultimate expositor of the constitutional text,” they issued a warning shot aimed at Congress’s ability to interpret and enforce the Reconstruction amendments in particular and constitutional law more broadly.

The Court under Chief Justice John Roberts inherited this project and escalated it. What once startled in Lopez and Morrison—the conservative bloc striking down major federal legislation—is now routine. But the Roberts Court, pushed further right by new appointments, has plunged into once-unthinkable territory. Its decisions combine a contempt for negotiated legislative compromise, an insensitivity to the human crises Congress tries to address, and a hostility to multipolar sites of constitutional interpretation.

Few policy domains have escaped unscathed. In the 2010s alone, the Court invalidated core provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in an opinion that paid “scant attention to the overarching aim” of Congress to make it “feasible for women to work while sustaining family life,” as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in dissent. It uprooted Congress’s design of the federal bankruptcy system, inflicting what Justice Stephen Breyer called “needless additional suffering” on vulnerable people. And it tossed an entire federal sports-betting law, unleashing a wave of financial misery.

Even acts framed as judicial modesty mask great hubris. Consider the Affordable Care Act, the most important domestic law since Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society. In 2012, Roberts joined the Court’s liberal justices to spare the law from wholesale demolition; the remaining conservatives voted to strike it down in full. Yet the chief justice’s “upholding” opinion declared that Congress lacked authority under its spending power to enact the assiduously constructed Medicaid expansion. In doing so, the Court gutted one of the ACA’s most ambitious components, denying millions of poor Americans in red states inexpensive health-care coverage.

Most dramatically, the Court has deconstructed the Voting Rights Act, the crown jewel of the civil-rights movement. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), it demolished the act’s preclearance regime, an effective statutory provision that blocked racially discriminatory election rules before they went into effect. The Court’s evisceration led more voting-rights cases to be brought under another part of the VRA, which the Court then proceeded to undermine in Brnovich v. DNC (2021). A further gutting of the VRA is now likely in a case the Court will hand down this term.

Meanwhile, a constellation of campaign-finance decisions—Citizens United (2010), McCutcheon (2014), and others less well known—dismantled Congress’s two most significant efforts to regulate private money in public elections, eroding the safeguards that protect elections as conduits of public opinion. Here, again, the Court could go further this term, in a case brought by Republicans seeking to lift limits on how much parties may spend in coordination with candidates.

It is a category error to treat these decisions as isolated strikes against discrete statutes. The laws in question reflect something more profound: Congress mediating public constitutional values, drawing on sustained exchange with the people, and articulating constitutional meaning through debate and enactment. In short, they are instances of congressional constitutionalism. By overriding these laws, the Court rejects this rival interpreter’s long-recognized authority to give form to the nation’s evolving and elusive constitutional aspirations in law.

The FMLA was never merely a routine tax-and-spend measure. Its sponsors explicitly advanced a vision of gender equality under the Fourteenth Amendment, one emerging from their constituents and more expansive than the Court’s. Campaign-finance laws likewise do more than regulate money in politics; they embody congressional judgments about the conditions necessary for democratic self-government and meaningful political opportunity. And the VRA—described by legal scholars as a “super-statute”—marks the high point of this tradition: not an ordinary exercise in budgeting, but Congress giving constitutional form to the country’s deepest democratic commitments.

Congress’s constitutionalism carries advantages over the Court’s. Most important, it remains tethered to the public. Elections, however imperfectly, compel lawmakers to listen and respond. When Congress speaks on constitutional affairs, this democratic legitimacy wields an authority that the Court’s rarefied exegesis cannot match. Congress also possesses institutional tools that the Court lacks. Statutes can be comprehensive and prospective; their language can be iterative, granular, and versatile. The FMLA, VRA, and ACA exist because legislators navigated tangled terrain—negotiating, compromising, calibrating demands among plural interests in and outside of the Capitol. Cloistered justices cannot do these things. They adjudicate from a comparatively passive posture, bereft of an enforcement and policy-making apparatus.

The Roberts Court has hollowed out these dynamic sources of congressional constitutionalism. Its voting-rights and campaign-finance decisions have weakened the electoral systems that make Congress responsive to the public. Statutes of this genre, to borrow from the former Yale Law School dean Robert Post, should be thought of as “wholesome legislation that nourishes democratic legitimacy”—measured legislative judgments about the guardrails and ground rules necessary to preserve elections as channels of representation, and public faith in them as such. In dismantling this scaffolding, the Court has left Congress more detached from its electorate, diminishing its claim and role as a representative authority.

The Court has further eroded the conditions that make lawmaking possible. Deregulated campaign finance has produced a political economy in which lawmakers and candidates spend much of their day fundraising. Time that might otherwise be devoted to legislation, oversight, or the slow, unpredictable social interactions that foster bipartisanship is instead siphoned off to “call time” and cocktail hour. Empirical studies confirm that reliance on large donors depresses participation in time-intensive legislative activities—things such as bill sponsorship, floor debate, and committee work. It simultaneously redirects lawmakers’ attention toward courting high-net-worth donors and away from talking to people in their districts.

And then there is gerrymandering. By immunizing partisan-drawn maps from federal-court scrutiny, the Court’s decision in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019) entrenched electoral distortion in American politics. The Court has since doubled down. Last month, Justice Samuel Alito defended Texas’s gerrymandered maps on the grounds that they reflected “partisan advantage pure and simple”—an unabashed apologia for a practice destructive to democracy. Gerrymandering for partisan advantage begets safe seats. Safe seats reward ideologues, marginalize moderate voices, and intensify polarization. They elevate representatives who are less responsive to median voters and less inclined to legislative compromise. Representation thins and drifts toward the extremes, and public confidence in Congress as an accountable institution erodes along with it.

The Court’s expansion of its power vis-à-vis Congress has proceeded on two mutually reinforcing fronts. Methodologically, it has transformed how the Court interprets law.  Substantively, it has redefined what the Constitution forbids, preemptively removing entire policy domains from democratic deliberation before voters and lawmakers can even weigh in.

The Court now rigidly reads legal texts through originalism and textualism, both of which concentrate power in the judiciary, and especially in the Supreme Court. Originalism empowers judges to parse contemporary laws through their own analysis of an “original understanding” of the Constitution’s provisions at the time of adoption. Textualism—which emphasizes the words of a statute themselves to divine an analogous (and equally chimerical) “ordinary meaning”—treats Congress with overt disdain, disregarding lawmakers’ intentions, factual findings, and the problems they sought to address.

As part of this textualist counterrevolution, the Court has invented new rules and discarded old ones to second-guess legislative choices. The so-called major-questions doctrine, announced from whole cloth in West Virginia v. EPA (2022), lets judges strike down agency actions based on their own subjective calls about which legal questions involve “vast economic and political significance.” More recently, the overturning of Chevron deference in Loper Bright (2024) gives judges new bases to substitute their preferred interpretations for those of expert agencies acting on congressional will.

The Court has also interpreted certain constitutional rights so broadly as to strip Congress—and, crucially, the people who act through it to advance their constitutional visions—of the power to address pressing social problems. For example, its expansive, libertarian reading of the First Amendment, which it has used to knock down labor-organizing protections and public-accommodation laws, doesn’t just embrace a dubious account of what speech is; it forecloses forms of regulation and redistribution historically left to the democratic arena. And its Second Amendment jurisprudence now blocks some of the most effective legislative interventions to combat gun violence.

The power grab extends to the mechanics of lawmaking itself. For decades, the Court allowed Congress to design statutes with flexibility, including by creating independent agencies to handle complex issues requiring expertise. The Roberts Court is unraveling that discretion, discovering fatal constitutional problems in arrangements that had stood for generations. Trump v. Slaughter, argued last month, is poised to join a long line of cases, including Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Accounting Oversight Board (2010) and Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2020), in which the Court has invalidated congressionally created independent agencies. This project shrinks the space for legislative creativity in confronting and solving problems.

Finally, the Court has constrained Congress’s authority to define rights and check executive power. TransUnion v. Ramirez (2021), for instance, curtailed Congress’s ability to create enforceable legal rights—a core legislative function—when it limited consumers’ ability to sue over inaccurate reporting of financial information. Trump v. United States (2024) radically expanded presidential immunity, further limiting Congress’s capacity in another core function: overseeing and constraining the executive.

For now, the supernova of Donald Trump’s presidency has muted this systemic conflict in public view. His second term—defined by galloping abuses of executive power buttressed by Trump v. United States—has played out against a Republican Congress and Republican Court aligned, if not enthralled, with him. But this alignment is likely temporary and contingent. Should a Democratic Congress return, the conflict will roar back into view.

Paul Rosenzweig: The Supreme Court’s inconsistency is very revealing

The short-term convergence of the branches should not obscure the larger transformation: Congress is no longer the first branch of government. The same gale-force winds of polarization that split Congress into warring camps has also produced a Republican-appointee-dominated Court systematically constraining congressional power while expanding its own.

The Court alone is not responsible for all causes of Congress’s decline. Partisan polarization predates the Roberts Court and has deep structural roots in geographic sorting, media fragmentation, and the fusion of personal identity with politics. The distorting design of the Senate and the Electoral College, the filibuster’s persistence, and centralized leadership have all contributed to legislative ossification. But the Court has made things worse. Its hard-right jurisprudence is an outgrowth of polarization and an accelerant of dysfunction.

A constitutional democracy cannot survive on judicial pronouncements alone. It requires institutions capable of translating popular commitments into lasting legal forms through deliberation and compromise. In other words, it needs a functioning Congress.

This capacity to translate democratic and constitutional aspirations matters not because legislative majorities are always right, but because certain national challenges cannot be deferred or ignored indefinitely, and because judicial supremacy cannot substitute for self-governance. When the Court claims exclusive authority over constitutional meaning while systematically weakening the federal institution most responsive to the people, it does not preserve the constitutional order. It ends it.</div>

Other than putting on a spare for a flat tire, what sort of &quot;roadside repairs&quot; are people performing in 2026? There&#39;s not much on any modern car (gas or electric) that can be fixed by the side of the road. It&#39;s not 1965 and you aren&#39;t fiddling with a carburetor anymore.

I thought the same thing, what a bullshit article.

Edmund King, AA president, said: &quot;The AA has the biggest database of EV breakdowns in the UK and our data shows EVs running out of charge is a tiny proportion of EV breakdowns and has fallen dramatically since 2015..

Huh.  So what is it?  Not addressing obvious questions causes speculation.

I&#39;m pretty sure that the vast majority of people reading this are located in the US, with a small chunk of us from Canada as well. And TFA is clearly British, where the market forces, logistics, and demographics are vastly different from those here.

Also, the article is long on claims and short on actual stats and other key details. It strikes me as more of a lazy propaganda piece than a news article.

You still have to wear a fancy helmet. True the new one is higher resolution and more immersive but it is still a helmet. When these things are as small as sunglasses or integrated into contact lenses it will make more sense.

Tim Cook is at the bed. What does his hand do? What substantial subject matter does it grasp?

I know... I know I&#39;ve let you down. I&#39;ve been a fool to myself.

Operating a virtual computer screen by waving my fingers around seems awful and uselessI sit at the computer when I need to use itI can imagine a device like that might be useful for visualizing a building or large machine made in a CAD systemI can imagine a virtual tour of a city, real or simulatedI can imagine playing a video gameBut operating a computer on a virtual screen? Nope

It&#39;s hard to be sure, but it looks like he&#39;s saying that Apple actually created the video for the Apple Goggles but don&#39;t realize people wearing Apple Goggles want to be in the game and not jumping around from camera to camera like sports TV.

Apple was providing their own commentary, scores/graphics, and deciding which camera angle the viewer would see as if it was a regular broadcast. Which it is not. Instead of feeling like a floor level seat it is another TV broadcast forcing your perspective.  This adds expense and reduces the being there live experience he wanted. To my understanding this is a specialized broadcast not a TV show being viewed through the headset.

Dammit, not only do I hate agreeing with am abject coward but now I have to wonder what type of asshat does it take to downvote this cowardly but correct statement.

This is a blog post by a child with nothing better to bitch about than an extreme first world problem and yet it somehow made it to /. ?  Must be a paid submission.

I kind of disagree. He seems to be pointing out that when people are watching something in VR they don&#39;t want to be pulled out of it all the time by traditional TV production techniques.

I was watching Dredd 3D in VR last night and that while it was pretty good it would be much better if I could somehow move around and watch the action and wasn&#39;t just watching a 3D movie on a virtual screen in a virtual movie theatre. I don&#39;t see how that could work though, without turning it into something more like a VR ga

Apple announced they were cancelling production of their VR goggles, and as a pressure relief valve to save face, made vague hand-wavey gestures towards using all that R&D money for something in the future.... maybe.
  If you&#39;re still standing up for Apple&#39;s VR ambitions, then you don&#39;t get it - VR has failed as a mainstream product. The same as 3D TV, 3D Blue Ray, etc. There will always be a core audience of VR users but they are vanishingly small, the number of VR headsets manufactured per year i

Oddly enough, VR headsets are the best way I&#39;ve found to watch 3D movies now they&#39;re capable of playing HD videos without losing much (if any) of that resolution.

> There will always be a core audience of VR users but they are vanishingly small, the number of VR headsets manufactured per year is in the 85,000-175,000 range

Quest 3 alone allegedly sells over 1,000,000 a year, though quite a few probably go into the closet after a few weeks. So small, but not vanishingly small.

With traditional approaches, well first you either halve the frame rate or resolution, depending on which technique is in use.

And even the highest end versions tended to have a bit of uncomfortable cross-talk where the wrong side would bleed through because the shutter glasses or the polarization wouldn&#39;t block *all* of the intended other one.  With the VR headsets, you have actual dedicated pixels per eye, so no crosstalk.

Yeah, VR is a bit of a niche, but not under a

His primary criticism is that there are cuts between cameras. The alternative would be a view from a single place which, even from a courtside seat, isn&#39;t as good a view of the action as you can get from multiple cameras. It might be a realistic experience, but that single point of view would get tiresome pretty quickly.

Perhaps it&#39;s more not liking having the cut happen without having control.  Or maybe the composition, like have a 180 feed and pop up key views on extra screens. Just like how sporting events have big screens for letting the audience get a focused view, but let the &#39;immersive&#39; view remain while you may also use that focused view.

Biggest problem with even the 180 degree view is that the source resolution tends to be rather underwhelming, Even 4k becomes underwhelming when spread across 180 degrees.  Properly

There are many things that could be done with VR to enhance the viewing experience, but no, that&#39;s not the complaint expressed in TFA about how Apple is doing the broadcast.

Apple didn&#39;t say this, it was just some asshole calling themselves an &quot;analyst.&quot;

Apple is well aware that the VP is a failure. They&#39;re still going to push ahead though. The first iPhone and iPad were disappointing but it turned them into a trillion dollar company.

There are real uses for VR and particularly AR in industry. For example, I&#39;ve seen a VR app which teaches truck drivers how not to screw up and kill themselves by loading cargo incorrectly, and aircraft manufacturers using an AR headset to show the workers exactly what they&#39;re supposed to do for their work order (so no putting the wrong cables or rivets in the wrong place).

But that&#39;s not as sexy as imagining people walking down the street wearing goggles while posting Twits and seeing everyone&#39;s Twit histor

VR/3D will need a killer app to take off, comparable to spreadsheets launching desktop computers into most businesses.

However, Big Tech has not been good at producing such killer apps. Instead, open-source and standardize the tooling and let tinkerers tinker. Then you have a pool of many thousands of enthusiastic amateurs experimenting and sharing ideas with each other. Eventually killer apps will bubble out from this Lab Of The People.

Meta and Apple should cooperate since if it takes off, both will likely

This accelerates the timeline to FSD versus the path they were on. They&#39;re going to have better self-driving, just not using the Drive Pilot system. They couldn&#39;t do eyes off in street level driving so easily as on highways. The highway driving experience should be  similar. They are implementing &quot;Level 2++&quot; ... &quot;Drive Pilot Assist&quot;, that brings in street driving not just highways .. and in within a couple of years they will skip level 3 and go directly to level 4.

Nobody outside of Arkham Asylum for the criminally insane said in 2018 that all cars will be FSD by 2020. We already have FSD, ride a Waymo and see for yourself. People misjudged to the time it will take to solve and distribute full self driving. They didn&#39;t misjudge that it could be solved.

Even Tesla, which has the cheapest and fewest sensors possible is almost fully level 4 FSD capable.

Fanboys in car forums did. I particularly remembered it because it was so absurd.

Is this another of those &quot;even though you were there and saw it, that definitely couldn&#39;t have happened&quot; things?

Tesla isnt even close to level 4, it can barely manage level 2 sometimes. As for Waymo- sure, on nice wide US streets set out on a grid system. Good luck in london, paris or rome with narrow streets that often only have room for 1 vehicle to pass each way at a time and lots of hand gestures and headlight flashing to indicate intent. Perhaps take a break from the tech bro propaganda occasionally.

e.g. &quot;I consider autonomous driving to be a basically solved problem. ... We&#39;re less than two years away from complete autonomy. Regulators however will take at least another year; they&#39;ll want to see billions of miles of data.&quot; - June 2016

They cited both middling demand and development costs as reasons for killing it.

The problem with Level 3 self-driving is that it&#39;s mostly useless. It can&#39;t control the car in all conditions. It may require the vehicle to navigate to safety and/or return control to the driver. Hardly anyone really wants that. It&#39;s not ubiquitous and reliable. You can&#39;t plan around it.

People really want Level 4, which is fully autonomous driving at human-equivalent levels in all conditions. But that&#39;s a much harder problem to solve.

Meanwhile, you&#39;re dealing with the potential liability from Level 3 self-drive without a huge increase in sales to justify it. This is a classic risk-vs-reward calculation.

I expect Mercedes-Benz to continue working toward Level 4 self-drive, but, personally, I&#39;ve never seen the point of Level 3. I certainly wouldn&#39;t pay for it, and apparently I&#39;m not alone in that respect.

They cited both middling demand and development costs as reasons for killing it.As another post mentioned, development is a sunk cost.  However, demand is a valid issue.  Mercedes&#39; Level 3 requires a bunch of additional hardware, including lidar.  In the US, the hardware is included on the already expensive car but also requires a $2500/year subscription.The problem with Level 3 self-driving is that it&#39;s mostly useless.

too many unexplained unintended acceleration events, check out some mbeq boards.

Legal costs after it inevitably fucks up at some point.

Anything short of being able to drive me anywhere with full autonomy is more or less useless to me. If I have to pay attention at any point during the drive I might as well just drive myself and save the money for the service.

The benefits of autonomous driving only really come from level 4 or 5. If I can summon my car from across town or sleep in the back during a road trip, that provides real benefits to me as the owner. But sitting in the driver&#39;s seat staring at the road while waiting to take over at a moment&#39;s notice does nothing for me. If I have to be ready to take over, I&#39;d prefer to just drive myself.

A rare consumer product that does exactly what it promises.It &#39;just works&#39; keeping the car in-lane, hands free, and that&#39;s it.Under a grand, a 15 minute install, and well integrated so it feels like the car came with it stock.Beautiful work by George Hotz and the team at Comma.ai

Combination of being the worst offender and acquiring new spectrum.

They got a big piece of the 700-MHz band, and in exchange they had to agree to stop being assholes for a while.

So, now do they have to give that bandwidth slice back?

If allocations were based on the level of ass-hattery, they&#39;d be left with one CB channel.

So, now do they have to give that bandwidth slice back?No, because this is a waiver (not a cancellation of the original agreement).  While it seems that the waiver will be superseded by new rules about unlocking (hint: those new rules are not likely to be especially consumer friendly), it is still possible for some future commission to undo the waiver.

as long as the checks clear the waiver flies.

While I don&#39;t like the whole idea of &quot;locked&quot; phones in the first place, it was ridiculous that Verizon was explicitly singled-out in the regulations.
Well, not really.  Verizon agreed to the quick unlocking as part of their 2007 700MHz spectrum acquisition (and they really wanted that spectrum).

This only means the companies must make the required contributions to el Bunko and THEN write the policy for the FCC to rubber stamp.

I don&#39;t see why people who live there should have to pay more so people on the other side of the world can generate Emma Watson pr0n.

Local industry actually produces something useful and provides jobs for the people who live there.

AI data centres provide very few jobs and are designed to eliminate jobs all over the world while also making Emma Watson pr0n.

After a datacenter is built and operational, the number of new jobs are trivial and mostly low-paid.

After a datacenter is built and operational, the number of new jobs are trivial and mostly low-paid.This is completely untrue.As one example, our &quot;primary&quot; (not really any such thing anymore, it was just the first) in Santa Clara operates about 150K sq ft. Unless they are building a new cage or doing other significant work, there are two employees on site - the security person and a guy that handles hands and eyes, shipping and random maintenance.Then they have outsourced all of their facilities work, which is a shit-ton.

Anything that uses over a certain percentage of power for said plant should be directly charged for infrastructure upgrades required to deliver it.

Telecoms do that already - you want a special fiber line, shoot you want a connection to an area that isnâ(TM)t yet served - you pay up front for that connection. Iâ(TM)ve seen Comcast charge $10k to extend their service to a new neighborhood.

It&#39;s more than that:  &quot;Older power plants are going out of service faster than new ones can be built,&quot;.  It&#39;s timing.  This is a SUDDEN increase in requirements.  (&quot;Sudden&quot; relative to the time required to build new facilities.)

There will come a time that you, the consumer, will not get any power from the grid, no matter how much you want to pay. Energy-security, that will be the result of AI in datacenters in their current form.

AI, in its current form, deserves to die in the biggest bubble implosion man ever knew or should want to know. AI, as a technology can be a boon for consumers. Its current form sure isn&#39;t it.

But it won&#39;t be an electricity problem alone. Datacenters tend to consume a lot of water too for cooling. And once t

I don&#39;t understand why heavy users aren&#39;t charged more, like water.  In my town water usage is tiered, and those upper tiers charge you a lot more per gallon than if you conserve.  C&#39;mon, electric company, do the same, and make those upper tiers juicy and you can finance yourself into great infrastructure upgrades (think power lines in forests that for some reason catch fire frequently).  Those AI companies are flush with inventory money, they can afford it, fleece the fuck of them for taking our electricity to do their stupid AI shit.

It depends on where you are, from a resource cost (fuel cost) point of view. Out here in the Pacific Northwest, our &quot;fuel cost&quot; is nearly zero. Because it&#39;s primarily hydroelectric. What is expensive is the capital cost of the grid infrastructure but needed to serve each customer&#39;s peak demand. But politicaly, it was advanageous to &quot;convert&quot; those charges to an equvalent energy consumption fee. Dollars per kilowatt-hour. In order to prevent a tragedy of the commons. &quot;I&quot;&#39;ve paid my fee for peak use this mont

Corporations are more important than people.

If takes half of power plant&#39;s output to drive a datacenter, then they can damn well pay for the plant.

Don&#39;t let them connect to the grid until they do. Or, require that they be able to generate most of their power locally, either onsite or at a nearby site.

These are billion-dollar investments. Make them buy or build their facilities in way that doesn&#39;t affect the state/county/local population.

If you possibly can. It&#39;s THE way to address peak demand problems and, with battery storage, a solution to continuity.

My thoughts exactly. Like, good by why is it a news? Dozens of companies quietly keep employees on payroll contributing OS projects.

If they gave 100M one time, maybe it would have been newsworthy. 1.5m is nothing

> Big company uses open source and doesn&#39;t pay a cent. People are upset> Big company uses open source and pays $1.5 million. People are upset

Nobody is upset they paid $1.5M, at least, not here so far.

Nobody should be impressed they paid $1.5M. It&#39;s not a lot of money any more and it&#39;s jack shit to them. Am I mad? No. Do I think they should not have done it? Also no. Am I amazed by their munificence? No again.

Can the foundation use it? Yes.Not long ago they had to decline government money because of attached &quot;anti woke&quot; clauses. Now they get some money no strings attached.

Maybe that is all Python asked for to cover headcount for those two package improvements.We don&#39;t need one company paying for everything we need each company to pay their share.

The point is it should not be in the news. I mean we don&#39;t see news about a random guy giving 20 bucks to a homeless. This is the same level of newsworthyness

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s campaign to punish Sen. Mark Kelly—a retired Navy captain—for urging members of the armed forces to disobey unlawful orders, is even more outlandish, and legally baseless, than it seems at first glance.

This past November, in a 90-second video addressed to service members, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers who had served in the military or in intelligence agencies stated that the Constitution was under threat from abroad and here at home, and that “our laws are clear—you can refuse illegal orders. … You must refuse illegal orders.”

The video failed to mention President Donald Trump’s name or any of his policies, but in the wake of military actions and threats he was making at the time, especially toward Venezuela, the message was clear.

In response, Trump denounced the video as “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS … punishable by DEATH!” He added, a bit later, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!”

Hegseth characteristically chimed in with his own denunciations and, last week, issued a formal letter of censure, which could lead to a demotion of Kelly’s rank, reducing his benefits. Kelly could even be recalled to active duty, then court-martialed, an act that would remove his military status entirely and even land the senator in prison.

On Monday, Kelly filed a lawsuit against Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, the Department of Defense, and the Department of the Navy, claiming that they were trying to deny his constitutional rights and requesting a federal judge to block them from carrying out their threats.

Kelly’s case seems to be a slam dunk. Even if the judge allows Hegseth and Phelan to pursue their censure, it is extremely unlikely—though I hesitate to say impossible, because nothing is impossible with this administration—that the senator’s persecutors will succeed.

First, and most obviously, the notion that Kelly and his colleagues committed sedition, treason, or any sort of crime with their video is preposterous. They were not encouraging service members to defy specific orders—only reminding them that they are obligated not to follow unlawful orders. In this, the lawmakers were merely reciting the clear language of military law.

Second, even if this were seditious (or even if Kelly had made some truly treasonous remark), retired officers cannot be demoted for things they say or do after they retire. “The statutes on this are absolutely clear,” Eugene Fidell, a senior scholar specializing in military law at Yale Law School, told me on Tuesday. (Retired officers can be demoted for things they had said or done on active duty, but no one is even pretending that Kelly’s record as a Navy pilot was anything but salutary.)

Third, retired officers can be court-martialed for sedition. If found guilty, they could be stripped of all military rank or even imprisoned. However, a court-martial would require a trial in a military court, with the prosecutors presenting evidence of criminality. Even Hegseth must realize that the more hard-line military court would likely dismiss a case based on a video in which Kelly recites a fundamental plank of military law.

Could Hegseth just go ahead and sign an order demoting Kelly and docking his retirement pay? Actually, no. According to Fidell, the secretary of defense has the authority to demote only flag officers—that is, generals and admirals. Kelly’s rank of captain, the highest of the U.S. Navy’s senior officers, is one notch below rear admiral, the lowest-ranking flag officer.

However, Phelan, the secretary of the Navy, could sign such an order. If he did, Fidell told me, Kelly could sue him in federal claims court—and very likely succeed at getting his pay restored and making the Pentagon’s civilian leaders look appallingly petty. The consequences could be deeply demoralizing, within the Pentagon and at U.S. military bases (not that this possibility has deterred Hegseth from his antics so far).

Kelly sees what’s really going on here. In a statement released while filing his lawsuit, Kelly said that Hegseth’s “unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: If you speak out and say something that the president or secretary of defense doesn’t like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted.” He added, “That’s not the way things work in the United States of America, and I won’t stand for it.”

Actually, this does seem to be the way things work in the United States of America now. I know of a few officers who are hesitant to speak out against Trump or his policies precisely because they fear retribution—and lack the access to resources, high profile, and legal protections that Kelly enjoys as a member of Congress. There is also a disposition among many officers, bred in them from their days as cadets, to steer clear of political activity, even if it’s meant to protest the politicization of the military.

Still, there are rumblings of change. Kelly’s suit is one. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s video pushback against the Trump Justice Department’s criminal investigation is another. The votes of a few (remarkably few, but still a few) Republican lawmakers—voicing new dissent against Trump’s war-making powers in Venezuela, his imperial threats against Greenland, and even his desire to kill Obamacare—may be more wavelets in a turning tide.

Meanwhile, the crusade against Captain Kelly seems doomed to a proper flameout.

It was the most unlikely response to the widely expected overturning of Roe v. Wade. In the summer of 2021, a small group of about 12 individuals, including some health care workers, elected officials, and local community activists, in the deep-red state of Wyoming—which didn’t have a single abortion clinic at the time—began planning to open a new clinic in the college town of Casper. This was at the same time that most abortion clinics in red states, seeing the writing on the wall, had begun planning to close or move to a more hospitable location. But not in Wyoming.

And this long-shot gamble paid off. Wellspring Health Access, which provides abortions as well as other services including family planning, general gynecology, and gender affirming care, opened its doors in spring 2023, almost a year after the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Since then, the clinic has faced unending legal challenges from the state. However, at each turn, the clinic has prevailed, culminating in a big win before the Wyoming Supreme Court last week. This ruling, which may have significance for abortion rights beyond Wyoming, struck down the state’s general abortion ban as well as a specific ban on mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion.

How did this implausible turn of events come to pass? Beyond the determination of the community group in Casper, two main factors explain the ultimate success of this venture: Wyoming’s unique libertarian constitution and the savvy and determination of a woman named Julie Burkhart. In a wonderful instance of karma, the famously libertarian citizens of Wyoming, enraged by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, aka “Obamacare,” in 2010, amended their constitution, stipulating that individuals have the right to make their own health care decisions. This amendment became the heart of the legal strategy used by the would-be clinic’s lawyers, and this argument ultimately prevailed.

But there needed to be someone to use that constitutional provision, and that’s where Julie Burkhart came in. Julie is a longtime, well-known figure in abortion-providing circles. She is not a clinician, but rather an abortion access strategist and a skillful clinic operator who has a track record of opening abortion facilities in hostile and underserved areas. It was this reputation that led the Casper group to invite her to work with them even when Roe was about to be overturned.

Julie’s involvement with abortion care began in 2001, when she began work with Dr. George Tiller, the Kansas doctor who was assassinated in 2009 in his church by an anti-abortion fanatic. Tiller’s mentorship was deeply influential for Julie, and she has worked in the abortion field since his death. She purchased his Wichita clinic from his widow and reestablished abortion there, a city that had been left without such care after Tiller’s death. She also went on to open a clinic in Oklahoma, as well as several other places.

As part of a book project on how people in various sectors of the abortion-providing community were preparing for and then responding to the Dobbs, we interviewed Julie three times over the course of 2022. These interviews took place at the very beginning of that year, immediately after the decision was announced in June, and finally at the end of 2022.

Our first interview with Julie, in January 2022, took place while she and her Casper allies were already actively planning how to move forward with an abortion clinic. A lucky break occurred, she told us, when a wealthy donor purchased a facility from a medical practice that had closed and donated it to the group. This purchase was especially fortuitous as the facility was in an area already zoned to permit a medical clinic.

Finding a contractor to upgrade the clinic for abortion services was a challenge, though. Abortion providers have long faced difficulties finding people willing to work with them. Even if the individual workers involved are not opposed to abortion, they often have realistic fears of being targeted by anti-abortion forces and being subjected to boycotts. Julie did manage to convince a local contractor to do the necessary work, vaguely telling him the clinic was for a “women’s health center.” The contractor did eventually learn the intended purpose of the facility, but continued to do the work, and tellingly, did not post a sign on the site giving the name of his company, as is normally done.

Julie’s fervent hope was to open the clinic about a month before Dobbs was expected to be announced, on the theory that since the clinic would offer a range of services, it could not be shut down, even if providing abortions was no longer legal in the state. As she put it, “So if something does happen in Wyoming, we will have that presence. We will have community ties. We will have standing if we have to go to court.”

But this hope of a pre-Dobbs opening was dashed in May 2022 when Julie awoke to a phone call informing her that the nearly finished clinic had been firebombed. Upon going to the clinic, she learned that most of the building would need to be gutted and rebuilt. The arsonist was eventually caught, but this set the clinic’s opening back by almost a year.

The summer of 2022 got even worse weeks later with the announcement of the Dobbs decision. When we spoke to her shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, Julie was predictably devastated. “I was so angry, so hurt,” she said. Julie spent the day after the decision listening to music at very high volume—including old feminist anthems from the 1970s. But neither the firebombing, the Dobbs decision, nor the Wyoming Legislature’s vote to ban abortion, if the Supreme Court allowed it to do so, broke her and caused her to retreat. As she said to us with more passion in her voice than in previous conversations, “I want to tell you, in Wyoming, we are going to litigate; we are going to fight this thing to the end.”

Finding legal representation proved yet another challenge. Several national legal groups who represented abortion clinics, while very supportive of the idea of a new clinic in Wyoming, were reluctant to get involved, feeling that the aspiration was unrealistic and that their limited resources in the face of a hostile U.S. Supreme Court were better spent elsewhere. But Julie and her comrades finally located local lawyers willing to represent them. Together, they promptly seized the above-mentioned constitutional amendment as their core legal argument.

This strategy quickly paid off. Several lower court victories allowed the clinic to open in 2023, when it began serving not only people in Wyoming but also those from surrounding states which have banned abortion. Julie has since told us there has been both community support and opposition to the clinic. Tellingly in this era of anti-trans sentiment, in some instances, the hostility is as much about the clinic’s provision of gender-affirming care as about abortion.

With the resounding victory from the Wyoming Supreme Court last week, Julie was celebratory when we emailed with her. However, nothing is “over” when it comes to abortion conflicts, especially in a place like Wyoming. In response to the decision, the state’s governor has called for a ballot measure in the 2026 election to amend the state constitution to ban abortion. These kinds of measures since Dobbs have mostly supported the pro-choice position, even in red states. It is unclear how the vote would go in Wyoming, if indeed it is on the ballot. If the measure is before the voters, it is clear that Julie and the Casper community will be actively helping to defeat it.

It’s perhaps inevitable that there are already several online fundraisers for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis last week. Conservative social media users often rally to financially defend anyone perceived as a member of their team, regardless of how unpalatable their actions might be. One GoFundMe for the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, has already raised more than $439,000, $10,000 of which came from the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who argued that everyone deserves a hearty defense.

But there was one specific fundraiser that betrayed just how careless the right has become in its tribalist impulses. On GiveSendGo, the “Christian” alternative to GoFundMe, the primary fundraising post for Ross is explicitly white supremacist in nature.

GiveSendGo was built as a kind of conservative, faith-based alternative to GoFundMe, and it has crowdfunded small fortunes for plenty of conservative heroes accused of violent or bigoted actions. For example, it hosted a campaign that raised $836,000 for Shiloh Hendrix, the white mother who called a child on a playground the N-word. It is also where Kyle Rittenhouse raised more than $586,000 for his defense after he killed two men in 2020. Many Jan. 6 insurrectionists—even those who assaulted police officers in their efforts to overturn the election—turned to this platform when they wanted help.

But the site’s Ross fundraiser, which has raised more than $171,000, reveals an even darker side of these crowdfunding efforts.

Titled “Stand With Our Brave ICE Hero,” the fundraiser is a legitimate campaign connected to the agent. It has been shared by Jacob Wells, a co-founder of GiveSendGo, who has personally vouched, on social media, that the funds will go to Ross. It was boosted by major conservative accounts, as well as the right-wing news outlet Alpha News, which was the first publication to share video from Ross’ perspective of the Minneapolis encounter.

But skim to the third paragraph of its description of the event, and you’ll see—or would have seen, as the page has since been edited—a rather odd description of the situation: “This didn’t happen in a vacuum—it’s the direct result of anti-American traitors like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (who is Jewish) fanning the flames of resistance.”

In case that reference to Frey’s religion isn’t enough, there are other tells about this particular fundraiser’s specific white supremacist leanings. The fundraiser’s URL is www.givesendgo.com/Theyallmustgo. Then there’s the opener, addressing “America First patriots”—a signal, often, to the more white supremacist element of the right. The text also speaks of “illegal aliens … flooding our nation … and threatening our sovereignty” and of efforts to “purge … parasites from our soil,” dehumanizing rhetoric that evokes Great Replacement conspiracy theories.

But we don’t actually need to decipher the language here, because the man who created the account is an avowed white supremacist who has no desire to hide his views. On X, the man—who goes by Tom Hennessey, it’s unclear if that is his real name—defended the killing by asking if Good was a “negrophile” and arguing that “American stormtroopers … should be able to use extraordinary violence on our behalf.” He celebrates whiteness on his account, argues for the protection of “White American bloodlines,” and promotes the idea that Jews ruin white nations by “flooding” them with immigrants.

It’s not clear if he has any direct connection to Ross, but this isn’t his first fundraiser. In November, Hennessey set up a GoFundMe page for a 20-year-old Mississippi State University student who yelled “Fuck the Jews” at Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. (The page said that Jewish complaints about “hate speech” were weaponized to get “the goyim get locked up.”) And in December, Hennessey set up another page, this time for Crystal Wilsey, a woman who repeatedly used the N-word at a Somali American couple and declared herself to be “a racist.” In fact, the ICE agent page was admittedly out of character for Hennessey, as it didn’t involve an explicitly racist incident. But it did establish this as, at minimum, a hobby for him.

The people who donated to this GoFundMe, or those who just expressed interest, such as Megyn Kelly, may not have all read the page or clocked its white supremacist origins. It has since been edited to remove the reference to Frey’s Judaism; it has not been toned down that much overall. But this incident shows the carelessness behind right-wing solidarity. Ross’ supporters, acting on a kind of anti-left impulse, may think they’re helping their movement by supporting patriots. They are also exposing overt hatred at the core of the anti-immigrant movement.

By now, the footage of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shooting and killing Minneapolis mom of three Renee Nicole Good has been pored over and dissected frame by frame. When Good tried to drive away from her otherwise anemic standoff with ICE, Ross shot her in the face. Good was barred from receiving medical aid for 15 minutes. It’s all pretty grisly, and it’s increasingly mundane. Already this year, the agency has killed two people. Last year, its most fatal year since 2004, it killed 32. That’s one reason it feels as if Ross could get away with this, a murder, entirely without consequence. ICE has always seemed to operate with impunity, even before this particular administration, and the federal probe into Good’s killing is starting to impede the state investigation.

But on Friday night, a new angle emerged—cellphone footage from Ross himself. In it, more realities of the killing are clarified: Good wasn’t antagonizing the agent, and she had turned her wheels not to try to hit him but instead to drive away slowly. Most telling are Ross’ final words, after he shoots Good but before he stops recording. As her van drifts off, Good soon to be dead in the driver’s seat, he mutters, “Fucking bitch,” mostly to himself.

I know, I know: Who gives a shit about mere words when he literally murdered a woman in the street? On camera, in front of witnesses? With the president defending his every move? It’s almost farcical to care. But to call Good a “fucking bitch”—after he already shot her—still tells us plenty about what Donald Trump and his soldiers think about the rest of us. It also shows us plenty about where we’ve come as a society in this decade of MAGA. Trump often speaks about women as disposable. One of the first times the president showed us he plays by a different set of rules was when he bounced back after being caught on a hot mic talking to Billy Bush about how he could “grab [women] by the pussy.”

The snarl of Ross calling Good a “fucking bitch” is familiar in the way any garden-variety misogynistic comment is to most women. He said it after he shot her, after it was clear she would be grievously injured at best and dead at worst. It was adding literal insult to injury, an aside meant mostly for himself, to shore him up as the big man who won the fight with this small girl. It wasn’t enough to just kill her—he had to insult her in a uniquely female way too. Ross could have called her a fucking asshole. A piece of shit. A member of Hamas! There was plenty of incendiary invective for Ross to pull from. He chose to call Good a bitch because it’s what men call us all the time. It was easy, and lazy.

Agents like Ross resent women like Good because they don’t give a shit about his authority. (Her evident queerness wasn’t likely to help either.) She was behaving the way we want our mothers to behave—protective, strong—and the way we need white women to act, getting in between the most vulnerable people in their communities and the forces trying to hurt them. She was punished for it in a few ways.

Good’s final sentences to the ICE agent were telling too: “I’m not mad at you.” On paper, this seems like the exact right way to de-escalate a hostile conversation with a police officer; in reality, it’s that kind of dismissal that likely pissed Ross off so much in the first place. The fear is part of the point for ICE; why else would its members hunt mothers down in front of day cares, taking children out of their arms?

Good refused to give ICE any of her fear, up until the very end. Her plan was to drive away calmly, moving like someone who wasn’t afraid of the big bad wolf trying to scare her on her block. Maybe she would have had a better chance if she had showed him she was afraid; he could have retained some agency over her. But for her to drive away, a smile on her face? That’s something only a fucking bitch would do.

One thing this Trump administration has given us, especially post-COVID, is the unvarnished truth of how mean everything is. The Obama administration deported people en masse too. There have always been murders at the hands of the police. But Trump’s version of law and order is so brazenly cruel, so demonstratively evil, that it at least makes it easier to point at, clearer to define. What Good’s murder clarifies for us, among other brutalities, is that the administration and the army it has deployed have categorized the people who live in this country in tidy boxes. Those boxes are labeled with slurs.

God, how low we’ve sunk. At least when Trump was boasting about grabbing women by the pussy, he was doing it behind closed doors. Back then, he knew he had to eke out a mealymouthed apology for the sake of decorum. Now any pretense of such decorum is gone—the uberrich, like Bill Ackman, are helping fund the next act of a guy who killed a woman in her family van. Is it still locker-room talk if they say it to our faces, gun cocked? Never mind that the political and media figures who publicly mourned Charlie Kirk and denounced his public execution have been largely silent about Good’s death. That hypocrisy is obvious, even if it’s still devastating.

This week, there will continue to be countless attempts to justify what Ross said. Words are not actions. He was afraid she was going to hit him with her van. She should have gotten out of the car. Nothing matters except this: Ross called Good a fucking bitch because it’s what he thinks of her. It’s what guys like Ross think about all of us. It’s just that now guys like Ross, and guys like a president, feel free to say it out loud. What a relief, in a way, to hear it stated so plainly.

            <div id="article-text">The following essay is excerpted from The Pain Brokers: How Con Men, Call Centers, and Rogue Doctors Fuel America’s Lawsuit Factory, published by Atria/One Signal Publishers on Tuesday.

In the fall of 2015, a horde of lawyers from across the country descended on Las Vegas and beelined for the Bellagio Resort and Casino. They weren’t in town to hear Britney Spears, immerse themselves in the Strip’s glitz and glamour, or answer the siren call of the blackjack tables. But they did harbor gamblers’ get-rich goals.

The draw: a conference called “Mass Torts Made Perfect,” held in the hotel’s grand ballroom, tucked well behind its famous musical water fountain. It was the nation’s largest gathering of attorneys who represent groups of people injured—or killed—by exposure to products like opioids or asbestos.

Some of the attorneys, the insiders, were already rich beyond imagining. Others, like the Elvis impersonators roaming the streets, were wannabes, eager to tap into the mass tort gold mine.

A mass tort is personal-injury litigation on steroids. It’s not just one fender-bender victim with whiplash out for a few thousand bucks. Nor is it a class action over $3 ATM fees that alerts consumers via junk mail. It’s hundreds, thousands, and sometimes more than 100,000 people suing over life-changing physical harm from asbestos-laced baby powder, from NFL concussions, from pacemakers, hip implants, and other medical products.

Ordinarily, plaintiffs expect to file a lawsuit and have a suit-and-tie lawyer usher them through to trial, where they can tell the jury how corporate wrongdoing wrecked their health. But in mass torts, a panel of seven judges decides which federal judge will handle all federal lawsuits with similar facts. Then injured plaintiffs from Alaska to Maine find their cases shipped off to a single judge somewhere in the United States through a process known as multidistrict litigation. With thousands of cases mushed into a scrum, trials disappear and individuals become numbers on a spreadsheet.

At the center of these mass tort cases are real people seeking justice from large corporations. None of those people was in Las Vegas. This gathering was for their lawyers, who paid $1,495 each to attend. This event was about money and power.

Outside the Bellagio’s grand ballroom, three men registered for the conference. They’d jetted in on separate planes, lest one go down. Nine seasoned “spokesmodels” in electric-blue dresses sashayed around them in the hallway like roving disco balls.

“Come party with us tonight,” the women said, handing out embossed invitations to passing lawyers.

“They can’t do that,” snapped the woman behind the makeshift registration desk. “That’s like free advertising.”

With a snort, the youngest of the three men peeled off $10,000 in cash, slapped it on the desk, and registered the strippers too.

The evening’s party hosts were Vincent Chhabra, his son and front man Michael, and Ron Lasorsa, principals in a company called Alpha Law LLC.

Though Alpha Law was billed as a law firm, Vince, Michael, and Ron weren’t lawyers, and their company was not a law firm in the usual sense. They were entrepreneurs who ran a call center that generated client leads. Their Florida-based business raised the hopes of women who’d been hurt, added their names to a giant database of “clients,” then collaborated with real lawyers willing to pay for the clients’ names—and to fork over 85 percent of their attorneys fees to Alpha Law, their new “co-counsel,” if they settled the cases.

Vincent was a first-generation Indian immigrant and dot-com whiz kid. His early online pill mill had led to prison time, which got extended for running an online puppy scam. Out for a few years, he ventured into call centers that targeted women injured by pelvic mesh, a device intended to stabilize sagging organs and cure incontinence but which left many women in diapers and debilitating pain.

Ron, a New Yorker from Long Island, was Vince’s stocky, tattooed business partner. He’d been a company commander at the Marine Corps School of Infantry, gone bald after two tours of duty in Kuwait, and done a long stint on Wall Street before getting fired, filing for divorce, and discovering mass torts.

Rounding out the trio was Michael, the 20-year-old son Vince had been grooming to take over the business since he was 6. At 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds, Michael was still growing into his lanky frame and taking classes at Ohio State. He looked nothing like his dad; he had light skin and blue eyes and was 6 inches taller.

That night, in one of the Bellagio’s opulent suites, the three celebrated with a lavish house party. Just months before, they had sold the names of 14,000 clients to a Texas law firm for $40 million. Those clients were mostly women injured by pelvic mesh. And despite the sale, the trio had no intention of exiting the business.

Music pulsed as lawyers crammed into the suite to ogle the performing strippers. Some elbowed their way closer, others puffed on cigars or weed, and a chosen few leaned back to enjoy lap dances—plus less stand-up activities. Glasses filled with amber liquor, neat, clinked and sloshed onto the billiard table. Late into the night, the guys draped themselves with barely clad women in a photo booth, memorializing the moment. Remnants of white powder stuck to tabletops and bathroom counters. And mobile IV hydration stations stood ready to serve cocktails of vitamins, amino acids, and anti-nausea meds to take the edge off in the morning.

The music, the women, the open bar, the outfits—Armani meets Miami Vice—gave the soiree a Wolf of Wall Street vibe. The details of that night in 2015 vary depending on whom you ask. Someone photographed prominent attorney partygoers in the act and “basically blackmailed” them into payoffs or future business deals. Whether the women or the Chhabras sprang the honey trap was never clear.

The next day at the pool, which had a golden fountain spouting from the middle, was a scene straight out of Animal House: Polo club lawyers sipped bloody marys and mimosas on one side, and the Alpha Law crew wrestled like bawdy Delta House frat bros on the other.

Led by “Savage,” a tough blonde, nine women clad in acid-blue bikinis and stilettos paraded through the Bellagio’s corridors. Advertising Alpha Law, they coaxed male lawyers to the rowdy poolside cabana.

Mike Papantonio was among the invited conference-goers. Pap, as he liked to be called, presided as master of ceremonies. His law firm had invented “Mass Torts Made Perfect” and ran it as a conference for elite plaintiffs’ attorneys nationwide to rub elbows and strategize, making him the unofficial president of the polo club posse. Even as the upper crust regarded Alpha Law’s members as parasites, some of the elite in pelvic-mesh multidistrict-litigation leadership positions profited handily from their efforts.

Pap was surely not amused by Savage’s party; he’d already gotten an earful about the previous night’s shenanigans. He sent out a reproachful email saying everything and nothing at the same time: “A group of individuals … were involved during the seminar in business practices that we do not condone and will not tolerate.” Above the Law, a clever, classed-up National Enquirer for lawyers, filed it under “Conferences/sex” and mused, “Jesus, why don’t we go to these seminars?”

Ron, Vincent, and Michael, however, were on top of the world, the new fat cats on the rise. All the lights of Las Vegas, from Planet Hollywood to Caesars Palace, lay at their feet.

The Bellagio’s grand ballroom felt much like its casino—ornate, windowless, sour with old cigarette smoke. Mike Papantonio strutted on a raised stage, his own face a hundred times larger than life on the screen behind him. With the gestures, voice, and pomaded hair of a televangelist, he introduced a panel of mostly white men in suits, a few female lawyers defending medical device manufacturers, and two illustrious senior federal judges wrangling big cases.

Oblivious to the evening and poolside shenanigans, I sat about halfway back, embedded in a sea of plaintiffs’ lawyers who routinely earn more on a single mass tort deal than I’d take home in 15 years as a law professor. I’d long made noises about lawyers’ self-dealing—the stuff professors complain about over craft beer. I’d been invited to speak because I’m a national expert on mass torts, but no one really wanted me there. It was the inner circle, a cabal I’d tried to disband for more than a decade. Fighting nerves about my upcoming panel, I saw a text light up my phone. It was my boss, the law school dean. “How’s Vegas?” he asked. “SEAL Team Six on standby.”

I was about to repeat a presentation I had given the previous week at Duke Law School, where I highlighted the astronomical sums awarded to a handful of lawyers chosen to lead mass tort cases by a good-old-boy network. That practice, I argued, enriched everyone except their clients, the regular citizens who suffered the actual harm. My remarks moved an apoplectic plaintiff’s lawyer to point across the room at his opposing counsel, leer in my direction, and ask, “So are you accusing me of colluding with him?”

I never used the word collude. “Just curious about these numbers,” I said.

That lawyer was one of eight attorneys who’d led a massive multidistrict lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Propulsid, an acid-reflux drug popular in the 1990s whose side effects allegedly included deadly cardiac abnormalities. I’d unearthed plenty about the business side of this famous case that they’d all have preferred to keep buried.

Lawyers claimed that the Propulsid settlements were worth between $84 million and $105 million total. But most plaintiffs—99.4 percent—got nothing. Only 37 of 6,012 plaintiffs received anything, and collectively it was less than $6.5 million. Lead attorneys like the red-faced lawyer had made money not only by settling their own clients’ cases but by spearheading the lawsuit. For that work, defendant Johnson & Johnson paid them—the plaintiffs’ lawyers (!)—a whopping $27 million.

How could the injured get so little while their lawyers purchased private jets?

Now, surrounded by the Moulin Rouge feel of the Bellagio, I made my way up to the dais and laid out those damning numbers in the lawyers’ den, where I was the only thing standing between them and lunch with legendary running back Emmitt Smith.

But nothing would change. The status quo benefited the key stakeholders: The in crowd of plaintiffs’ attorneys got richer. Corporate defendants found settlements cheaper by the thousand. And judges received accolades when massive cases settled quickly—despite secret terms that typically made the money impossible to follow.

Plaintiffs were the ones who suffered. I knew because I’d spoken with them when their lawyers had not.

Afterward, those titans of tort seemed to have retained only one thing: that they were ranked on a list of lawyers chosen to command these cases. Never mind that it was a roster of the infamous, not the famous.

I wandered next door into the exhibit hall, where rows of tables were strapped with plastic banners and heaped with leaflets, mints, lens cleaners, highlighters, and tote bags. Herds of plaintiffs’ lawyers in suits, buttoned-down polo shirts, and the occasional high heels meandered past vendor booths hawking services for everything from medical records retrieval and client ads to law firm loans and settlement administration.

Those were the invisible hands greasing the wheels of mass torts, hands that propelled injured people through a maze they knew nothing about. I’d written about the industry for well over a decade, but I had no idea how vast it was until I saw its inner workings on display. Only much later would I realize that it wasn’t so much a smorgasbord of vendors as it was the Gorgon Medusa: When one head is removed, more sprout in its place.

Later, in the airport terminal, a slim, silver-haired conference attendee confirmed the snippets of hushed chatter I’d overheard in the Bellagio’s hallways. Something darker than lawyers’ self-dealing was stirring, and it involved pelvic mesh. An estimated 10 million women worldwide have pelvic mesh in their bodies, and hundreds of thousands of them were suing. The case would be bigger than the BP oil spill and Vioxx combined. Once the leviathan of profit for companies like Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific, pelvic mesh was now the white whale of liability for mass tort plaintiffs’ attorneys.

Pelvic mesh settlements were expected to total $11 billion, and everyone in the industry wanted a piece. Lead attorneys would receive $366 million of that in common-benefit fees for their work on behalf of all plaintiffs. With each plaintiff’s contingent fees ranging from 33 to 45 percent, non-lead lawyers would net between $3.63 billion and $4.95 billion, excluding costs. (As costs, one attorney charged a mesh client $575 for his steak dinner, $5,000 for his private plane, and $6,630 in interest.)

And the injured women? Their settlements would average $40,000 before fees and costs.

Though I’d escaped Las Vegas without needing a SEAL Team Six rescue, I soon found myself submerged in the legal system’s gritty underbelly, tracking a network of con men, bankrupt surgeons, chiropractors, medical funders, and lawyers who yearned to be insiders—all of them willing to do anything for a buck.

In that legal netherworld, women weren’t just plaintiffs. They were cash machines.

            <h2>Anthropic Claude wants to be your helpful colleague, always looking over your shoulder</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/13/anthropic_previews_claude_cowork_for/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic on Monday announced the research preview of Claude Cowork, a tool for automating office work that comes with the now familiar recitation of machine learning risks.

The company said Cowork was inspired by Claude Code, its tool for generating programming code using natural language prompts and whatever files and tools have been made accessible.

With Claude Code, the output is generally source code or related artifacts like documentation or configuration files. With Cowork, the output may be local files like spreadsheets or interaction with desktop or web applications.

Cowork may find fans among knowledge workers who have to create presentations but take no pride in their work, who need to move data between applications without codified import and export rituals, or who have to conduct extensive reformatting operations in spreadsheets.

It may also find favor as a crutch that allows people with minimal application skills to delegate activities beyond their competency to an AI model with a different set of limitations. Think of all the charts Cowork can produce for those untutored in data science and statistics, or the proposals and position papers it can generate for summarization by other AI models.

But to function, Cowork must have access to files and applications.

That&#39;s where the warning comes in. Anthropic makes it clear that Cowork is a research preview and should be used with caution. Users are advised not to give Cowork access to local files containing sensitive information.

When used in conjunction with the Claude in Chrome extension (which comes with its own safety warning), Cowork should be limited to accessing trusted websites. The same goes for modifying Claude&#39;s default internet settings.

Also, users are advised to &quot;monitor Claude for suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection.&quot; Yes, if you happen to sic the AI model on a file or website that contains text that could be interpreted as a system instruction rather than data, you could trigger an indirect prompt injection attack. Security researchers have repeatedly shown how relatively easy it is to craft such attacks.

Anthropic goes on to offer reassurance that it implements various layers of protection, like reinforcement learning to convince Claude to refuse malicious instructions and content classifiers that attempt to catch malicious consent before it can be passed to the underlying model.

But the company follows its mollification with a cautionary reprise: &quot;Important: While we&#39;ve enacted these safety measures to reduce risks, the chances of an attack are still non-zero. Always exercise caution when using Cowork.&quot; You&#39;ve been warned.

For those still not convinced to proceed carefully, there&#39;s a disclaimer of liability that insists &quot;You remain responsible for all actions taken by Claude performed on your behalf.&quot;

In case that&#39;s not clear, the company says this includes content published or messages sent, purchases or financial transactions, data accessed or modified, and the terms of service at third-party websites, which, like Amazon, may prohibit automated interaction without permission.

Once you&#39;ve gotten past the disclaimers and the necessary permissions have been granted, and if you happen to meet the access requirements – a Claude Max subscription ($100 or $200 per month) and the Claude macOS desktop app – then you can tell Cowork &quot;Please help organize my desktop.&quot; With any luck, the assistive software will rearrange your messy desktop files more thoroughly than your Mac&#39;s Clean Up Selection command.

That&#39;s not all. &quot;Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder,&quot; Anthropic explains in its blog post. &quot;It can, for example, re-organize your downloads by sorting and renaming each file, create a new spreadsheet with a list of expenses from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft of a report from your scattered notes.&quot;

Cowork can be extended to work with third-party apps and sites via Connectors, and with specific file formats like PowerPoint (pptx), Excel (xlsx), Word (docx), and PDF (pdf) via Skills.

The challenge is figuring out what makes sense to automate. Some batch operations on desktop files may be more efficient as CLI commands or shell scripts, which Claude might even compose if asked.

Anthropic has acknowledged that users may have trouble coming up with ways to employ Claude by publishing a list of suggested use cases. These include tasks like &quot;clean up promotional emails,&quot; &quot;organize files in Google Drive,&quot; and &quot;thoughtful gift giving with Claude&quot; .

Anthropic said it expects to make improvements in Cowork based on feedback, and to bring the automation service to Windows. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Everest has been turned into a run-of-the-mill tourist attraction. Space tourism is over now that any celebrity can blast off into orbit. Next up: a hotel on the Moon, now taking reservations for only about six years from now, if you&#39;re willing to make a small deposit.

For the low, low deposit cost of either $250,000 or $1 million, depending on the option selected, you can get in on the inflatable ground floor of GRU&#39;s definitely-going-to-happen inflatable Moon hotel, which it said it wants to have deployed by 2032.

Don&#39;t expect to foot the bill of a private five-day lunar expedition for you and up to three others for the meager deposit cost, though.

&quot;Final pricing has not yet been determined will likely exceed $10 million,&quot; the company states on its reservation website. Yes, we know that sentence is missing either a coordinating conjunction or some critical punctuation. Cut GRU a break - it&#39;s too busy brainstorming Moon hotels to run its website copy through a grammar checker.

For those hoping the company has a more grounded explanation of its Moon hotel fantasy elsewhere on its website, sorry - a &quot;whitepaper&quot; included on the site is just as fantasy-filled and hyperbolic as the rest of its corporate persona.

&quot;GRU Space rejects the notion that we must wait for external validation or government consensus to build the future,&quot; the company says in its whitepaper introduction, echoing a philosophy that&#39;s never been problematic in the history of tourist endeavors in hazardous environments. &quot;Instead, we operate on the principle that conviction must bridge the gap between the status quo and the necessary future.&quot; As anyone who saw 2001: A Space Odyssey knows, lunar hotels are absolutely a necessary part of the future.

GRU intends to first build an inflatable space hotel - the one it wants to have up by 2032 - which will follow a projected 2029 mission that will deploy a miniature version of the hotel along with a miniature drill unit, used to collect a sample of regolith as part of the company’s plan to use in-situ resources.

A second mission in 2031 will deploy a slightly larger test hotel in a lunar pit, where it imagines its eventual full-sized hotel to be inflated due to the protection from micrometeoroids and radiation the lava tube openings provide. The 2031 mission will also include more in-situ resource testing, and the first full-sized hotel will be deployed in 2032.

Once it gets its full-sized, inflatable, four-person hotel built, GRU said it plans to start work on a much fancier 10-person unit built from polymerized lunar regolith that it said will be based on the San Francisco Palace of Fine Arts.

Even the first-generation full-sized hotel, however, will require a SpaceX Starship-sized craft to get it to the Moon, the company said in its whitepaper. Chalk that up as yet another catch that could slow the company down.

The company also doesn&#39;t appear to have ownership rights to any of the Moon&#39;s surface on which to build anything at all, yet still hopes it will be part of NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman&#39;s professed Moon base plans, which GRU believes will necessitate commercial partnerships - and dual-use facilities like a Moon hotel.

&quot;If the U.S. must field a base within the decade, there is no time to invent exotic, bespoke government-only infrastructure from scratch,&quot; GRU asserts in its whitepaper. &quot;We believe the only viable path is to lean heavily on commercial hardware and dual-use surface systems with real unit economics.&quot;

The company seems to believe that it&#39;s going to have &quot;revenue sovereignty,&quot; unlike a government agency, thanks to its ability to &quot;tap into high-net-worth private capital&quot; and its marketing of a product people will actually want. That, and &quot;the AI explosion is also creating a new source of ultra wealth,&quot; the company said, making this sound more like a scam to separate gullible tech bros from their bank account balances than a concrete plan for lunar tourism.

&quot;By anchoring our roadmap to a commercial product with intrinsic demand … we end-run competitors who are waiting for NASA to request a shovel,&quot; GRU said.

With an incredibly small customer base, a whitepaper more full of assumptions, assertions, and Despicable Me–themed hyperbole (“It’s time to steal the Moon” - really?) than actual technical details, and a website that suggests the company is more interested in selling Moon hotel merchandise than putting an actual date on the &quot;dawn of lunar tourism,&quot; there&#39;s a lot of skepticism warranted.

That, and there&#39;s no mention of how the hotel is going to be staffed - with that in mind, and no publicly-stated difference between the two reservation packages, perhaps paying the higher price might be worth it?

GRU Space didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Memory makers just can&#39;t churn out their DRAM fast enough. On the heels of an AI-driven shortage, SK Hynix on Tuesday announced a new 19 trillion Korean won (about $13 billion) advanced packaging and test facility in South Korea that could offer some relief - just not for consumer products like laptops and phones.

The South Korean memory giant unveiled the new site, dubbed P&T7, which will be located at the Cheongju Technopolis Industrial Park in Chungbuk, South Korea. Work on the plant is expected to begin in April with completion targeted for the end of 2027.

The site aims to address surging demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) modules used extensively in datacenter GPUs and AI accelerators. Between 2025 and 2030, SK expects HBM demand to grow by an average of 33 percent a year, fueled in no small part by extreme demand for AI infrastructure.

HBM is manufactured by stacking multiple layers of DRAM - eight and 12 layers are most common - to achieve higher capacity and bandwidth while reducing energy consumption in the process.

The process is incredibly expensive, as a single defect in any of the layers could render the final module worthless. Worse, because of HBM&#39;s prodigious data rates - as high as 2.75 TB/s per module in the latest generations - the chips usually need to be permanently co-packaged alongside the compute logic. This makes the margin incredibly tight. Defective modules could scrap a $50,000 GPU.

Because of this, specialized packaging and test facilities, like SK&#39;s newly announced P&T7 site, are essential to producing HBM in volume.

Development of the P&T7 facility comes as SK Hynix prepares to bring its M15X DRAM plant online. Announced in 2024, the 20 trillion won (about $13.5 billion) DRAM plant was built to address growing HBM demand. It opened its clean room in October and, according to SK, work to deploy fab equipment is progressing smoothly.

While the new packaging site may be welcome news for the likes of AMD or Nvidia - two of the largest consumers of HBM memory - the packaging site will likely do little to address skyrocketing memory prices seen by consumers and businesses over the past few months. While HBM has appeared in consumer products in the past, its extreme cost and complexity usually preclude its use in modern client devices.

DDR5 memory kits that, a year ago, sold for less than $100 are now going for well in excess of $300 as vendors grapple with the ongoing DRAM and NAND crunch.

As we previously reported, DRAM prices are expected to remain high for the next several years, driven in part by strong demand for AI infrastructure. Analysts predict DRAM prices to peak later this year before plateauing in 2027, and rising again in 2028.

While customers pay through the nose, memory vendors are raking in billions of dollars of revenue. Last week, Samsung issued a revised Q4 forecast in which it predicted its operating profits would more than triple, while Micron and SK Hynix&#39;s profits are expected to more than double. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Chinese companies may be unable to import the best US GPUs, but they have found a workaround: renting access to that hardware via cloud services. Now, the US House of Representatives is moving to bring that loophole under the export-control law.

The House of Representatives passed the Remote Access Security Act on Monday by an overwhelming 369-22 bipartisan vote. The bill extends the US Export Control Reform Act to treat certain forms of remote access to export-controlled items - including high-end GPUs and other AI chips - as subject to US export-control law.

&quot;Our export controls are only as strong as the weakest link, and right now, the CCP has a real tool to sidestep these prohibitions,&quot; said bill sponsor Representative Mike Lawler (R-NY).

It&#39;s not like that&#39;s a hypothetical scenario, either: Chinese companies faced with export controls on high-end Nvidia GPUs and other chips have been acquiring access to them through platforms like Amazon Web Services since at least 2023.

According to our prior reporting, Chinese cloud providers such as Alibaba and Tencent may be enabling access to export-controlled GPUs for China-based customers by renting cloud hardware hosted outside the country. Microsoft and AWS, meanwhile, reportedly operate in China via local partners that offer cloud services broadly similar to those available elsewhere.

In short, this is a very real loophole in US export control laws - the chips aren&#39;t going anywhere, after all. This being the internet age, location doesn&#39;t really matter.

&quot;This bill brings our laws into the digital age and makes it clear that cloud compute is subject to U.S. export control law, just like physical chips,&quot; said House Select Committee on China chairman Representative John Moolenaar (R-MI). &quot;Closing these loopholes will strengthen U.S. national security and protect American innovation.&quot;

Passage of the bill through the Senate, and a signature from President Trump, aren&#39;t guarantees, and it&#39;s unknown how the upper chamber and the White House feel about the bill. We reached out to Lawler&#39;s team for more information, but didn&#39;t hear back.

It&#39;s also worth noting that the export of powerful AI chips from the US to China isn&#39;t as locked down as it was when this bill was introduced in April of 2025. Since then, the Trump administration has given Nvidia the go-ahead to sell H200 chips in China, and while not the most advanced Nvidia has to offer, they&#39;re definitely powerful.

Beijing has yet to give its stamp of approval to Nvidia for imports, but it&#39;s believed that they&#39;re likely to do so soon.

That said, China has been pushing its own chip companies to ditch American imports over national security concerns and instead develop its own competitive alternatives, a process that may still take time, though likely not much. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-pocalypse AI and automation could wipe out 6.1 percent of jobs in the US by 2030 – equating to 10.4 million fewer positions that are held by humans today.

This is according to Forrester veep and principal analyst J.P. Gownder, who states in a blog: &quot;To give you a sense of the magnitude, the US lost 8.7 million jobs during the Great Recession. The numbers aren&#39;t directly comparable, since jobs lost to AI are structural and permanent while those lost during a recession are cyclical and macroeconomic. But no matter how you view it, the numbers are meaningful and worthy of our attention.&quot;

The US population has also grown since the early part of this century, further muddying the waters when talking about absolute numbers.

The &quot;real but modest impact&quot; that Forrester models between 2025 and 2030 suggests that the replacement of large chunks of the workforce remains unlikely, &quot;as labor productivity would need to accelerate significantly for AI to replace human talent at scale.&quot;

The more realistic scenario, it says, is that AI will &quot;augment&quot; one in five roles at the end of the forecast period, indicating employers may need to invest in staff training to prepare them for a new age.

In the tech world, some of the SaaS providers are already making moves to replace parts of the workforce, including Salesforce, Workday, and ServiceNow.

Still, risks remain. Forrester says there is a danger that &quot;over-automating roles&quot; based on the &quot;hype surrounding&quot; AI can result in &quot;costly pullbacks, damaged reputations, and weakened employee experiences.&quot;

Some businesses – Duolingo and Klarna spring to mind – rowed back their efforts to replace meatbags with AI. Forrester last year said it expects 55 percent of corporations to regret the decision to press ahead with these types of projects and quietly rehire people.

Forrester today cites a million US layoffs in 2025 with some attributed to AI. Gownder recalls discussions with clients that want advice on laying off 20 percent of their staff in the lurch toward AI.

&quot;When we ask if they have a mature, vetted AI app ready to fill in those jobs, nine out of ten times, the answer is no – and they haven&#39;t even started. So most of the layoffs are financially driven and AI is just the scapegoat, at least today.&quot;

So what has changed since Forrester&#39;s previous AI jobs forecast in 2023? Agentic AI has hit the market, and organizations are using it to create applications Forrester claims are more accurate – though not according to everyone – and solve specific problems.

Generative AI projects, both successes and failures, are also teaching the market how to get better results, Gownder says.

&quot;Where our earlier forecast saw just 29 percent of US jobs lost to automation coming from GenAI, that number is now 50 percent, which accounts for agentic AI solutions that leverage GenAI as well.&quot;

As for the 20 percent of positions that will be influenced by AI, this &quot;represents a nearly fourfold increase compared with our 2023 forecast.&quot;

All of which means that while jobs will be going, &quot;we&#39;re not heading for an imminent AI job apocalypse.&quot; AI might take over some workflows and tasks, but in the next five years, Forrester thinks that work will be mostly undertaken by humans. ®

            <div id="article-text">President Trump says tech giants must pay their way when it comes to delivering increased power needed for datacenters, rather than the burden falling on US citizens, and it seems Microsoft is on board with that.

Trump issued his latest edict via his Truth Social media platform, declaring: &quot;I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers.&quot;

The Trump administration is working with major US technology companies to secure their commitment, he added, saying: &quot;First up is Microsoft, who my team has been working with, and which will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don&#39;t &#39;pick up the tab&#39; for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills.&quot;

This is a new concern for the President, who last year assured the tech oligarchy during a convivial dinner hosted at the White House that he would ensure they got as much energy as they needed to retain US leadership in the AI arms race.

Microsoft has responded to the Presidential decree with what it is calling &quot;Community-First AI Infrastructure.&quot; This might sound like a contradiction in terms, but Microsoft insists it wants &quot;to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our datacenters.&quot;

In a blog post, vice chair and president Brad Smith says tech companies have a unique opportunity to deliver the advances AI is expected to bring, plus a responsibility to address new challenges it creates.

In June 2025, Val Walsh, Microsoft&#39;s VP for Cloud Operations & Innovation, complained at the Datacloud Global Congress event in France: &quot;we have communities that don&#39;t want us there,&quot; and criticized the &quot;lack of alignment from the general public&quot; as to why datacenters are necessary.

The Community-First AI Infrastructure Initiative provides a framework to address community-related challenges, Smith explained today, based on five commitments from Microsoft:

On paying its way, Smith said Microsoft will ask utility companies to set its electricity rates high enough to cover the electricity costs for its datacenters, including the costs of expanding the electricity infrastructure.

However, in a telling aside, he commented: &quot;Some have suggested that AI will be so beneficial that the public should help pay for the added electricity the country needs for it.&quot; Of course, others have also suggested that AI is a bubble waiting to burst, and that many are likely to be impacted by the fallout once it does.

On the other promises, Microsoft reiterates that it is committed to reducing the amount of water its datacenters use, claiming this will equate to &quot;a 40 percent improvement in datacenter water use intensity by 2030.&quot; But as we reported back in 2023, the company&#39;s water consumption actually surged 34 percent to 6.4 million cubic meters the previous year.

Microsoft also pledges to create jobs, although opponents of datacenters are quick to point out that while these facilities may employ thousands during construction, once up and running, the number of permanent positions may be as few as 50.

However, major infrastructure expansion is always difficult, Smith concluded. &quot;It&#39;s expensive. It inevitably raises questions, concerns, and even controversies.&quot;

Private companies can help, he added, by &quot;stepping up and acting in a responsible way. We cannot surmount inevitable community challenges by ourselves. But we can make everything easier by embracing a long-term vision. By recognizing our responsibility. By playing a constructive role. And by supporting the entire community.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">﻿Nia DaCosta’s 28 Years Later sequel turns the franchise on its head with a story about spirituality in the end times.

﻿Nia DaCosta’s 28 Years Later sequel turns the franchise on its head with a story about spirituality in the end times.

Because there was such a long gap between the releases of 28 Weeks Later and 28 Years Later, it was surprising to hear that writer-director duo Alex Garland and Danny Boyle already had plans for their latest collaboration to be the first chapter of a new horror trilogy. Sony seemed keen on fast-tracking the pair’s idea, as 28 Years Later and its sequel began shooting back to back. But it also felt like the studio wanted to bring a different kind of energy into the franchise when it tapped Nia DaCosta to direct the new film.

That energy and its distinctness from Boyle’s directorial voice is palpable in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple — a film that understands how much more potent horror is when it’s laced with goofy humor. Though there’s no shortage of gore and stomach-turning violence, leaning into comedy is one of the movie’s more clever ways of illustrating what its characters are fighting for. Each of The Bone Temple’s jokes is a reminder of how, in a world full of flesh-eating ghouls, human connection and community are the kinds of things people are willing to die for.

The Bone Temple picks up soon after 28 Years Later to find teenager Spike (Alfie Williams) trying to make sense of his life as a newly inducted member of Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal’s (Jack O’Connell) roving cult of platinum blonde wig-wearing droogs who all go by “Jimmy.” Spike can handle himself alright against a couple of the infected lurking in the English wilderness, but his skills with a bow and arrow are nothing compared to the Jimmys’ ultraviolent approach to dealing with anything that crosses their path.

Murdering people — infected or not — at Jimmy Crystal’s command has become second nature for Jimmy Ink (Erin Kellyman), Jimmima (Emma Laird), and the rest of their demented crew. Spike finds it hard to buy Jimmy Crystal’s claims of being spoken to and directed by a higher, unseen power, but he knows that he has no choice but to join the gang and dress up like a sexual predator when they ask him to join their ranks.

It’s through the Jimmys as a unit that 28 Years Later starts exploring the ways that faith can be weaponized to harm the very same people that it provides psychological comfort to. The Jimmys are a twisted family bound by a genuine fondness for one another and an understanding that they’re safer as a group. But the movie presents their willingness to follow Jimmy Crystal as being born out of fear and a more general gullibility caused by society’s collapse.

One of the most striking things about O’Connell’s performance is how — for all of Jimmy Crystal’s psychopathy and moments of delusion — he makes the character come across as a scared boy trapped inside an unhinged man’s body. The movie says as much through Jimmy’s frequent mentions of the Teletubbies and the way he insists that his father, Satan, is whispering commands into his ear. Jimmy’s delusional rantings are convincing to his relatively young followers because they have grown up in a world where level-minded authority figures who can teach them fact from fiction are few and far between. But the cult leader’s bluster is less effective when it’s aimed at older people with more life experience and memories of the pre-plague world, like Dr. Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes).

It’s through Kelson that The Bone Temple starts to ask and answer a number of fascinating questions about those infected with the plague virus, like Samson (Chi Lewis-Parry), the hulking, spine-ripping Alpha introduced in 28 Years Later. The new movie spends much more time with these returning characters to give us a better understanding of what their lives have been like and how they’ve both been changed by meeting one another. Fiennes and Lewis-Parry are tremendous together as The Bone Temple moves Kelson and Samson closer in ways that are surprising, alarming, and unexpectedly funny. But as much levity as the pair bring to this story, The Bone Temple also uses them to remind you what humanity has lost in the 28 years since the Rage contagion got loose.

Whereas 28 Years Later felt very much like a film that was in conversation with zombie narratives inspired by 28 Days Later, The Bone Temple draws much of its inspiration from older pieces of the undead canon. DaCosta punctuates scenes of Samson’s berserker hunt for flesh with unsettling moments of stillness and tight, nauseating shots of him cracking skulls open to scarf down his victims’ brains. In the context of the movie, Samson is a new kind of infected — one with more intelligence and the ability to socialize with others like him. But as a screen presence, the character comes across a lot like a tribute to the shambling corpses that made George Romero a cinematic icon.

Though DaCosta inherited much of this story from Boyle and Garland’s last collaboration, she makes it her own by leaning into a less frenetic style of visual storytelling. Some of the movie’s biggest scares work because of how slowly they’re revealed. But just when it seems like the movie is at its most disturbing, DaCosta defuses some of that tension with a handful of perfectly placed needle drops.

It was hard to get a sense of how 28 Years Later might grow into a compelling trilogy. But The Bone Temple makes it clear that Boyle and Garland have been cooking with heat from the very beginning of this new chapter of the larger franchise. DaCosta masterfully sets up a number of promising developments for the trilogy’s conclusion, which will see Boyle return to wrap things up. And if the next film manages to inject a similar level of life into the undead genre, it will all have been worth the wait.

28 Days Later: The Bone Temple also stars Louis Ashbourne Serkis, Maura Bird, Ghazi Al Ruffai, Sam Locke, and Cillian Murphy. The film hits theaters on January 16th.

            <div id="article-text">It comes amid the global uproar over X’s mass AI undressing of users on its platform.

It comes amid the global uproar over X’s mass AI undressing of users on its platform.

The Senate passed a bill that could give people who’ve found their likeness deepfaked into sexually-explicit images without their consent a new way to fight back.

The Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act (DEFIANCE Act), would let victims sue the individuals who created the images for civil damages. The bill passed with unanimous consent — meaning there was no roll-call vote, and no Senator objected to its passage on the floor Tuesday. It’s meant to build on the work of the Take It Down Act, a law that criminalizes the distribution of nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) and requires social media platforms to promptly remove them.

The passage comes as policymakers around the world have threatened action against X for enabling users to create nonconsensual and sexually suggestive AI images with its Grok chatbot. X owner Elon Musk has shrugged off blame onto the individuals prompting Grok, writing, “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” But even after pushback, X continued to let users prompt Grok to virtually strip people down.

Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), a lead sponsor of the bill, referenced Grok’s nonconsensual undressing in remarks on the Senate floor. “Even after these terrible deepfake, harming images are pointed out to Grok and to X, formerly Twitter, they do not respond. They don’t take the images off of the internet. They don’t come to the rescue of people who are victims,” Durbin said. Though the Take It Down Act, whose takedown provision goes into full force later this year, could have implications for X, the DEFIANCE Act would impact individuals, like those Grok users creating deepfaked nonconsensual intimate imagery.

Governments around the world are creating new protections against AI-generated nonconsensual images, spurred in part by the recent Grok controversy. The UK, for example, recently pushed up a law that criminalizes the creation of nonconsensual intimate deepfakes.

The DEFIANCE Act similarly passed the Senate in 2024 following a different nonconsensual deepfake scandal on X. Early that year, sexually explicit AI-generated images of Taylor Swift circulated on the platform. Durbin along with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced the bill to expand on a provision in the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022, which gave people whose non-AI generated intimate images were shared without consent a right to sue. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who has found her own image digitally altered in nonconsensual intimate deepfakes, sponsored the bill in the House. The bill stalled in the House without a vote during the last Congress, requiring the Senate to take it up again this year. Now the ball is again in the House leadership’s court; if they decide to bring the bill to the floor, it will have to pass in order to reach the president’s desk.

Flagship phones cost a small fortune these days. We can help you pick the right one and get the most for your money.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Haven’t you heard? Phones are boring now. And that’s just fine! Most people buying a new phone just want something familiar that works better than the device they’re replacing. If that’s your MO, then you’re sure to find something reliable in my recommendations below.

But even if you’re looking for something a little more extra, you’ve got some great options. They’re going to be pretty iterative compared to whatever you’re using now — we’re in more of a software era than a hardware innovation cycle these days — but you can still find a delightful new device. We finally have a folding phone that offers full water and dust resistance, there are flip phones that offer more than just nostalgia, and you can still buy a phone with no fewer than four cameras on the back. There are even a few that offer fun styles. Not bad for a boring season of phone hardware. And stay tuned — if CES 2026 was anything to go by, there may be some even more interesting phones in our future.

A lot of people in the US get their phones through carrier deals, and no judgment here if that’s the route you take — it’s how I bought mine. Just be sure you know what you’re getting into and how many years you’ll need to stay on that Super 5G Everything Unlimited Plus plan to keep the monthly device reimbursements coming.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

The phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it’s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates are a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.

Most phone cameras perform well in good lighting, from flagship models to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting — and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to improve low-light performance is a must in this category.

The very best devices carry robust IP68 ratings, durable glass on the front and back, and sturdy aluminum exterior frames.

In addition to the very best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to recommending a lower-tier model if it’s particularly feature-rich for its price, or last year’s model if it’s still sold new and this year’s device doesn’t offer many upgrades.

If you’re looking to spend a little less and still get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $600. For those recommendations, check out our guide to budget smartphones.

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe (Qi2) / Weather-resistance: IP68

This year’s standard iPhone offers a handful of major upgrades over its predecessor, including a larger 6.3-inch screen with a 120Hz panel and an always-on display. These two features make the everyday experience meaningfully better, but they’re not the only ones: you also get faster performance, better battery life, and twice the amount of base storage at 256GB. It also has the same starting price of $799, which is a shockingly great deal.

On the camera front, the iPhone 17’s new 48-megapixel ultrawide matches the Pro’s resolution, delivering sharper, more vibrant shots, while the main camera remains reliably good in most conditions. It also features the Pro’s 18-megapixel selfie camera, which lets you take horizontal shots without rotating the device. If you care about zoom or portraits, the iPhone 17’s lack of a telephoto camera is the clearest reason to go Pro. For most people, though, the device’s 2x “optical quality” zoom will be fine for everyday snaps, making it a great upgrade.

Qi2 wireless charging with magnets is greatAI is actually kind of useful, finallyTelephoto camera is a nice addition

Main and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as the ProBattery life is just okay

Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 13-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,970mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP68

The Pixel 10 is an easygoing Android phone that offers some handy upgrades over its predecessor. The addition of Qi2 with built-in magnets is a delight, making it easier than ever to quickly charge up without plugging in. AI features like Magic Cue, which can proactively suggest information based on what you’re doing on your phone, are finally showing promise. And for the first time ever, the base model features a dedicated telephoto lens.

But, alas, there’s a catch: The Pixel 10 no longer features the same main and ultrawide camera hardware as the Pro. You’re essentially getting the two rear cameras found in the midrange Pixel 9A, plus a telephoto lens. Still, as a whole, the device’s triple camera system produces images that are totally fine. Beyond the cameras, the Pixel 10 features the same Tensor G5 chipset that’s found in the Pro phones — handy for those aforementioned AI features.

Overall, the Pixel 10 mostly improves upon what made last year’s Pixel 9 such a solid release. We’re not thrilled with the downgraded camera, but the addition of Qi2 and a telephoto lens helps to soften the blow. If you can live with the camera tradeoffs, the Pixel 10 is still a smart pick for anyone who wants a flagship experience at a more approachable price.

Excellent screenImproved ultrawide cameraRounded corners are comfier

Screen: 6.9-inch, 1440p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS; 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 50-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless, Qi2 ready / Weather resistance: IP68

Samsung’s “Ultra” S-series phone is still your best bet for a maximalist Android phone, even if ultra doesn’t quite mean what it once did. You still get four rear cameras — including a 3x and 5x telephoto — a massive screen, and a built-in S Pen stylus. The battery goes all day, the processor is top-notch, and there are AI features aplenty if you’re into that sort of thing. There’s just no other phone quite like it.

This year, Samsung removed the Bluetooth features from the stylus. That stings a little, especially considering that the company swapped a 10x zoom for the shorter 5x camera the year before. It still amounts to a great phone, but it’s one of the priciest slab-style phones you can buy, and Samsung seems to be cutting features without adding back any extra value. It’s still “ultra” alright, but it doesn’t feel quite as special as it used to.

Robust IP68 ratingSeven years of software updatesBrighter, bigger screen

Missing a couple of AI featuresAI is occasionally handy, usually weird

Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance: IP68

Every year, we’re pleasantly surprised by how much Google packs into its midrange Pixel A-series devices. In 2024, it was the Pixel 8A, and last year, it was the even better Pixel 9A. For $500 (and very often, less), the 9A offers Google’s fourth-gen custom Tensor G4 chipset (the very same chip that’s in the pricier Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro), a brighter and larger 6.3-inch OLED display, and an IP68 rating for improved durability. Plus, you get the benefit of seven years of software updates and security support. What you end up with is a device that delivers fantastic value, especially compared to other inexpensive devices.

The Pixel 9A offers a handful of other features that put it above the pack, like a 120Hz refresh rate, wireless charging, and the largest battery across the Pixel line. It does fall short in a few areas, though — the camera’s low light performance and Portrait mode could be better. That said, the 9A’s camera is still great for everyday snaps, and for the price, the device is an easy recommendation as the best in this category.

Solid battery lifeBrighter screen outdoorsCenter Stage cameraFaster chargingDoesn’t get blazing hotOrange

What’s up with Siri?Heavier than last year

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 Pro / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W MagSafe (Qi2) / Weather-resistance: IP68

The iPhone 17 Pro is the model to get if you want Apple’s most capable camera system and the longest battery life you can get in an iPhone. All three rear sensors use 48-megapixel lenses — including the telephoto with 4x zoom — and support creator-focused tools like ProRes RAW. Apple’s switch to an aluminum body with a vapor chamber also helps keep temperatures low during intensive tasks, including high-res video recording, while the Ceramic Shield 2 front improves durability. And it’s all wrapped in a fresh, rounded design.

As part of that redesign, Apple carved out the frame to fit a larger battery, which lasts through a typical day of mixed use while browsing social media, gaming, etc. The 17 Pro supports 40W wired charging and slightly faster MagSafe charging, allowing you to take it from zero to 50 percent in as little as 20 minutes. It also supports USB 3 for lightning-fast transfer speeds, so you can quickly copy over all your vacation photos and videos to your laptop.

Since the standard iPhone 17 has the same 120Hz refresh rate and an always‑on display, it’s easier to skip the Pro this year. That being said, if you want longer battery life and the most flexible camera system in the lineup, the 17 Pro is the way to go. Plus, it comes in a bold orange shade that’s unlike anything else in Apple’s lineup.

Samsung finally adopted the big cover screenAll-day batteryReliable camera

More susceptible to dust than your average phoneStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen

Screen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather resistance: IP48

Samsung finally got the memo with the Galaxy Z Flip 7’s cover screen. The company’s latest flip phone ditches the file folder-shaped look of its predecessor for a 4.1-inch, edge-to-edge display that wraps around the cameras. With more outer screen real estate, it’s easier to respond to texts and punch in a coffee order without flipping open the phone and getting sucked into a digital rabbit hole.

The Flip 7 still makes you jump through a few hoops if you want to run full apps on the cover screen, but once you’ve wrangled the settings, it unlocks a lot of convenience for everyday tasks. That said, the cover screen isn’t perfect for every app. Sometimes a button hides behind the camera cutout, forcing you to change the app’s window size. But most tasks are a breeze, and opening the phone is always an option.

Under the hood, Samsung swapped out Qualcomm’s processor for an in-house Exynos chip, though we didn’t notice any hits to performance. The new 4,300mAh battery will last you all day with moderate use, but heavy gaming and hotspot use will significantly impact battery life. The camera system, meanwhile, remains unchanged from the Z Flip 6, which isn’t a bad thing. You still get a 50-megapixel main shooter and all the fun flex mode tricks, which are great for capturing candids.

Unfortunately, the Flip 7 still offers no protection against fine particles like dust or sand, which might work their way into the hinge and cause damage. This raises concerns about how the device might hold up over time. But Samsung’s beefed-up warranty and repair program can provide extra peace of mind. Plus, with seven years of OS and security updates, the Flip 7 should prove reliable until you decide to upgrade.

Full dust resistance! On a foldable!Qi2 support with built-in magnets

Heavy and chunkyCameras aren’t as good as the other 10 Pro phones’Pricier than a regular phone

Screen: 8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.4-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Google Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 5,015mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) / Weather resistance: IP68

Concerns over long-term durability have kept us from recommending foldables to anyone but the most diehard gadget nerd. Then Google said “hold my USB-C cable” and bestowed an IP68 rating on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, making it the first foldable to provide full water and dust resistance. That means the device can survive a tumble on the beach without the hinge and inner screen failing. What’s more, the device features Qi2 support with built-in magnets for accessories and wireless charging. And with a new Tensor G5 chip, it offers smooth performance, whether you’re playing intensive games like Diablo Immortal or multitasking on the larger inner display.

As much as we love the 10 Pro Fold’s improved durability, its cameras can’t quite keep up with those of other 10 Pro models. The device is also heavy and rather chunky; it’s over 40 grams heavier than Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 and nearly 2 millimeters thicker when folded shut. There’s a plus side to the thicker frame, though: it leaves more room for the phone’s larger battery, which can last a full day with minimal use of the inner display. If you find yourself spending most of your time using the larger display, you may need to find the nearest outlet by the end of the day.

Update, January 13th: Adjusted pricing / availability, removed mention of the OnePlus 13R, and added info about the Samsung Z TriFold and the OnePlus 15R. Brandon Russell and Barbara Krasnoff also contributed to this post.

﻿Chief product officer Mike Krieger will change roles and join the “Labs” team.

Mike Krieger, the Instagram co-founder who joined Anthropic two years ago as its chief product officer, is moving to a new focus at the AI startup: co-leading its internal incubator, dubbed the “Labs” team.

The Anthropic Labs team started in mid-2024 with just two members; now, the company has decided to expand it, with a focus on building “experimental products.” Krieger’s new title will be simply a member of technical staff reporting to Anthropic president Daniela Amodei, and he’ll co-lead the Labs team with Ben Mann, who has been the company’s product engineering lead. Ami Vora, the company’s current “head of product,” will take over Krieger’s duties and work closely with the company’s chief technology officer, Rahul Patil, to scale products, the company said.

The company hopes to double the number of Labs team members in the next six months.

In a statement to The Verge, Krieger said, “We’ve reached a watershed moment in AI—model capabilities are advancing so fast that the window to shape how they’re used is now. That’s why I’m getting back into builder mode, moving from my role as CPO and joining our Labs team: I want to be hands-on at the frontier, building products that channel AI toward solving the world’s hardest problems. I’m excited to pass the baton to Ami as she leads the team in scaling Claude.”

Anthropic’s C-suite shake-up comes at a time when competition among AI startups and tech giants has never been more stiff. Tech giants like Apple and Google are trying to shore up defenses against high-flying startups like OpenAI and Anthropic, while companies of all sizes are attempting to differentiate themselves by rebranding their longtime goal of “artificial general intelligence” (AGI). They’re also trying to set themselves apart in the AI agent game by constantly one-upping each other with new features designed to corner the market on consumers. As AI companies’ fundraising rounds balloon significantly — i.e., Anthropic is reportedly planning to raise $10 billion on a $350 billion valuation — investors are eager to see delivery on their promises.

Anthropic president Daniela Amodei said in a statement to The Verge that the “speed of advancement in AI demands a different approach to how we build, how we organize, and where we focus. Labs gives us room to break the mold and explore.”

Get some peace and quiet with any of our top picks for noise-canceling headphones. Sony’s still the best overall, but there are reasons to go elsewhere, too.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Whether you’re wearing them for the morning commute, while traveling, or if you’re simply trying to find some peace and quiet while working at home, noise-canceling headphones are a more essential piece of kit nowadays than ever before. And you’ve got a slew of great options to pick from; it’s hard to make a bad choice.

There are longtime heavyweights like Bose and Sony to pick from. Apple has quickly carved into the market with the luxurious AirPods Max. And if you’ve got an ear that demands the best audio quality, headphones from Bowers & Wilkins and Sennheiser might appeal to you more than the mainstream contenders.

Not everyone loves the feel of earbuds, and there are scenarios where over-ear and on-ear headphones are just simpler or make more sense than wireless buds — particularly if lengthy battery life matters to you.

No matter how you’re using them, the criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones haven’t changed.

We put our top picks for noise-canceling headphones through many hours of testing. Since their ability to tamp down the loudness of your surroundings is critical, we use them in a variety of environments — including busy city streets, the office, coffee shops, and public transit — and for more quiet, focused listening at home.We sample their transparency mode to see how clearly the outside world comes through and if it’s easy to carry on conversations while wearing the headphones. We have friends and family try them on and provide feedback on the fit and comfort. And, of course, we have our favorite albums and playlists on repeat to assess how each pair sounds and how much listening time you can expect from a single charge.

If headphones are causing a sore spot at the top of your noggin, what good are they no matter how good they sound or cancel noise? Traditionally, the lighter they are, the more comfortable the headphones will prove over extended listening sessions. But manufacturers can also help improve comfort by being thoughtful in the materials they choose for ear cups and the headband that wraps over your cranium. Clamping force is another important factor; some headphones will squeeze your head more firmly than others; this can be great if you want a pair to stay put for exercise, but not ideal if you’re just trying to relax and tune out the world.

Practically any of our picks will do an excellent job at providing distraction-free listening when on a flight, at the office, or if you’re traversing city streets. Noise-canceling headphones work by using built-in microphones to listen to the sounds in your environment, and they invert those soundwaves to eliminate the cacophony of everyday life.

Having powerful noise-canceling used to mean compromising on sound quality, but that’s simply not the case anymore. Most of today’s flagship ANC headphones provide dynamic, rich, and immersive sound. They support a variety of Bluetooth audio codecs, and some (like Sony’s LDAC and aptX HD) can deliver higher bitrates than the status quo AAC and SBC codecs. But don’t get bogged down in those details; headphones that are tuned well with the right components can make your music sound fantastic regardless of codecs.

One benefit of buying headphones instead of earbuds is that they can last much longer on a single charge. Whereas you’ll need to plop most earbuds back into their case after five hours or so, wireless headphones can keep the music going for around 20 hours. And some recent models can even exceed that, reaching 60 hours.

We all try to do our best at multitasking, and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity is essential for headphones to meet the same challenge. Multipoint allows your noise-canceling headphones to pair with two devices at the same time. This makes it easy to take a call on your phone and get right back to the music you were playing on your laptop without fussing with Bluetooth settings menus.

Headphones are increasingly gaining features that are exclusive to individual manufacturer ecosystems. For example, the AirPods Max are capable of head-tracking spatial audio and other tricks like audio sharing — but only if you’re listening to them with one of the company’s other products, like an iPhone, Mac, or iPad.

Even better active noise cancellationMore balanced, tighter soundMuch-improved voice call quality

Design is very plasticky for $400No major new features over 1000XM4Bulky, awkward carrying case

Battery life: 30 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Connectors: USB-C (charging), 3.5mm headphone jack (audio)

Sony’s WH-1000XM5 have a completely different design from their predecessors. The changes result in greater comfort when you wear them on your head for extended periods of time — like on a flight or at the office.

Noise cancellation has been further improved from the already-stellar performance of the WH-1000XM4, putting Sony at the front of the pack compared to all major competitors. Sound quality is more detailed and balanced than the older XM4; the low end is still punchy but tighter and less boomy than before. The XM5 offer excellent voice call performance, and they can connect to two devices simultaneously, so you can stay clued in on what’s happening on your phone when you’re working away on your laptop or tablet.

Sony’s headphones also include unique features like “speak to chat,” which automatically pauses your music and pipes in ambient audio whenever you start talking. Or you can hold one hand over the right ear cup to activate quick attention mode, which is convenient when grabbing a coffee or listening to airport announcements. And like other high-end headphones, the XM5 can detect when they’ve been removed from your ears for auto-pause.

Last year, Sony introduced the WH-1000XM6, and while they offer incremental improvements over the XM5 in terms of sound and ANC performance, they’re also more expensive at $449.99. The XM5, meanwhile, can regularly be found for $300 or less. When you weigh price versus performance, the XM5 represent a better value overall, which is why they remain at the top of our list.

Exemplary comfortTop-tier noise cancellationImproved transparency mode clarityBetter voice call quality than NCH700

Immersive Audio is sometimes enjoyable but often badImmersive Audio drains battery fasterNo USB-C audio supportCase has annoying indentations

Battery life: 24 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: aptX Adaptive, AAC, SBC / Connectors: USB-C (charging), 2.5mm headphone jack (audio)

Bose’s first-gen QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are basically a blend of the company’s prior Noise Canceling Headphones 700 and QuietComfort 45 that borrow the best traits from both — while throwing in a new “immersive audio” listening mode. Like past Bose cans, they’re very light and comfortable on your head, even when worn for long stretches of time. Best of all, unlike the Noise Canceling Headphones 700, these can be folded, making them easier to travel with.

Their 24-hour battery life is more than adequate, and Bose has added support for the aptX Adaptive Bluetooth codec for improved audio fidelity on Android devices. The immersive audio feature works well on some songs, but less so on others. It’s worth experimenting with, but even if you leave it off entirely, you’re left with best-in-class noise cancellation, pleasing sound, and a helpful “aware” transparency mode.

It’s worth noting that, in September, Bose launched the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for $449. The newer headphones build on the original with support for lossless audio over USB-C, a slight uptick in battery life, and an improved transparency mode that’s more natural and better at boosting ANC when you encounter sudden noises. They offer a handful of other iterative improvements, but as is the case with Sony’s newer WH-1000XM6, their higher price tag keeps us from recommending them over the original model.

High-luxury designTerrific, balanced sound qualityVery effective noise cancellationDependable and foolproof controlsSpatial audio for immersive entertainment

Heavier than many competitorsNo 3.5mm jackWired listening requires $35 cableCase is an abominationLacks latest AirPods Pro features

Battery life: 20 hours / Multipoint: No / Audio codecs: AAC, SBC / Connectors: Lightning (audio and charging)

There was definitely some sticker shock when Apple introduced a $549 set of noise-canceling headphones in 2020. The AirPods Max cost significantly more money than any of our other recommendations. But Apple’s build quality is on another level: these trade the plastic you’ll find in many noise-canceling headphones for steel and aluminum, and the ear cups are a breathable mesh fabric. They’re hefty headphones, there’s no denying that. But aside from Apple refusing to include a headphone cable in the box, there’s nothing about the AirPods Max that feels cheap. And I appreciate the simplicity of using the digital crown for controls, rather than relying on hit-or-miss gestures like taps and swipes.

The most important part is that the AirPods Max deliver audio quality that’s up there with the best high-end Bluetooth headphones. They have an immersive, wide soundstage and fantastic dynamics, and you’ll find yourself hopping around your music library just to hear what they bring out in your favorite songs. The newer USB-C model also supports lossless audio and ultra low latency thanks to a firmware update, which, technically, isn’t something you’ll find on the last-gen Lightning model.

Apple’s noise cancellation is on par with Sony and Bose, and no one does transparency mode better; at times, it can make you think you’re not wearing headphones at all. Extra features like Spatial Audio (surround sound for movies and TV shows) and automatic switching between Apple gadgets help make it a bit easier to swallow their daunting price.

But the AirPods Max do have faults. The carrying case is abysmal, battery life is only average for the category, and just like regular AirPods, they’re designed with Apple’s ecosystem in mind. It gets much harder to justify dropping $550 on them if you live outside the iPhone and Mac universe.

Stylish, standout designExcellent sound qualitySupports wired USB-C audio

No regular headphone inputDoesn’t include LDAC supportYour ears might get sweaty

Battery life: 30 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: aptX Adaptive, aptX HD, aptX, AAC, SBC / Connectors: USB-C (audio and charging)

If sound quality is priority number one, then Bowers & Wilkins has you covered with the PX7 S2e headphones. They exhibit superb, detailed sound quality that some people prefer to the AirPods Max. The Bowers & Wilkins cans are true to the company’s legacy and style, with a fine-crafted design that exudes quality. And the newer “e” variant has a revamped digital signal processing that can bring out the best audio quality from streaming music.

We prefer their physical buttons over the tap/swipe ear cup gestures of Sony’s WH-1000XM5. With 30 hours of battery life, they’re more than competitive with mainstream, less expensive picks. And the sound profile is delightfully warm and will bring out the most from your favorite music. The main downside of the PX7 S2e is that there’s no traditional 3.5mm or 2.5mm output for a headphone cable. You can still listen wired over USB-C, however.

Much-improved comfortBetter noise cancellation than beforeMarathon 60-hour battery life

Terribly generic designNo more physical button controlsHeadphones can power on unexpectedly

Battery life: 60 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: aptX Adaptive, aptX, AAC, SBC / Connectors: USB-C (audio and charging), 2.5mm headphone jack (audio)

Sixty hours. They can last for up to 60 hours on a single charge. That’s really all you need to know about the Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones if you’re looking for an endurance champ. But they also sound terrific and prove extremely comfortable over long listening periods. This combination doesn’t come cheap, but you can routinely find them for under $300, or, in the case of Black Friday, under $200.

Sennheiser’s Momentum 4 Wireless headphones edge out Bowers & Wilkins on comfort thanks to their lighter design, and the noise cancellation is slightly better. Next to the Sonys and Bose’s QC Ultra Headphones, it doesn’t get much cozier. These are headphones you can wear for multiple hours without any fatigue or pressure on your ears.

Sennheiser’s sound signature is a bit more expressive with more emphasis on bass than the B&W, but the upper treble range still comes through crystal clear. Our only real nitpick with the Sennheisers is that they tend to occasionally power on inside the case and automatically connect for no apparent reason.

Both the B&W and Sennheiser headphones support multipoint connectivity and a range of Bluetooth codecs, including SBC, AAC, aptX, and aptX Adaptive.

Update, January 13th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and several new related links. We also added a mention of the latest QC Ultra Headphones.

            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <div id="article-text">New US dietary guidelines promote more protein and beef tallow, potentially moving Americans further away from a low-carbon diet.

New US dietary guidelines promote more protein and beef tallow, potentially moving Americans further away from a low-carbon diet.

The Trump administration announced last week that it wants Americans to consume more protein, churning out a colorful illustration of an inverted food pyramid that prominently features a big, red steak, a wedge of cheese, and a carton of whole milk at the top and claiming it’s “ending the war on protein.” It may seem like another example of cartoonish propaganda from an administration that essentially runs on memes, but don’t be fooled: It signals a marked turn from previous advice that encouraged Americans to limit high-fat sources of protein like red meat and whole milk for their health, which can incidentally also curb planet-heating pollution from the beef and dairy industries.

“The milk mustache is back,” says an X post from the US Department of Agriculture showing an image of President Donald Trump sporting one while leaning over a glass of milk.

There’s been plenty of debate over how fair it is to judge individual consumers for the carbon footprint of food systems, especially when a person’s choices might be limited. Plus, the environmental impact of what we eat depends a lot on the way industries conduct their business, experts tell The Verge. Besides, the US stopped using the food pyramid as an official guide in 2011, and survey data shows Americans don’t follow federal nutritional recommendations anyway. But if the Trump administration’s new dietary guidelines actually result in real changes to American food production and diets, that could wind up leading to more of the pollution that exacerbates climate change.

“I’m kind of a big believer in it all matters because at the end of the day, it is true that every action matters, and every ton of greenhouse gas omitted or not omitted matters,” says Richard Waite, director for agriculture initiatives at the nonprofit World Resources Institute (WRI).

Waite and his team estimated the hypothetical climate impact of Americans eating more protein in accordance with the updated federal guidelines. The Trump administration raised the recommendation to roughly 1.2–1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (about 0.54–0.73 grams per pound of body weight per day). Already, Americans eat about 1.0–1.3 grams per day — within the lower range of the new recommendations. However, if they moved up to the higher end of that range, that would be about a 25 percent increase in protein consumption.

WRI estimates that such an increase in Americans eating any kind of protein, whether it comes from animal or plant sources, could require up to 100 million acres of additional agricultural land each year, roughly as big as the state of California. The climate impact of that could be equivalent to hundreds of millions of tons of additional carbon dioxide emissions, according to WRI.

Waite is quick to caution that this is a thought experiment. Federal surveys show that American diets don’t align with recommendations for most food groups and nutrients, in part because folks are eating away from home more often, and those meals on the go are typically less nutritious. The cost and availability of healthy foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, can also be a stumbling block.

The environmental impact of a meal varies depending on what sources of protein people eat. Cattle and other hoofed animals with similar digestive systems like sheep and goats are a bigger concern than chicken or plant-based proteins. Protein from meat requires more land for raising animals and growing their feed. Cows have a digestive process that’s less efficient at turning feed into food humans can eat. They also belch methane, a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide even though it’s shorter-lived in the atmosphere.

The climate impact could be equivalent to hundreds of millions of tons of additional carbon dioxide emissions

Fortunately, there are a lot of nuances that are likely to prevent a big rise in greenhouse gas emissions from protein consumption, according to Frank Mitloehner, a professor at the University of California, Davis Department of Animal Science. Americans have actually been eating a lot more chicken recently, while US consumption of beef has been relatively stable over the past decade. And even if the Trump administration is advising people to drink whole milk, it doesn’t necessarily have a larger climate impact than lower-fat alternatives, according to Mitloehner.

The important question to consider, for Mitloehner, is whether herd sizes will grow and agriculture will begin producing more beef and dairy. That’s unlikely in the near term, he says, considering the industry is already struggling to meet existing demand in the US. Heat waves and drought have cut herd sizes, and beef and dairy producers are on alert for potentially devastating screwworm parasites that have already been documented in Mexico near the US border.

“Many of the producers who have left the industry will not come back,” Mitloehner says. “And there’s no international supplier who can just fill that void.”

The number of cattle in the US has reached record-low levels. In part, that reflects big efficiency gains in how much meat and dairy you can produce from a single animal. Fewer than 90 million cattle are needed today to get the same amount of beef produced by 140 million cattle in the 1970s, according to UC Davis. The industry can raise an animal much faster today as a result of genetic and nutritional changes. Certain types of feed can even reduce the amount of methane a cow releases in its belches.

Many ranchers are still working to keep up those gains in efficiency and climate impact, at least in California, Mitloehner says. The Trump administration, on the other hand, is rolling back greenhouse gas pollution regulations and calling any efforts to address the effects of climate change — such as the heat and drought stressing cattle — a “green scam” while trying to bury previous federal research on the issue.

Some scientists and health and environmental advocates also now accuse President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of ignoring a previous scientific panel’s recommendations for the dietary guidelines. An “uncompromised” version of the new guidelines based on the most recent recommendations from the federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) would have advised Americans to “increase intake of beans, peas, lentils, nuts, seeds, and soy products and decrease intake of red and processed meat,” according to a report from the Center for Science in the Public Interest and the Center for Biological Diversity.

The number of cattle in the US has reached record-low levels

The federal guidelines are updated every five years, and reflected most of DGAC’s advice back in 2020. This time around, the Trump administration rejected more than half of DGAC’s 2024 recommendations, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. And several of the panelists involved in crafting this year’s guidelines disclosed financial ties to the beef and dairy industries. The existence of the Trump administration’s new scientific review panel and its industry ties was first reported by Stat News.

“Who selected them, why they were selected, and by what authority is anyone’s guess. [It] raises serious questions,” says Matthew Hayek, an associate professor at New York University’s Department of Environmental Studies. The Trump administration says in its supplementary analysis for the guidelines that “subject matter experts were selected through a federal contracting process based on demonstrated expertise,” a point that it reiterated in an email to The Verge.

The guidelines also reflect RFK’s promotion of cooking with beef tallow, a hallmark of the “Make America Healthy Again” attack on seed oils despite decades of scientific evidence showing the health benefits of cooking with plant-based oils rather than tallow, butter, and lard high in saturated fats. Seed oils have gotten a bad rap because they’re often used in ultra-processed foods, guilt by association that’s added to the growing hype around cooking with beef tallow. The American Heart Association put out a statement last week warning that consuming tallow is linked to higher cardiovascular risk (while also commending the new federal guidelines for advising people to limit highly processed foods and added sugars).

As the Trump administration takes a wrecking ball to federal science institutions and cherry-picks research it uses, Hayek says Americans can still rely on recommendations that are based on scientific consensus from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Heart Association.

While most Americans don’t follow federal nutritional guidelines closely anyway, some big institutions do, Hayek notes, including federal nutrition programs. “If followed by even a few large institutions like our public school systems, [that] will serve to increase the greenhouse gas emissions and potentially decrease the health of American diets,” he says. “Individuals are also a product of the institutions that they engage with every day.”</div>

Sodium-ion batteries are making their way into cars—and the grid

For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. Enter: sodium-ion batteries.

They work much like lithium-ion ones: they store and release energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. Read why it’s poised to become more important to our energy future.

Sodium-ion batteries are one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Take a look at what else made the list.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese companies showcased everything from AI gadgets to household appliances to robots, and the overall mood among them was upbeat. Here’s why.This story was first featured in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter giving you the inside story of what’s going on in AI. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Monday.

At some point this month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial.

The volunteers—who are covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

However, some experts warn the trial is too small, and likely won’t reveal anything useful. Read the full story.

While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains.

By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. And their output encapsulates how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI. Read the full story.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch.

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <h2>Securing digital assets as crypto crime surges</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1129479/securing-digital-assets-as-crypto-crime-surges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2025, cyberattackers thought to be linked to North Korea executed a sophisticated supply chain attack on cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. By targeting its infrastructure and multi-signature security process, hackers managed to steal more than $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum in the largest known digital-asset theft to date.

The ripple effects were felt across the cryptocurrency market, with the price of Bitcoin dropping 20% from its record high in January. And the massive losses put 2025 on track to be the worst year in history for cryptocurrency theft.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins have established themselves as benchmark monetary vehicles, and, despite volatility, their values continue to rise. In October 2025, the value of cryptocurrency and other digital assets topped $4 trillion.

Yet, with this burgeoning value and liquidity comes more attention from cybercriminals and digital thieves. The Bybit attack demonstrates how focused sophisticated attackers are on finding ways to break the security measures that guard the crypto ecosystem, says Charles Guillemet, chief technology officer of Ledger, a provider of secure signer platforms.

”The attackers were very well organized, they have plenty of money, and they are spending a lot of time and resources trying to attack big stuff, because they can,” he says. “In terms of opportunity costs, it&#39;s a big investment, but if at the end they earn $1.4 billion it makes sense to do this investment.”

But it also demonstrates how the crypto threat landscape has pitfalls not just for the unwary but for the tech savvy too. On the one hand, cybercriminals are using techniques like social engineering to target end users. On the other, they are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities to exploit at different points in the cryptocurrency infrastructure.

Historically, owners of digital assets have had to stand against these attackers alone. But now, cybersecurity firms and cryptocurrency-solution providers are offering new solutions, powered by in-depth threat research.

One of the advantages of cryprocurrency is self custody. Users can save their private keys—the critical piece of alphanumeric code that proves ownership and grants full control over digital assets—into either a software or hardware wallet to safeguard it.

But users must put their faith in the security of the wallet technology, and, because the data is the asset, if the keys are lost or forgotten, the value too can be lost.

”If I hack your credit card, what is the issue? You will call your bank, and they will manage to revert the operations,” says Vincent Bouzon, head of the Donjon research team at Ledger. &quot;The problem with crypto is, if something happens, it&#39;s too late. So we must eliminate the possibility of vulnerabilities and give users security.”

Increasingly, attackers are focusing on digital assets known as stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the value of a hard asset, such as gold, or a fiat currency, like the US dollar.

Stablecoins rely on smart contracts—digital contracts stored on blockchain that use pre-set code to manage issuance, maintain value, and enforce rules—that can be vulnerable to different classes of attacks, often taking advantage of users&#39; credulity or lack of awareness about the threats. Post-theft countermeasures, such as freezing the transfer of coins and blacklisting of addresses, can lessen the risk with these kinds of attacks, however.

Software-based wallets, also known as “hot wallets,” which are applications or programs that run on a user’s computer, phone, or web browser, are often a weak link. While their connection to the internet makes them convenient for users, it also makes them more readily accessible to hackers too.

“If you are using a software wallet, by design it&#39;s vulnerable because your keys are stored inside your computer or inside your phone. And unfortunately, a phone or a computer is not designed for security.” says Guillemet.

The rewards for exploiting this kind of vulnerability can be extensive. Hackers who stole credentials in a targeted attack on encrypted password manager application LastPass in 2022 managed to transfer millions worth of cryptocurrency away from victims in the subsequent two or more years.

Even hardware-based wallets, which often resemble USB drives or key fobs and are more secure than their software counterparts since they are completely offline, can have vulnerabilities that a diligent attacker might find and exploit.

Tactics include the use of side-channel attacks, for example, where a cycbercriminal observes a system’s physical side effects, like timing, power, or electromagnetic and acoustic emissions to gain information about the implementation of an algorithm.

Guillemet explains that cybersecurity providers building digital asset solutions, such as wallets, need to help minimize the burden on the users by building security features and providing education about enhancing defense.

For businesses to protect cryptocurrency, tokens, critical documents, or other digital assets, this could be a platform that allows multi-stakeholder custody and governance, supports software and hardware protections, and allows for visibility of assets and transactions through Web3 checks.

As the threat landscape evolves at breakneck speed, in-depth research conducted by attack labs like Ledger Donjon can help security firms keep pace. The team at Ledger Donjon are working to understand how to proactively secure the digital asset ecosystem and set global security standards.

Key projects include the team’s offensive security research, which uses ethical and white hat hackers to simulate attacks and uncover weaknesses in hardware wallets, cryptographic systems, and infrastructure.

In November 2022, the Donjon team discovered a vulnerability in Web3 wallet platform Trust Wallet, which had been acquired by Binance. They found that the seed-phrase generation was not random enough, allowing the team to compute all possible private keys and putting as much as $30 million stored in Trust Wallet accounts at risk, says Bouzon. “The entropy was not high enough, the entropy was only 4 billion. It was huge, but not enough,” he says.

To enhance overall safety there are three key principles that digital-asset protection platforms should apply, says Bouzon. First, security providers should create secure algorithms to generate the seed phrases for private keys and conduct in-depth security audits of the software. Second, users should use hardware wallets with a secure screen instead of software wallets. And finally, any smart contract transaction should include visibility into what is being signed to avoid blind signing attacks.

Ultimately, the responsibility for safeguarding these valuable assets lies on both digital asset solution providers and the users themselves. As the value of cryptocurrencies continues to grow so too will the threat landscape as hackers keep attempting to circumvent new security measures. While digital asset providers, security firms, and wallet solutions must work to build strong and simple protection to support the cryptocurrency ecosystems, users must also seek out the information and education they need to proactively protect themselves and their wallets.

            <div id="article-text">Our reporters and editors constantly debate which emerging technologies will define the future. Once a year, we take stock and share some educated guesses with our readers. Here are the advances that we think will drive progress or incite the most change—for better or worse—in the years ahead.

Sodium-ion batteries, made from abundant materials like salt, are emerging as a cheaper, safer alternative to lithium. Backed by major players and public investment, they’re poised to power grids and affordable EVs worldwide.

AI coding tools are revolutionizing how we write, test, and deploy code, making it easier and faster to build sophisticated websites, games, and other applications than ever before. Just be sure to double-check what they come up with.

Nuclear power already provides steady electricity to grids around the world, without producing any greenhouse-gas emissions. New designs rely on alternative fuels and cooling systems or take up less space, which could get more reactors online faster.

From molten salt to TRISO fuel, here’s how technological advancements could upend an old power technology.

Every day, millions of people interact with AI chatbots. Some of them form what feel like close, personal bonds with the bots. There’s mounting evidence that this can be dangerous, and politicians are finally waking up.

When he was just seven months old, baby KJ became the first person to receive a personalized gene-editing treatment. A clinical trial is now planned, and bespoke gene-editing drugs could be approved within the next few years.

Growing banks of gene information on extinct creatures are providing clues to new treatments and suggesting solutions to climate change—and may help save endangered species.

Nobody knows exactly how large language models work, which means we don’t have a clear idea of their limitations. But that’s changing: Clever research techniques are giving us the best glimpse yet of what’s really going on inside the black box.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

Space tourism may seem fanciful, but this might be the year paying customers can finally check into a room with a galactic view. The shiny new modules will also support research missions by scientists and space agencies.

Screening embryos for genetic diseases is relatively common practice in fertility clinics today, and it can give potential parents some peace of mind. Now, though, new startups are making bold claims about using similar techniques to predict certain traits, including intelligence.

The race for AI supremacy has supercharged data centers. Hyperscale AI data centers pack powerful computer chips into synchronized clusters that work like giant, high-speed supercomputers—sizzling hot, power-hungry behemoths pushing infrastructure to its limits.

            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/lmarena-raises-150m-in-series-a-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.
