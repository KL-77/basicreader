            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/intel-launches-core-ultra-series-3-cpus-made-using-its-long-awaited-18a-process/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel will formally launch its first Core Ultra Series 3 laptop processors later this month, the company announced at its CES keynote today. Codenamed Panther Lake and targeted, at least for now, at high-end ultraportable PCs, the Core Ultra 3 chips will also be the first to use Intel’s 18A manufacturing process, the company’s effort to catch up with the chip manufacturing technology of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC).

The launch will start with 14 chips across 5 product families, which Intel says will be used in “over 200” PC designs. The first of these will be available on January 27th, with others following “throughout the first half of this year.”

We wrote about the basic building blocks of Panther Lake when Intel released details late last year. In many ways the chip is a retreat from the Lunar Lake design, sold as Core Ultra 200V, which used chiplets manufactured mostly outside the company and on-package RAM rather than memory in a DIMM slot or soldered to the mainboard. At the time, Intel said these moves were made in the interest of saving power and extending battery life, as were decisions like removing Hyperthreading support from the P-cores.

The Core Ultra 3 chips pull back on some of these changes, but Intel did say it had used Lunar Lake as its baseline for power efficiency, hopefully ensuring that its improvements won’t come at the expense of battery life.

Like past Core Ultra generations, the Core Ultra 3 chips use a chiplet-based approach, combining several distinct silicon tiles on a foundational “base tile” using Intel’s Foveros packaging technology. The compute tile houses the CPU cores and the neural processing unit (NPU), and it’s the piece that’s built using 18A—there are two version of this tile, one with a maximum of 16 CPU cores and one with 8. The platform controller tile, which handles most I/O, is still being built at TSMC, as is the high-end 12-core version of the graphics tile. A simpler four-core version of the graphics tile is being made using an older Intel 3 process, which to date has mostly been used for Intel’s Xeon server CPUs.

The chiplet-based approach allows Intel to mix-and-match these tiles to offer three distinct iterations of Panther Lake: the 16-core CPU and the 12-core GPU, the 16-core CPU and the 4-core GPU, and the 8-core CPU and the 4-core GPU. Versions of these chips with some CPU and GPU cores switched off fill out the rest of the Core Ultra Series 3 lineup.

Intel is making big performance claims about the highest-end Core Ultra Series 3 processors: up to 60 percent faster multi-core CPU performance compared to the outgoing Core Ultra 200V chips, and up to 77 percent faster integrated GPU performance. Intel also says a “Lenovo IdeaPad reference design” using a Core Ultra X9 388H was able to stream Netflix at 1080p for 27.1 hours, though how battery life shakes out in real-world laptops is going to vary widely based on other specs and settings.

All Panther Lake chips will also include the same neural processing unit (NPU), capable of up to 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS). This puts it well above the 40 TOPS requirement for Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC label, if a bit short of the 60 TOPS that AMD is claiming for its Ryzen AI 400 series and the 80 TOPS that Qualcomm says its Snapdragon X2 chips are capable of. Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, and up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports round out the most important connectivity features.

It remains to be seen whether Core Ultra Series 3 chips are a turning point for Intel’s fortunes or a temporary rebound in between years of missed deadlines (Panther Lake is a month later than Intel said it would be in October, though by its recent standards that isn’t bad). But their launch later this month suggests that the company’s 18A facilities are up and running, opening the door to the kind of third-party chip manufacturing that former CEO Pat Gelsinger began pursuing nearly five years ago.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and other chip companies usually have some kind of news to announce at CES to kick off the year, but some of those announcements are more interesting than others. Sometimes you see new chips with significant speed boosts and other new technologies, and sometimes you get rebranded versions of old silicon meant to fill out a lineup or make an existing architecture seem newer and more exciting than it is.

AMD’s Ryzen CPU announcements this year fall firmly into the latter camp—these are all gently tweaked variants of chips that launched in 2024 and 2025.

Let’s start with the Ryzen AI 400 series. Officially the follow-up to the Ryzen AI 300 chips announced in June 2024, these processors offer some modest clock speed improvements and faster memory support. The new Ryzen AI 9 HX 470 has a peak boost clock speed of 5.2 GHz and support for LPDDR5x-8533, for example, up from 5.1 GHz and LPDDR5x-8000 for the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, and its built-in neural processing unit (NPU) is capable of 60 trillion operations per second (TOPS) rather than 50 TOPS.

But beyond those modest tweaks, Ryzen AI 400 chips are constructed from the same building blocks as Ryzen AI 300. They use a combination of high-performance Zen 5 CPU cores and smaller, more efficient Zen 5c cores, between 4 and 16 integrated GPU cores based on the RDNA 3 GPU architecture, and a 4 nm TSMC manufacturing process.

This isn’t new behavior from AMD. A couple of processor generations ago (and one processor naming scheme ago), the company did the same thing with the Ryzen 8040-series laptop chips, sprucing up the older 7040 series with marginally higher clock speeds and not much else. The upshot is that if you can get a decent discount on a Ryzen AI 300 system because it’s “old,” you can buy it without missing much.

AMD’s additions to the Ryzen AI Max+ 300 lineup are slightly more interesting, at least for gaming laptop and mini PC enthusiasts. These chips power some gaming laptops and a handful of desktop systems, including the Framework Desktop, and their claim to fame is a massive integrated Radeon GPU that can rival the performance of entry-level dedicated graphics cards.

Until now, getting a Ryzen AI Max+ CPU with all 40 of its RDNA 3.5 GPU cores enabled also meant buying a chip with all 16 of its CPU cores enabled. But AMD is adding new Ryzen AI Max+ 392 and 388 models to the lineup, which both have fully enabled GPUs but with partly enabled 12- and 8-core CPUs. The reduced CPU performance shouldn’t hurt game performance much, if at all, and the new models could lead to slightly cheaper options for people who want to maximize graphics performance without paying for extra CPU cores they don’t strictly need.

One side effect of soldiering on with existing architectures in all of these chips, particularly the RDNA 3 graphics architecture, is that none of these integrated GPUs will ever benefit from “FSR Redstone,” the basket of graphics upscaling and frame generation technologies that AMD just announced to try to close the gap between FSR and Nvidia’s competing DLSS features. The Redstone technologies all require hardware only available in the RDNA 4 architecture, which is used only in dedicated Radeon RX 9060 and 9070 series graphics cards. These “new” chips, while still capable of using older FSR versions, will miss out on all those improvements.

Desktop builders and buyers have just a single new socketed AM5 chip to consider: the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, a new 8-core Zen 5 chip with a 64 MB chunk of AMD’s 3D V-Cache. This chip is essentially the Ryzen 7 9800X3D with a clock speed boost—up to 5.6 GHz, compared to 5.2 GHz—and there’s not much else to say about it. Anyone hoping for Zen 6 or a more significant overhaul for the Ryzen desktop CPUs will need to keep waiting—though that may not be such a bad thing right now given today’s skyrocketing RAM and storage prices.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In June, the White House released a budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 that slashed funding for NASA’s science programs by nearly 50 percent. Then, in July, the Trump administration began telling the leaders of dozens of space science missions to prepare “closeout” plans for their spacecraft.

Things looked pretty grim for a while, but then Congress stepped in. Congress, of course, sets the federal government’s budget. In many ways, Congress abdicated authority to the Trump administration last year. But not so, it turns out, with federal spending.

Throughout the summer and fall, as the White House and Congress wrangled over various issues, lawmakers made it clear they intended to fund most of NASA’s science portfolio. Preliminary efforts to shut down active missions were put on hold.

On Monday, Congress made good on those promises, releasing a $24.4 billion budget plan for NASA as part of the conferencing process, when House and Senate lawmakers convene to hammer out a final budget. The result is a budget that calls for just a 1 percent cut in NASA’s science funding, to $7.25 billion, for fiscal year 2026.

“This is, frankly, better than I could have expected,” said Casey Dreier, chief of space policy for The Planetary Society, which argued against the cuts. “There’s very little to not like in this.”

The new budget will not undo the significant cuts to NASA’s workforce through a voluntary buyout program in 2025, or other efforts by the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency to reduce headcounts across the federal government.

Dreier also lamented the many wasted hours spent planning by scientists and engineers to comply with the Trump White House’s budget proposal.

“Those hours could have been spent running and analyzing data from these valuable missions,” Dreier said. “It created a lot of needless friction and churn at a time when NASA is being told it must remain competitive with China and other nations in space.”

The House of Representatives could vote on the budget bill for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies as soon as this week, with the US Senate possibly following next week. It is expected that President Trump will sign the bill. It would then go into effect immediately for the current fiscal year, which began on October 1.

The biggest casualty in the NASA science budget is the Mars Sample Return mission, a NASA-led effort to return Martian rocks and soil for study in Earth-based laboratories.

“As proposed in the budget, the agreement does not support the existing Mars Sample Return (MSR) program,” the budget document states. “However, the technological capabilities being developed in the MSR program are not only critical to the success of future science missions but also to human exploration of the Moon and Mars.”

Although it offers no details, the budget provides $110 million for something called the “Mars Future Missions” program to support “radar, spectroscopy, entry, descent, and landing systems.”

NASA previously said it was pausing the ambitious sample return mission because its projected cost was approximately $10 billion, with no certain return date for the samples.

Now it seems likely that the agency and its new administrator, Jared Isaacman, will have to develop a new strategy. This may include sending humans to Mars, rather than bringing Martian rocks back to Earth.

Unlike the Trump budget request, the science budget also keeps future missions, such as the DAVINCI probe for Venus, alive. It also provides $10 million to continue studying the development of a Uranus orbiter, as well as $150 million for a flagship telescope to search for signs of life on nearby, Earth-like planets called the Habitable Worlds Observatory.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., federal health officials on Monday announced a sweeping and unprecedented overhaul of federal vaccine recommendations, abruptly paring down recommended immunizations for children from 17 to 11.

Officials claimed the rationale for the change was to align US vaccine recommendations more closely with those of other high-income countries, namely Denmark, a small, far less diverse country of around 6 million people (smaller than the population of New York City) that has universal health care. The officials also claim the change is necessary to address the decline in public trust in vaccinations, which has been driven by anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy.

“This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a statement.

Health experts disagree. “Kennedy’s decision will harm and kill children, like all of his anti-vaccination decisions will,” virologist James Alwine, who works with the organization Defend Public Health, said in a statement.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, a vocal critic of Kennedy, blasted the changes, saying “to arbitrarily stop recommending numerous routine childhood immunizations is dangerous and unnecessary,” AAP President Andrew Racine said. “The United States is not Denmark,” he added.

Under the new federal recommendations, universally recommended immunizations are pared down to these 11 diseases: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus (HPV), and varicella (chickenpox).

Immunizations against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY, and meningococcal B are now only recommended for “high risk” groups. (Immunization against dengue was previously only recommended for certain groups.)

Parents may choose through “shared clinical decision-making” to vaccinate their children against rotavirus, COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B.

The American Medical Association criticized the changes and the way in which they were made—unilaterally, without transparency, and without scientific rigor.&quot;Changes of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision,” Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, an AMA Trustee, said in a statement.

In a US health department announcement, CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz noted that “All vaccines currently recommended by CDC will remain covered by insurance without cost sharing. No family will lose access.”

But health experts fear the confusion and distrust created by the abrupt and ideology-based changes will only lead more Americans to delay or decline vaccinating their children.

The country is already seeing surges in vaccine-preventable diseases amid a nationwide slide in childhood vaccination, particularly with outbreaks of whooping cough and measles. The US is on track to lose its measles elimination status this month.</div>

            <h2>The nation’s strictest privacy law just took effect, to data brokers’ chagrin</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/data-broker-hoarding-is-rampant-new-law-lets-consumers-fight-back/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Californians are getting a new, supercharged way to stop data brokers from hoarding and selling their personal information, as a recently enacted law that’s among the strictest in the nation took effect at the beginning of the year.

According to the California Privacy Protection Agency, more than 500 companies actively scour all sorts of sources for scraps of information about individuals, then package and store it to sell to marketers, private investigators, and others.

The nonprofit Consumer Watchdog said in 2024 that brokers trawl automakers, tech companies, junk-food restaurants, device makers, and others for financial info, purchases, family situations, eating, exercising, travel, entertainment habits, and just about any other imaginable information belonging to millions of people.

Two years ago, California’s Delete Act took effect. It required data brokers to provide residents with a means to obtain a copy of all data pertaining to them and to demand that such information be deleted. Unfortunately, Consumer Watchdog found that only 1 percent of Californians exercised these rights in the first 12 months after the law went into effect. A chief reason: Residents were required to file a separate demand with each broker. With hundreds of companies selling data, the burden was too onerous for most residents to take on.

On January 1, a new law known as DROP (Delete Request and Opt-out Platform) took effect. DROP allows California residents to register a single demand for their data to be deleted and no longer collected in the future. CalPrivacy then forwards it to all brokers.

Starting in August, brokers will have 45 days after receiving the notice to report the status of each deletion request. If any of the brokers’ records match the information in the demand, all associated data—including inferences—must be deleted unless legal exemptions such as information provided during one-to-one interactions between the individual and the broker apply. To use DROP, individuals must first prove they’re a California resident.

I used the DROP website and found the flow flawless and the interface intuitive. After I provided proof of residency, the site prompted me to enter personal information such as any names and email addresses I use, and specific information such as VIN (vehicle identification numbers) and advertising IDs from phones, TVs, and other devices. It required about 15 minutes to complete the form, but most of that time was spent pulling that data from disparate locations, many buried in system settings.

It initially felt counterintuitive to provide such a wealth of personal information to ensure that data is no longer tracked. As I thought about it more, I realized that all that data is already compromised as it sits in online databases, which are often easily hacked and, of course, readily available for sale. What’s more, CalPrivacy promises to use the data solely for data deletion. Under the circumstances, enrolling was a no-brainer.

It’s unfortunate that the law is binding only in California. As the scourge of data-broker information hoarding and hacks on their databases continues, it would not be surprising to see other states follow California’s lead.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The primary domain of Shadow library Anna’s Archive was taken offline, with annas-archive.org being put under the serverHold status. While Anna’s Archive recently made waves with a massive “backup” of Spotify, the shadow library’s operator said the music pirating doesn’t appear to be connected to the .org domain suspension. Anna’s Archive remains available at several other domains.

Anna’s Archive launched in 2022 in response to the US Department of Justice seizure of domains used by e-book pirate site Z-Library. Acting as a shadow library and a search engine for other shadow libraries, Anna’s Archive aims to archive books and other written materials and make them widely available via torrents. Its data sets have also been heavily used by AI companies to train large language models.

In addition to mirroring shadow libraries such as Sci-Hub, Library Genesis, and Z-Library, Anna’s Archive made a major move into music pirating two weeks ago with an announcement that it scraped Spotify and made a 300TB copy of the most streamed songs. Despite that development, the person behind Anna’s Archive said the domain suspension doesn’t seem to be related to the Spotify scraping.

“The .org domain apparently has been suspended,” Anna’s Archive said in a post on Reddit yesterday. “Our other domains work fine, and we’ve added some more. We recommend checking our Wikipedia page for the latest domains. This unfortunately happens to shadow libraries on a regular basis. We don’t believe this has to do with our Spotify backup.” The Reddit post ended with a request for donations.

The serverHold designation is a status code set by the domain’s registry operator and means the “domain is not activated in the DNS,” according to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

As TorrentFreak writes, “It is rare to see a .org domain involved in domain name suspensions. The American non-profit Public Interest Registry (PIR), which oversees the .org domains, previously refused to suspend domain names voluntarily, including thepiratebay.org. The registry’s cautionary stance suggests that the actions against annas-archive.org are backed by a court order.”

A spokesperson for the Public Interest Registry told Ars that “PIR is unable to comment on the situation at this time.”

Anna’s Archive’s domain registrar is Tucows. A Tucows spokesperson told Ars that “server-type statuses can only be set by the registry (PIR, in this case).” Tucows also said it doesn’t have any information on what led to the Anna’s Archive serverHold. “PIR has not contacted us about it and we were unaware of the status before you alerted us to it,” a Tucows spokesperson said.

After last month’s Spotify incident, Spotify told Ars that it “identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping” and “implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks.” We asked Spotify today if it has taken any additional steps against Anna’s Archive and will update this article if it provides a response.

Anna’s Archive is also facing a lawsuit from OCLC, a nonprofit that operates the WorldCat library catalog on behalf of member libraries. The lawsuit alleges that Anna’s Archive “illegally hacked WorldCat.org” to steal 2.2TB of data.

An OCLC motion for default judgment filed in November asked for a permanent injunction prohibiting Anna’s Archive from scraping or distributing WorldCat data and requiring Anna’s Archive to delete all its copies of WorldCat data. OCLC said it hopes such a judgment would compel web hosting services to take action.

“OCLC hopes to take the judgment to website hosting services so that OCLC’s WorldCat data will be removed from Anna’s Archive’s websites,” said the November 17 motion filed in US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The court has not yet ruled on the motion.</div>

            <h2>That Video of Happy Crying Venezuelans After Maduro’s Kidnapping? It’s AI Slop</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-05</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the wake of the deadly attack on Venezuela and kidnapping of president Nicolás Maduro by the United States, netizens looking to manufacture support for the strikes have found a friend in generative AI.

Since the kidnapping, people in the West have been fiercely debating who should control the narrative about the military action. By many accounts, those most impacted by the attacks — Venezuelans living and working in Venezuela — are resolutely opposed to the strikes, with thousands mobilizing in numerous Venezuelan cities in protest. (The death toll from the US strikes currently stands at 80 soldiers and civilians, a figure whichwill likely go up as the dust settles.)

Though the attacks are still too recent to get accurate polling data of the country’s sentiments, a November survey found that 86 percent of Venezuelans preferred for Maduro to remain head of state to resolve the country’s economic woes. Only 8 percent favored the far-right opposition party, which has support from US president Donald Trump. Even many Venezuelans who oppose Maduro are also opposed to the United States’ incursion to oust him.

Yet if you ask American Trump supporters, Venezuelans are actually thrilled about the invasion. Their evidence: good ol’ AI slop.

In a post with over five million views on X-formerly-Twitter, the account Wall Street Apes shared a minute-long video of what are supposed to be Venezuelan citizens crying tears of joy over the attacks. Of course, as anyone versed in the visual language of gen AI will quickly notice, the video is a compilation of low-quality AI clips.

“The people cry for their freedom, thanks to the United States for freeing us,” the video’s AI narrator exclaims. “The hero, thank you Donald Trump.”

“I’m so jealous,” a US-run account with nearly 140,000 followers replied under the clip. “I want the same freedom and the same joy for Iran and the Iranian people.”

Shooting back at the mega-viral post, critics warned that the AI slop augurs a frightening new era of misinformation.

“The US empire’s war propaganda is getting much more sophisticated,” wrote geopolitical analyst Ben Norton. “You can bet the US government will use AI to try to justify its many more imperialist wars of aggression.”

Sure enough, plenty more AI generated misinformation has surfaced following the attacks, spread by conservative politicians like Vince Lago, mayor of Coral Gables, Florida. In some cases, AI generated images of Maduro in various US custody centers began to circulate in the hours immediately after his kidnapping — and well before authentic images were released by the Trump administration.

As Mexican political journalist José Luis Granados Ceja observed, the AI slop follows decades of efforts by the US government and media to manufacture consent among the western masses for intervention in the oil-rich South American state.

“In 2002, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez was briefly ousted in what came to be called the ‘world’s first media coup’ where the lies said on TV paved the road,” Ceja wrote in response to the AI propaganda. “It shouldn’t be a surprise then that in 2025 new tech and fake AI videos are being used toward similar ends.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Surprise! A public policy initiative panned by drivers and pro-car pundits turned out to instead be a roaring success that improved traffic congestion, road safety, and even reduced pollution — a godsend not just for those living in Manhattan, but for transit riders, drivers, and outer-borough residents.

Congestion pricing is a policy which charges drivers a toll of up to $9 for using surface-roads below Manhattan’s 60th street, an area known as the Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ), which is enforced by over 1,400 license-plate cameras.

Critics, including president Donald Trump, assailed the program during the runup period, but after a full year of congestion pricing, the New York Times reports massive wins for people living in Manhattan and beyond.

Since the CRZ went into effect on January 5, 2025, the NYT reports an 11 percent decrease in daily vehicle traffic throughout the borough’s central business district. In real terms, that comes out to about 73,000 fewer vehicles per day, or 27 million fewer trips than expected in the program’s first year alone.

As a result, those who do drive or use surface-level transit like buses experience much less traffic. Over the past year, average travel speeds increased 4.5 percent in the congestion zone, while the rest of New York City experienced a 1.4 percent increase. Local bus speeds are also up noticeably, increasing 2.4 percent in the CRZ, and 0.8 percent throughout the rest of the city.

The gains haven’t just been about convenience, either. The reduced volume of cars has led to marked improvements in pollution and traffic safety for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. It also raised more than half a billion dollars for the city’s beleaguered public transportation system.

“It turns out that mostly when people say ‘New York is noisy’ they really mean ‘cars are noisy,&#39;” Grant Louis of Manhattan told the NYT.

And even the commuters who criticized the program are gaining back untold hours of their life that would have otherwise been spent in traffic. Those who trudge into the city via the Lincoln Tunnel, for example, saw travel speeds increase by an average of almost 25 percent, while average speeds in the Holland tunnel were 51 percent faster compared to pre-congestion data.

Even outside of New York City, people noticed a marked difference in vehicular traffic, confirming earlier studies which found positive run-off effects in surrounding communities.

“I supercommute weekly from Kingston by bus,” resident Rob Bellinger told the paper. “Each week, my bus round trip is 30-60 minutes faster than it was before congestion pricing.”

The implications are clear for other busy metropolitan areas: even gently discouraging unnecessary automotive traffic can have immense benefits for a city’s wellbeing.

            <h2>Google’s AI Overviews Caught Giving Dangerous “Health” Advice</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-05</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In May 2024, Google threw caution to the wind by rolling out its controversial AI Overviews feature in a purported effort to make information easier to find.

But the AI hallucinations that followed — like telling users to eat rocks and put glue on their pizzas — ended up perfectly illustrated the persistent issues that plague large language model-based tools to this day.

And while not being able to reliably tell what year it is or making up explanations for nonexistent idioms might sound like innocent gaffes that at most lead to user frustration, some advice Google’s AI Overviews feature is offering up could have far more serious consequences

In a new investigation, The Guardian found that the tool’s AI-powered summaries are loaded with inaccurate health information that could put people at risk. Experts warn that it’s only a matter of time until the bad advice endangers users — or, in a worst-case scenario, results in someone’s death.

The issue is severe. For instance, The Guardian found that it advised those with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods, despite doctors recommending the exact opposite. It also completely bungled information about women’s cancer tests, which could lead to people ignoring real symptoms of the disease.

It’s a precarious situation as those who are vulnerable and suffering often turn to self-diagnosis on the internet for answers.

“People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis,” end-of-life charity Marie Curie director of digital Stephanie Parker told The Guardian. “If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”

Others were alarmed by the feature turning up completely different responses to the same prompts, a well-documented shortcoming of large language model-based tools that can lead to confusion.

Mental health charity Mind’s head of information, Stephen Buckle, told the newspaper that AI Overviews offered “very dangerous advice” about eating disorders and psychosis, summaries that were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help.”

A Google spokesperson told The Guardian in a statement that the tech giant invests “significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”

But given the results of the newspaper’s investigation, the company has a lot of work left to ensure that its AI tool isn’t dispensing dangerous health misinformation.

The risks could continue to grow. According to an April 2025 survey by the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center, nearly eight in ten adults said they’re likely to go online for answers about health symptoms and conditions. Nearly two-thirds of them found AI-generated results to be “somewhat or very reliable,” indicating a considerable — and troubling — level of trust.

At the same time, just under half of respondents said they were uncomfortable with healthcare providers using AI to make decisions about their care.

A separate MIT study found that participants deemed low-accuracy AI-generated responses “valid, trustworthy, and complete/satisfactory” and even “indicated a high tendency to follow the potentially harmful medical advice and incorrectly seek unnecessary medical attention as a result of the response provided.”

That’s despite AI models continuing to prove themselves as strikingly poor replacements for human medical professionals.

Meanwhile, doctors have the daunting task of dispelling myths and trying to keep patients from being led down the wrong path by a hallucinating AI.

On its website, the Canadian Medical Association calls AI-generated health advice “dangerous,” pointing out that hallucinations, as well as algorithmic biases and outdated facts, can “mislead you and potentially harm your health” if they choose to follow the generated advice.

Experts continue to advise people to consult human doctors and other licensed healthcare professionals instead of AI, a tragically tall ask given the many barriers to adequate care around the world.

At least AI Overviews sometimes appears to be aware of its own shortcomings. When queried if it should be trusted for health advice, the feature happily pointed us to The Guardian‘s investigation.

“A Guardian investigation has found that Google’s AI Overviews have displayed false and misleading health information that could put people at risk of harm,” read the AI Overviews’ reply.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi have long garnered a reputation for facilitating cheating and insider trading — allowing an athlete, for instance, to place a bet on a game they could then lose on purpose.

Now there’s compelling evidence that someone with inside information about the Trump administration’s regime change plans in Venezuela used that foreknowledge to profit massively from the conflict.

As spotted by researcher Tyson Brody, an unidentified user bet tens of thousands of dollars on various predictions that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro would be imminently “out” or that the US forces would show up “in Venezuela by” a specified date during the runup to the incursion.

The account “existed for only one week and quickly became the biggest ‘yes’ holder in the Maduro out market,” Brody tweeted.

The evidence of insider trading is compelling, to say the least, given the highly suspicious timing. The account invested over $30,000 less than two days before the United States launched its invasion to kidnap Maduro and his wife and “profited $400,000 in less than 24 hours,” as sports entrepreneur Joe Pompliano calculated in a post on Bluesky.

“Seems pretty suspicious!” he added. “[Secretary of defense] Pete Hegseth making some beer money on the side?” Brody joked.

“Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged,” Pompliano argued.

Who was behind the Polymarket account remains a mystery. Accounts on markets like Polymarket are anonymous, and payouts are in cryptocurrency, making them hard to track.

As Semafor reported over the weekend, news organizations also had early intel of the US raid on Venezuela, but held off publishing the information so as not to put US troops in danger.

In other words, could it have been an insider at a New York or Washington newsroom who was trying to make a buck — or was it an operative inside the Trump administration?

Prediction markets have long raised concerns over exactly these types of situations. Case in point, one Polymarket user made $1 million in 24 hours in early December after betting on Google’s 2025 Year in Search rankings. Per Forbes, the account had a “near-perfect record of 22 correct predictions out of 23 attempts.”

As The American Prospect points out, critics of the Trump administration have long accused officials of dabbling in similar behavior. The administration has also allowed the prediction market to flourish by dropping enforcement cases in the crypto world and failing to introduce meaningful regulations.

Even Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which owns the president’s social network, Truth Social, entered the prediction markets business last year, showing a pointed appetite for the space.

“Of course insiders shouldn’t be able to get rich off of policy decisions — but even more concerning is the possibility that people are skewing policy outcomes in order to make their bets pay off,” Demand Progress executive director Sean Vitka told The American Prospect.

One thing’s for sure: while insiders profit, those without that privileged information lose out — and when the bets are on a deadly conflict, innocent people stand to suffer as well.

“And questions related to whether or not, and when, military action might be undertaken are especially vulnerable to such manipulation because the president frequently moves with discretion over the timing and (legally or not) without notice to the public or Congress,” Vitka added.

            <h2>Elon Musk After His Grok AI Did Disgusting Things to Literal Children: “Way Funnier”</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/elon-comment-grok-children">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok began fielding an influx of stunningly inappropriate requests. Though the AI has long been known to have loose guardrails, users suddenly swarmed the AI to generate either nudes or sexually charged images of X users based on photos they posted to the site — and it obliged. Even worse, some of the individuals it took requests for appeared to be minors. The trend was so prolific that AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated the bot was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute.

Equally stunning is that the chatbot’s maker, xAI, has remained silent on the issue, despite it gaining international attention in news media and on X, where the bot operates. So has owner and CEO Musk — except for one instance in which he completely failed to meet the gravity of the situation.

“Grok’s viral image moment has arrived, it’s a little different than the Ghibli one was though,” one writer who covers AI euphemistically observed in a tweet.

For the most part, the only acknowledgment of wrongdoing has come from Grok itself, including in one widely seen post where it issued an “apology” — an output that many media outlets interpreted as Grok speaking for xAI.

“Dear Community, I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user’s prompt,” it wrote. “This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on CSAM.”

“It was a failure in safeguards,” it added, “and I’m sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.”

In another tweet spotted by Ars Technica, Grok acknowledged the gravely inappropriate requests using a royal “we.”

Responding to a user who had spent the past few days flagging the issue to Grok, the chatbot wrote: “We appreciate you raising this. As noted, we’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them — CSAM is illegal and prohibited.”

“xAI is committed to preventing such issues,” Grok added.

It’s worth noting that these apologies and avowals of fixing the issue are almost certainly complete hokum from Grok. The fact that it’s freely generating such morally reprehensible — not to mention likely illegal — images indicates that it’s at heart designed to be highly compliant to virtually any request; in this case, the expression of contrition was responding to a prompt asking it to “write a heartfelt apology note.”

Nonetheless, it’s both alarming and cowardly that Grok’s writeups are the only acknowledgement we’re getting. Seemingly no one at xAI, Musk included, is brave enough to face the music. xAI rarely addresses the bad behavior of its chief product, but has done so on a handful of occasions in the past, including when Grok infamously began ranting about “white genocide,” a racist conspiracy theory, in response to completely unrelated posts all across the site.

Some of the recent posts, and especially the ones that involved minors, have been removed, with some of the users who made the requests receiving suspensions. But why Grok allowed the generation of these images at all is unclear. One user who is known for stress-testing the chatbot — and was behind the revelation that Grok would be willing to annihilate all Jewish people and kill a billion children — opined that its guardrails were “deliberately” lowered, noting that requests that were once refused were now being accepted.

            <div id="article-text">Last week, news emerged that NASA’s largest library at its iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GFSC) in Maryland was being shut down.

The optics — especially considering the wider context of the Trump administration’s nakedly anti-science vision for the future of the agency and the shuttering of over a dozen buildings at the center — were bad, to say the least.

At least 13 buildings at Goddard, as well as more than 100 labs, are set to have been shut by March of this year, a major downscaling effort that highlights the Trump administration’s desire to slash NASA’s science budget by more than half in its proposed 2026 fiscal year budget. (The exact budget is still being actively debated, despite already being three months into NASA’s fiscal year.)

NASA insiders are dismayed at the situation playing out at GSFC, arguing that the library was an extremely important resource that’s being unjustifiably wiped out.

“I have a hard time imagining a research center of the high quality that Goddard is, or any center at NASA, how they will operate without a library, without a central collection,” planetary scientist David Williams, who has curated space mission data for NASA’s archives, told NBC News.

“It’s not like we’re so much smarter now than we were in the past,” he told the NYT. “It’s the same people, and they make the same kind of human errors. If you lose that history, you are going to make the same mistakes again.”

In some ways, others have pointed out, it’s business as usual for a large government bureaucracy.

“NASA has been closing its libraries for a long time,” Keith Cowing, a former NASA astrobiologist who now blogs about the agency at NASA Watch, wrote in a recent post. “Budgetary and building issues are usually the prime reason. Usually, stuff gets moved around and put in storage for years until the storage costs mount and then a portion ends up in someone’s library — somewhere — and the rest gets shipped to some generic [General Services Administration] warehouse — or thrown.”

But the process is agonizing, and important records can be lost through carelessness or error.

“Now it is GSFC’s turn to go through this painful process,” he added.

Officials have cried foul, arguing that plans for shutting the GSFC library existed long before Trump took office last year.

Recently sworn-in NASA administrator Jared Isaacman, for instance, insisted on a thread on X-formerly-Twitter that the move was “part of a long-planned facilities consolidation approved in 2022 under the previous administration.” And NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens described it as a “consolidation, not a closure.”

Isaacman also took issue with the New York Times‘ framing of the story, accusing the newspaper that its reporting on the matter did not “fully reflect the context NASA shared,” arguing that “at no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials, and that framing has led to several other misleading headlines.”

He also pointed out that “NASA researchers will continue to have access to the scientific information and resources they need to do their work.”

However, as a NASA spokesperson claimed in a statement to the NYT — which Isaacman quoted himself on X — “some material would be stored in a government warehouse while the rest would be tossed away” following a careful 60-day review.

Isaacman later admitted that he doesn’t “dispute that, after a deliberate review, some materials with no historical or technical value may not be retained” following an “evaluation by an on-site NASA team over a 60-day period.”

In short, there’s clearly some nuance to NASA’s plans — but given the broader political context, the shocked reactions by current and former NASA staffers shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. The Trump administration has indicated that it’s looking to shut down dozens of important science missions as part of its planned 2026 budget, the agency’s biggest budget cut in its 66-year history, if it were to pass.

The administration has also slashed budgets for other important and lifesaving scientific research as part of what’s being characterized as a broader “war on science.”

The Trump administration’s motivations for shutting down over a dozen buildings at the GSFC are a little murky. The 2022 master plan Isaacman was referring to lists “meet affordability goals” as one of its three top long-term priorities, while maintaining “mission capability” and creating a “vision” for “GSFC campuses of the future.”

Futurism has reached out to NASA for a more detailed budget breakdown and how much the agency is hoping to save through its “consolidation” efforts.

Isaacman argued that the public discourse surrounding the plans was “unfortunate at a time when the world should be energized by a plan to send NASA astronauts farther into space than ever before, return us to the lunar environment with a commitment to stay, alongside historic investments in an orbital economy and a renewed pursuit of science and discovery.”

But insiders aren’t nearly as optimistic, arguing that shutting the GSFC library would be an immense loss and could make the lives of researchers needlessly difficult.

“We want to restore the data so that it can be used, and in order to restore the data, we need to know, like I said, how the instruments worked, how they were calibrated,” Williams told NBC. “And that information is all over the place and you have to gather it. And, really, the library is one of the main resources for me and people in the future.”

While responding to Isaacman on X, spaceflight engineering expert Dennis Wingo, who has advised NASA as a subject matter expert for decades, argued that the risks of losing important historical records are immense.

“As one who has personally saved and restored NASA data, there is much more to this than you are being told,” Wingo tweeted.

“While what you are saying is the party line, that is not how it works in actuality,” he added, referencing the closing of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center-funded Redstone Science and Information Center in 2019.

After Isaacman once again doubled down in response to Wingo, taking “exception” to “the mischaracterization of this process and its politicization to suggest the current administration is engaging in some sort of book burning,” Wingo remained unconvinced.

“Libraries and archives around the world are being ‘consolidated’ out of existence,” he wrote. “I can tell you for an absolute fact that many of the people making the determinations on what is historically valuable or not are not qualified to do so.”

“I have personally seen this happen multiple times over the past 35 years,” Wingo added.

In the early 2000s, Wingo and NASA Watch’s Cowing discovered tapes in a remote warehouse of NASA’s Lunar Orbiter spacecraft missions in the late 1960s, which, per Cowing, NASA “wanted to get rid of.”

“We drove the tapes up to NASA Ames in two large rental trucks and assembled a team of retirees and college kids to bring the data back from the past at resolutions simply impossible to achieve back in the day,” Cowing recalled in his latest blog post.

“I urge you to not allow the dumpsterization of our scientific history,” Wingo concluded in his plea to Isaacman.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/narwal-adds-ai-to-its-vacuum-cleaners-to-monitor-pets-and-find-jewelry/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Robot vacuum maker Narwal unveiled its new set of smart vacuum cleaners at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) with AI-powered features such as monitoring pets, finding valuable objects, and notifying users about misplaced toys.

The company said that its new flagship Flow 2 robot vacuum has a rounded design and easy-lift tanks for better cleaning. The device uses two 1080p RGB cameras with a 136-degree field of view to map out the area and recognize different kinds of objects using AI models.

Narwal said that through this tech stack, the vacuum cleaner has the ability to identify an unlimited number of objects. The device first tries to identify an object locally, but in case there are no matches, it sends the data to the cloud for further processing.

The Flow 2 has three key modes called pet care mode, baby care mode, and AI floor tag mode. With pet care mode, you can define zones where pets usually rest or hang out to clean them. Plus, it can monitor pets and also check in on your pets via two-way audio (there is no guarantee that they would listen to you, though). In the baby care mode, the vacuum switches to quiet mode near the crib and notifies you of misplaced toys. In the AI floor tag mode, the vacuum recognizes valuable items like jewelry, avoids them, and alerts you.

Narwal said that its newest vacuum cleaner has four cleaning modes that can identify different types of dirt. The device can also return to its base to wash the mop and then re-mop a certain area if it is dirty. The company noted that the Flow 2’s design allows for a higher hot water washing temperature for better cleaning.

Along with the Flow 2, the company also showed off a handheld vacuum called the U50 that weighs 1.41kg (3.1 lbs) and has UV-C sterilization along with heat treatment for allergen removal. The company also demoed an unnamed cordless vacuum with a slim design, 360-degree swivel, and up to 50 minutes of run time. The cordless vacuum also has an auto-empty station that can support up to 60 days of dust disposal.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su kicked off her keynote at CES 2026 with a message about what compute could deliver: AI for everyone.

As part of that promise, AMD announced a new line of AI processors as the company thinks AI-powered personal computers are the way of the future.

The semiconductor giant revealed AMD Ryzen AI 400 Series processor, its latest version of its AI-powered PC chips, at the yearly CES conference on Monday. The company says the latest version of its Ryzen processor series allows for 1.3x faster multitasking than its competitors and are 1.7x times faster at content creation.

These new chips feature 12 CPU Cores, individual processing units inside a core processor, and 24 threads, independent streams of instruction

This is an upgrade to the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor that was announced in 2024. AMD started producing the Ryzen processor series in 2017.

Rahul Tikoo, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s client business, said AMD has expanded to over 250 AI PC platforms on the company’s recent press briefing. That represents a growth 2x over the last year, he added.

“In the years ahead, AI is going to be a multi-layered fabric that gets woven into every level of computing at the personal layer,” Tikoo said. “Our AI PCs and devices will transform how we work, how we play, how we create and how we connect with each other.”

AMD also announced the release of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the latest version of its gaming-focused processor.

“No matter who you are and how you use technology on a daily basis, AI is reshaping everyday computing,” Tikoo said. “You have thousands of interactions with your PC every day. AI is able to understand, learn context, bring automation, provide deep reasoning and personal customization to every individual.”

PCs that include either the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D processor become available in the first quarter of 2026.

The company also announced the latest version of its Redstone ray tracing technology, which simulates physical behavior of light, which allows for better video game graphics without a performance or speed lag.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/insight-partners-sued-by-former-vice-president-kate-lowry/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Kate Lowry, a former vice president at Insight Partners, is suing the firm, alleging disability discrimination, gender discrimination, and wrongful termination, according to a suit filed on December 30 in San Mateo County, California, and seen by TechCrunch.   Insight Partners did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Lowry told TechCrunch she filed the suit because she believes “too many powerful, wealthy people in venture act like it’s OK to break the law and systemically underpay and abuse their employees.”

“It’s an oppressive system that reflect[s] broader trends in society that use fear, intimidation, and power to silence and isolate truth. I’m trying to change that.”

Lowry began working at Insight Partners in 2022, after previously working for Meta, McKinsey & Company, and an early-stage startup. The suit alleges that, upon being hired, she was assigned to a different supervisor than the person mentioned during her interview.

She alleges in the suit that she was told by her new supervisor, who was a woman, to be “online all the time, including PTO, holidays, and weekends,” and to respond between “6 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily.”

Lowry says in the suit that this first supervisor “berated, hazed, and antagonized” her, spoke openly about a hazing that would be “longer and more intense” than what she put other male reports through.

Some comments the supervisor allegedly made, according to the suit, include “you are incompetent, shut up and take notes” and “you need to obey me like a dog; do whatever I say whenever I say it, without speaking.”  Lowry also alleges that her supervisor assigned her “redundant tasks” and restricted her ability to participate in calls, while allowing less experienced male colleagues to do so. Lowry, instead, she alleges, was relegated to “administrative tasks such as note-taking and cataloging.”

Lowry said she became “increasingly ill” because of the work environment and that her physician advised a medical leave of absence, which she was granted and took from February to July 2023.

When she returned to work, she was placed on a new team and, the suit alleges, was told by the head of human resources that “if the new team did not like her, she would be fired.”

In September 2023, Lowry said she got a concussion and took another medical leave and returned to work near the end of 2024. Due to some departures, she was placed under the supervision of a new person, where Lowry said her poor treatment continued. She also alleges that in 2024, her compensation was about 30% below the market.

By April 2025, she alleges she was told her compensation would be cut. In May of 2025, through her attorneys, Lowry sent a letter to Insight regarding her alleged treatment by the company. A week later, the firm terminated her employment, the suit states.

The lawsuit is reminiscent of Ellen Pao’s suit against Kleiner Perkins back in 2012, in which she alleged discrimination and retaliation. That suit offered what was, at the time, a rare glimpse into how women partners felt they were treated in venture capital. Though Pao lost that suit, it sent waves through the industry, and other women went on to sue major tech companies.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/microsofts-nadella-wants-us-to-stop-thinking-of-ai-as-slop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A couple of weeks after Merriam-Webster named “slop” as its word of the year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella weighed in on what to expect from AI in 2026.

In his classic, intellectual style, Nadella wrote on his personal blog that he wants us to stop thinking of AI as “slop” and start thinking of it as “bicycles for the mind.”

He wrote, “A new concept that evolves ‘bicycles for the mind’ such that we always think of AI as a scaffolding for human potential vs a substitute.”

He continued: “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind’ that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.”

If you parse through those syllables, you may see that he’s not only urging everyone to stop thinking of AI-generated content as slop, but also wants the tech industry to stop talking about AI as a replacement for humans. He hopes the industry will start talking about it as a human-helper productivity tool instead.

Here’s the problem with that framing, though: Much of AI agent marketing uses the idea of replacing human labor as a way to price it, and justify its expense.

Meanwhile, some of the biggest names in AI have been sounding the alarm that the tech will soon cause very high levels of human unemployment. For instance, in May Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could take away half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, raising unemployment to 10-20% over the next five years, and he doubled down on that last month in an interview on 60 Minutes.

Yet we currently don’t know how true such doomsday stats are. As Nadella implies, most AI tools today don’t replace workers, they are used by them (as long as the human doesn’t mind checking the AI’s work for accuracy).

One oft-cited research study is MIT’s ongoing Project Iceberg, which seeks to measure the economic impact on jobs as AI enters the workforce. Project Iceberg estimates that AI is currently capable of performing about 11.7% of human paid labor.

While this has been widely reported as AI being capable of replacing nearly 12% of jobs, the Project says what it’s actually estimating is how much of a job can be offloaded to AI. It then calculates wages attached to that offloaded work. Interestingly, the tasks it cites as examples include automated paperwork for nurses and AI-written computer code.

That’s not to say there are no jobs being heavily impacted by AI. Corporate graphic artists and marketing bloggers are two examples, according to a Substack called Blood in the Machine. Then there are the high unemployment rates among new-grad junior coders.

But it’s also true that highly skilled artists, writers, and programmers produce better work with AI tools than those without the skills. AI can’t replace human creativity, yet.

So it’s perhaps no surprise that as we slide into 2026, some data is emerging that shows the jobs where AI has made the most progress are actually flourishing. Vanguard’s 2026 economic forecast report found that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”

The Vanguard report concludes that those who are masterfully using AI are making themselves more valuable, not replaceable.

The irony is that Microsoft’s own actions last year helped give rise to the AI-is-coming-for-our-jobs narrative. The company laid off over 15,000 people in 2025, even as it recorded record revenues and profits for its last fiscal year, which closed in June — citing success with AI as a reason. Nadella even wrote a public memo about the layoffs after these results.

Notably, he didn’t say that internal AI efficiency led to cuts. But he did say that Microsoft had to “reimagine our mission for a new era” and named “AI transformation” as one of the company’s three business objectives in this era (the other two being security and quality).

The truth about job loss attributed to AI during 2025 is more nuanced. As the Vanguard report points out, this had less to do with internal AI efficiency and more to do with ordinary business practices that are less exciting to investors, like ending investment in slowing areas to pile in to growing ones.

To be fair, Microsoft wasn’t alone in laying off workers while pursuing AI. The technology was said to be responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to research from firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, CNBC reported. That report cited the large cuts last year at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, and other tech companies chasing AI.

And to be fair to slop, those of us who spend more time than we should on social media laughing at memes and AI-generated short-form videos might argue that slop is one of AI’s most entertaining (if not best) uses, too.

            <h2>This is Uber’s new robotaxi from Lucid and Nuro</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/this-is-ubers-new-robotaxi-from-lucid-and-nuro/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Uber, Lucid Motors, and Nuro have revealed the production-intent version of their collaborative robotaxi at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, and TechCrunch got a sneak peek ahead of the reveal.

It’s a vehicle that’s been in the works for more than half a year now, part of a deal that saw Uber invest $300 million into Lucid and commit to buying 20,000 of the company’s EVs. On Monday, the companies said the robotaxi is already being tested on public roads ahead of a planned commercial service launching in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year.

Based on the Lucid Gravity SUV, the robotaxi has high-resolution cameras, solid state lidar sensors, and radars integrated into the body and the roof-mounted “halo.” The autonomy package is powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Thor computer. That halo also has integrated LED lights that will help riders identify their vehicle (similar to how Waymo’s Jaguar I-Pace SUVs work).

Crucially, all of this extra tech is added to the Gravity as it’s being built at Lucid Motors’ Casa Grande, Arizona factory, saving the companies some time and money. By comparison, Waymo currently has to take apart the I-Pace SUVs it receives from Jaguar and integrate the autonomous tech as it puts them back together. (Future Waymo vehicles are planned to be more purpose-built.)

The vehicle unveiled on Monday is a more polished-up version of the test version that the three companies have spent the last seven months showing off in press photos. The newest element revealed at CES has to do with how users will interface with the Uber-Lucid-Nuro robotaxi. That includes a small screen on the halo meant to greet riders and a ride interface inside the cabin.

Anyone who has ridden in a Waymo will find this UI experience familiar. The rear passenger screen shows an isometric graphical view of the robotaxi moving through city streets, with representations of nearby cars and pedestrians.

The companies did not have an interactive version of the software — which is being created by Uber — ready to test out just yet. But it has been built to show the standard information like estimated drop-off time, how much ride time is remaining, and climate and music controls. There are also buttons to reach rider support and to tell the robotaxi to pull over.

The front passenger screen shows a lot of the same information, just on a larger central touchscreen display. In the demonstration car on display at the Fontainebleau hotel, a lot of the same elements appeared on the Gravity’s sweeping 34-inch curved OLED display, which sits behind the steering wheel.

Uber chose to build this forthcoming “premium” robotaxi service around the Gravity, and at a high level it seems like a wise decision. The Gravity is immensely spacious inside, especially in the two-row configuration on display at the hotel. (Uber says a three-row version will be available, too.)

That said, the Gravity’s first full year came with struggles. Lucid fought with software issues as it ramped up production of the SUV, and the problems got bad enough that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to owners in December apologizing for the “frustrations” they experienced.

Lucid has seemingly been able to bounce back from that, and on Monday announced that it doubled its 2024 production figures and reached new sales records. Time will tell if the robotaxi version has any of the same kinds of software struggles.

Uber, Lucid, and Nuro said Monday that once final validation is complete on the robotaxi later this year, true production versions will start rolling off Lucid’s factory lines in Arizona. The companies did not give a concrete timeline for that, though.

            <h2>Nvidia wants to be the Android of generalist robotics</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-05</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nvidia released a new stack of robot foundation models, simulation tools, and edge hardware at CES 2026, moves that signal the company’s ambition to become the default platform for generalist robotics, much as Android became the operating system for smartphones.

Nvidia’s move into robotics reflects a broader industry shift as AI moves off the cloud and into machines that can learn how to think in the physical world, enabled by cheaper sensors, advanced simulation, and AI models that increasingly can generalize across tasks.

Nvidia revealed details on Monday about its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, including new open foundation models that allow robots to reason, plan, and adapt across many tasks and diverse environments, moving beyond narrow task-specific bots, all of which are available on Hugging Face.

Those models include: Cosmos Transfer 2.5 and Cosmos Predict 2.5, two world models for synthetic data generation and robot policy evaluation in simulation; Cosmos Reason 2, a reasoning vision language model (VLM) that allows AI systems to see, understand, and act in the physical world; and Isaac GR00T N1.6, its next-gen vision language action (VLA) model purpose-built for humanoid robots. GR00T relies on Cosmos Reason as its brain, and it unlocks whole-body control for humanoids so they can move and handle objects simultaneously.

Nvidia also introduced Isaac Lab-Arena at CES, an open source simulation framework hosted on GitHub that serves as another component of the company’s physical AI platform, enabling safe virtual testing of robotic capabilities.

The platform promises to address a critical industry challenge: As robots learn increasingly complex tasks, from precise object handling to cable installation, validating these abilities in physical environments can be costly, slow, and risky. Isaac Lab-Arena tackles this by consolidating resources, task scenarios, training tools, and established benchmarks like Libero, RoboCasa, and RoboTwin, creating a unified standard where the industry previously lacked one.

Supporting the ecosystem is Nvidia OSMO, an open source command center that serves as connective infrastructure that integrates the entire workflow from data generation through training across both desktop and cloud environments.

And to help power it all, there’s the new Blackwell-powered Jetson T4000 graphics card, the newest member of the Thor family. Nvidia is pitching it as a cost-effective on-device compute upgrade that delivers 1200 teraflops of AI compute and 64 gigabytes of memory while running efficiently at 40 to 70 watts.

Nvidia is also deepening its partnership with Hugging Face to let more people experiment with robot training without needing expensive hardware or specialized knowledge. The collaboration integrates Nvidia’s Isaac and GR00T technologies into Hugging Face’s LeRobot framework, connecting Nvidia’s 2 million robotics developers with Hugging Face’s 13 million AI builders. The developer platform’s open source Reachy 2 humanoid now works directly with Nvidia’s Jetson Thor chip, letting developers experiment with different AI models without being locked into proprietary systems.

The bigger picture here is that Nvidia is trying to make robotics development more accessible, and it wants to be the underlying hardware and software vendor powering it, much like Android is the default for smartphone makers.

There are early signs that Nvidia’s strategy is working. Robotics is the fastest growing category on Hugging Face, with Nvidia’s models leading downloads. Meanwhile robotics companies, from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar to Franka Robots and NEURA Robotics, are already using Nvidia’s tech.

            <h2>Rotavirus Could Come Roaring Back—Very Soon</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/childhood-vaccine-schedule-rotavirus-paul-offit/685513/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Of all the diseases that the U.S. government announced today that it will no longer recommend vaccines against, rotavirus is by no means the deadliest. Not all children develop substantial symptoms; most of those who do experience a few days of fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, and then get better. In the early 1970s, when no rotavirus vaccines were available and most children could expect to be sickened with the virus at least once by the end of toddlerhood, Paul Offit considered it to be no big deal, relatively speaking. In this country especially, rotavirus “was an illness from which children recovered,” he told me.

That perception shifted abruptly during Offit’s pediatric residency training, when he saw hundreds of severe rotavirus cases admitted to the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh each year. Although plenty of children weathered the infection largely without bad symptoms, others vomited so profusely that they struggled to keep down the fluids they desperately needed. Offit can still recall the nine-month-old he treated in the late 1970s who was hospitalized after her mother had struggled to feed her sufficient fluids at home. The infant was so severely dehydrated that Offit and his colleagues couldn’t find a vein in which to insert an IV; as a last resort, they attempted to drill a needle into her bone marrow to hydrate her. “We failed,” Offit told me. “And then I was the one who had to go out to the waiting room to tell this mom of a little girl who had been previously healthy two days earlier that her child had died.”

Within a few years, Offit had partnered with several other scientists and begun to develop a rotavirus vaccine. Their oral immunization, called RotaTeq and delivered as a series of sugar-sweet drops to infants, would ultimately be licensed in 2006. Today, it remains one of the two main rotavirus vaccines available to American children. Offit is now a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where, he told me, “most residents have never seen an inpatient with rotavirus-induced dehydration”—thanks in large part to the country’s deployment of rotavirus vaccines, which reaches about 70 percent of U.S. children each year.

Now, though, the United States’ rotavirus shield stands to fracture. Today, the Trump administration overhauled the nation’s childhood vaccination schedule, shrinking from 17 to 11 the number of immunizations it broadly recommends to all American kids. “After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy said in a statement today. Among the vaccines clipped—including immunizations against hepatitis A, meningitis, and influenza—is the rotavirus vaccine, which the administration frames as more of a personal choice, allowable under consultation with a health-care provider but not essential, because the virus poses “almost no risk of either mortality or chronic morbidity.” Experts suspect that vaccination rates will plummet in response. If they do, rates of diarrheal disease are likely to quickly roar back, Virginia Pitzer, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Yale, told me. (The administration’s nod to international consensus is tenuous at best; rotavirus also remains the leading cause of diarrheal death among young children worldwide.)

In an email, Andrew Nixon, HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for media relations, defended today’s decision as “based on a rigorous review of evidence and gold standard science, not claims from individuals with a financial stake in maintaining universal recommendations.” (Offit, who is a co-patent holder on RotaTeq, did profit from his invention but sold his interest in the vaccine more than 15 years ago and does not currently receive royalties from its sale.)

I called Offit to discuss the federal backtracking on the vaccine he once helped bring to market, and what the loss of protection will mean for future generations. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Katherine J. Wu: Rotavirus was once a disease that hospitalized up to 70,000 children each year. Since the arrival of the vaccine you co-invented, as well as another two years later, those rates have plummeted. What was it like to see a vaccine you helped develop have that sort of impact?

Paul Offit: I remember a meeting at Merck [the company that manufactured the vaccine] when they revealed the results of our big Phase 3 trial. [The presenter] showed the data, that it clearly was safe, in 70,000 children. And it was like 95 percent effective at preventing severe illness. She showed a map of the world, with Asia, Africa, Latin America studded with black dots, and each black dot represented 1,000 deaths. She said, “Now we have in hand the technology to prevent this.” Then she showed a picture of a map of the world where all those black dots were gone. And she put her head down, shoulders going up and down, and wept.

The vaccine was taken up relatively quickly, I think in large part because it was an oral vaccine and that is perceived as less difficult than a child getting a shot. To go from 1980 to 2006, and to start to see the incidence of the disease decline, it was just an amazing feeling.

Wu: What will it mean for this vaccine to no longer be recommended by the federal government?

Offit: My wife’s in private practice in pediatrics, and there certainly were many parents who she saw who were hesitant about getting vaccines. And I think it’s more convincing when you can say, “Look, this is a recommended vaccine. This is something that the CDC, the major public-health agency in this country, believes is important for your child to receive.” You can’t really say that now. And if you get rotavirus in early childhood, you have a chance of being one of those 70,000 children [who were hospitalized] before there was a vaccine.

Some diseases, you need to build up a susceptible population, like measles, which we eliminated from this country. That’s not true for viruses like rotavirus, flu, RSV. The virus is always circulating. So if you choose not to get a vaccine, you are at risk, because you may come in contact with that virus. So if there’s a fairly rapid erosion in vaccine rates, I think you would immediately see children suffering a preventable illness.

Wu: In a decision memo addressed to the acting director of the CDC, top officials at the Department of Health and Human Services downplayed the virus’s threat to American children and suggested that the decrease in rotavirus deaths that followed the approval of RotaTeq and another vaccine called Rotarix may instead have been attributable to factors “unrelated to the vaccine, including improved medical care, changes in diagnostic practices, or random fluctuations.” I’m curious what you make of that justification. Were there other reasons rotavirus might have been among the six vaccines targeted?

Offit: A phrase like almost no mortality—really? So the 20 to 60 children who died every year of rotavirus in this country, that’s okay? One child dying is too many, especially if you can safely prevent it. So I don’t agree with that.

Sure, right now the morbidity is low because of the vaccine, and certainly the mortality is largely gone because of the vaccine. We are once again exposing children unnecessarily to harm. There’s no advantage to this. There were 70,000 hospitalizations a year, which was not trivial, and virtually eliminating them was one of the major successes for vaccines in this country. And I don’t understand why you would ever back off that success.

I also just never imagined we would ever get to a time when the CDC, the nation’s No. 1 public-health agency, and the ACIP, which was a group of outside expert advisers who went through the science and made best recommendations, would get to the point where it was basically not a scientific organization anymore. It’s an organization run by an anti-vaccine activist who was a science denialist and conspiracy theorist. I mean, that’s where we are now. We don’t have the CDC anymore. We don’t have an ACIP anymore. I certainly never imagined that. [Editor’s note: Kennedy has an established history of anti-vaccine activism and of embracing conspiracy theories. Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, did not offer further comment on this criticism.]

Wu: This actually isn’t the first time that a rotavirus vaccine has lost a government endorsement. The U.S.’s first rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield, was taken off the market in 1999 after officials detected a rare intestinal-blockage complication. How does the current situation compare? Was there a safety reason to make current rotavirus vaccines less accessible to the public?

Offit: I was actually on the ACIP when that happened. [Editor’s note: Offit was no longer on the ACIP when his own vaccine was voted on.] The [rare side effect was] quickly picked up, and the vaccine was off the market within a little over a year. We care about vaccine safety. It depends on which paper you read, but anywhere from one in 10,000 to one in 30,000 children developed [the blockage]. You were still at greater risk of being hospitalized and dying from rotavirus, but the decision was made to take it off the market.

Wu: What do you think will be the future of the rotavirus vaccine you helped develop and bring to market, and watched help reshape the portrait of diarrheal disease in this country?

Offit: The American Academy of Pediatrics will certainly still recommend it. But younger pediatricians may be less compelled to offer this vaccine, because they didn’t experience this disease when they were in training. But I think what they hopefully realize is that this virus continues to circulate. It’s still out there. And the lower immunization rates, even a little, will cause children to suffer unnecessarily.</div>

            <h2>Trump Seizing Greenland Could Set Off a Chain Reaction</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/greenland-trump-venezuela-nato/685511/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Danish officials think they know how Donald Trump might seize Greenland. In a late-night Truth Social post, the president announces that the Danish territory is now an American “protectorate.” Because neither Denmark nor its European allies possess the military force to prevent the United States from taking the island, they are powerless to resist Trump’s dubious claim. And as the leading member of NATO claims the sovereign territory of another state, the alliance is paralyzed. Arguing that possession is nine-tenths of the law, Trump simply declares that Greenland now belongs to the United States.

This chain of events, which some Danish officials and security experts proposed to us in recent months, may have seemed faintly ridiculous as of last Friday. By the weekend—after the toppling of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump’s ensuing insistence that the United States now “runs” Venezuela—it seemed far less so. For months, Danes have anxiously imagined an audacious move by the Trump administration to annex Greenland, whether by force, coercion, or an attempt to buy off the local population of about 56,000 people with the promise of cutting them in on future mining deals. Now those fears are spiking.

Shortly after U.S. forces captured Maduro, Katie Miller, a former White House official who is married to the senior Trump aide Stephen Miller, posted on X a map of Greenland covered in the U.S. flag, with the caption “SOON.” Officials in Denmark told us that they were furious—and rattled. Then, yesterday morning, in an interview with our colleague Michael Scherer, Trump reasserted his intention to annex Greenland. “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” he said.

European leaders have long downplayed Trump’s acquisitive posture and tried to ignore his comments. Not after what happened in Venezuela. Today, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, argued that the president’s threats are credible. “Unfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland,” she told the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR).

U.S. officials and Trump allies we spoke with downplayed the possibility of military action in Greenland. (Stephen Miller told CNN’s Jake Tapper today that it would hardly be necessary. “No one is going to fight the U.S. militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller said, reiterating that the territory should belong to the United States.) But Trump has pointedly not ruled out taking Greenland by force. And if the U.S. goes down that road, NATO will effectively cease to exist the moment the first military personnel enter Greenlandic territory.

“If the United States attacks another NATO country, everything stops,” Frederiksen said on DR.

The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, made clear to reporters during a visit to Lithuania that Greenland falls under Article 5 of the alliance, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all, obligating other members to respond: “Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. And since Denmark is a member of NATO, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to NATO defence.”

But how exactly would that play out in practice? One European official was blunt: “We won’t be able to defend Greenland. Are you kidding?”

Boosters of Trump’s Greenlandic ambitions are delighted by the Venezuela operation and by the president’s restated commitment to their cause. “I think it’s a big opportunity and a new beginning for Greenland, with Trump’s interest,” Jørgen Boassen, the president’s most prominent and vocal advocate in Greenland, told us. Boassen, known for his collection of MAGA hats and for wearing T-shirts with Trump’s face printed on them, said that Greenlanders yearn for independence from Denmark and from “Danish elites” in Greenland who don’t speak the native language or understand local culture.

Those long-standing rifts aside, polls do not show widespread Greenlandic support for swapping the Danish flag for the Stars and Stripes. Boassen insisted that many Greenlanders are afraid to speak up in favor of annexation because they would face professional and political retribution. He claimed that Danish authorities shut down his Facebook page, which is his primary means of spreading his support for Trump’s policies. (We were able to access the page this afternoon.) Boassen said that “Trump has heard about people suffering” and that he is “a savior for us right now.”

European leaders see matters very differently. Since yesterday, they have dispensed with the kind of equivocation that sometimes marks their public statements about the American president. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Sky News, “Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark are to decide the future of Greenland, and only Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark.” France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, wrote on social media, “Greenland is neither for the taking nor for sale.”

As for the Danes, they’re cycling through various stages of grief, according to Rufus Gifford, who served as U.S. ambassador to Denmark under President Barack Obama. Above all, they can’t figure out what Trump’s true intentions are, Gifford told us. The likeliest outcome, in his estimation, is that the president uses the leverage of U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine to pressure European countries, including Denmark, to accept U.S. plans for the Arctic island. Indeed, a former senior U.S. official in Europe told us that one reason NATO leaders didn’t speak up sooner, and more emphatically, in opposition to U.S. territorial designs on Greenland was fear that Trump would lash out in response and curtail U.S. support for Ukraine, possibly interrupting intelligence sharing and weapons sales.

The former official said that panic first set in about U.S. plans a year ago, after MAGA acolytes, led by Donald Trump Jr., made a trip to Nuuk, Greenland’s capital. “From the standpoint of the Danish government, that’s when it began to get really heated,” said the former official, who, like some others, spoke with us on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. The visit had a carnival atmosphere, with locals flocking to see the visiting delegation that had arrived in the president’s personal airplane, dubbed “Trump Force One.”

Danish officials and experts told us it was on this trip that Trump lost any prospect of popular support from Greenlanders. Rumors circulated that Trump’s son was handing out $100 bills to local homeless people. That wasn’t true, but Trump Jr. did buy the people lunch, said Boassen, who helped organize the trip. Still, many Greenlanders believed that Trump Jr. was exhibiting the kind of colonialist mentality that they have long complained about.

Over the following months, some dared to hope that Trump had moved on from his dreams of acquiring Greenland. But a series of recent moves created a new sense of urgency for Denmark. In December, Trump named Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. (Landry’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.) The same month, the president appointed Tom Dans, an ally, entrepreneur, and investor involved in organizing American excursions to the island, to lead an Arctic research commission. The U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Ken Howery, told us in a statement that members of his staff have “interacted” with Dans and that he expects to meet with him, given Dans’s new role. Dans wrote on social media that he would make “the ARCTIC GREAT AGAIN!” He declined to comment.

The operation in Venezuela seems to confirm that the president is willing to back up his demands of foreign nations with military action, a kind of gunboat diplomacy for the 21st century. People close to the president told us that Trump is enamored with the success of the military interventions he has ordered in Iran, Nigeria, and now Venezuela—and that he will not shy away from wielding force again. And he’s happy, at least, to use the threat of force as leverage while he eyes Greenland. Some around Trump have delighted in Europe’s impassioned reaction to his latest expression of interest in the mineral-rich island. “Let them squirm,” one close outside ally told us. “Maybe we’ll take it; maybe we won’t. But after what we just saw in Caracas, do you want to try to call Trump’s bluff?” Trump said this past weekend that Greenland is not yet at the top of his to-do list, but he offered multiple timelines—from 20 days to two months—for when he might fully engage on the issue.

Western diplomats and security officials we spoke with were apoplectic. One told us that Denmark and its Nordic neighbors have been taking the president’s statements seriously for a year but have remained uncertain about how to interpret them and, especially, how to respond. The editor in chief of the Copenhagen-based newspaper Berlingske wrote in a column today that Denmark and its allies should seek to raise the cost for Washington of any possible military aggression, including by moving more military assets to the island: “It won’t be able to stop the USA, but it will be a symbolic step.”

A Danish lawmaker, who spoke with us on the condition of anonymity to address the security situation candidly, said that the very notion of the U.S. invading Greenland—both mounting an invasion and defending against it—is absurd. The island is nearly four times the size of France and is mostly ice. The lawmaker told us that Danes are particularly baffled by Trump’s designs on Greenland because he could accomplish all of his security objectives by working with Denmark, a committed U.S. ally. During the Cold War, there was even a nuclear-powered U.S. base built under Greenlandic ice. “If the Americans want another military base, just say where,” the lawmaker said. “If you want a radar, you can put it up.”

Carsten Søndergaard, a career Danish diplomat who served as an ambassador to Russia and as the permanent representative to NATO, told us that additional U.S. troops in Greenland, as well as mining rights, could be negotiated, to the benefit of all parties. “A hostile takeover of an ally’s territory will have severe consequences for the transatlantic relations and the West. So much is at stake,” he said.

There was one specific jab at Denmark, made by Trump aboard Air Force One last night, that the Danish lawmaker felt compelled to counter. “You know what Denmark did recently to boost up security on Greenland?” Trump joked to reporters. “They added one more dogsled.”

A Danish naval unit, called the Sirius Patrol, actually does conduct reconnaissance missions by dogsled in the unforgiving northeastern part of the island. The U.S. Department of Defense—or the Department of War, as Trump’s team has taken to calling it—even celebrates the unit’s history on its website: Danish, Norwegian, and Greenlandic hunters patrolled Greenland’s coast by dogsled to fend off German intruders during the Second World War. Drawing on that legacy, the unit still conducts long-range missions and “enforces Danish sovereignty in the Arctic wilderness of northern and eastern Greenland,” according to the Defense Department.

Patrolling is typically done in pairs, sometimes for months on end without other human contact. The Danish lawmaker said that it’s a tough job in some of the bleakest conditions in the world. “Very few U.S. soldiers,” he told us, “would survive a week up there.”</div>

One indicator of a polity’s health is whether a citizen can be punished merely for telling the truth about the law. The signs for American democracy are not good.

This morning, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that he has begun the process to demote Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and NASA astronaut, and reduce his pension pay. The operative facts here, naturally, are not Kelly’s past service but his current rank and service: a Democrat serving in the U.S. Senate and a political adversary of President Donald Trump.

“Six weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly—and five other members of Congress—released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,” Hegseth wrote on X this morning. He cited two articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice; Kelly, unlike the other five, holds retired military status, which makes him subject to sanctions from the Defense Department.

What Hegseth did not cite was what Kelly and his colleagues actually said in the video, and for good reason. Doing so would expose the absurdity of the charge and the abuse of power involved in the attempt to demote him. “Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,” Kelly said. No one in the Trump administration has disputed that this is true. A more agile or even-keeled administration would have smoothly dismissed the video as irrelevant: This is true, but of course we would never issue an illegal order. (As Kelly and his lawyers have noted, Hegseth has cited the same law about disobeying illegal orders in the past.) Instead, Trump and his aides threw a fit, dubbing the Democrats the “Seditious Six.”

One possible reason for the frantic response became apparent quickly. Not only have U.S. forces been conducting likely unlawful strikes on boats in the Caribbean; late last year, several news sources reported new details about the first attack, in which the initial strike had not killed all those aboard the boat, so a second strike was ordered. The Pentagon’s own Law of War Manual for service members states that “orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal.” This revelation made the video from Kelly and company not just hypothetical but directly relevant. It also put Hegseth on the defensive, even among Republican members of Congress, and he quickly shifted blame to Admiral Mitch Bradley, who commanded the operation.

In contrast to the language in the Law of War Manual, the UCMJ articles upon which Hegseth rests his decision to discipline Kelly are vague, involving “conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman” and “all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces.” As my colleague Tom Nichols has noted, these provisions might apply to Hegseth’s own admitted behavior while in uniform. Punishing Kelly is extremely pernicious political retaliation. It also ought to be embarrassing to Hegseth, though he seems as impervious to shame as his boss.

The censure is appealable in the next 30 days, and Kelly vowed to fight it. (If it goes through, it could cost him roughly $1,000 a month in pay, per Politico.) “My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife,” former Representative Gabby Giffords, “recovered from a gunshot wound to the head—all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,” he said in a statement on X. “If Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country’s history, thinks he can intimidate me with a censure or threats to demote me or prosecute me, he still doesn’t get it.”

Kelly is one of several critics of Trump to be targeted by the administration in the past year. The administration has repeatedly sought to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey; launched investigations into a major Democratic fundraising platform and prominent politicians including Senator Adam Schiff; and used administration policy to bully states that don’t fully cooperate with Trump—most recently vetoing a bipartisan bill on a Colorado water project, apparently as punishment for the state’s refusal to free a former local official who backed up Trump’s false claims of voter fraud.

Despite Kelly’s defiance, his attempted demotion sends a message, even if it ultimately doesn’t come to pass. Kelly has the resources and political support to fight for his views, and he’ll get plenty of prominent backers. But if a notable figure like Kelly can be punished, how can any ordinary soldier or sailor who is currently serving hope to refuse an illegal order without facing serious personal consequences?

Members of the armed forces, and retirees like Kelly, are particularly susceptible to Hegseth’s abuse of power, because they can be punished by the Defense Department internally. But the chilling effect does not end with those who are serving or have served, or with the particular question of illegal orders. The administration has told the other five Democrats that it is investigating them as well. The core belief underlying all of this is as plain as it is dangerous: Criticizing Donald Trump and defending the rule of law is sedition.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The Venezuelan Opposition’s Desperate Gamble

Venezuelans have been through a lot in recent decades: the rise of Hugo Chávez, a ruinous revolution that turned democracy into dictatorship, an economic crisis that became a humanitarian one, the emigration of more than one in four inhabitants. Many people are by now familiar with the smell of tear gas and the sound of gunshots. But the sensory experience of bombs falling from the sky was for the most part novel. The Trump administration hit military bases mainly in or near Caracas; at least seven explosions killed dozens of people.

Many Venezuelans welcomed the strikes. Before Saturday, polls showed that a majority of Venezuelans both inside and outside the country favored U.S. military intervention. María Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition movement, issued a statement following the American operation: “Venezuelans, the hour of freedom has arrived!” she said, adding, “Let’s remain vigilant, active, and organized, until the Democratic Transition is fulfilled.”

The simplest reason for celebration is that Nicolás Maduro is out … But there are reasons to be wary too.

            <h2>Trump’s Retro Imperialism</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/trump-venezuela-oil-seize/685509/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump’s fans like to cheer on his most audacious moves by declaring, “I voted for this.” It is safe to assume, though, that very few people who pulled the lever for Trump in 2024 expected that he would soon announce that he had seized control over Venezuela. One of Trump’s most popular qualities has always been his supposed opposition to foreign wars, his anti-imperialist isolationism. Yet J. D. Vance, who once wrote an op-ed headlined “Trump’s Best Foreign Policy? Not Starting Any Wars,” now declares the new war in Venezuela to be a glorious and necessary exercise of America Firstism.

MAGA is primarily a personality cult, the objectives of which evolve to suit Trump’s capricious moods. Yet his pivot to new wars of conquest is not some shocking reversal. The “Donroe Doctrine,” as he calls his assertion of regional supremacy—a Trumpian extension of the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, which established the United States’ claim over the Americas in order to keep Europeans out—is in fact consistent with his deepest beliefs. In some ways, it represents the ultimate expression of the world order he hopes to engineer.

A desire to dominate—an eagerness to bully his counterparties into submission—is perhaps the essence of Trump’s character. Trump’s unexpected political resurrection and return to the White House have emboldened his ambitions, which have spread outward. His threats against Canada, Panama, and Greenland, and his renaming of the Gulf of Mexico, have little to do with national interest and everything to do with reifying a new order in which he’s the boss and the leaders of neighboring countries are his cowering subordinates.

Read: The fuck-around-and-find-out presidency

Other administration officials have tried to depict the Venezuela intervention as a limited operation, but Trump’s constant claims that these moves are about oil, and his constant boasts that he is “in charge” of the country, clarify his motives. In invading Venezuela and capturing its president, Trump is asserting dominance not only over the hemisphere, but also over energy resources.

This is in keeping with Trump’s view that wealth and power are always zero-sum contests, and his belief that control of natural resources will dictate who wins. “The future will be determined by the ability to protect commerce and territory and resources that are core to national security,” he announced in his prepared remarks on Saturday. “These are the iron laws that have always determined global power, and we’re going to keep it that way.”

Trump’s faith that controlling Venezuela’s oil fields will deliver wealth and power to the U.S. is so profound that he has ignored all evidence to the contrary. For starters, oil prices are currently low—a fact that Trump is fond of pointing out in other contexts, but that limits the financial upside of opening more oil for development. Trump insists that Venezuela’s oil fields will provide a windfall to the United States (“It won’t cost us anything, because the money coming out of the ground is very substantial”). Yet analysts project that any profit from Venezuelan oil will require a massive up-front investment.

Trump’s conviction that American wealth demands siphoning or stealing natural resources from other countries is of a piece with his winner-takes-all worldview. But this rather retro understanding of economics is readily defied by examples around the world. Many of the nations that have seen the fastest economic growth  in recent decades have few natural resources, such as Japan, Israel, and the “Asian Tigers.” Meanwhile many of the nations that are richest in resources remain trapped in poverty, such as Venezuela.

This paradox is so long-standing that economists have coined the term resource curse to describe it. According to this theory, natural resources perversely impoverish nations by concentrating economic and political power in the hands of a kleptocratic elite. This discourages the formation of liberal democratic systems with accountable governments that follow the rule of law, which in turn discourages investment and entrepreneurialism.

Anne Applebaum: Trump’s ‘American dominance’ may leave us with nothing

A kleptocracy does, however, seem in line with Trump’s Donroe Doctrine. Asked by reporters what the main priority should be for Venezuela’s new government, Trump replied, “We need total access. We need access to the oil.” When another reporter wondered whether the new government should liberalize opposition or free political prisoners, he demurred: “Right now what we want to do is fix up the oil, fix up the country.”

To the extent that Trump intuits an inverse relationship between wealth extraction and liberal democracy, he may see it as a benefit rather than a cost. The countries he most admires around the world, including Russia and the Gulf kingdoms, are neither the most affluent nor the most free. But their leaders are disproportionately wealthy and powerful. What economists call the resource curse seems, to Trump, to be a resource blessing.

Trump thinks about economics less like a businessman, as some of his supporters say, than like a warlord or a gangster: He imagines wealth as something to be plundered and hoarded by the strong. As a formula for amassing a personal fortune, this view has delivered beyond his wildest dreams. As a blueprint for national success, however, his crude ideas offer little more than an outdated fantasy of hemispheric supremacy.</div>

            <h2>@Grok, Did Venezuela ‘Deserve It’?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/grok-did-venezuela-deserve-it/685506/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hours before President Donald Trump announced Nicolás Maduro’s capture, on Saturday morning, people had questions for Grok, Elon Musk’s chatbot. Footage was circulating on X of explosions in Venezuela, and some users assumed the United States was responsible: “Hey @grok why is Trump sending US airstrikes to bomb Venezuela. Do you think they deserve it or not ?”one person asked. “@grok what is the reason why America is bombing Venezuela,” another asked.

This is to be expected. Today, chatbots are treated as a source of information by many people. Millions in the United States alone use them to get information, and the number is growing. This means that tech companies such as X, Google, Anthropic, Meta, and OpenAI now play a central role not just in delivering information to people—as some of them have for decades, through social-media platforms and search engines—but in actively shaping what that information is: which facts are included and which are not.

Journalists and other sources may be cited by the bots, but the people who control these AI products, such as Musk, now have a greater ability to manipulate how events are reported. This is a deeply troubling development—one that threatens to leave the public less informed, with fewer checks on those in power.

There are already signs that some amount of influence is occurring. For starters, there have been a number of egregious incidents in which Grok has spread false details about a purported “white genocide” and aggressively posted in support of Musk himself. At one point, Google’s Gemini was directed to prioritize diversity in its responses, resulting in AI-generated images of racially diverse Nazis. Chatbots reflect their programming and training data, not only reality.

The examples do not have to be dramatic to be concerning. Take those two Grok queries about Venezuela. Musk has insisted that Grok should be “sensible and neutral politically.” The bot’s responses to the Venezuela queries indeed carried an outward appearance of political balance. In its answer to the first person, Grok included vague references to outlets such as CBS and Al Jazeera, as well as perspectives from both “supporters” and “critics” of the Trump administration; in its answer to the second question, it referenced both U.S. and Venezuelan officials.

Later, after Trump announced that a military operation had been conducted and that Maduro had been captured—after the president held a press conference in which he asserted that the U.S. would “run” Venezuela and take over its oil production—Grok offered a similarly anodyne view of the situation in response to a user query. “Recent reports indicate Trump’s administration describes the involvement as temporary support for stability and oil production during a transition, per statements from Reuters and the White House,” it said in part. “Critics argue it’s overreach.” (It is not clear which “statement” from Reuters Grok may be referencing; while we were able to find relevant coverage, no link is given.)

These answers may seem reasonable at a glance, but they miss obvious, key context: In these particular responses, Grok did not mention the U.S. recently committing a series of extrajudicial killings at sea, for example, nor did it explain that the operation to extract Maduro was very possibly illegal. The bot typically delivers no real sense of the political stakes or human toll of the operation, and it does not link to any journalistic work. When it mentions news outlets, it’s only through simple, vague assertions that may or not be based in reality. Chatbots have a well-known tendency to hallucinate. (xAI, the Musk-founded company behind Grok, did not respond to a request for comment.)

At least two other prominent chatbots stumbled out of the gate, getting the facts wrong altogether and presenting false information. Wired’s Brian Barrett found that in response to a query roughly four hours after Maduro’s capture had been announced by Trump, ChatGPT not only got the facts wrong but fabricated a whole story, stating that “the United States has not invaded Venezuela, and Nicolás Maduro has not been captured.” The bot suggested that “sensational headlines” and “social media misinformation” could have contributed to any confusion. Barrett also found that Perplexity, another popular AI service, similarly asserted that the military operation had not occurred.

Although models frequently have “knowledge cutoffs,” as Barrett notes—meaning that their training data are current only as of a certain past date—both Perplexity and ChatGPT can search the web for up-to-date information, even in their free versions. It’s not clear why this did not result in accurate answers. OpenAI, which has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic, did not respond to our request for comment. As for Perplexity, Jesse Dwyer, a spokesperson for the company, told us, “Our post-mortem revealed that Brian’s initial query had been mistakenly classified as likely fraud. This caused it to be routed to a lower-tier model, and that model didn’t perform to our standards.”

In short: Chatbots are not reliable in breaking-news situations. They may, in fact, be particularly unreliable in these cases. Answers may be skewed according to an AI’s biases, or they may be completely wrong but presented as correct. AI products might simply route you to faulty models if they don’t like how you’ve phrased a question. Despite these flaws, the language used by chatbots is typically assertive and confident. A recent Pew Research Center survey shows that most people who use chatbots for news aren’t confident that they can always tell what is true and what isn’t. Large language models are also already making it harder for human writers and publishers to succeed, meaning more people will likely come to rely on these flawed chatbots for information in the future. They may not be reliable, but they will be used.

Read: The end of publishing as we know it

Some political powers are already well attuned to this reality and are attempting to turn it to their advantage. One Russian network, for example, has reportedly produced millions of articles that advance state propaganda, which have influenced the narratives that major chatbots produce in response to user questions. Even more sophisticated “reasoning” models can fall prey to such “LLM grooming,” according to research that one of the authors of this story, Gary Marcus, conducted together with Sophia Freuden and Nina Jankowicz. (Marcus has also founded a machine-learning company and a robotics company and is active in the AI industry.) Lobbying groups, politicians, and any well-resourced person or organization with an interest in controlling a given narrative could attempt their own version of this process, filling the web with synthetic articles supporting their viewpoints, which chatbots then pick up and parrot.

AI proponents like to say that the technology is “democratizing,” that it gives power to the masses—delivering knowledge, allowing anyone to create art or coherent writing, and so on. But generative AI democratizes the bad stuff, too: disinformation, propaganda, deepfakes. Just last week, X exploded with people using Grok to create nonconsensual pornography of real people, including those who appeared to be young children. The information ecosystem is degrading more each moment.

The irony here is that many in Washington have been openly fantasizing about how advanced AI systems could revolutionize military strategy and reshape geopolitics—to such an extent that this speculation has fueled a kind of arms race with China. Such systems may never materialize as planned. Many AI models have struggled to follow the basic rules of chess—they are hardly suited for strategic thinking.

The current systems are patient, amoral, and fantastic at mimicry, making them among the greatest tools in history for generating mis- and disinformation—the latter of which is a tremendous weapon, not necessarily for its ability to persuade and convince, but for its ability to sow chaos. This, rather than some intelligence breakthrough, may well be the legacy of generative AI.

In turn, the fog of war may become more terrifying as citizens lose trust in much of what they read or see, and when conflicts are started and escalated by false pretexts.</div>

Better With Time is a new newsletter course from The Atlantic. If you sign up, I’ll send you an email the following day at 7 a.m. ET on how to kick-start your wake-up. Then, once a week for the next eight weeks, I’ll send you an email at a different time of day that could likely use a zhuzh: the mid-morning doldrums, that vanishing slice of post-work free time, all the way up to bedtime. Each edition will give you a single to-do to improve that bit of the day, drawn from The Atlantic’s coverage.

I’ve already spoiled the first—the scandalous suggestion that you start your morning with that inimitable Italian American alchemy of cutlet, cheese, and marinara—but things get weirder and more wonderful from there. (That means no telling you to meditate, reduce screen time, or journal about gratitude. Sorry.) And yes, there is science behind it all—kinda.

This course is for anyone who wants to make their days a little better, which is to say, everyone. It’s especially for anyone who, when lying in bed at night after the hours have exhausted themselves, wonders, Where do I begin?

Fine: Unless that chicken parm is a very, very good chicken parm, it will not change your life, or at least not right away. But like everything else in Better With Time, it will change your day. And what is life but a great bunch of changing days dominoed together?

Up and at ’em. Sign up to begin the course here. And preview the first edition here.</div>

I&#39;m just waiting for somebody smart to convince the AI to sell services worth millions for pennies.  Like researchers/reporters did with the AI vending machine.

we will be running out of &#39;best persons&#39; soon.

A junior sales rep costs $150K a year?  Since when are college hires in sales that expensive?

What I suspec if this is true is this is just a guy who hires out his own social circles, these aren&#39;t applicants just coming in, it&#39;s all &quot;yo hire my boy&quot; and that boy happens to also come from an already very wealthy family.

Also they never quite mention *what* these things are selling, it&#39;s not a platform itself, it must be selling access to the network which if it already has a gathering of 10k people who are already part of an extremely narrow slice of the population then you don&#39;t really need to sell i

This is a wild ass guess but maybe something like 60k base salary plus 30k in bonuses, 65k worth of overhead...

Of course if they&#39;re making 30K in commission, that means they&#39;re making sales and thus more than paying for themselves.  Which makes it an odd place to try to cut cost.

Surely they&#39;ll need a few modifications before that&#39;s viable. For instance, are the currently available AI Agents even capable of accepting multi-million dollar pay-outs?

Train them on your best grift and they become grifters.

Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world&#39;s largest community of business-to-business founders.

I can&#39;t even tell what this guy&#39;s business does in the first place. And I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve heard of this company.

(From TFA) That month, though, during the SaaStr Annual — its yearly gathering of over 10,000 founders, executives, and VCs — two of its high-paid sales representatives abruptly quit.

Still can&#39;t quite tell. Do they run events for other companies? I tried to check Wikipedia, but they don&#39;t even have a page there.

So next I did a general search. First result from DDG:

https://www.saastr.com/ [saastr.com]SaaStr | B2B + AI Community, Events, Leads

I clicked on the link for their page, and got hit in the face with AI this, AI that. They offer advice, vibe coding, etc. etc. It looks like his company is an AI-heavy startup that caters to other AI startups. And he&#39;s telling us he&#39;s all-in on AI? Wow that&#39;s a shocker.

So the one remaining question is - did an AI agent arrange for this paid advertorial, or was it a human?

Calling yourself &quot;godfather&quot; is a sure indication of a scam.

I expect that one of these sales agents will sell the whole company to some random troll for $1. Don&#39;t forget this is the same guy who put an AI coding agent in charge of his software development, which randomly deleted his production database:

https://www.theregister.com/20... [theregister.com]

And if this guy is really the &quot;Godfather of SaaS&quot; then he is probably among the top 50 most destructive human beings alive right now.

I bought one of those AI agents and I don&#39;t need any of Lemkin&#39;s products now.

If most of your business can be replaced with software (AI), then you will not be able to compete anymore. Anyone with spare computing power and electricity is going to be able to do what you already do. And there are countries other than the US that are using government money to fund infrastructure for power, networking, and data centers.

The push for jamming AI into every possible orif... er, office, already sucked mightily. Now it&#39;s a fucking diSaaStr...

&quot;My spam-bots need less human intervention to dupe morons.&quot;

back in the late ‘90s a rogue DNS registrar called “.cool” offered TLD services to folks that didn’t want to conform to INTERNIC’s policies. we could always do that again.

You have to get the TLD recognised by the root DNS servers, or get everyone to add new root servers that recognise the alternative TLDs.

Same reason LetsEncrypt languished for years before they first got a trusted cert provider to let them issue blanket certs, and then they got their own root certs trusted by all the browsers.  But that took years.

Are there people out there making backup copies? Same with wikipedia .. which could get shutdown anytime.

Trump has had the thing for almost a decade and they only busted him for was lying on a federal firearm form and doing blow.

The point was not the firearm charges. The point was the Burisma dealings of Joe Biden who at the time was running for presidency.

The amount of outright censorship about the laptop was also legion. Countless accounts were banned who dared to mention that the laptop was real.

Your narrow focus on one issue surrounding the laptop exemplifies the dismissiveness of the outright truth telling by various people who do not align with the Democrat party.

I like a lot of progressive ideas. But I do not believe in usin

Really?  Covering up the Gaza genocide is a leftist position now?  Supporting the Iraq war was leftist?  Burying stories about Dow, ADM and Monsanto was leftist?  Pretending that no one could predict the Mortgage Meltdown or the Dot Bomb so no one should be prosecuted was leftist?  Etc. etc. etc.

Yeesh, I&#39;d hate to see what it takes to qualify as &#39;right wing&#39; in your book.

Supporting the Iraq war was leftist?Unfortunately, yeah. The support was bipartisan. I hate Bush (and always opposed the Iraq war) but he did a good job building bipartisan support, I admit it.

It&#39;s wild to watch supposedly educated people try and rationalize in real time their political dogma.

If merely reading the words of your cult leader offends you then you might want to do some self reflection.

The Reagan Badministration pretty much eliminated any &#39;leftists&#39;, they&#39;ve only moved further and further to the right, even approving of the Iraq invasion.

Free access to video editing hardware and cameras was probably really useful 20 years ago. That said, now you can record high definition video on your phone, edit it on your laptop, and post yourself to YouTube.

If you&#39;re good it it, you can probably produce better content yourself that what was available on most small public access channels 20 years ago. Sure, you&#39;re not going to be able to produce the next Ken Burns war documentary that way, but the barriers of entry are much lower than what they were befo

Plenty of books involving AI to show the way. ;-)

Soon we will se shows that are completely AI generated pushing some strange agenda.

I wouldn&#39;t fuck them with YOUR dick, much less mine.

I watched PBS growing up and learned so much from this valuable resource. Cooking with Julia Child and Jacques Pepin. Home improvement and woodworking with Bob Vila and Norm. Can&#39;t forget the Woodright&#39;s Shop either. Or is building furniture by hand too woke? Hell I don&#39;t particularly enjoy country music but I watched the entire Ken Burns series on it. Why? Because it was interesting and I learned something. Hell some years ago I caught a show about using muon detectors to passively scan the great pyramids.

Just more of the dumbing down of the country. Fuck everyone involved in this.

You&#39;re absolutely correct. PBS was pretty cool.

where can we get learing with no public brodcast, need money?

It&#39;s interesting that he chose not to co-opt public broadcasting for his own propaganda and instead chose to shut it down and rely on his good friends at Fox to do the propaganda for him.  Had this been Russia, Putin would have put money into public broadcasting (and thumb screws of course), not cut it, and use it as a propaganda tool.  Along the way of course Putin eliminated and co-opted private media companies until now there really only is the state-run media for news and political opinion, and dissenting voices are very effectively quelled and even disbelieved by most Russians.  This is happening in the US now too under the threat of civil litigation by the president (so weird that people now think this is normal and acceptable).  It&#39;s just a slightly different path is all.

Let&#39;s be clear.  No one thing is a prelude to fascism.  But it&#39;s certainly an interesting step and one of many.  The GOP has wanted to end public broadcasting for decades.  I think it&#39;s mainly about money and power. They want to control the narrative and make money off of it (Rush Limbaugh was one of their heroes). They used to be afraid to cut things like public broadcasting when they were in power just like how until recently all  Conservatives in Canada would never have dared to try to eliminate the Canada Health Act.  Trump has certainly emboldened right wingers&#39; worst and most base instincts.  Oh there I go with my TDS again.  Need more meds. Oh wait, can&#39;t afford them now.

This whole thing sort of reminds me of a funny line from Yes Prime Minister where Humphries is explaining that even though most people don&#39;t (or can&#39;t) go to the National Theatre. they want it funded because it&#39;s nice to know that it&#39;s there, similar to the Church of England.

This is cheaper and Fox will say what he wants already. Plus reducing the size and spend of the government is a primary goal. The kind of people who watch PBS aren&#39;t going to believe him anyway.

Simpler is that you are a simpleton and couldn&#39;t recognize a fascist unless they were impersonating Hitler; while the OG fascist you&#39;d probably not recognize. Musk&#39;s salute is too Italian so he can&#39;t be pro-fascist...

Quality &quot;content&quot; was still produced in modern times without much in the way of alternatives funding such creation. It&#39;s insulting to just call it &quot;content&quot; because youtube is loaded with shit content.

The little TV I do watch is PBS; or crap infomercials or the crap local news which only makes

I think it&#39;s mainly about money and powerIt&#39;s much simpler than that. There is a list of stuff the government should do. Running television stations isn&#39;t on that list for a lot of people. Nor radio stations. Nor newspapers. Nor publishing companies or social media networks.

Give it a rest. &quot;accusing&quot; the current administration of doing? Come on. The fascist administration knows no law, and they are abusing the law to the FULLEST.SO don&#39;t give me that crap about &quot;The Democrats MAY do it&quot; They could have hung Trump out to dry with the Epstein files. They didn&#39;t because it wasn&#39;t *lawful* to do so.

God I hate you stupid anons. You think your argument holds water? Post under your real name. I think you know it&#39;s shit and are just stirring your own little shit pot.

Oh please.  Those Bolsheviks leak like a sieve.  If those files had anything at all to do with Trump it would have been on the front page of the NYT or WaPo while Alzheimers-boy was president.

so you would prefer more overt propaganda on FOX? okay. meanwhile there are fewer resources that teach kids to literally fucking read. but no big deal, you think what you think.

While PBS are left leaning, they are not at all propaganda.  It&#39;s one of the few stations where news is still not treated as entertainment.

I still remember am early interview with someone from the Trump team during his first term.

The interviewee immediately started quoting alternate facts and Judie had this look of, &quot;You&#39;re... going to do this here?&quot; in disbelief.

President Donald Trump’s military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is flatly illegal under international law and almost certainly illegal under federal law—an unauthorized use of force against a foreign nation that pushes executive power past its breaking point. Yet there is no real chance that the courts will curb it, even as the mission evolves into a possible occupation of Venezuela and an expansion of hostilities to its neighbors. Nor is there any signal that Congress will impose restraints on what appears to be the dawn of a new conflict overseas, surrendering its constitutional war powers to Trump without objection. And even if Congress does try to assert its authority to oversee (or end) military action in South America, it will face an uphill battle in a judiciary that persistently favors the commander in chief.

This inversion of our constitutional order sets a perilous precedent that even many celebrating Maduro’s fall may come to regret. It marks the death knell of the post–World War II settlement that, however imperfect, wrestled the anarchy of war into a framework designed to condition armed aggression on legal justification. The executive branch’s consolidation of power now reverberates far beyond the United States’ shores as a saber-rattling president abandons any pretense that the law can constrain his resort to military force. Indeed, the legal theories the administration has floated to defend its actions draw on a historical source Trump once disavowed: the arch-interventionist claim that the U.S. has an inalienable right to police the world.

It is difficult to tally all the ways in which the Maduro operation was illegal, but start with a point that few dispute: This act violated international law. Trump’s invasion of Venezuela to capture its president cannot be squared with Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which bars member nations from deploying “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” This principle—the most important rule of international law today—should bind the United States, which ratified the charter in 1945. And it clearly prohibits the American government from invading another country to make an arrest.

Yet Mike Waltz, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, did not even pretend that the administration complied with Article 2(4) in his address to the U.N. Security Council on Monday. Instead, Waltz rejected the premise that this rule should apply to Venezuela at all, because Maduro was an “illegitimate narco-terrorist” and “fugitive from justice.” Of course, if a country can disregard the U.N. Charter whenever it concludes that another nation’s leaders have given up their claim to “territorial integrity or political independence,” then the charter means nothing. Arguably worse was Waltz’s insistence that Venezuela’s vast “energy reserves” also justified the action, a motive Trump has laid bare from the start. It should go without saying that the charter does not, under any circumstances, permit one nation to invade another to secure control over its natural resources.

So what is the government’s legal defense of its military incursion into Venezuela? The administration purports to be following the Panama precedent of 1989—when President George H.W. Bush ordered the military invasion of Panama to arrest its dictator, Manuel Noriega, ostensibly so he could stand trial in the U.S. But this episode was not approved by Congress (which found out just hours before) or the U.N. (which condemned it) or a federal court (which never passed on its legality). Instead, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel justified the aggression in a secret memo signed by William Barr, who would go on to serve as attorney general for the first Bush and Trump.

In that memo, Barr claimed that the president has inherent constitutional authority to conduct extraterritorial arrests for violations of U.S. law. Even if those arrests require complex military incursions into foreign nations, he wrote, they remain within the president’s inherent powers and do not require congressional approval. Barr further asserted that these arrests did not have to comply with Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. That provision, he wrote, does not actually bind the executive branch because it is not “self-executing,” freeing the commander in chief to disregard it.

This conclusion was obviously wrong: Even if the charter cannot be enforced by federal courts, it remains binding on the executive branch and is a law that the president has a constitutional duty to faithfully execute. The memo was so absurd, in fact, that the DOJ did everything in its power to conceal it, as New York University law professor Ryan Goodman has documented. After Congress demanded to see Barr’s memo, the department refused, even failing to comply with a subpoena ordering its disclosure. When Barr eventually testified about its contents under oath, he omitted its assertion that the president can “override” the U.N. Charter (a legal justification that made up a mere four paragraphs). The Clinton administration finally released the memo in 1993, and in the years since, legal experts have derided it as “deeply counterintuitive and indefensible,” “fundamentally flawed,” “preposterous,” and utterly “bereft of citation to supporting authority.”

But embrace, for a moment, the nihilism of Barr’s memo and assume that international law imposes no legitimate constraints on the president’s use of force. Even then, Trump’s actions in Venezuela would still be illegal—or, most generously, an egregious distortion of the constitutional war powers. It is Congress, after all, that has the authority to declare war and must authorize use of military force. The president is the commander in chief, the civilian leader of the armed forces, but he holds no independent power to commence hostilities. Needless to say, Congress has neither declared war on Venezuela nor authorized military force within its borders.

From where, then, did Trump derive authority to invade Venezuela? As Harvard Law professor Jack Goldsmith has explained, the administration evidently contrived it from its desire to arrest Maduro on federal charges. The logic goes like this: The DOJ sought to take the dictator into custody on charges of drug trafficking. It could do so only by storming Venezuela. That operation would require protection from the military. And as a matter of “unit self-defense,” these accompanying troops had a right to bomb, shoot, and otherwise overwhelm any threats to the mission through lethal force. This rationale is quintessential bootstrapping: The alleged goal of trying Maduro in the U.S. gives Trump permission to launch a hostile incursion into a sovereign nation, whose ramifications may well give rise to a broader regional conflict.

Georgetown Law professor and Slate contributor Steve Vladeck has laid out the danger of this shameless maneuver: It subverts the constitutional order by allowing the president to set off offensive military operations under the pretext of carrying out an arrest warrant on foreign soil. If troops face any resistance, they can escalate with further use of force, sliding quickly toward war—all without authorization from the legislative branch. So the Trump administration’s apparent rationale is less of a loophole than a complete end run around Congress’ war powers with no limiting principle in sight.

Despite all this, no one seriously thinks that any federal court will slow or stop Trump’s attacks in Venezuela and its neighbors. Americans seem to have consigned ourselves to the reality that legal constraints on the commander in chief’s operational decisions are entirely theoretical, with no meaningful mechanism for enforcement. Congress has handed over to the president more and more of its authority over foreign affairs. The Supreme Court has persistently forbidden federal judges from second-guessing the executive branch’s use of military force. (That’s why the Trump administration’s legal defense comes not from a court decision but from a self-serving opinion produced by the Department of Justice.) And the rest of the world has no means to secure accountability for the United States, which does not even recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.

So Trump, already a “unitary executive” at home, becomes a kind of ersatz emperor abroad, bound by no law of nations, no treaty or charter, no checks but those he elects to honor. The post–World War II consensus, as enshrined in the U.N. Charter, rejected this kind of unbridled aggression as an invitation to perpetual conflict. Trump, in turn, rejects that consensus. It may be tempting to ignore the consequences of this radical new doctrine when it is wielded against an illegitimate dictator like Maduro. But Trump is already threatening action against Colombia, Cuba, Iran, and even Mexico, a liberal democracy with a legitimately elected president. The end point, it seems, is whatever this president says it is. That theory of American dominance does not merely push legal limits. It subordinates law to the logic of conquest.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Saturday morning, in what the Trump administration dubbed Operation Absolute Resolve, Delta Force commandos entered the compound of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and extracted him from his own country. They took his wife too, and killed dozens of Venezuelans in their path.

Members of the administration say this was about accountability. Attorney General Pam Bondi says Maduro is about to face the “full wrath of American justice.” She alleges he’s been running Venezuela as a narco-state.

Shane Harris, a staff writer covering national security and intelligence at the Atlantic, says the administration’s actions are not surprising. Since September, the United States has been obliterating fishing boats off Venezuela’s coast and calling it a drug war.

The logic behind Maduro’s extradition is equally hard to explain. And Harris doesn’t want to call it a regime change. The regime remains in place: The vice president is now the interim president.

“That’s still the regime,” he says. “And now I think the United States is not running Venezuela, as President Trump said they were going to do. I think that the United States is essentially holding Venezuela at gunpoint and saying to the new interim president, You’re going to do what we want and govern the country according to these demands, or you’re going to face consequences.”

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris tries to answer a few of the bigger questions about what just went down in Venezuela. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: I think some people would look at what’s happened over the weekend and say, “Oh, are we at war with Venezuela?” So are we?

Shane Harris: No. Look, we’ve taken hostile action against Venezuela. Could Venezuela say we’re at war with them? Sure. Yes. We invaded their country. I mean, we violated their territorial sovereignty. But Congress has not declared war.

Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, says this is primarily a law-enforcement action because members of the FBI were there to serve papers to Maduro. That is not normal, right?

No, that’s not normal. In the most technical sense, the mission that occurred over Caracas was the Department of Justice issuing an arrest warrant on the president of Venezuela and his wife, escorted by the U.S. military. That’s one hell of an escort. So, sure, in a very narrow, technical sense that is true, but that obviously obscures the reality of what happened here.

What I thought was interesting about the whole law-enforcement-operation framing of this was that Donald Trump was not reading from that script when he was briefing reporters. And in many ways, he seemed to go off script. He talked about this as removing a corrupt dictator and getting Venezuela to pay back what was stolen—to use his words—from the United States in terms of oil and oil revenues. And you could see, both in the other officials who were briefing and in Rubio’s comments on the Sunday shows, an effort to try to walk this back and frame it a bit more narrowly. But the president does what he often does, which is he goes off script. He gets grandiose in his explanations. And that points to the fact that there is no coherent strategy for what is happening right now.

My understanding of things is that Maduro was offered the opportunity to go into exile in Turkey. And he was like, “Oh, thank you.” And they’re like, “All right, we’re coming to get you.” So there were clearly weeks of, if not negotiation, discussion or raising of stakes.

From our reporting and that of other journalist colleagues, the administration wanted him to leave peacefully, go into this kind of gilded exile, as it has been described. The question remains, then: Who was going to replace him? Who would come next? And that seems to be the part that they haven’t quite figured out yet.

There were those clearly within the anti-Maduro camp, both in the administration and publicly, who wanted to see him go and be replaced with possibly the person who everyone agrees actually won the election for president in 2024, Edmundo González, or even with María Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize winner who has been such a huge force for democracy and activism in Venezuela.

Machado was banned from running, so she ran someone else in her stead, but it was sort of as if a vote for him was a vote for her. But Machado has been thanking Trump. She’s very deferential to him, clearly aiming for this goal of “OK, and I’ll take over.” But that’s not what happened.

It’s not what happened, and he was quite dismissive of Machado in his comments in Florida this weekend, essentially saying that she doesn’t have the respect in Venezuela, that there’s not really support for her. This is a very strange argument for him to make. And I think it’s a false argument because everybody agrees, including people in the Trump administration, that González, the candidate who essentially ran in her stead, won by a healthy margin. He is actually the legitimately elected leader of Venezuela. The United States has been saying that for months and months now. So why, then, is the person to replace Maduro his own vice president? Why are you sticking with the same regime?

The vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, got in front of cameras and was basically like, “Maduro is our president, and these people are trying to take our oil.” She doesn’t seem to be a pliant member of Team America here.

Yeah, at least not outwardly. We do have to hold open the possibility that there’s been some behind-the-scenes discussions. There has been reporting that she was in conversations with people in the Trump administration, saying, “If Maduro goes, I can take over, and maybe we can work something out.”

She’s known for straightening out the oil industry in Venezuela, making sure they could make money off it. Doesn’t she have a kind of tangled personal history and reasons not to maybe want to have this American oversight?

She is in the mold of Hugo Chávez and Maduro. This is not somebody who is the pro-democracy, pro-America kind of figure that we would expect to see in some of the other alternatives. She has impressed people in the West and in the U.S. and the administration as a competent technocrat. She is somebody we can do business with. That is how the Trump administration sees her.

What do you think is going to happen in Venezuela now? Who is in charge, and what does that mean for the actual people of Venezuela?

The next step—and this is what we should be watching for in the next couple of days—is some kind of signal or statement from Rodríguez about whether she is willing to negotiate with the U.S. [Editor’s note: Following the taping of this episode, Rodríguez issued a statement on Instagram, including this message: “We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence.”] Rubio has been very clear on behalf of the administration in laying out the demands and what he wants to see action on. And so now we will see if she can at least pay lip service to that in the coming days. I think that will go a long way toward lowering the temperature.

If she continues to be defiant—and, in the way that she was right after Maduro was captured, saying, “He is the legitimate president, we demand that he be brought back right now, we will not be colonized by anyone”—then you’re going to see that temperature raise back up, and that’s going to increase the likelihood that Trump will use military force again. What that looks like afterward I’m not even sure the administration knows. I’m not sure they’re thinking that far ahead.

Two days after the U.S. military action that forced Nicolás Maduro out of power and into a New York courthouse, two big questions remain: What happens next in Venezuela—specifically, who’s in charge? And, related to that: Who’s in charge of U.S. foreign policy?

At his Saturday press conference, where he announced the nabbing of Maduro, President Donald Trump said—to widespread astonishment—that the United States will soon “run,” or even is now “running,” Venezuela.

The next morning, on NBC’s Meet the Press, in an only slightly less baffling moment, Marco Rubio, Trump’s secretary of state and national security adviser, backpedaled on his boss’s claim. Asked whether the U.S. will really run Venezuela, Rubio replied, “Yeah, I keep [seeing] people fixating on that.” He continued: “The bottom line is, we expect to see changes in Venezuela. … It’s not running the—it’s running policy, the policy with regards to this. We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction” that would be “good for the people of Venezuela … [and] in our national interest.”

First, there should be no mystery why people are “fixating” on Trump’s claim. It’s because, in the course of his Saturday press conference, the president said 12 times that he and a group of his choosing, including Rubio himself, would “run” Venezuela.

Second, there is a distinction between running a foreign country and influencing its direction, even when this influence stems from a U.S. naval armada that remains off Venezuelan shores and an explicit threat from Trump to send in a second, larger wave of U.S. troops to enforce our influence.

Hence the question: Who is running American foreign policy—the president or his chief foreign policy adviser?

The question isn’t trivial. First, the answer will shape what happens next in Venezuela—who governs, to whose benefit, and with what level of internal freedom and stability? Second, it could shape what lessons other countries—friends and foes—take from Operation Absolute Resolve, the quite large and impressive military action that unfolded in the wee hours on Saturday. Will Russian President Vladimir Putin see the claim of unabashed regional imperialism as a winking green light to his claim of control over Ukraine? Will Chinese President Xi Jinping infer the same about his claims over Taiwan? Will the mullahs of Tehran take it as grounds for fear of an impending U.S. attack? How seriously will Cuba’s leaders take Trump’s—and Rubio’s—warnings that as goes Caracas will soon go Havana, whether by U.S. attack or self-immolation?

Given the regional and global stakes, one might think that Trump and his team would have worked out a unified message to explain and justify this audacious (to say the least) military action. Instead, this is just another case in point that Trump’s actions often have no underlying strategy—which is to say, no clear idea of how to link means and ends: or, in this case, just what the desired ends are.

Some of those ends are clear, as Trump laid out on Saturday and as neither Rubio nor any of the other officials flanking him contradicted: the desire for sole domination of the Western Hemisphere (as had been spelled out in his National Security Strategy document) and the desire for control of its oil and the wealth it produces.

Leaving aside the wisdom and legality of those goals, the press conference and Rubio’s subsequent caveat made clear that the administration has not thought through just how to obtain them—i.e., it’s clear they have no strategy.

If Trump is serious about “running” Venezuela, how, and through what agent, does he plan to do this? He said that Maduro’s former deputy, Delcy Rodríguez, who has now been sworn in as his interim successor, was an acceptable intermediary, and that Rubio is working with her. (Rodríguez herself, a longtime fiery Maduro associate who at first denounced the abduction, has since said she’s willing to “collaborate” with the U.S. to redevelop her country, though added, perhaps wishfully, that she wouldn’t let it become a U.S. colony.)

The same question applies if Rubio’s slightly less coercive notion of merely influencing the country’s policy applies. Maduro’s ministers remain in charge; the Venezuelan military retains ultimate power, offering security and oppression, assisted by at least 20,000 Cubans, many officers and some health care workers who have provided health care in exchange for Venezuelan oil. Will the military now be swayed toward northern-leaning sentiments, given the evaporation of the wages that Maduro provided and the continuing blockade of the country’s oil for as long as they refuse to budge? Some insiders were apparently bought off during the planning of the incursion. The CIA had recruited at least one person close to Maduro to keep track of his movements; it’s reasonable to assume that wasn’t the only spy.

And what about the democratic opposition? Trump shoved aside any role in a new government for María Corina Machado, the movement’s leader, saying, “She doesn’t have respect in the country.” And he said nothing about the leader of her party, Edmundo González Urrutia, who legitimately won the 2024 election and who fled in exile to Spain after Maduro, who was soundly defeated, held on to power. Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her valiant struggle (perhaps to the bitterness of Trump, who many times said he deserved it), issued a statement, calling on Urrutia to be brought back to lead the country. Will the democrats on the streets and elsewhere second her demands, or will they simply bow down to the continued reign of Maduro’s team just because it will now be tempered a bit by influence from Washington and the big oil companies?

This too has broader implications. The United States cannot easily claim to be leader of “the free world,” or even a champion of democracy, if it ousts a dictator—a feat that many Venezuelans cheer—but then does nothing to help restore the real, freely elected president.

There is also something a bit fishy about the official rationale for the military operation, which was to bring a criminal fugitive to justice, given that the U.S. extracted him through means that were likely in violation of international law. Yes, a U.S. grand jury indicted Maduro for drug smuggling back in 2020, and in the wake of his abduction this weekend, the Justice Department filed additional charges—most of them legitimate. (I say “most,” rather than “all,” because one of them, possession of a machine gun, seems an odd charge to level against a foreign head of state, however illegitimate he might be.)

Which leads to one more broad point. The United States has had a pretty successful record of overthrowing foreign leaders but a pretty lousy one of imposing order, or accomplishing whatever outcomes it has desired, in the aftermath. (Some obvious cases in point: Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Guatemala, and—going back several decades but one with enormous implications later on and ever since—Iran.)

A reporter at Saturday’s press conference asked Trump about this mixed record with previous presidents. His reply was evasive to say the least:

With me, that’s not true. With me, we’ve had a perfect track record of winning. … If you look at [the assassination of Qasem] Soleimani, you look at [Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi, you look at the Midnight Hammer [the air raid on Iranian nuclear targets] … we have essentially peace in the Middle East because of that. … So, with me, you’ve had a lot of victory. You’ve had only victories, you’ve had no losses.

There are several disturbing things about this passage, quite aside from the fact that “peace in the Middle East” remains, in many ways, aspirational. The most pertinent here is that Trump seems to believe that a dramatic tactically successful strike—the killing of a terrorist leader, the bombing of a nascent nuclear facility, the signing of a multiphase 20-point peace treaty (but the accomplishment of just the first phase), and now the extraction of a horrible dictator—amounts to a strategic victory and the fulfillment of an ambitious policy.

Trump doesn’t think he has to care about what happens next in Venezuela or what he needs to do to make it happen, to improve the odds of success or reduce the odds of catastrophe, however those terms are defined.

In Operation Absolute Resolve, the U.S. military showed itself to be, as it has several times in recent years, an agile, effective, supremely coordinated instrument of national power. Whose resolve it enforces, to what ends, is another matter. The policymaking machinery at the top of America’s power structure is appallingly adrift.

Donald Trump’s moves to invade Venezuela, abduct its president and first lady, invite global corporations to exploit its resources, and leave the nation’s feckless authoritarian regime largely intact range from blatantly illegal to facially insane. And the MAGA response to them is the most illustrative yet of the movement’s utter ideological and moral bankruptcy. This is a president who promised to put America first: He ran on isolationism, as well as an end to the era of wars of choice, foreign quagmires, and the U.S. as the world’s police officer. What Trump has offered instead: wars of choice, with America as the world’s plunderer—and his followers not only cheer but invent ridiculous pretexts to defend this utterly unjustifiable move.

Trump is clear: He does not care about restoring democratic governance to Venezuela. He doesn’t like Nicolás Maduro and wanted the spectacle of bringing him to the U.S. in handcuffs. He does like Venezuelan oil, and because he believes that American military power should allow him to grab whatever he’d like, he plans to take a lot of it. The administration likes to accuse Venezuela of flooding the U.S. with drugs, and in theory that’s one of the reasons Maduro is being prosecuted—but the former president of Honduras faced similar charges and received a pardon from Trump. The president says the U.S. plans to “run” Venezuela for … well, how long is unclear. He doesn’t plan to give a helping hand to María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader who observers say won last year’s election but saw it stolen by the Maduro regime. She also recently won the Nobel Peace Prize that Trump believes he deserved, and her accepting it instead of refusing it and saying it should go to Trump is, according to some insiders, the reason he’s hanging her out to dry. (“If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ she’d be the president of Venezuela today,” one source told the Washington Post.) Instead, he’s backing Maduro’s No. 2, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, whom Trump sees as more amenable to American oil interests.

In other words: He’s keeping Maduro’s disastrous despotic regime in place, just with a new figurehead. There seems to be no real plan to extract the U.S. from Venezuela. And now the president and his lackeys are threatening to invade other countries too: Cuba, Mexico, Colombia, Greenland.

This flies in the face of everything MAGA supposedly stands for. So what are MAGA loyalists doing in response? They’re lining up and making excuses.

Why did Trump pardon the Honduran president for what prosecutors deemed “one of the largest and most violent drug-trafficking conspiracies in the world”? Per Secretary of State Marco Rubio, “He felt that in that particular case there was unfairness.” (If you asked Trump himself: “The man that I pardoned was, if you could equate it to us, he was treated like the Biden administration treated a man named Trump,” he said. “This was a man who was persecuted very unfairly. He was the head of the country.”) Maduro, of course, was also the head of a country—but for some reason, that’s different.

What about Trump’s promise at his inauguration that “we will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, by the wars we never get into”? Or, as Vice President J.D. Vance put it on the pages of the Wall Street Journal, “Trump’s Best Foreign Policy? Not Starting Any Wars.” Per that same Vance, who seems to be channeling the “Everyone Is 12 Now” theory of MAGA politics, starting wars is OK, actually, if you’re mad enough. “Are we just supposed to allow a communist to steal our stuff in our hemisphere and do nothing?” he asked on X.

As for whether we’re occupying Venezuela, that’s a no, unless it’s a yes. Rubio told Face the Nation that we aren’t. Sen. Tom Cotton claimed that Trump’s statement that the U.S. “runs” Venezuela actually “means the new leaders of Venezuela need to meet our demands.” But when asked who is in charge in Venezuela, Trump offered a clearer answer: “We’re in charge.”

But wait, isn’t MAGA an anti-interventionist movement? “This is not interventionism,” insisted Sen. Lindsey Graham, straining the possible meaning of the word interventionism beyond reality.

MAGA talking heads were even more blatant about justifying the invasion. Influencer Will Chamberlain, back in 2020, asserted that “the Republican Party is no longer the party of regime change and endless wars” and warned: “If you want to be its standard-bearer, that is a nonnegotiable position.” He is now cheering that “the future of American foreign policy isn’t regime change, but regime control.” Mike Cernovich didn’t shy away from the idea that America is turning Venezuela into a new American colony, arguing, “Occupation is moral when done correctly.” (What does a moral occupation look like? It means choosing “to rule a primitive people and extract resources for our benefits, with the Christian moral duty to elevate them.”)

“I’m as reflexively non-interventionist as anyone can possibly be,” wrote conservative provocateur Matt Walsh, “but Venezuela appears to be a resounding victory and one of the most brilliant military operations in American history.” After deeming international law “fake and gay,” he argued, “The only international law is that big and powerful countries get to do what they want.” I’m not sure what definition of noninterventionist translates to “Big and powerful countries get to do what they want, including intervene abroad,” but this is MAGA morality in one tweet: Whatever Trump does is good, words are meaningless, and there is no ideology except that whatever Trump does is good.

The usual MAGA defectors—Thomas Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene—offered their usual criticisms that this isn’t what MAGA stands for. But the protests are starting to ring a little hollow after the 456th time the president said he would do something, then did the opposite. What is now apparent to anyone willing to see it is that there is no MAGA ideology. There is no moral core. There is no organizing philosophy. There is simply a reckless and self-interested president who desperately wants to be admired, who is a master of distraction, and who sees the White House as a very fine way to enrich him and his family.

There is much to distract from in this moment. We don’t hear a lot these days about the president’s old promise to “drain the swamp,” perhaps because it’s astoundingly obvious that the White House has never been swampier. The recently released secret testimony from special counsel Jack Smith clearly places the president at the head of a criminal conspiracy to undermine a free and fair election in the United States. Americans continue to struggle to afford basics, and Republicans just jacked up millions of people’s health insurance premiums. The release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein’s sex crimes has not been flattering to the president, which is perhaps why his administration continues to withhold a great many of them. Trump’s deportation scheme is increasingly unpopular, as it turns out that most Americans don’t love the idea of a racist paramilitary force nabbing people off the street and shipping them to a Salvadoran torture prison.

“Start a war for oil to distract from problems at home” is the dumbest plot, but it seems to be our current storyline. And most of MAGA, a hollowed-out movement of unprincipled and morally vacant shills and sycophants, seems keen to play along.

In 2026, there’s one easy resolution we should all commit to: Be better consumers of media.

Traditional media is in crisis, thanks to a combination of Trump administration attacks, corporate takeovers, and technological innovations. Social media sites compete for our attention by offering us addictive little bites: outrage-bait tweets and short-form shock-value TikTok videos, served up according to algorithms that track how long we linger and feed us more and more of what keeps us locked in (which is often what makes us angry).

For young people raised on smartphones, this has meant that most of them seem to lack the attentional ability to actually read news articles in their entirety. Only 15 percent of adults under 30 say they follow the news most or all of the time, and that statistic has declined since 2016, according to Pew. While the majority of Americans over 50 regularly seek out the news, young adults largely do not—70 percent of them say they see political news simply when they come across it, which happens largely via social media. Nearly 40 percent rely on “influencers” for news because, as one 21-year-old man told Pew, “if I agree with that person already, if I already have background with that person, then I’ll probably trust him more than some news site.”

This is troubling enough. Except now, some once legitimate news outlets are following suit and pledging to tell viewers what they want to hear and already believe, rather than what’s true and what it means. CBS, now helmed by former opinion writer and Substacker Bari Weiss, just relaunched its flagship show CBS Evening News, newly anchored by Tony Dokoupil, who opened the program’s reboot by telling viewers, “On too many stories, the press has missed the story. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you.” Dokoupil promised, “From now on, what you see and hear on the news will reflect what you see and hear in your own life.”

Programming that simply regurgitates what people already see, hear, and believe in their own lives is not, by any definition, “news” or even new. News media of course report stories that are relevant to their readers’ and viewers’ lives. But they should also be reporting the things those readers and viewers should know but don’t: political corruption or malfeasance; the actions of the very powerful; the disasters afflicting those less fortunate; innovations and world-changing achievements; the ways in which choices made in Washington invisibly but indelibly shape the lives of average people. The job of the reporter is to report what’s true, and to help the reader or viewer understand why it matters or what it means, which often requires bringing in subject-matter experts who are less “elites” than people who have spent years amassing knowledge and whose insights can expand minds and deepen public understanding. Mimicking the social media model of simply affirming people’s own beliefs, biases, and animosities and insisting that the guy next door knows as much about nuclear fission as a nuclear physicist is anathema to real journalism.

It’s also perpetuating the problem. People have lost trust in mainstream media not because mainstream media outlets have routinely lied to and manipulated them. People have lost trust in mainstream media at least in part because canny political actors have told the public that mainstream media has lied to and manipulated them, and that instead they should trust their own gut—and, naturally, highly ideological activists who use short-form video and text as tools to drive engagement (and drive up their own relevance and wealth).

Take, for example, the recent fraud scandal in Minnesota. Dozens of people, many of them Somali immigrants, have been accused and convicted of bilking federal social services programs for hundreds of millions of dollars in a sprawling and remarkably well-organized scheme involving autism care and a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future. (The alleged mastermind of the plot was the nonprofit’s head, a white woman.) President Donald Trump has jumped on the issue, using it to hammer his anti-immigrant views; several prominent conservatives have called to denaturalize and deport U.S. citizens who were involved in the plan.

Now right-wing influencers have made uncovering other acts of alleged Somali fraud something of a competition. In an act that has shades of Pizzagate, one man showed up at day care centers wielding a camera and demanding to be let inside, ostensibly to prove that there were no children there and the centers were more illegal money grabs; he seemed confused that day cares are typically locked to outsiders and don’t have formal reception areas, and he has been unable to offer any actual evidence of fraud. Nevertheless, his video went viral and was shared by the vice president and the director of the FBI. And there have been real and devastating consequences: Innocent Somalis have been harassed and threatened; Somali-run day cares have been vandalized. Based, it seems, solely on the claims of one right-wing influencer, Trump has cut off all federal child care funding to Minnesota, money that thousands of families rely on to afford care for their kids.

Conservative influencers are claiming that there was a widespread cover-up not only by Democrats in office, but by news media. “Right now the mainstream media is doing nothing to cover the Somali fraud in Minnesota,” one conservative activist with a million followers tweeted a few days before the new year. MAGA Voice told its 1.4 million followers that “CBS hasn’t reported on Minnesota/PBS hasn’t reported on Minnesota” and continued that convention to accuse six mainstream television networks of not reporting on the fraud case. “You literally can’t find a single mainstream article about the Minnesota fraud … Not even one,” reads one tweet, which has been shared more than 9,000 times.

“Somali fraud” became a talking point in right-wing circles thanks to an article in the conservative City Journal co-authored by right-wing activist Christopher Rufo. It claims that not only were Somalis defrauding the government, but, as the headline says, “the largest funder of [the terrorist group] al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.” The piece then proceeds to include no evidence for its al-Shabaab claim, save for one quote attributed to an anonymous source. (Later in the piece, a law-enforcement official notes that Somalis, like many immigrant groups, send money to relatives back home, and that in Somalia, al-Shabaab is “taking a cut”—not that Somali Americans are sending reams of cash to terrorists, or that the Minnesota taxpayer is their primary bankroller.) That they were just hearing about this scandal, conservatives claimed, was evidence of the media’s complicity in a cover-up.

It was, instead, evidence of their own insularity, incuriosity, and apparent inability to read the news or even google. The City Journal article came out in mid-November; the New York Times had covered the case in March and again in August and kept up reporting as the story evolved and as federal indictments turned into mounting convictions. Sahan Journal, a Minnesota publication catering to the Somali community, wrote about it a year ago. The Associated Press, CBS News, and half a dozen local news outlets were following the story months before Rufo was on the case.

It is true that, so far, mainstream media outlets have not gone around accusing day care operators of malfeasance with no evidence beyond an online search, a hunch, and an unheeded demand to be allowed into child care centers to video the kids; this is a good thing. Real investigative journalism concerns itself with getting the facts right, and that takes time. Unlike in the Feeding Our Future scheme, there is no criminal case to cover in these so far unsubstantiated claims of day care fraud.

Being the first influencer to accuse immigrants of a serious crime may drive engagement and make one a right-wing hero, but it’s not the same as actual investigative reporting, which requires verifying facts rather than simply asserting them. And when reputable outlets get things wrong—and, being run by humans, they sometimes do—they publicly correct the record. Ideologues and influencers tend to just ignore or deny their own mistakes. If the influencer pounding on day care doors is shown evidence that the care centers are legit, do we think he’ll admit he was wrong, let alone go viral for it? And if he does walk back his claims, will the many millions who have taken them seriously get the memo—or will they continue on with the impression that a rampant fraud occurred and the legacy media simply refuses to talk about it? Do we believe that the president will restore child care funding and repay any lost wages to the parents whose ability to work just got scrambled?

This is all incredibly corrosive. The incoming A.I. era seems primed to supercharge this already perilous situation. With bots sounding more human by the day and the ability to create highly realistic photos and videos of just about whatever one pleases, the very concept of a shared reality may be in rapid decline. What we observe with our own eyes on our phones—what we see and hear political leaders saying, what we see and hear our fellow citizens doing—is becoming less reliable, and it takes ever greater sophistication to ferret out what’s real.

In this new Alice in Wonderland semireality, we need honest, accountable, real journalism. Instead of shoring up reputable outlets, though, too many are being sacrificed to the president by greedy owners who seem eager to profit handsomely even if it comes at the cost of America’s once robust democratic functioning enabled by the fourth estate. CBS’s rightward turn, including the appointment of Weiss—who was an opinion writer (not a reporter) with no experience in TV news—has come in the wake of its parent company’s acquisition by Skydance Media (now Paramount Skydance), owned by David Ellison, the son of Trump-supporting billionaire Larry Ellison. The younger Ellison was able to acquire Paramount only with the approval of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency the president has captured and whose power he continues to abuse. Announcing the merger, FCC chairman and Trump loyalist Brendan Carr said that he welcomes “Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network,” including the appointment of a right-wing think tank employee as the broadcaster’s new ombudsman.

Ellison is now in a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN—another network the president believes is against him. Trump has implied that he will again abuse the FCC’s power to grant or block the merger the younger Ellison badly wants. It’s not hard to see Weiss’ decision to pull a ready-to-air 60 Minutes segment about the Salvadoran torture prison to which Trump is deporting immigrants—after the president complained that 60 Minutes had been mean to him—as part of a broader strategy to gut media companies that allow reporters to do their jobs rather than serve as mouthpieces for the administration, all in the service of enriching a tiny few.

There is not much the average American citizen can do to stop billionaires from seizing and eviscerating long-standing news networks, and other authoritarian leaders have run similar playbooks in their own countries, most notably in Hungary. What we can do, though, is direct our dollars and our attention to the reputable and well-run outlets that remain—and even though local news was dying well before Trump’s second term and national outlets are being disemboweled as if Hannibal Lecter is on the run, there are, thankfully, still many newspapers, news magazines, and television news networks doing real journalism. But they are facing threats from all sides: a vengeful president; a distracted and disengaged audience used to endless scrolling and pop-pop-pops of entertainment; the creeping unreality of A.I.

Fundamentally, we all need to be better news consumers. News outlets also see what’s shared and what’s ignored, which stories draw clicks and eyeballs and which are scrolled past, which outlets are growing their subscription bases and which are shrinking. That doesn’t determine editorial decisions, but it would be naive to believe that it doesn’t at all shape them. And if reputable news outlets aren’t getting readers and viewers, they also aren’t earning subscriber and ad dollars, which means there’s less cash to pay journalists to do the often-slow and often-pedantic work of good journalism.

It’s not just journalism that’s at stake; it’s your own brain. Do you believe you are better off getting news and information primarily from social media feeds that have been cultivated to push your particular outrage buttons, delivered by people who are accountable to no one? Or might it be better for your mind (your intellectual abilities and your basic sanity) to read a range of stories from across a big and complicated world, and sometimes see your priors challenged?

It’s practically a national pastime to complain about the media. Instead of asking “Who says stuff I agree with?,” try questioning a publication’s or individual’s editorial policies. Do they check their facts and check them again before publishing, to make sure they get it right most of the time? Are they transparent when they’re wrong? Do they hold the powerful to account, no matter who “the powerful” may be? Do they approach their subject matter with curiosity rather than an agenda?

Social media, A.I., Trump, and corporate greed do not have to be the end of reliable journalism. But they’re definitely not going to save it. As the old PBS slogan goes, that’s only made possible by viewers like you.

            <div id="article-text">If you don&#39;t say &quot;yes way&quot; to MFA, the consequences can be disastrous. Sensitive data belonging to about 50 global enterprises is listed for sale – and, in some cases, has already been sold – on the dark web following a major infostealer campaign, with apparent victims including American utility engineering firm Pickett and Associates; Japan&#39;s homebuilding giant Sekisui House; and Spain&#39;s largest airline Iberia.

The thief, who goes by the moniker Zestix or Sentap, steals data from corporate file-sharing portals by using compromised cloud credentials obtained from information-stealing malware. And none of the purported victims enforced multi-factor authentication (MFA), according to Hudson Rock, an Israeli cybersecurity company that specializes in infostealers.

Stolen credentials combined with a lack of MFA are always a recipe for disaster, as we have seen in earlier big breaches such as Change Healthcare, British Library, and Snowflake customers&#39; database hacks.

&quot;Because the organizations listed below did not enforce MFA, the attacker walks right in through the front door,&quot; the cybersecurity shop said in a Monday report. &quot;No exploits, no cookies – just a password.&quot;

We&#39;re told Zestix gains access after employees inadvertently download infostealer-laden files to their devices. The stealer malware, such as RedLine, Lumma, or Vidar, then snarfs up saved credentials and browser history.

The cybercriminal, who has been operating as an initial access broker and extortionist since at least 2021, specifically targets enterprise file synchronization and sharing (EFSS) platforms like Progress Software&#39;s ShareFile, Nextcloud, and OwnCloud.

The Register reached out to all of the apparent victim companies listed in this story, plus the file-sharing software providers. As of press time, only one of them, Progress, had responded to our inquiries.

&quot;Hudson Rock&#39;s investigation found that these recent compromises of corporate file-sharing portals - including ShareFile instances - were not the result of platform vulnerabilities, but consistent with the use of credentials previously stolen from infostealer-infected devices,&quot; a Progress spokesperson told us, adding that the compromises &quot;appear to have involved the use of valid credentials in environments where multi-factor authentication was not enforced, which may have enabled unauthorized access.&quot;

The spokesperson added, &quot;Progress continues to emphasize the importance of implementing multi-factor authentication as a widely recognized control to help mitigate the risk of credential-based attacks.&quot;

We will update this story if and when we receive any additional responses.

Most of the organizations listed in the Monday report have very sensitive data and span critical sectors such as utilities, aviation, robotics, housing, and government infrastructure, making this massive data dump particularly concerning.

The Register last week reported that Pickett and Associates, a Florida-based engineering firm whose clients include major US utilities, was among the apparent victims after the data thief posted for sale 139 GB of engineering data about Tampa Electric Company, Duke Energy Florida, and American Electric Power. Zestix was selling this trove for 6.5 bitcoin, which amounts to about $585,000.

At the time, Pickett declined to comment, while a Duke Energy spokesperson told The Register that the company is investigating the criminal&#39;s claims.

Hudson Rock reports that Zestix obtained the engineering data by abusing stolen ShareFile credentials.

Turkey&#39;s Intecro Robotics, which manufactures aerospace testing equipment and defense robotics, was also reportedly victimized via ShareFile sans MFA. This 11.5 GB dataset reportedly contains critical military intellectual property.

Brazil&#39;s Maida Health is yet another of the 50-ish alleged victims, and the 2.3 TB dataset accessed via a Nextcloud instance reportedly contains the health records and sensitive personal information belonging to the Brazilian Military Police and their family members.

Burris & Macomber, a law firm that represents Mercedes-Benz USA in its lemon law cases and warranty litigation, was also an apparent victim, with the criminal claiming to have stolen active lemon law cases, defense strategies, and settlement policies from 48 states, along with thousands of customers&#39; records containing VINs, license plates, home addresses, and phone numbers.

The Iberia Airlines breach reportedly contains 77 GB of technical safety data and confidential fleet information.

Pwned engineering servers belonging to CRRC MA – the Massachusetts subsidiary of the world&#39;s largest rolling stock manufacturer – reportedly contained complete signaling drawings, SCADA RTU lists, and &quot;deliberately withheld&quot; test reports regarding doors, HVAC, and propulsion systems, along with sensitive security info such as GPS coordinates of control rooms and battery rooms.

And the list of reported victims goes on … and on, and on.

The report illustrates the growing problem with infostealers, a favorite method of ransomware gangs and other financially motivated criminals.

It also highlights the growing trend of criminals simply logging in – not breaking in – to cloud accounts, which security experts have been warning about for the past couple of years.

Plus, as Hudson Rock reports, &quot;while some credentials were harvested from recently infected machines, others had been sitting in logs for years, waiting for an actor like Zestix to exploit them.&quot; This, the team adds, shows a &quot;pervasive failure&quot; in corporate credential hygiene with organizations neglecting to rotate passwords and invalidate sessions.

&quot;It is time for organizations to enforce MFA and monitor their employees&#39; compromised credentials,&quot; the security firm notes. We couldn&#39;t agree more. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At most businesses today, the IT department gives laptops out to employees so they can easily take their work with them. But HP has a different idea: build a Windows computer into a full-size keyboard and let you carry that around, plugging into monitors and mice along the way.

Announced on Monday at CES 2026, the HP EliteBoard G1a looks like a standard desktop keyboard, complete with 93 keys, including a number pad. Its keys have a solid 2 mm of travel, more than most laptops, and felt OK to type on during our brief hands-on, but it&#39;s not mechanical so isn&#39;t the best keyboard money can buy. However, look at the back surface and you&#39;ll notice a small vent where air comes out and either two USB-C ports, or, on some SKus, a single port with a built-in USB-C cable that hangs off it like a tail.

The idea is that you plug the EliteBoard G1a into a monitor that has USB-C video input and allow it to send data and get power over a single wire. Connect a wireless mouse and you&#39;ve got your workstation covered. Maintain a similar monitor and mouse setup at home and you can carry just the keyboard back and forth.

If your monitor, like the majority on the market, doesn&#39;t have a USB-C input, you can use an included USB-to-HDMI adapter to connect. You can use a 65 W USB-C power adapter to juice the G1a if it&#39;s not getting electricity directly from the monitor.

The G1a weighs between 1.49 and 1.69 pounds, depending on config, and measures 14.1 in x 4.7 in x 0.7 inches, so it is more portable than most laptops, though it is longer and thicker than some. At its CES preview, HP showed off a long, thin envelope you can use to carry it and said it would also fit into any laptop bag that holds a 16-inch or larger laptop.

The G1a comes powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 5 or 7 (330, 340, or 350 Pro) with integrated AMD Radeon 800 graphics and an NPU that runs at up to 50 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second). Those specs make it a Copilot+ PC by Microsoft&#39;s standards, which means you get certain offline AI features like Microsoft Recall, Click to Do, and Windows Studio Effects. You can get it with up to 64 GB of DDR5 5600 MT/s RAM and up to 2 TB of SSD storage, along with Wi-Fi 6E or 7 connectivity.

When it comes out in March, the G1a will be available either with or without an embedded cable. It&#39;s unclear what the price difference will be, but having an embedded cable is a disadvantage because it makes the keyboard harder to carry safely and easier to break.

You&#39;ll also be able to configure the G1a with or without a 32 Wh battery that HP claims can offer up to 3.5 hours of unplugged use or two days in sleep. It&#39;s difficult to imagine a scenario where you&#39;d need to use the keyboard without a power source, but having it be asleep while you carry it from one destination to another would be a huge plus.

HP is marketing the EliteBoard G1a as an enterprise device, which means enterprise-grade security. The keyboard PC will have HP Wolf Security for Business, which protects the BIOS from firmware attacks.

By building the PC into a keyboard and selling the G1a based on portability, HP hopes to change business behavior from laptop culture to keyboard culture. This could theoretically work in businesses that practice hoteling and expect employees to carry their keyboard to whatever hot desk they are using today.

However, asking employees to have a similar monitor and mouse setup at home seems like an additional hassle that IT departments won&#39;t want and, if the business has to pay for this home monitor, the cost of this solution and the support needed become more of a hassle. We don&#39;t know how much the G1a will cost either. To justify itself, it would have to cost significantly less than a business laptop.

Where we could see the G1a taking off is in call centers or other environments where desk space is tight. In lieu of buying an all-in-one PC, companies could buy HP&#39;s keyboard computer and stick it on the desk for various employees to use as they come on and off shift. But taking it back and forth between locations seems like a rare use case.

Those looking for a more traditional portable computer will find options in HP&#39;s new lineup of EliteBook X G2 laptops. These 14-inch laptops are available with a choice of three different processor platforms from each of the three PC CPU manufacturers. The EliteBook X G2i features Intel&#39;s upcoming &quot;Panther Lake,&quot; Core Ultra 5, and Ultra 7 series processors, while the EliteBook X G2q (Q for Qualcomm) is powered by Snapdragon X2 Elite or X Plus processors, and the EliteBook X G2a (A for AMD) runs AMD Ryzen AI 5, 7, or 9 chips.

The 14-inch laptop weighs around 2.4 pounds (1.09 kg) in most configurations, but there&#39;s also an Intel-powered G2i lightweight config that starts at 2.2 pounds (998 g) and a bend-back 2-in-1 called the EliteBook X Flip G2i that tips the scales at 2.86 pounds (1.29 kg). Depending on config, you can get it with a variety of screen panel options, ranging from a 1920 x 1200, 300-nit panel on the low end to a 2880 x 1800 OLED touch screen that goes up to 700 nits and 120 Hz.

The EliteBook X G2 series laptops are available with up to a 2 TB PCIe SSD and as much as 64 GB of LPDDR5x RAM. They sport a 5 MP webcam that has an IR sensor for facial recognition and can do human presence detection to tell if you&#39;re at your seat.

You can power the EliteBook X G2 with an included 65 W or 100 W power adapter (your choice). There&#39;s a built-in three-cell, 56 Wh or six-cell, 68 Wh battery.

All versions of the laptop come with Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, Bluetooth 6, and the option of adding a 5G modem. In the case of the EliteBook X G2q, the modem comes from Qualcomm, while the AMD and Intel versions have HP R15 or R18 5G connectivity. The lightweight G2i model is Wi-Fi only.

If your company has a Microsoft 365 Copilot account and you own or plan to buy an HP Enterprise printer that works with its ecosystem of Workpath apps, you&#39;ll soon be able to get that AI directly in your print/scan solution.

Dubbed HP for Microsoft 365 Copilot and due out this spring, the new on-printer software lets you do new AI-related kinds of things directly from the printer/scanner&#39;s touch screen. First, you&#39;ll be able to redact personally identifiable information from documents before you print them. Imagine scanning in a resume or opening it up from OneDrive and having the name and other information blacked out so that hiring managers can only look at the qualifications.

You&#39;ll also be able to have Copilot suggest file names for documents you scan so that you can easily identify them when looking through your folders. As you might expect, Copilot will also print AI-generated summaries of documents in lieu of the documents themselves and will do translation on-device. ®

            <h2>AMD clocks in with higher CPU speeds, leaves architecture untouched</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-06</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AMD kicked off CES on Monday by unveiling a slew of desktop and mobile processors aimed at everyone from casual users and creative professionals to gamers and AI devs. But with few improvements, they&#39;re more &quot;newish&quot; than new.

As usual, AMD&#39;s marketing leaned into superlatives: all-day battery life; best-in-class CPU and GPU performance; and more AI TOPS than the average person could reasonably find use for.

OK, maybe they didn&#39;t say it quite like that, but AMD is going all in on the AI PC transition, predicting a crossover point in 2026.

However, apart from a new brand name here and a new SKU there, not much has actually changed under the hood for the House of Zen&#39;s CES lineup.

Take, for example, AMD&#39;s new Ryzen AI 400 series processors, which can be had with up to 12 cores capable of boosting to 5.2 GHz, an NPU good for 60 TOPS, and support for faster 8533 MT/s memory.

But if you look a bit closer, you&#39;ll quickly realize that apart from higher CPU, GPU, NPU, and memory clocks, the 400 series is essentially the same as the 300 series. They have the same Zen 5 cores, same XDNA 2 NPU architecture, and RDNA 3.5 GPU. Even the core counts remain unchanged. The chips just clock higher, so AMD is adding a &quot;100&quot; to the name.

With that said, higher clocks should translate into meaningful performance gains even if there are no juicy micro-architectural improvements to dig into.

Systems supporting these refreshed chips are slated to arrive later this quarter from the usual suspects.

Alongside the new 400-series lineup, AMD also announced two new Ryzen AI Max+ SoCs, which you may recognize by its internal codename: Strix Halo.

Both slot in under AMD&#39;s top-spec AI Max+ 395, which we looked at in detail last year and include the 12-core Max+ 392 and 8-core Max+ 388. What makes these special is that they feature the same 40 CU RDNA 3.5 GPU as found in its flagship part, which is capable of delivering 60 teraFLOPS of peak AI performance at BF16.

Sticking with the AI PC narrative, AMD is positioning the AI Max+ line, which you may have noticed isn&#39;t getting the 400-series rebrand just yet, as a small-form-factor workstation for multimedia professionals and local AI devs.

Compared to Nvidia&#39;s $3,999 DGX Spark, AMD says its Max+ 395 offers between 1.5x and 1.7x higher tokens per second per dollar in gpt-oss 20B and 120B. This doesn&#39;t actually tell us anything about how they compare, just that AMD&#39;s chips can be had for less and thus are a better value.

If you want to know how Strix Halo actually compares to DGX Spark, you can find our comparison, including the same HP Z2 Mini G1a used by AMD, here. However, the TL;DR is that, in most GenAI workloads other than LLM inference, the Spark is 2-3x faster at BF16 than Strix Halo.

Then again, AMD isn&#39;t wrong about its chips being able to run Windows or Linux. And, on Windows, generative AI performance should improve a fair bit with version 7.2 of AMD&#39;s ROCm machine learning framework set to arrive on both Windows 11 and Linux in February.

The new Max+ SKUs will be available in Q1 from a slew of OEMs including HP, Lenovo, Framework, and Minisforum to name a few.

Finally, for gamers, AMD has a new desktop processor, but just like the Ryzen AI 400, &quot;new&quot; just means bumping up the frequency of an existing product.

The Ryzen 7 9850X3D is essentially a 9800X3D with a 400 MHz higher boost clock, which now tops out at 5.6 GHz. We&#39;re told the chip itself is otherwise identical with eight Zen 5 cores, 104 MB of cache, and a 120 W TDP.

According to AMD, the 9850X3D&#39;s higher clocks net it a 7 percent higher performance in gaming. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, we don&#39;t have pricing for the part.

On the bright side, we won&#39;t have to wait long to find out. Just like the majority of chips AMD is launching at CES, it&#39;s also arriving later in Q1. ®

            <h2>Intel unleashes Panther Lake CPUs, first built on 18A process</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/intel_unleashes_panther_lake_cpus/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel has finally let its new Panther Lake CPUs out of the cage. First detailed in October and now launching under the brand name Intel Core Ultra Series 3, these are the first chips made with Intel’s 18A process and boast improved power efficiency and performance, particularly for graphics and AI workloads.

Laptops with the chips will start shipping as soon as January 27, with Chipzilla boasting more than 200 design wins, including the new Dell XPS 14 and 16, which have just been announced and will be available for pre-order starting Tuesday, with a choice of Intel Core Ultra Series 3 configs. These laptops are all about long battery life, with Dell boasting in its press materials that they both lasted more than 40 hours while streaming 1080p video.

These new processors will also appear in devices other than laptops. Intel claims that they have been certified for embedded and industrial use in robotics, healthcare devices, and other kinds of edge computing hardware.

As part of its announcement, Intel revealed that there will be 14 SKUs of Core Ultra Series 3. These range from the 16-core, 5.1-GHz Core Ultra X9 388H on the high end to the 8-core, 4.4-GHz Core Ultra 5 322 on the low end.

All of the processors have either eight or 16 cores composed of three types of core. Each processor has four P or performance cores, which offer the highest clocks and use the most juice. Then there are LP E cores, which use the least amount of power and are the slowest. Then 16-core chips also have eight E cores which are somewhere in the middle. The goal is to offload as many tasks as possible onto the LP E and E cores to save power while lighting up the P cores for demanding tasks such as gaming.

Whatever cores it uses, Panther Lake’s new architecture promises power savings thanks to its die shrink from a 3 nm process to a 2 nm process, its use of denser RibbonFET transistors, and its shifting of power delivery to the back of the wafer.

The company claims that transistor density has increased by 30 percent while performance per watt is up 10 percent on single-threaded tasks and 50 percent on multithreaded tasks versus the prior-gen Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake CPUs. All of the SKUs carry a base power of 25 watts with turbo wattages of 65 or 55 W. Intel said that the top SKUs – the Core Ultra X9 and Core Ultra X7 – provide 60 percent better multithreaded performance and 77 percent faster gaming.

In another power-saving move, Core Ultra Series 3 processors will support Intel Intelligent Display technology, which uses AI to change screen settings based on what tasks you are performing and what you are doing. So, if you walk away, the screen instantly goes into a lower brightness and lower refresh rate than when you’re actively working. Similarly, if you are reading emails, it can lower the refresh rate and then raise it again when you’re watching videos or playing games. The lower your refresh rate and screen brightness, the less power your computer uses.

As we wrote about in October, not all of Panther Lake is made by Intel’s 18A process. The compute die, which contains the CPU and NPU, is made with 18A, but the platform controller is made by TSMC and the integrated GPU is either built by TSMC or Intel on its Intel 3 process, if it’s one of the lower-end models.

Speaking of graphics, Panther Lake comes with Intel Arc GPUs built in that each has up to 12 Xe cores for graphics and can deliver up to 120 TOPS (Trillion Operations per Second) when used for AI workloads. The GPUs enable Intel XeSS (super sampling) and XeSS-SR (Super Resolution), along with XeSS-MFG (multi-frame generation) and XeLL (low latency), all of which allow games to achieve faster frame rates through the power of AI upscaling and quicker response times.

Endurance Gaming Mode is designed to help improve battery life while gaming by lowering the frame rate at times. The Arc graphics also use XMX (Xe Matrix Extensions) and XMX engines to help with their AI processing.

All of the Core Ultra Series 3 SKUs feature low-power NPUs that can achieve up to 50 TOPS themselves. The idea is that, where performance is key, the GPU will perform AI workloads, but where the task is simple enough, the NPU can do it while sipping a lot less juice.

Many of the chips have built-in support for Thunderbolt 5, which can provide 80 Gbps of bidirectional, wired connectivity and 120 Gbps in Bandwidth Boost mode. Others support only Thunderbolt 4, which is limited to 40 Gbps connections.

Either way, as long as the manufacturer puts a Thunderbolt port on the laptop, you can use the standard to connect to monitors and docks that provide video, data, and charging over a single cable. The laptops will also support Thunderbolt Share, which allows you to share screens, keyboard, mouse, and files over a single cable.

All of the chips support built-in Wi-Fi 7 with Bluetooth 6.0. Those are the latest wireless standards you can get.

The Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors support up to 96 or 128GB of LPDDR5x or DDR5 RAM, depending on SKU. The two X series chips, the Core Ultra X9 and Ultra X7, support RAM that operates at up to 9,600 MT/s, while other units support only up to 8,533, 7,467, or 6,800 MT/s. ®

            <div id="article-text">Nvidia&#39;s DGX Spark and its GB10-based siblings are getting a major performance bump with the platform&#39;s latest software update, announced at CES on Monday. The AI mini PC is also getting access to the GPU giant&#39;s full suite of AI Enterprise apps, alongside integrations with RTX Remix and Hugging Face&#39;s Reachy robotics platform.

First teased at CES 2025 under the codename Project Digits, the DGX Spark is a tiny AI workstation designed to support rapid prototyping, GPU-accelerated software development, and local AI training and inference workloads.

While it&#39;s billed as the &quot;world&#39;s smallest AI supercomputer,&quot; the machine isn&#39;t actually that powerful with the computational grunt equivalent to an RTX 5070. What sets it apart from the rest of Nvidia&#39;s lineup is the inclusion of 128 GB of unified memory, all of which can be allocated to the GPU. That&#39;s the most of an Nvidia workstation product, save for the DGX Station.

Since the Spark&#39;s launch in October, Nvidia has been hard at work improving the system&#39;s performance by an average of 2.5x across a number of software libraries and frameworks, though we haven&#39;t had the opportunity to independently verify those claims just yet.

But before you get too excited, don&#39;t expect to see the Spark churning out tokens twice as quickly as before. The decode phase of LLM inference, during which tokens are generated, is bandwidth-limited. The Spark can&#39;t actually get much faster here.

Instead, Nvidia has confirmed that most of the performance gains in this software release are for the compute-intensive parts of the genAI pipeline. For LLM inference, these updates will predominantly improve prefill performance, which reduces the time from when a prompt is submitted to when the Spark begins generating a response.

Updates include enhancements to Nvidia&#39;s inference engine, TensorRT LLM, Llama.cpp, and PyTorch to name a few. The latter, we&#39;ll note, should help to improve other compute-intensive workloads like fine tuning and image or video generation.

Nvidia also announced plans to make its full AI Enterprise suite available on the Spark as a subscription service later this month.

The suite includes access to a host of enterprise-focused applications, frameworks, models, and microservices designed to streamline the development of AI apps and services.

Normally the suite runs for $4,500 a year per GPU or $1 an hour per GPU in the cloud, but we&#39;re told Nvidia does plan to offer special pricing for Spark, although that&#39;s not official yet. Nvidia does make the offering available at no cost to developers, but a paid plan is required to use applications and services built on it in production.

We&#39;ve reached out to Nvidia for comment; we&#39;ll let you know if we hear anything back.

In any case, the offering should help to assuage concerns over long-term software support. When the Spark launched, many expressed fears that the $3,999 AI lab in a box could be rendered a golden paperweight in a few years if Nvidia failed to release updates to DGX OS, the company&#39;s custom spin of Ubuntu.

Some older development boards, like the Jetson Nano, have faced such a fate. The single-board computer never advanced past Ubuntu 18.04, which hasn&#39;t been supported since 24.04 came out a couple of years ago.

Nvidia tells us this shouldn&#39;t be the case for the Spark or other GB10-based systems.

&quot;We&#39;re committed to support. In fact, we just released the latest kernel with some security patches,&quot; Allen Bourgoyne, director of product marketing for Nvidia&#39;s professional visualization business, said in response to our questions.

The real test will be whether we see Nvidia base DGX OS for the Spark on Ubuntu 26.04, which will be Canonical&#39;s next long-term support release.

Support for third-party Linux distros, like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), would go a long way to mitigating concerns of obsolescence, but it doesn&#39;t appear to be on the table just yet.

Nvidia says it&#39;s focusing development on DGX OS for now. But the company could still release the drivers and firmware packages necessary to get GPU acceleration working on the GB10 on other distros.

Alongside Nvidia&#39;s software updates and subscription services, the company plans to release a version of its Nsight CUDA code assistant capable of running entirely on the Spark. Previously, the models used by the assistant were too large to fit on Nvidia&#39;s consumer graphics offerings and therefore were limited to the cloud, making it less useful for privacy-conscious enterprises.

Nsight is expected to arrive on the Spark later this spring.

For gamers, Nvidia is extending RTX Remix support to the Spark. The platform is designed to support the development of game mods that take advantage of Nvidia&#39;s ray tracing accelerators. With the integration, activities such as text generation can be offloaded to the Spark.

Meanwhile, for robotics enthusiasts, Nvidia says it&#39;s working on a new guide that pairs the Spark with Hugging Face&#39;s Reachy robot. The desktop robot is designed to support the development of embodied AI frameworks and services.

Finally, we&#39;ve learned that Nvidia could soon extend support for Spark clusters containing more than two systems.

One of the Spark&#39;s more interesting features is the inclusion of a ConnectX-7 NIC with a pair of QSFP+ ports capable of delivering 200 Gbps of bandwidth between them.

Nvidia currently supports linking up to two Sparks (or GB10 partner systems) using these ports, but in theory there&#39;s nothing stopping someone from building a whole cluster of them. Nvidia tells us that it&#39;s seen interest from customers for larger clusters and its engineers are actively exploring the possibility. ®

            <div id="article-text">CES used to be all about consumer electronics, TVs, smartphones, tablets, PCs, and – over the last few years – automobiles. Now, it&#39;s just another opportunity for Nvidia to peddle its AI hardware and software — in particular its next-gen Vera Rubin architecture.

The AI arms dealer boasts that, compared to Blackwell, the chips will deliver up to 5x higher floating point performance for inference, 3.5x for training, along with 2.8x more memory bandwidth and an NvLink interconnect that&#39;s now twice as fast.

But don&#39;t get too excited just yet. It&#39;s not like the chips are launching earlier than previously expected. They&#39;re still expected to arrive in the second half of the year, just like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra did.

Nvidia normally holds off until GTC in March to reveal its next-gen chips. Perhaps AMD&#39;s aggressive rack scale roadmap has Nvidia&#39;s CEO Jensen Huang nervous. Announced at Advancing AI late last spring and expected later this year, AMD&#39;s double-wide Helios racks promise to deliver performance on par with Vera Rubin NVL72 while offering customers 50 percent more HBM4.

Nvidia has also been teasing the Vera Rubin platform for nearly a year now, to the point where there&#39;s not much we didn&#39;t already know about the platform.

But even though you won&#39;t be able to get your hands on Rubin for a few more months, it&#39;s never too early for a closer look at what the multi-million dollar machines will buy you.

The flagship system for Nvidia&#39;s Vera Rubin CPU and GPU architectures is once again its NVL72 rack systems. At first blush, the machine doesn&#39;t look all that different from its Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra-based siblings. But under the hood, Nvidia has been hard at work refining the architecture for better serviceability and telemetry.

Switch trays can now be serviced without taking down the machine first. Nvidia also has new reliability, availability, and serviceability features which enable customers to check in on the health of the GPUs without dropping them from the cluster first. These health checks can now run between training checkpoints or jobs, Ian Buck, Nvidia&#39;s VP and General Manager of Hyperscale and HPC, tells El Reg.

At the heart of the rack is the Vera Rubin superchip, which, if history tells us anything, should bear the VR200 code name.

Much like Blackwell, the Vera Rubin superchip features two dual-die Rubin GPUs, each capable of churning out 50 petaFLOPS of inference performance or 35 petaFLOPS for training. Both of those numbers refer to peak performance achievable when using NVLFP4 data type.

Here&#39;s a quick overview of Rubin&#39;s speeds and feeds - Click to enlarge

According to Buck, for this generation, Nvidia is using a new adaptive compression technique that&#39;s better suited to generative AI and mixture of experts (MoE) model inference to achieve the 50 petaFLOP claim rather than structured sparsity. As you may recall, while structured sparsity did have benefits for certain workloads, it didn&#39;t offer many if any advantages for LLM inference.

Of course, higher-precision data types remain relevant for many workloads, whether for vision-language model inference, image generation, fine-tuning, training, or high-performance computing (HPC). In this respect Nvidia hasn&#39;t deprecated support for any data types, but its approach to some like FP64 has changed a little.

FP64 is essential for HPC and scientific computing workloads, such as physics simulations and material analysis, and compared to Blackwell, performance regressed from 45 teraFLOPS to 33 TFLOPS of double-precision vector performance on Rubin. For FP64 matrix applications, which are what the Top500 ranking of the most powerful publicly known supercomputers is heavily weighted toward, performance is achieved using emulation, an approach that was pioneered on Blackwell accelerators.

The GPUs are fed by 288 GB of HBM4 memory — 576 GB per superchip — which, despite delivering the same capacity as the Blackwell Ultra-based GB300, is now 2.8x faster at 22 TB/s per socket (44 TB/s per superchip). If that number seems a little high, that&#39;s because Nvidia initially targeted 13 TB/s of HBM4 bandwidth when it first teased Rubin last year. Buck tells us that the jump to 22 TB/s was attained entirely through silicon and doesn&#39;t rely on techniques like memory compression.

Nvidia&#39;s latest Arm CPU features 88 custom Olympus cores with SMT - Click to enlarge

The two Rubin GPUs are paired to Nvidia&#39;s new Vera CPU via a 1.8 TB/s NvLink-C2C interconnect. The CPU contains 88 of Nvidia&#39;s custom Arm-based Olympus cores and is paired with 1.5 TB of LPDDR5x memory — 3x that of the GB200. We guess we know why memory is in such short supply these days. Actually it&#39;s more complicated than that, but this certainly isn&#39;t helping the situation.

However, one of the most important features Vera brings to the table is support for confidential computing across the system&#39;s NvLink domain, something that previously was only available on x86-based HGX systems.

Nvidia&#39;s Vera Rubin NVL72 racks feature 72 Rubin GPUs, 20.7 TB of HBM4, 36 Vera CPUs, 54 TB of LPDDR5x which are spread across 18 compute blades interconnected by nine NvSwitch 6 blades which deliver 3.6 TB/s of bandwidth to each GPU — twice that of last gen.

Nvidia isn&#39;t ready to say how much power that additional compute and bandwidth will require. However, Buck tells us that while it will be higher, we shouldn&#39;t expect power to double.

Since announcing Rubin, Nvidia has decided not to use the NVL144 naming convention and to stick to counting SXM modules as GPUs rather than dies. (Image from GTC 2025) - Click to enlarge

If you&#39;re scratching your head wondering &quot;didn&#39;t Nvidia say this thing was supposed to have 144 GPUs?&quot; you wouldn&#39;t be the only one. At GTC 2025, Huang announced that they were changing the way they counted GPUs from the package to the dies on board. In that sense, the Blackwell-based NVL72s also had 144 GPUs, but Nvidia was going to wait for Vera Rubin to make the switch to the new convention.

It seems Nvidia has since changed its mind and is sticking with the established naming convention. Having said that, we may yet see Nvidia racks with at least 144 GPUs on board before long.

The Rubin CPUs we&#39;ve talked about up to this point actually are one of two accelerators announced so far. Rubin CPX is the other.

Unveiled in September, the chip is a more niche product, designed specifically to accelerate the compute-intense prefill phase of LLM inference. Since prefill isn&#39;t bandwidth-bound, CPX doesn&#39;t need HBM and can instead make do with slower DRAM.

Each CPX accelerator will be capable of churning out 30 petaFLOPS of NVFP4 compute and will sport 128 GB of GDDR7 memory.

In a graphic shared this summer, Nvidia showed an NVL144 CPX blade with four 288 GB Rubin SXM modules and eight Rubin CPX prefill accelerators for a total of 12 GPUs per node.

The complete rack system would only need 12 compute blades for the thing to have 144 GPUs, though only 48 of them would be connected via NVLink.

As with past Nvidia rack systems, eight NVL72 racks form a SuperPOD with the GPU slinger&#39;s Spectrum-X Ethernet and/or Quantum-X InfiniBand the glue used to stitch them together. Multiple SuperPODS can then be combined to form larger compute environments for training or distributed inference.

If you aren&#39;t ready to make the switch to Nvidia&#39;s rack-scale kit, don&#39;t worry. Eight-way (NVL8) HGX systems based around the Rubin platform are still available, but we&#39;re told liquid cooling is no longer a suggestion, but a requirement. These smaller systems, 64 to be exact, can also be combined to form a SuperPOD with 512 GPUs — just shy of the of the more powerful NVL72 SuperPOD at 576.

For this generation, Nvidia also has two new NICs, which it teased on a few occasions over the last year. At GTC DC, Nvidia showed off the ConnectX-9, a 1.6 Tbps &quot;superNIC&quot; designed for high-speed distributed computing, which we sometimes call the backend network.

For storage, management, and security, Nvidia is pushing its BlueField-4 data processing units (DPUs), which feature an integrated 800 Gbps ConnectX-9 NIC and a 64-core Grace CPU on board. This, we should note, isn&#39;t the same Grace CPU found in the GB200, but a newer version based on Arm&#39;s Neoverse V3 core architecture.

The beefier CPU is designed to offload software defined networking, storage, security, and can also run hypervisors for virtualized environments.

Cramming 64 Grace cores onto a NIC might seem like overkill, but Nvidia has a specific reason for wanting that much compute hanging off the machine like a computer in front of a computer.

Alongside all its shiny new hardware, Nvidia showed off what it&#39;s describing as a &quot;new class of memory between the GPU and storage,&quot; designed to offload key value (KV) caches.

The basic idea isn&#39;t new. KV caches store the model&#39;s state. You can think of this like its short-term memory. Calculating the key value vectors is one of the more compute-intensive aspects of the inference.

Because inference workloads often involve passing over the same info multiple times, it makes sense to cache the computed vectors in memory. By doing this, only changes need to be computed and data in the cache can be reused. This sounds simple, but, in practice, KV caches can be quite large, easily consuming tens of gigabytes in order to keep track of 100,000 or so tokens. That might sound like a lot, but a single user running a code assistant or agent can blow through that rather quickly.

As we understand it, Nvidia&#39;s Inference Context Storage platform will work with storage platforms from multiple partner vendors, and will take advantage of the BlueField-4 DPU, NIXL GPU direct storage libraries, and optimize KV cache offloading for maximum performance and efficiency.

Combined with technologies like Rubin CPX, this kind of high-performance KV offloading should allow the GPUs to spend more time generating tokens and less time waiting on data to be shuffled about and recomputed.

Nvidia&#39;s decision to &quot;launch&quot; Rubin — again it isn&#39;t actually shipping in volume yet — betrays an increasingly competitive compute landscape.

As we mentioned earlier, AMD&#39;s Helios rack systems promise to deliver floating point performance roughly equivalent to Nvidia&#39;s Vera Rubin NVL72 at 2.9 exaFLOPS versus 2.5-3.6 exaFLOPS of FP4, respectively. For applications that can&#39;t take advantage of Nvidia&#39;s adaptive compression tech, Helios is, at least on paper, faster.

However, with Nvidia planning to ship faster memory on Rubin than initially planned, AMD no longer has a bandwidth advantage. It does still have a capacity lead with 432 GB of HBM4 per GPU socket compared to 288 GB on Rubin. In theory, this should allow the AMD-based system to serve 50 percent larger MoE models on a single double-wide rack.

In practice, the real-world performance is going to depend heavily on how well tunneling Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) over Broadcom&#39;s Tomahawk 6 Ethernet switches actually works.

AMD&#39;s MI450-series GPUs appear very well positioned to compete against Rubin, but as we&#39;ve seen repeated with Amazon and Google, the ability to scale that compute often makes a bigger difference than the chip&#39;s individual performance.

AMD is also having to play catch up on the software ecosystem front. The company&#39;s HIP and ROCm libraries have certainly come a long way since the MI300X made its debut at the end of 2023, but the company still has a ways to go.

Nvidia certainly isn&#39;t making the situation any easier for AMD. At CES, the GPU giant unveiled a slew of new software frameworks aimed at enterprises, robotics devs, and the automotive industry.

This includes the development of new foundation models for domain specific applications like retrieval augmented generation, safety, speech, and autonomous driving.

The latter, called Alpamayo, is a relatively small &quot;reasoning vision language action&quot; model designed to help level-4 autonomous vehicles better handle unique and fast evolving road conditions. Level-4 capable vehicles are capable of driving fully autonomously, unsupervised driving in specific environments, like high-ways or urban environments.

Nvidia&#39;s autonomous driving stack is due to hit US roads late this year with the level-2++ capable Mercedes Benz CLA. This class of autonomous vehicle is capable of driving itself in similar conditions as level-4, but requires the supervision of a human operator.

With Nvidia kicking off the New Year with Rubin — a chip we hadn&#39;t expected to get a good look at for another three months — we&#39;re left to wonder what we&#39;ll see at GTC, which is slated to run from March 16-19 in San Jose, California.

In addition to the regular mix of software libraries and foundation models, we expect to get a lot more details on the Kyber racks that&#39;ll underpin the company&#39;s Vera Rubin Ultra platform starting in 2027.

As you might have noticed, Nvidia, AMD, AWS, and others have gotten in the habit of pre-announcing products well in advance of them shipping or becoming generally available. As the saying goes: enterprises don&#39;t buy products, they buy roadmaps. In this case, however, it&#39;s really about ensuring they have somewhere to put them.

Nvidia&#39;s Kyber racks are expected to pull 600 kilowatts of power which means datacenter operators need to start preparing now, if they want to deploy them on day one.

By 2027 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expects racks to surge to 600 kW with the debut of its Rubin Ultra Kyber racks (Image from GTC 2025) - Click to enlarge

We don&#39;t yet have a full picture of what Vera Rubin Ultra will offer, but we know it&#39;ll feature four reticle-sized Rubin Ultra GPUs, 1TB of HBM4e, and will deliver 100 petaFLOPS of FP4 performance.

As things currently stand, Nvidia plans to cram 144 of these GPU packages (576 GPU dies) into a single NvLink domain which is expected to deliver 15 exaFLOPS of FP4 inference performance or 10 exaFLOPS for training. ®

            <h2>These open-ear buds actually have decent noise reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853290/shokz-open-fit-pro-hands-on-ces-2026-headphones-wearables">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Shokz OpenFit Pro won’t replace regular ANC buds, but they do an admirable job on loud commutes.

The Shokz OpenFit Pro won’t replace regular ANC buds, but they do an admirable job on loud commutes.

My biggest gripe about open-ear buds is that they’re rotten for loud city commutes. Cue a pedantic audiophile pointing out that the whole premise of open-ear buds is to not block out sound. Yes, yes. But the unfortunate truth is that often means if you want open-ear buds for one situation, you’ll have to buy a second pair for when the train is screeching along the subway tracks while the local mariachi band starts busking in your car.

So I was intrigued when Shokz reached out to say at CES 2026, its new $249.95 OpenFit Pro buds would have “noise cancellation.”

Technically, the correct term is noise reduction. Active noise cancellation requires a sealed ear canal, whereas the OpenFit Pro don’t do that. Instead, the buds have a triple microphone array, a tweaked speaker design, and an adaptive algorithm to dampen unwanted environmental noise. Two of the microphones monitor environmental sounds, while a third microphone next to your ear tracks what’s reaching the canal.

I was deeply skeptical when Shokz first briefed me on the product. I’ve tested several Shokz open-ear buds (not to be confused with their bone conduction headphones). While they’re great for staying aware at home or in quiet areas, they’re Not Great, Bob for commuting. I often can’t hear my music — even at maximum volume — and forget audiobooks or podcasts!

To my surprise, whatever dark magic Shokz is using in these buds works pretty well. The difference is very noticeable, especially if you turn the reduction setting all the way up in the Shokz app.

Don’t get me wrong. True ANC is still better. It’s always going to be hard listening to audiobooks if there’s a live mariachi band in my train car. (To be fair, ANC headphones also struggle against the power of mariachi.) But during less disruptive commutes, I had little problem listening to music and was able to listen to my audiobooks in more scenarios. I’d say these are best suited to moderately loud environments. Think cafes, not so much bars.

At home, I was surprised at how well the buds masked the ambient hum of my air purifier and fridge. Of course, it’s no match for the TV if you’ve got a show going on in the background, but that’s not really the point. This is more or less the kind of earbud that lets you focus on your content, but still hear when your spouse yell-asks from another room if you’ve seen their keys.

In another plus, bass quality — another weakness for open-ear buds — has improved as well. This iteration of the OpenFit Pro now supports a range up to 40kHz and reduces distortion below 100Hz. There’s also Dolby Atmos support with head tracking, but that felt sort of gimmicky when I turned it on. Nice if that’s something you like, but not all that necessary with open-ear buds.

The main issues I’ve had in the past few weeks of testing are, once again, fit and design. The hooks still feel bulky behind the ear, especially when I wear them with glasses. Oftentimes, I don’t feel they sit on my ears as securely as I’d like. The case is also large, though I do appreciate the extra 50 hours of charge it provides. (The buds last 12 hours on their own; that drops to six with noise reduction.)

This is admittedly a niche kind of earbud. It’s the rare person who would be able to fully replace their AirPods Pro (or any other pair of ANC-enabled buds) with these. However, as someone who likes to keep my wits about me when walking, commuting, or puttering around the house, they’re much more useful than previous iterations of the device.

Loona DeskMate can pan and tilt to keep your iPhone camera following you.

CES is packed with AI companions and assistant robots this year, but the DeskMate from Loona is a clever take on the idea: it’s a desktop charging hub, with three USB-C ports, one USB-A, and a MagSafe pad, that automatically activates an AI companion app when you attach your iPhone to the wireless charger.

What’s unique about the DeskMate is that by using your phone, it takes advantage of tech you already have. It doesn’t need its own display, camera, or microphone, because the iPhone provides them (and it is, for now, iPhone-only). By providing charging too, it might replace a charger that’s already on your desk, rather than adding to the clutter.

The stand rotates and tilts, so that the DeskMate keeps looking at you as you talk to it. It’s got cute, Pixar-y eyes, but still has practical features like Slack integration and meeting assistance.

DeskMate is expected to launch in a crowdfunding campaign in March, but my big hesitation is the price. There’s no final figure yet, but the company told me it will be “below $300,” which is steep for a device that’s already piggybacking on your phone.

Nvidia is also adding joystick and yoke flight control support to GeForce Now.

Nvidia’s RTX 5080 rollout for its GeForce Now cloud gaming service is now complete, so it’s ready to announce some additional features for subscribers. In the coming months, Nvidia is planning to launch native GeForce Now apps for Linux and Amazon’s Fire TV devices, alongside flight control support for its cloud gaming service.

The native Linux app is a highly requested feature for GeForce Now, especially as subscribers have had to rely on unofficial apps or browser tweaks to get access to the service. A beta of GeForce Now for Linux will be available initially for Ubuntu 24.04 and newer soon, nearly a year after Nvidia made it easier to access GeForce Now on the Linux-based SteamOS.

“Right now, the GeForce Now Linux app is going to launch first as a beta on Ubuntu 24.04 primarily because this is a long-term support release that enables stable graphics drivers and consistent system libraries,” says Michael McSorley, product marketing manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with The Verge. “As we continually test the app, we’re going to be expanding formal support to additional [Linux] distributions in the coming weeks.”

Nvidia is also further expanding GeForce Now into the living room with support for Amazon Fire TV devices. The app will launch early this year for Fire TV Stick 4K Plus and 4K Max initially, allowing owners to stream PC games to their TV with just a controller.

If you’re a fan of Microsoft Flight Simulator, Nvidia is also introducing full flight control support for GeForce Now so that devices from Thrustmaster and Logitech will work on its cloud gaming service. That means you can connect a joystick or yoke to an underpowered laptop and stream a copy of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 with the controls all working in the game.

Nvidia is also enabling automatic sign-in for Battle.net accounts on GeForce Now this week, with Gaijin.net account support soon. And if you’re wondering when GeForce Now will finally launch in India, as Nvidia promised last year, it has been delayed to “sometime in Q1, 2026,” according to McSorley.

The latest G-Sync Pulsar monitors have a built-in light sensor so they can adjust brightness and color.

Nvidia is bringing a new set of G-Sync Pulsar monitors to the market this week that will automatically adjust brightness and color based on the ambient lighting in a room. Much like a modern laptop, these new monitors have a built-in light sensor that measures the brightness and color temperature of an environment to enable a screen to automatically adapt to different times of day.

“In bright daylight conditions it increases brightness and shifts to a color that’s cooler in temperature,” says Michael McSorley, product marketing manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with The Verge. “At night, or in darker rooms, it reduces brightness and uses warmer tones to minimize glare and eyestrain.”

While the process is automatic, much like a laptop display, you’ll still be able to fully control how this feature works so you can fine-tune it or disable it altogether directly through the monitor’s onscreen display.

The first displays that include G-Sync Ambient Adaptive Technology will be available on January 7th, starting at $599. Acer, AOC, Asus, and MSI all have new G-Sync Pulsar monitors with this automatic brightness feature, and they’re all designed more for professional esports players. Each model is a 27-inch IPS display running at 1440p and up to 360Hz refresh rate.

Nvidia first introduced its G-Sync Pulsar monitors last year, as part of a partnership with MediaTek to integrate its current and future G-Sync features into MediaTek scalers and eliminate the need for dedicated G-Sync modules. G-Sync originally required a dedicated module in 2013 to allow it to synchronize display refresh rates to a GPU, eliminate screen tearing, and reduce display stutter and input lag.

All RTX owners will get DLSS 4.5 model and image quality improvements today.

Nvidia is announcing its next major update to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) feature at CES today. DLSS 4.5 includes Nvidia’s second-generation Super Resolution transformer model and a new 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series GPUs that uses AI to generate up to five additional frames for every single rendered one.

DLSS 4.5 will be available for all RTX GPUs today, but will run the fastest on Nvidia’s latest RTX 40- and 50-series cards. The latest transformer model is designed to improve image quality overall and reduce some of the artifacting that we saw with DLSS 4.

“This second-generation model is our most sophisticated yet,” says Henry Lin, director of product management at Nvidia, in a briefing with The Verge. “It utilizes 5x the compute power over the original transformer model, it’s trained on a significantly expanded high-fidelity dataset, and it also takes full advantage of our GeForce RTX 40- and 50-series GPUs, which benefit from faster and more advanced Tensor Cores.”

Nvidia has updated its DLSS model to better understand scenes in games so it can use game engine data to improve lighting, finer edges, and motion clarity. In a briefing, Nvidia demonstrated improvements to DLSS 4.5 in a variety of games. Ghosting is reduced in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, anti-aliasing is improved in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and there is less shimmering in certain scenes in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.

While the AI model improvements to DLSS 4.5 will benefit all RTX owners today, Nvidia is also launching a new 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series owners in spring. Targeted at 240Hz 4K gaming, the 6x mode will generate five additional fake frames for every single rendered one, instead of the maximum of three additional in DLSS 4.

Nvidia is also launching a Dynamic Multi Frame Generation mode that automatically switches between different Multi Frame Generation levels depending on when you need more or less fake frames. “When things are really graphically intense, it upshifts and increases the Frame Generation required to bridge the performance dips, ensuring that your high refresh rate monitor remains buttery smooth,” explains Lin. “When the workload lightens, it seamlessly shifts the multiplier down to compute only what’s needed.”

DLSS 4.5 will be available for more than 400 games and apps through Nvidia’s app today, allowing RTX owners to force 4.5 on in games that haven’t been updated yet. Nvidia is only committing to a vague “spring 2026” timeframe for its 6x Multi Frame Generation and Dynamic Frame Generation modes for RTX 50-series owners.

A new line of small appliances and devices from IAI Smart, billed as Emerson Smart products, are now available that will let you operate fans, heaters, smart plugs, and air fryers with your voice — with no apps, Wi-Fi, or smart home connection at all.

Using the company’s SmartVoice technology, the devices react to wake-up words for verbal commands, using built-in microphones. Most of the appliances will also offer a built-in speaker so that they can react audibly to the commands. IAI Smart emphasizes the ease of use that this offers. “Our guiding principle is simple: make smart home technology easier for everyone,” said Jason Jiang, CEO of IAI Smart. “Voice control should be effortless, and now it is.” And because everything is on-device, personal information never leaves the home.

The first devices with this technology include:

The SmartVoice appliances are available from Best Buy, Walmart, Amazon, and the Emerson SmartVoice site.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When business leaders talk about digital transformation, their focus often jumps straight to cloud platforms, AI tools, or collaboration software. Yet, one of the most fundamental enablers of how organizations now work, and how employees experience that work, is often overlooked: audio.

As Genevieve Juillard, CEO of IDC, notes, the shift to hybrid collaboration made every space, from corporate boardrooms to kitchen tables, meeting-ready almost overnight. In the scramble, audio quality often lagged, creating what research now shows is more than a nuisance. Poor sound can alter how speakers are perceived, making them seem less credible or even less trustworthy.

&quot;Audio is the gatekeeper of meaning,” stresses Julliard. “If people can&#39;t hear clearly, they can&#39;t understand you. And if they can&#39;t understand you, they can&#39;t trust you, and they can&#39;t act on what you said. And no amount of sharp video can fix that.&quot; Without clarity, comprehension and confidence collapse.

For Shure, which has spent a century advancing sound technology, the implications extend far beyond convenience. Chris Schyvinck, Shure’s president and CEO, explains that ineffective audio undermines engagement and productivity. Meetings stall, decisions slow, and fatigue builds.

&quot;Use technology to make hybrid meetings seamless, and then be clear on which conversations truly require being in the same physical space,&quot; says Juillard. &quot;If you can strike that balance, you&#39;re not just making work more efficient, you&#39;re making it more sustainable, you&#39;re also making it more inclusive, and you&#39;re making it more resilient.&quot;

When audio is prioritized on equal footing with video and other collaboration tools, organizations can gain something rare: frictionless communication. That clarity ensures the machines listening in, from AI transcription engines to real-time translation systems, can deliver reliable results.

The research from Shure and IDC highlights two blind spots for leaders. First, buying decisions too often privilege price over quality, with costly consequences in productivity and trust. Second, organizations underestimate the stress poor sound imposes on employees, intensifying the cognitive load of already demanding workdays. Addressing both requires leaders to view audio not as a peripheral expense but as core infrastructure.

Looking ahead, audio is becoming inseparable from AI-driven collaboration. Smarter systems can already filter out background noise, enhance voices in real time, and integrate seamlessly into hybrid ecosystems.

&quot;We should be able to provide improved accessibility and a more equitable meeting experience for people,&quot; says Schyvinck.

For Schyvinck and Juillard, the future belongs to companies that treat audio transformation as an integral part of digital transformation, building workplaces that are more sustainable, equitable, and resilient.

Chris Schyvinck: It&#39;s really nice to be here. Thank you very much.

Genevieve Juillard: Yeah, thank you so much for having us. Great to be here.

Megan Tatum: Thank you both so much for being here. Genevieve, we could start with you. Let&#39;s start with some history perhaps for context. How would you describe the evolution of audio technology and how use cases and our expectations of audio have evolved? What have been some of the major drivers throughout the years and more recently, perhaps would you consider the pandemic to be one of those drivers?

Genevieve: It&#39;s interesting. If you go all the way back to 1976, Norman Macrae of The Economist predicted that video chat would actually kill the office, that people would just work from home. Obviously, that didn&#39;t happen then, but the core technology for remote collaboration has actually been around for decades. But until the pandemic, most of us only experienced it in very specific contexts. Offices had dedicated video conferencing rooms and most ran on expensive proprietary systems. And then almost overnight, everything including literally the kitchen table had to be AV ready. The cultural norms shifted just as fast. Before the pandemic, it was perfectly fine to keep your camera off in a meeting, and now that&#39;s seen as disengaged or even rude, and that changes what normalized video conferencing and my hybrid meetings.

But in a rush to equip a suddenly remote workforce, we hit two big problems. Supply chain disruptions and a massive spike in demand. High-quality gear was hard to get so low-quality audio and video became the default. And here&#39;s a key point. We now know from research that audio quality matters more than video quality for meeting outcomes. You can run a meeting without video, but you can&#39;t run a meeting without clear audio. Audio is the gatekeeper of meaning. If people can&#39;t hear clearly, they can&#39;t understand you. And if they can&#39;t understand you, they can&#39;t trust you and they can&#39;t act on what you said. And no amount of sharp video can fix that.

Megan: Oh, true. It&#39;s fascinating, isn&#39;t it? And Chris, Shure and IDC recently released some research titled “The Hidden Influencer Rethinking Audio Could Impact Your Organization Today, Tomorrow, and Forever.” The research highlighted that importance of audio that Genevieve&#39;s talking about in today&#39;s increasingly virtual world. What did you glean from those results and did anything surprise you?

Chris: Yeah, well, the research certainly confirmed a lot of hunches we&#39;ve had through the years. When you think about a company like Shure that&#39;s been doing audio for 100 years, we just celebrated that anniversary this year.

Chris: Our legacy business is over more in the music and performance arena. And so just what Genevieve said in terms of, &quot;Yeah, you can have a performance and look at somebody, but that&#39;s like 10% of it, right? 90% is hearing that person sing, perform, and talk.&quot; We&#39;ve always, of course, from our perspective, understood that clean, clear, crisp audio is what is needed in any setting. When you translate what&#39;s happening on the stage into a meeting or collaboration space at a corporation, we&#39;ve thought that that is just equally as important.

And we always had this hunch that if people don&#39;t have the good audio, they&#39;re going to have fatigue, they&#39;re going to get a little disengaged, and the whole meeting is going to become quite unproductive. The research just really amplified that hunch for us because it really depicted the fact that people not only get kind of frustrated and disengaged, they might actually start to distrust what the other person with bad audio is saying or just cast it in a different light. And the degree to which that frustration becomes almost personal was very surprising to us. Like I said, it validated some hunches, but it really put an exclamation point on it for us.

Megan: And Genevieve, based on the research results, I understand that IDC pulled together some recommendations for organizations. What is it that leaders need to know and what is the biggest blind spot for them to overcome as well?

Genevieve: The biggest blind spot is this. If your microphone has poor audio quality, like Chris said, people will literally perceive you as less intelligent and less trustworthy. And by the way, that&#39;s not an opinion. It&#39;s what the science says. But yet, when we surveyed first time business buyers, the number one factor they used to choose audio gear was price. However, for repeat buyers, the top factor flipped to audio quality. My guess is they learn the lesson the hard way. The second blind spot is to Chris&#39;s point, it&#39;s the stress that bad audio creates. Poor sound forces your brain to work harder to decode what&#39;s being said. That&#39;s a cognitive load and it creates stress. And over a full day of meetings, that stress adds up. Now, we don&#39;t have long-term studies yet on the effects, but we do know that prolonged stress is something that every company should be working to reduce.

Good audio lightens that cognitive load. It keeps people engaged and it levels the playing field. Whether you&#39;re in a room or you&#39;re halfway across the world, and here&#39;s one that&#39;s often overlooked, bad audio can sabotage AI transcription tools. As AI becomes more and more central to everyday work, that starts to become really critical. If your audio isn&#39;t clear, the transcription won&#39;t be accurate. And there&#39;s a world of difference between working, for example, the consulting department and the insulting department, and that is an actual example from the field.

The bottom line is you fix the audio, you cut friction, you save time, and you make meetings more productive.

Megan: I mean, it&#39;s just a huge game changer, isn&#39;t it, really? I mean, and given that, Chris, in your experience across industries, are audio technologies being included in digital transformation strategies and also artificial intelligence implementation? Do we need a separate audio transformation perhaps?

Chris: Well, like I mentioned earlier, yes, people tend to initially focus on that visual platform, but increasingly the attention to audio is really coming into focus. And I&#39;d hate to tear apart audio as a separate sort of strategy because at the same time, we, as an audio expert, are trying to really seamlessly integrate audio into the rest of the ecosystem. It really does need to be put on an equal footing with the rest of the components in that ecosystem. And to Genevieve&#39;s point, as we are seeing audio and video systems with more AI functionalities, the importance of real-time translations that are being used, voice recognition, being able to attribute who said what in a meeting and take action items, it&#39;s really, I think starting to elevate the importance of that clear audio. And it&#39;s got to be part of a comprehensive, really collaboration plan that helps some company figure out what&#39;s their whole digital transformation about. It just really has to be included in that comprehensive plan, but put on equal footing with the rest of the components in that system.

Megan: Yeah, absolutely. And in the broader landscape, Genevieve, in terms of discussing the importance of audio quality, what have you noticed across research projects about the effects of good and bad audio, not only from that company perspective, but from employee and client perspectives as well?

Genevieve: Well, let&#39;s start with employees.

Genevieve: Bad audio adds friction you don&#39;t need, we&#39;ve talked about this. When you&#39;re straining to hear or make sense of what&#39;s being said, your brain is burning energy on decoding instead of contributing. That frustration, it builds up, and by the end of the day, it hurts productivity. From a company perspective, the stakes get even higher. Meetings are where decisions happen or at least where they&#39;re supposed to happen. And if people can&#39;t hear clearly, decisions get delayed, mistakes creep in, and the whole process slows down. Poor audio doesn&#39;t just waste time, it chips away at the ability to move quickly and confidently. And then there&#39;s the client experience. So whether it&#39;s in sales, customer service, or any external conversation, poor audio can make you sound less credible and yet less trustworthy. Again, that&#39;s not my opinion. That&#39;s what the research shows. So that&#39;s quite a big risk when you&#39;re trying to close a deal or solve a major problem.

The takeaway is good audio, it matters, it&#39;s a multiplier. It makes meetings more productive and it can help decisions happen faster and client interactions be stronger.

Megan: It&#39;s just so impactful, isn&#39;t it, in so many different ways. I mean, Chris, how are you seeing these research results reflected as companies work through digital and AI transformations? What is it that leaders need to understand about what is involved in audio implementation across their organization?

Chris: Well, like I said earlier, I do think that audio is finally maybe getting its place in the spotlight a little bit up there with our cousins over in the video side. Audio, it&#39;s not just a peripheral aspect anymore. It&#39;s a very integral part of that sort of comprehensive collaboration plan I was talking about earlier. And when we think about how can we contribute solutions that are really more easy to use for our end users, because if you create something complicated, we were talking about the days gone by of walking into a room. It&#39;s a very complicated system, and you need to find the right person that knows how to run it. Increasingly, you just need to have some plug and play kind of solutions. We&#39;re thinking about a more sustainable strategy for our solutions where we make really high-quality hardware. We&#39;ve done that account for a hundred years. People will come up to me and tell the story of the SM58 microphone they bought in 1980 and how they&#39;re still using it every day.

We know how to do that part of it. If somebody is willing to make that investment upfront, put some high-quality hardware into their system, then we are getting to the point now where updates can be handled via software downloads or cloud connectivity. And just really being able to provide sort of a sustainable solution for people over time.

More in our industry, we&#39;re collaborating with other industry partners to go in that direction, make something that&#39;s very simple for anybody to walk into a room or on their individual at home setup and do something pretty simple. And I think we have the right industry groups, the right industry associations that can help make sure that the ecosystems have the proper standards, the right kind of ways to make sure everything is interoperable within a system. We&#39;re all kind of heading in that direction with that end user in mind.

Megan: Fantastic. And when the internet of things was emerging, efforts began to create sort of these data ecosystems, it seems there&#39;s an argument to be made that we need audio ecosystems as well. I wonder, Chris, what might an audio ecosystem look like and what would be involved in implementation?

Chris: Well, I think it does have to be part of that bigger ecosystem I was just talking about where we do collaborate with others in industry and we try to make sure that we&#39;re all playing by the kind of same set of rules and protocols and standards and whatnot. And when you think about compatibility across all the devices that sit in a room or sit in your, again, maybe your at home setup, making sure that the audio quality is as good as it can be, that you can interoperate with everything else in the system. That&#39;s just become very paramount in our day-to-day work here. Your hardware has to be scalable like I just alluded to a moment ago. You have to figure out how you can integrate with existing technologies, different platforms.

We were joking when we came into this session that when you&#39;re going from the platform at your company, maybe you&#39;re on Teams and you go into a Zoom setting or you go into a Google setting, you really have to figure out how to adapt to all those different sort of platforms that are out there. I think the ecosystem that we&#39;re trying to build, we&#39;re trying to be on that equal footing with the rest of the components in that system. And people really do understand that if you want to have extra functionalities in meetings and you want to be able to transcribe or take notes and all of that, that audio is an absolutely critical piece.

Megan: Absolutely. And speaking of bit of all those different platforms and use cases, that sort of audio is so relevant to Genevieve that goes back to this idea of in audio one size does not fit all and needs may change. How can companies also plan their audio implementations to be flexible enough to meet current needs and to be able to grow with future advancements?

Genevieve: I&#39;m glad you asked this question. Even years after the pandemic, many companies, they&#39;re still trying to get the balance right between remote, in office, how to support it. But even if a company has a strict return to office in-person policy, the reality is that work still isn&#39;t going away for that company. They may have teams across cities or countries, clients and external stakeholders will have their own office preferences that they have to adapt to. Supporting hybrid work is actually becoming more important, not less. And our research shows that companies are leaning into, not away from, hybrid setups. About one third of companies are now redesigning or resizing office spaces every single year. For large organizations with multiple sites, staggered leases, that&#39;s a moving target. It&#39;s really important that they have audio solutions that can work before, during, after all of those changes that they&#39;re constantly making. And so that&#39;s where flexibility becomes really important. Companies need to buy not just for right now, but for the future.

And so here&#39;s IDC&#39;s kind of pro-tip, which is make sure as a company that you go with a provider that offers top-notch audio quality and also has strong partnerships and certifications with the big players and communications technology because that will save you money in the long run. Your systems will stay compatible, your investments will last longer, and you won&#39;t be scrambling when that next shift happens.

Megan: Of course. And speaking of building for the future, as companies begin to include sustainability in their company goals, Chris, I wonder how can audio play a role in those sustainability efforts and how might that play into perhaps the return on investment in building out a high-quality audio ecosystem?

Chris: Well, I totally agree with what Genevieve just said in terms of hybrid work is not going anywhere. You get all of those big headlines that talk about XYZ company telling people to get back into the office. And I saw a fantastic piece of data just last week that showed the percent of in-office hours of the American workers versus out-of-office remote kind of work. It has basically been flatlined since 2022. This is our new way of working. And of course, like Genevieve mentioned, you have people in all these different locations. And in a strange way, living through the pandemic did teach us that we can do some things by not having to hop on an airplane and travel to go somewhere. Certainly that helps with a more sustainable strategy over time, and you&#39;re saving on travel and able to get things done much more quickly.

And then from a product offering perspective, I&#39;ll go back to the vision I was painting earlier where we and others in our industry see that we can create great solid hardware platforms. We&#39;ve done it for decades, and now that advancements around AI and all of our software that enables products and everything else that has happened in the last probably decade, we can get enhancements and additions and new functionality to people in simpler ways on existing hardware. I think we&#39;re all careening down this path of having a much more sustainable ecosystem for all collaboration. It&#39;s really quite an exciting time, and that pays off with any company implementing a system, their ROI is going to be much better in the long run.

Megan: Absolutely. And Genevieve, what trends around sustainability are you seeing? What opportunities do you see for audio to play into those sustainability efforts going forward?

Genevieve: Yeah, similar to Chris. In some industries, there&#39;s still a belief that the best work happens when everyone&#39;s in the same room. And yes, face-to-face time is really important for building relationships, for brainstorming, for closing big deals, but it does come at a cost. The carbon footprint of daily commutes, the sales visits, the constant business travel. And then there&#39;s the basic consideration, as we&#39;ve talked about, of just pure practicality. The good news is with the right AV setup, especially high-quality audio, many of those interactions can happen virtually without losing effectiveness, as Chris said it, but our research shows it.

Our research shows that virtual meetings can be just as productive as in-person ones, and every commute or flight you avoid, of course makes a measurable sustainability impact. I don&#39;t think, personally, that the takeaway is replace all in-person meetings, but instead it&#39;s to be intentional. Use technology to make hybrid meetings seamless, and then be clear on which conversations truly require being in the same physical space. If you can strike that balance, you&#39;re not just making work more efficient, you&#39;re making it more sustainable, you&#39;re also making it more inclusive, and you&#39;re making it more resilient.

Megan: Such an important point. And let&#39;s close with a future forward look, if we can. Genevieve, what innovations or advancements in the audio field are you most excited to see to come to fruition, and what potential interesting use cases do you see on the horizon?

Genevieve: I&#39;m especially interested in how AI and audio are converging. We&#39;re now seeing AI that can identify and isolate human voices in noisy environments. For example, right now, there are some jets flying overhead. It&#39;s very loud in here, but I suspect you may not even know that that&#39;s happening.

Genevieve: Right. That technology, it&#39;s pulling voices forward so that conversations like ours are crystal clear. And that&#39;s a big deal, especially as companies invest more and more in AI tools, especially for that translating, transcribing and summarizing meetings. But as we&#39;ve talked before, AI is only as good as the audio it hears. If the sound is poor or a word gets misheard, the meaning can shift entirely. And sometimes that&#39;s just inconvenient, or it can even be funny. But in really high stakes settings, like healthcare for example, a single mis-transcribed word can have serious consequences. So that&#39;s why our position as high quality audio is critical and it&#39;s necessary for making AI powered communication accurate, trustworthy, and useful because when the input is clean, the output can actually live up to its promise.

Megan: Fantastic. And Chris, finally, what are you most excited to see developed? What advancements are you most looking forward to seeing?

Chris: Well, I really do believe that this is one of the most exciting times that I know I&#39;ve lived through in my career. Just the pace of how fast technology is moving, the sudden emergence of all things AI. I was actually in a roundtable session of CEOs yesterday from lots of different industries, and the facilitator was talking about change management internally in companies as you&#39;re going through all of these technology shifts and some of the fear that people have around AI and things like that. And the facilitator asked each of us to give one word that describes how we&#39;re feeling right now. And the first CEO that went used the word dread. And that absolutely floored me because you enter into these eras with some skepticism and trying to figure out how to make things work and go down the right path. But my word was truly optimism.

When I look at all the ways that we are able to deliver better audio to people more quickly, there&#39;s so many opportunities in front of us. We&#39;re working on things outside of AI like algorithms that Genevieve just mentioned that filter out the bad sounds that you don&#39;t want entering into a meeting. We&#39;ve been doing that for quite a long time now. There&#39;s also opportunities to do real time audio improvements, enhancements, make audio more personal for people. How do they want to be able to very simply, through voice commands perhaps, adjust their audio? There shouldn&#39;t have to be a whole lot of techie settings that come along with our solutions.

We should be able to provide improved accessibility and a little bit more equitable meeting experience for people. And we&#39;re looking at tech technology solutions around immersive audio. How can you maybe feel like you&#39;re a bit more engaged in the meeting, kind of creating some realistic virtual experiences, if you will. There&#39;s just so many opportunities in front of us, and I can just picture a day when you walk into a room and you tell the room, &quot;Hey, call Genevieve. We&#39;re going to have a meeting for an hour, and we might need to have Megan on call to come in at a certain time.&quot;

And all of this will just be very automatic, very seamless, and we&#39;ll be able to see each other and talk at the same time. And this isn&#39;t years away. This is happening really, really quickly. And I do think it&#39;s a really exciting time for audio and just all together collaboration in our industry.

Megan: Absolutely. Sounds like there&#39;s plenty of reason to be optimistic. Thank you both so much.That was Chris Schyvinck, President and CEO at Shure.

Welcome to Kenya’s Great Carbon Valley: a bold new gamble to fight climate change

In June last year, startup Octavia Carbon began running a high-stakes test in the small town of Gilgil in south-central Kenya. It’s harnessing some of the excess energy generated by vast clouds of steam under the Earth’s surface to power prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.The company’s long-term vision is undoubtedly ambitious—it wants to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. On top of that, Kenya’s Maasai people have plenty of reasons to distrust energy companies. Read the full story.

AI Wrapped: The 14 AI terms you couldn’t avoid in 2025

If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. Our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse. Read the full list.

How aging clocks can help us understand why we age—and if we can reverse itWrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well—or poorly—someone’s body is truly aging. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging, might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn’t have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active.Over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. And what they’ve found is changing our understanding of aging itself. Read the full story.—Jessica Hamzelou

            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

In an industry in constant flux, sticking your neck out to predict what’s coming next may seem reckless. (AI bubble? What AI bubble?) But for the last few years we’ve done just that—and we’re doing it again.

How did we do last time? We picked five hot AI trends to look out for in 2025, including what we called generative virtual playgrounds, a.k.a world models (check: From Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 to World Labs’s Marble, tech that can generate realistic virtual environments on the fly keeps getting better and better); so-called reasoning models (check: Need we say more? Reasoning models have fast become the new paradigm for best-in-class problem solving); a boom in AI for science (check: OpenAI is now following Google DeepMind by setting up a dedicated team to focus on just that); AI companies that are cozier with national security (check: OpenAI reversed position on the use of its technology for warfare to sign a deal with the defense-tech startup Anduril to help it take down battlefield drones); and legitimate competition for Nvidia (check, kind of: China is going all in on developing advanced AI chips, but Nvidia’s dominance still looks unassailable—for now at least).

So what’s coming in 2026? Here are our big bets for the next 12 months.

The last year shaped up as a big one for Chinese open-source models. In January, DeepSeek released R1, its open-source reasoning model, and shocked the world with what a relatively small firm in China could do with limited resources. By the end of the year, “DeepSeek moment” had become a phrase frequently tossed around by AI entrepreneurs, observers, and builders—an aspirational benchmark of sorts.

It was the first time many people realized they could get a taste of top-tier AI performance without going through OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.

Open-weight models like R1 allow anyone to download a model and run it on their own hardware. They are also more customizable, letting teams tweak models through techniques like distillation and pruning. This stands in stark contrast to the “closed” models released by major American firms, where core capabilities remain proprietary and access is often expensive.

As a result, Chinese models have become an easy choice. Reports by CNBC and Bloomberg suggest that startups in the US have increasingly recognized and embraced what they can offer.

One popular group of models is Qwen, created by Alibaba, the company behind China’s largest e-commerce platform, Taobao. Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct alone has 8.85 million downloads, making it one of the most widely used pretrained LLMs. The Qwen family spans a wide range of model sizes alongside specialized versions tuned for math, coding, vision, and instruction-following, a breadth that has helped it become an open-source powerhouse.

Other Chinese AI firms that were previously unsure about committing to open source are following DeepSeek’s playbook. Standouts include Zhipu’s GLM and Moonshot’s Kimi. The competition has also pushed American firms to open up, at least in part. In August, OpenAI released its first open-source model. In November, the Allen Institute for AI, a Seattle-based nonprofit, released its latest open-source model, Olmo 3.

Even amid growing US-China antagonism, Chinese AI firms’ near-unanimous embrace of open source has earned them goodwill in the global AI community and a long-term trust advantage. In 2026, expect more Silicon Valley apps to quietly ship on top of Chinese open models, and look for the lag between Chinese releases and the Western frontier to keep shrinking—from months to weeks, and sometimes less.

T​​he battle over regulating artificial intelligence is heading for a showdown. On December 11, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to neuter state AI laws, a move meant to handcuff states from keeping the growing industry in check. In 2026, expect more political warfare. The White House and states will spar over who gets to govern the booming technology, while AI companies wage a fierce lobbying campaign to crush regulations, armed with the narrative that a patchwork of state laws will smother innovation and hobble the US in the AI arms race against China.

Under Trump’s executive order, states may fear being sued or starved federal funding if they clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. Big Democratic states like California—which just enacted the nation’s first frontier AI law requiring companies to publish safety testing for their AI models—will take the fight to court, arguing that only Congress can override state laws. But states that can’t afford to lose federal funding, or fear getting in Trump’s crosshairs, might fold. Still, expect to see more state lawmaking on hot-button issues, especially where Trump’s order gives states a green light to legislate. With chatbots accused of triggering teen suicides and data centers sucking up more and more energy, states will face mounting public pressure to push for guardrails.

In place of state laws, Trump promises to work with Congress to establish a federal AI law. Don’t count on it. Congress failed to pass a moratorium on state legislation twice in 2025, and we aren’t holding out hope that it will deliver its own bill this year.

AI companies like OpenAI and Meta will continue to deploy powerful super-PACs to support political candidates who back their agenda and target those who stand in their way. On the other side, super-PACs supporting AI regulation will build their own war chests to counter. Watch them duke it out at next year’s midterm elections.

The further AI advances, the more people will fight to steer its course, and 2026 will be another year of regulatory tug-of-war—with no end in sight.

Imagine a world in which you have a personal shopper at your disposal 24-7—an expert who can instantly recommend a gift for even the trickiest-to-buy-for friend or relative, or trawl the web to draw up a list of the best bookcases available within your tight budget. Better yet, they can analyze a kitchen appliance’s strengths and weaknesses, compare it with its seemingly identical competition, and find you the best deal. Then once you’re happy with their suggestion, they’ll take care of the purchasing and delivery details too.But this ultra-knowledgeable shopper isn’t a clued-up human at all—it’s a chatbot. This is no distant prediction, either. Salesforce recently said it anticipates that AI will drive $263 billion in online purchases this holiday season. That’s some 21% of all orders. And experts are betting on AI-enhanced shopping becoming even bigger business within the next few years. By 2030, between $3 trillion and $5 trillion annually will be made from agentic commerce, according to research from the consulting firm McKinsey.

Unsurprisingly, AI companies are already heavily invested in making purchasing through their platforms as frictionless as possible. Google’s Gemini app can now tap into the company’s powerful Shopping Graph data set of products and sellers, and can even use its agentic technology to call stores on your behalf. Meanwhile, back in November, OpenAI announced a ChatGPT shopping feature capable of rapidly compiling buyer’s guides, and the company has struck deals with Walmart, Target, and Etsy to allow shoppers to buy products directly within chatbot interactions.

Expect plenty more of these kinds of deals to be struck within the next year as consumer time spent chatting with AI keeps on rising, and web traffic from search engines and social media continues to plummet.

I’m going to hedge here, right out of the gate. It’s no secret that large language models spit out a lot of nonsense. Unless it’s with monkeys-and-typewriters luck, LLMs won’t discover anything by themselves. But LLMs do still have the potential to extend the bounds of human knowledge.

We got a glimpse of how this could work in May, when Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve, a system that used the firm’s Gemini LLM to come up with new algorithms for solving unsolved problems. The breakthrough was to combine Gemini with an evolutionary algorithm that checked its suggestions, picked the best ones, and fed them back into the LLM to make them even better.

Google DeepMind used AlphaEvolve to come up with more efficient ways to manage power consumption by data centers and Google’s TPU chips. Those discoveries are significant but not game-changing. Yet. Researchers at Google DeepMind are now pushing their approach to see how far it will go.

And others have been quick to follow their lead. A week after AlphaEvolve came out, Asankhaya Sharma, an AI engineer in Singapore, shared OpenEvolve, an open-source version of Google DeepMind’s tool. In September, the Japanese firm Sakana AI released a version of the software called SinkaEvolve. And in November, a team of US and Chinese researchers revealed AlphaResearch, which they claim improves on one of AlphaEvolve’s already better-than-human math solutions.

There are alternative approaches too. For example, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver are trying to make LLMs more inventive by tweaking the way so-called reasoning models work. They have drawn on what cognitive scientists know about creative thinking in humans to push reasoning models toward solutions that are more outside the box than their typical safe-bet suggestions.

Hundreds of companies are spending billions of dollars looking for ways to get AI to crack unsolved math problems, speed up computers, and come up with new drugs and materials. Now that AlphaEvolve has shown what’s possible with LLMs, expect activity on this front to ramp up fast.

For a while, lawsuits against AI companies were pretty predictable: Rights holders like authors or musicians would sue companies that trained AI models on their work, and the courts generally found in favor of the tech giants. AI’s upcoming legal battles will be far messier.

The fights center on thorny, unresolved questions: Can AI companies be held liable for what their chatbots encourage people to do, as when they help teens plan suicides? If a chatbot spreads patently false information about you, can its creator be sued for defamation? If companies lose these cases, will insurers shun AI companies as clients?

In 2026, we’ll start to see the answers to these questions, in part because some notable cases will go to trial (the family of a teen who died by suicide will bring OpenAI to court in November).

At the same time, the legal landscape will be further complicated by President Trump’s executive order from December—see Michelle’s item above for more details on the brewing regulatory storm.

No matter what, we’ll see a dizzying array of lawsuits in all directions (not to mention some judges even turning to AI amid the deluge).

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">My daughter introduced me to El Estepario Siberiano’s YouTube channel a few months back, and I have been obsessed ever since. The Spanish drummer (real name: Jorge Garrido) posts videos of himself playing supercharged cover versions of popular tracks, hitting his drums with such jaw-dropping speed and technique that he makes other pro drummers shake their heads in disbelief. The dozens of reaction videos posted by other musicians are a joy in themselves.

Garrido is up-front about the countless hours that it took to get this good. He says he sat behind his kit almost all day, every day for years. At a time when machines appear to do it all, there’s a kind of defiance in that level of human effort. It’s why my favorites are Garrido’s covers of electronic music, where he out-drums the drum machine. Check out his version of Skrillex and Missy Elliot’s “Ra Ta Ta” and tell me it doesn’t put happiness in your heart.

Watching Sora ­videos of Michael Jackson stealing a box of chicken nuggets or Sam Altman biting into the pink meat of a flame-grilled Pikachu has given me flashbacks to an Ed Atkins exhibition at Tate Britain I saw a few months ago. Atkins is one of the most influential and unsettling British artists of his generation. He is best known for hyper-detailed CG animations of himself (pore-perfect skin, janky movement) that play with the virtual representation of human emotions.

In The Worm we see a CGI Atkins make a long-distance call to his mother during a covid lockdown. The audio is from a recording of an actual conversation. Are we watching Atkins cry or his avatar? Our attention flickers between two realities. “When an actor breaks character during a scene, it’s known as corpsing,” Atkins has said. “I want everything I make to corpse.” Next to Atkins’s work, generative videos look like cardboard cutouts: lifelike but not alive.

What’s it like to be a pet? Australian author Laura Jean McKay’s debut novel, The Animals in That Country, will make you wish you’d never asked. A flu-like pandemic leaves people with the ability to hear what animals are saying. If that sounds too Dr. Dolittle for your tastes, rest assured: These animals are weird and nasty. A lot of the time they don’t even make any sense.

With everybody now talking to their computers, McKay’s book resets the anthropomorphic trap we’ve all fallen into. It’s a brilliant evocation of what a nonhuman mind might contain—and a meditation on the hard limits of communication.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

            <h2>Job titles of the future: Head-transplant surgeon</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/02/1129416/head-transplant-surgeon-sergio-canavero-future-job/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.

Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent. The Chicago Tribune labeled him the “P.T. Barnum of transplantation.”

Canavero withdrew from the spotlight. But the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups.

It’s been rocky. After he began publishing his surgical ideas a decade ago, Canavero says, he got his “pink slip” from the Molinette Hospital in Turin, where he’d spent 22 years on staff. “I’m an out-of-the-establishment guy. So that has made things harder, I have to say,” he says.

No other solution to aging is on the horizon. “It’s become absolutely clear over the past years that the idea of some incredible tech to rejuvenate elderly people—­happening in some secret lab, like Google—is really going nowhere,” he says. “You have to go for the whole shebang.”

He means getting a new body, not just one new organ. Canavero has an easy mastery of English idioms and an unexpected Southern twang. He says that’s due to a fascination with American comics as a child. “For me, learning the language of my heroes was paramount,” he says. “So I can shoot the breeze.”

Canavero is now an independent investigator and has advised entrepreneurs who want to create brainless human clones as a source of DNA-matched organs that wouldn’t get rejected by a recipient’s immune system. “I can tell you there are guys from top universities involved,” he says.

Combining the necessary technologies, like reliably precise surgical robots and artificial wombs to grow the clones, is going to be complex and very, very expensive. Canavero lacks the funds to take his plans further, but he believes “the money is out there” for a commercial moonshot project: “What I say to the billionaires is ‘Come together.’ You will all have your own share, plus make yourselves immortal.”

The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health.

Yes, you can pay $50,000 to clone a pet. But others are using the technology to rescue endangered species.

            <h2>Why inventing new emotions feels so good</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/31/1129403/new-emotions-online-life-feelings/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user named noahjeadie generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. With the right essential oils and soundtrack, apparently, you too can feel like “a soft fuzzy draping ghost floating through a lavender suburb.”

Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Velvetmist was a key example in a journal article about the phenomenon published in July 2025. But most neo-emotions aren’t the inventions of emo artificial intelligences. Humans come up with them, and they’re part of a big change in the way researchers are thinking about feelings, one that emphasizes how people continuously spin out new ones in response to a changing world.

Velvetmist might’ve been a chatbot one-off, but it’s not unique. The sociologist Marci Cottingham—whose 2024 paper got this vein of neo-emotion research started—cites many more new terms in circulation. There’s “Black joy” (Black people celebrating embodied pleasure as a form of political resistance), “trans euphoria” (the joy of having one’s gender identity affirmed and celebrated), “eco-anxiety” (the hovering fear of climate disaster), “hypernormalization” (the surreal pressure to continue performing mundane life and labor under capitalism during a global pandemic or fascist takeover), and the sense of “doom” found in “doomer” (one who is relentlessly pessimistic) or “doomscrolling” (being glued to an endless feed of bad news in an immobilized state combining apathy and dread).

Of course, emotional vocabulary is always evolving. During the Civil War, doctors used the centuries-old term “nostalgia,” combining the Greek words for “returning home”and “pain,” to describe a sometimes fatal set of symptoms suffered by soldiers—a condition we’d probably describe today as post-traumatic stress disorder. Now nostalgia’s meaning has mellowed and faded to a gentle affection for an old cultural product or vanished way of life. And people constantly import emotion words from other cultures when they’re convenient or evocative—like hygge (the Danish word for friendly coziness) or kvell (a Yiddish term for brimming over with happy pride).

Cottingham believes that neo-­emotions are proliferating as people spend more of their lives online. These coinages help us relate to one another and make sense of our experiences, and they get a lot of engagement on social media. So even when a neo-emotion is just a subtle variation on, or combination of, existing feelings, getting super-specific about those feelings helps us reflect and connect with other people. “These are potentially signals that tell us about our place in the world,” she says.

These neo-emotions are part of a paradigm shift in emotion science. For decades, researchers argued that humans all share a set of a half-dozen or so basic emotions. But over the last decade, Lisa Feldman Barrett, a clinical psychologist at Northeastern University, has become one of the most cited scientists in the world for work demonstrating otherwise. By using tools like advanced brain imaging and studying babies and people from relatively isolated cultures, she has concluded there’s no such thing as a basic emotional palette. The way we experience and talk about our feelings is culturally determined. “How do you know what anger and sadness and fear are? Because somebody taught you,” Barrett says.

If there are no true “basic” biological emotions, this puts more emphasis on social and cultural variations in how we interpret our experiences. And these interpretations can change over time. “As a sociologist, we think of all emotions as created,” Cottingham says. Just like any other tool humans make and use, “emotions are a practical resource people are using as they navigate the world.”

Some neo-emotions, like velvetmist, might be mere novelties. Barrett playfully suggests “chiplessness” to describe the combined hunger, frustration, and relief of getting to the bottom of the bag. But others, like eco-anxiety and Black joy, can take on a life of their own and help galvanize social movements.

Both reading about and crafting your own neo-emotions, with or without chatbot assistance, could be surprisingly helpful. Lots of research supports the benefits of emotional granularity. Basically, the more detailed and specific words you can use to describe your emotions, both positive and negative, the better.

Researchers analogize this “emodiversity” to biodiversity or cultural diversity, arguing that a more diverse world is more enriched. It turns out that people who exhibit higher emotional granularity go to the doctor less frequently, spend fewer days hospitalized for illness, and are less likely to drink when stressed, drive recklessly, or smoke cigarettes. And many studies show emodiversity is a skill that, with training, people can develop at any age. Just imagine cruising into this sweet, comforting future. Is the idea giving you a certain dreamy thrill?

Are you sure you’ve never felt velvetmist?

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
