            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A New York man is suing Prenuvo, a celebrity-endorsed whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provider, claiming that the company missed clear signs of trouble in his $2,500 whole-body scan—and if it hadn’t, he could have acted to avert the catastrophic stroke he suffered months later.

Sean Clifford and his legal team claim that his scan on July 15, 2023, showed a 60 percent narrowing and irregularity in a major artery in his brain—the proximal right middle cerebral artery, a branch of the most common artery involved in acute strokes. But Prenuvo’s reviews of the scan did not flag the finding and otherwise reported everything in his brain looked normal; there was “no adverse finding.” (You can read Prenuvo’s report and see Clifford’s subsequent imaging here.)

Clifford suffered a massive stroke on March 7, 2024. Subsequent imaging found that the proximal right middle cerebral artery progressed to a complete blockage, causing the stroke. Clifford suffered paralysis of his left hand and leg, general weakness on his left side, vision loss and permanent double vision, anxiety, depression, mood swings, cognitive deficits, speech problems, and permanent difficulties with all daily activities.

He filed his lawsuit against Prenuvo in September 2024 in the New York State Supreme Court. In the lawsuit, he argues that if he had known of the problem, he could have undergone stenting or other minimally invasive measures to prevent the stroke.

In the legal proceedings since, Prenuvo, a California-based company, has tried to limit the damages that Clifford could seek, first by trying to force arbitration and then by trying to apply California laws to the New York case, as California law caps malpractice damages. The company failed on both counts. In a December ruling, a judge also denied Prenovo’s attempts to shield the radiologist who reviewed Clifford’s scan, William A. Weiner, DO, of East Rockaway, New York.

Notably, Weiner has had his medical license suspended in connection with an auto insurance scheme, in which Weiner was accused of falsifying findings on MRI scans.

In comments to Radiology Business in December, Neal Bhushan, the lawyer representing Clifford, said, “I am pleased that the court sided with us. This ruling reaffirms the strength and merits of our medical malpractice and negligence claims, and we look forward to continuing to litigate this matter in New York County Supreme Court.”

Prenuvo has declined to comment on the litigation but it told The Washington Post, “We take any allegation seriously and are committed to addressing it through the appropriate legal process. Our focus remains on delivering safe, high quality, proactive care to the patients who place their trust in us every day.”

Prenuvo is one of the most prominent providers of elective whole-body MRIs. It got an endorsement from Kim Kardashian, and its investors include supermodel Cindy Crawford and 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki.

Overall, Clifford’s case spotlights the ongoing controversy over the use of elective whole-body MRI scans. They are marketed as a way to catch problems early and give patients peace of mind about their health. But many doctors have significant complaints about the scans, which are generally not covered by insurance, including that they serve the worried wealthy, further widening health care disparities in the country. They also raise concerns that they are likely to identify insignificant abnormalities that will only lead to unnecessary medical appointments, tests, and treatments.

A standing statement from the American College of Radiology says there is not sufficient evidence to justify the scans.

To date, there is no documented evidence that total body screening is cost-efficient or effective in prolonging life. In addition, the ACR is concerned that such procedures will lead to the identification of numerous non-specific findings that will not ultimately improve patients’ health but will result in unnecessary follow-up testing and procedures, as well as significant expense.

Clifford’s case represents the other end of the spectrum, where reviews of whole-body, non-specific scans, which are not aimed at looking for anything specific, could miss a critical finding.

The top comment on a medical subreddit conversation of Clifford’s legal case elaborated on this concern: “I think their business model has been predicated on getting two types of people: worried well or very sick, and are not appropriately set up to handle patients with real but subtle findings their MRI and radiologists aren’t well suited to detect.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/scientists-sequence-a-woolly-rhino-genome-from-a-14400-year-old-wolfs-stomach/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A 14,400-year-old wolf puppy’s last meal is shedding light on the last days of one of the Ice Age’s most iconic megafauna species, the woolly rhinoceros.

When researchers dissected the frozen mummified remains of an Ice Age wolf puppy, they found a partially digested chunk of meat in its stomach: the remnants of the puppy’s last meal 14,400 years ago. DNA testing revealed that the meat was a prime cut of woolly rhinoceros, a now-extinct 2-metric-ton behemoth that once stomped across the tundras of Europe and Asia. Stockholm University paleogeneticist Sólveig Guðjónsdóttir and her colleagues recently sequenced a full genome from the piece of meat, which reveals some secrets about woolly rhino populations in the centuries before their extinction.

“Sequencing the entire genome of an Ice Age animal found in the stomach of another animal has never been done before,” said Uppsala University paleogeneticist Camilo Chacón-Duque, a co-author of the study, in a recent press release.

Scientists found the freeze-dried corpse of the wolf puppy—and her sister—eroding out of the permafrost near the Siberian village of Tumat in 2011 and 2015. When the team brought the puppy to a lab for dissection in 2022, they found small pieces of her last meal still in her stomach. DNA sequencing identified the meat as woolly rhino (or Coelodonta antiquitatis, if you’re fancy) and the puppies as wolves, not dogs.

But extracting a full genome’s worth of DNA from the rhino meat was a challenge. After 14,400 years in the permafrost, DNA molecules break down, leaving genomicists only small, degraded strings. Sorting the rhino’s DNA from the wolf’s was also no small feat.

The rhino’s DNA suggests that it came from a genetically healthy population that was large enough to avoid inbreeding. Inbreeding leaves its mark in descendants’ genomes in the form of long strings of homozygous genes, in which the individual inherits the same version, or allele, of a gene from both parents. It’s normal to have some homozygous genes, but a genome laden with lots of long stretches of homozygosity could be a sign of inbreeding over several generations. The Tumat rhino (or what was left of it) showed no such signs.

That came as a surprise, since woolly rhinos disappear from the fossil record about 400 years later. Already, the species was making its last stand in northeastern Siberia; its range had been shrinking eastward since around 35,000 years ago. But apparently, on the cusp of extinction, the species was still doing pretty well in northeastern Siberia (except for this particular rhino, who got eaten by a wolf after what one can only assume was a bad day).

In the genome of a 49,000-year-old woolly rhino from a few hundred miles east in Rakvachan, Siberia, Guðjónsdóttir and her colleagues found clues about the species’ even more ancient history. Big changes in population size, among other events, can leave traces in the genome, and the researchers used those to estimate that between 114,000 and 63,000 years ago, the woolly rhino population dropped sharply, from about 15,600 to about 1,600.

Those numbers refer to what ecologists call the “effective population,” which means the number of rhinos breeding and contributing to the group’s gene pool (so there would have been more than 1,600 running around, but not all of them were reproducing). After 63,000 years ago, the woolly rhino population seems to have leveled out.

According to ecologists, an effective population of 1,600 rhinos would have been more than enough to keep the species thriving. Smaller populations, especially with shrinking ranges, are more vulnerable to being wiped out by events like environmental change, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks. And small populations are also more likely to face the genetic consequences of inbreeding, a loss of genetic diversity, and genetic drift (in which potentially harmful mutations can pile up), leaving the species even more vulnerable. The whole thing can turn into a vicious cycle.

For most species, the threshold for avoiding those genetic pitfalls is an effective population of around 1,000.

Researchers had expected to find woolly rhinos in dire straits by 14,400 years ago. Prior to discovering the Tumat genome inside a wolf’s stomach, the most recently sequenced woolly rhino genome dated to 18,400 years ago (and it was found just a few miles from the Rakvachan rhino). That genome showed all the signs of a healthy, stable population. But by 14,000 years ago, woolly rhinos disappeared from the fossil record—so it looked like their population must have started its death spiral shortly after 18,400 years ago.

But it turns out that the last woolly rhinos in the world probably died off in just a few hundred years, starting sometime after 14,400 years ago. And the culprit was probably a period of rapid climate warming called the Bølling–Allerød interstadial. An interstadial is a warmer period between the deepest freezes of an Ice Age, and the Bølling–Allerød lasted from 14,700 years ago to 12,800 years ago. Across the northern hemisphere, temperatures rose sharply; ice sheets collapsed, sea levels rose, and the woolly rhinos’ world changed too fast.

When Guðjónsdóttir and her colleagues compared the Tumat rhino’s genome to the one from 18,400 years ago, they found the same very low level of inbreeding and genetic load (a buildup of harmful genes, often from inbreeding or genetic drift). Whatever happened to the woolly rhino gene pool in the end, it hadn’t happened yet when Tumat got eaten by wolves.

In fact, the end of the woolly rhinos may have come so swiftly that it didn’t have time to leave a trace in the genome. The only way to answer that would, of course, be to sequence the genomes of woolly rhinos who lived even closer to the species extinction. And we have to find them first.

The fate of the woolly rhino may eventually shed some light on what’s happening to modern species facing extinction.

“In the current biodiversity crisis driven by anthropogenic climate change, it becomes increasingly important to understand the underlying drivers of population declines and the propensity of species going extinct,” wrote Guðjónsdóttir and her colleagues in their recent paper.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has toyed with personalized answers in Gemini, but that was just a hint of what was to come. Today, the company is announcing extensive “personal intelligence” in Gemini that allows the chatbot to connect to Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube to craft more useful answers to your questions. If you don’t want Gemini to get to know you, there’s some good news. Personal intelligence is beginning as a feature for paid users, and it’s entirely optional.

By every measure, Google’s models are at or near the top of the AI heap. In general, the more information you feed into a generative AI, the better the outputs are. And when that data is personal to you, the resulting inference is theoretically more useful. Google just so happens to have a lot of personal data on all its users, so it’s relatively simple to feed that data into Gemini.

As Personal Intelligence rolls out over the coming weeks, AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers will see the option to connect those data sources. Each can be connected individually, so you might choose to allow Gmail access but block Photos, for example. When Gemini is allowed access to other Google products, it incorporates that data into its responses.

Google VP Josh Woodward claims that he’s already seeing advantages while testing the feature. When shopping for tires, Gemini referenced road trip photos to justify different suggestions and pulled the license plate number from a separate image.

Gemini will cite when it uses your personal data. If the personalized answer isn’t what you want, you can re-run any output without personalization. You may also use temporary chats to get the standard Gemini output without using your account data. Disabling access to one or all data sources in the settings is also always an option.

Perhaps sensing that feeding more data into Gemini would give many people the creeps, Google’s announcement explains at great length how the company has approached privacy in Personal Intelligence. Google isn’t getting any new information about you—your photos, email, and search behaviors are already stored on Google’s servers, so “you don’t have to send sensitive data elsewhere to start personalizing your experience.”

Having the chatbot regurgitate your photos and emails might still be a little unsettling, but Google claims it has built guardrails that keep Gemini from musing on sensitive topics. For example, the chatbot won’t use any health information it finds. However, you can still ask for it to look at that information explicitly.

Google also stresses that your personal data is “not directly used to train the model.” So the images or search habits it references in outputs are not used for training, but the prompts and resulting outputs may be used. Woodward notes that all personal data is filtered from training data. Put another way, the system isn’t trained to learn your license plate number, but it is trained to be able to locate an image containing your license plate.

This feature will be in beta for awhile as it rolls out, and it may take several weeks to reach all paid Gemini accounts. It will work across all Gemini endpoints, including the web, Android, and iOS.

Google also says it plans to expand access to Personal Intelligence in Gemini down the road. Unless Google flip-flops on the default settings, you can leave this feature disabled. That ensures Gemini won’t get additional access to your data, but of course, all that data is still sitting on Google’s servers. This probably won’t be the last time Google tries to entice you to plug your photos into an AI tool.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After repeatedly denying for weeks that his force used AI tools, the chief constable of the West Midlands police has finally admitted that a hugely controversial decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans from the UK did involve hallucinated information from Microsoft Copilot.

In October 2025, Birmingham’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG) met to decide whether an upcoming football match between Aston Villa (based in Birmingham) and Maccabi Tel Aviv could be held safely.

Tensions were heightened in part due to an October 2 terror attack against a synagogue in Manchester where several people were killed by an Islamic attacker.

West Midlands Police, who were a key member of the SAG, argued that the upcoming football match could lead to violence in Birmingham, and they recommended banning fans from the game. The police pointed specifically to claims that Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had been violent in a recent football match in Amsterdam.

This decision was hugely controversial, and it quickly became political. To some Jews and conservatives, it looked like Jewish fans were being banned from the match even though Islamic terror attacks were the more serious source of violence. The football match went ahead on November 6 without fans, but the controversy around the ban has persisted for months.

Making it worse was the fact that the West Midlands Police narrative rapidly fell apart. According to the BBC, police claimed that the Amsterdam football match featured “500-600 Maccabi fans [who] had targeted Muslim communities the night before the Amsterdam fixture, saying there had been ‘serious assaults including throwing random members of the public’ into a river. They also claimed that 5,000 officers were needed to deal with the unrest in Amsterdam, after previously saying that the figure was 1,200.”

Amsterdam police made clear that the West Midlands account of bad Maccabi fan behavior was highly exaggerated, and the BBC recently obtained a letter from the Dutch inspector general confirming that the claims were inaccurate.

But it was one flat-out error—a small one, really—that has made the West Midlands Police recommendation look particularly shoddy. In a list of recent games with Maccabi Tel Aviv fans present, the police included a match between West Ham (UK) and Maccabi Tel Aviv. The only problem? No such match occurred.

So where had this completely fantasized detail come from? As an inquiry into the whole situation was mounted, Craig Guildford, the chief constable of the West Midlands Police, was hauled before Parliament in December 2025 and again in early January 2026 to answer questions. Both times, he claimed the police did not use AI—the obvious suspect in a case like this. In December, Guildford blamed “social media scraping” gone wrong; in January, he chalked it up to some bad Googling.

“We do not use AI,” he told Parliament on January 6. “On the West Ham side of things and how we gained that information, in producing the report, one of the officers would usually go to… a system, which football officers use all over the country, that has intelligence reports of previous games. They did not find any relevant information within the searches that they made for that. They basically Googled when the last time was. That is how the information came to be.”

But Guildford admitted this week that this explanation was, in fact, bollocks. As he acknowledged in a letter on January 12, “I [recently] became aware that the erroneous result concerning the West Ham v Maccabi Tel Aviv match arose as result of a use of Microsoft Co Pilot.”

He had not intended to deceive anyone, he added, saying that “up until Friday afternoon, [I] understood that the West Ham match had only been identified through the use of Google.”

This has made a bad situation even worse. Today, in the House of Commons, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood gave a long statement on the case in which she threw Guildford under the bus and backed over him five or six times.

Mahmood blamed the ban on “confirmation bias” by the police. She said the Amsterdam stories they used were “exaggerated or simply untrue.” And she highlighted the fact that Guildford claimed “AI tools were not used to prepare intelligence reports,” but now “AI hallucination” was said to be responsible.

The whole thing was a “failure of leadership,” and Guildford “no longer has my confidence,” she said.

This last bit was something that everyone in the UK appears to agree on. Conservatives want Guildford to go, too, with party leaders calling for his resignation. MP Nick Timothy has been ranting for days on X about the issue, especially the fact that hallucination-prone AI tools are being used to produce security decisions.

“More detail on the misuse of AI by the police,” he wrote today. “They didn’t just deny it to the home affairs committee. They denied it in FOI requests. They said they have no AI policy. So officers are using a new, unreliable technology for sensitive purposes without training or rules.”</div>

            <h2>EPA makes it harder for states, tribes to block pipelines</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/epa-makes-it-harder-for-states-tribes-to-block-pipelines/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration on Tuesday proposed a new rule aimed at speeding up and streamlining the permitting process for large energy and infrastructure projects, including oil and gas pipelines and facilities tied to artificial intelligence.

The rule, which does not require action by Congress, includes a suite of procedural changes to section 401 of the Clean Water Act—a law enacted in the 1970s that is the primary federal statute governing water pollution in the United States.

For decades, section 401 has granted states and tribes the authority to approve, impose conditions on, or reject, federal permits for projects that they determine will pollute or damage local waterways.

Now, the Trump administration aims to scale back that authority in order to expedite projects and “unleash energy dominance,” said Jess Kramer, EPA assistant administrator for water, in a press briefing. “This proposed rule is the next step in ensuring that states and tribes only utilize section 401 for its statutory purpose to protect water quality and not as a weapon to shut down projects.”

To date, Kramer said, section 401 has allowed major energy projects to stall unnecessarily, calling the current system “fundamentally flawed.” Implementation problems, she said, have led to lengthy certification timelines that are “bad for business.”

The new rule lays out a series of procedural changes that agency officials say are designed to make the permitting process more predictable and efficient. It would create a standardized list of items companies must submit before a state or tribe can begin reviewing a project. “When finalized, the proposed rule will increase transparency, efficiency and predictability for certifying authorities and the regulated community,” Kramer said. It would also prohibit regulators from asking applicants to withdraw and resubmit requests in order to extend deadlines and would reinforce a firm one-year limit for making decisions.

But in addition to making the process more streamlined, it is also restricting states and tribes, said Jon Devine, director of freshwater ecosystems at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“This is an effort to curtail the role of state and tribal water pollution control officials in looking at the impacts of federally permitted projects,” Devine said.

Under the proposal, states and authorized tribes would be limited to reviewing only the direct water-quality impacts of a project’s discharges into federally protected waters and would no longer be able to consider broader water-quality effects caused by the project as a whole, said Nancy Stoner, a senior attorney at the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a Chicago-based nonprofit that defends environmental and public health in the Midwest.

That shift could weaken oversight of projects such as dams, she said, noting that water released from a dam may meet quality standards while the structure itself blocks fish migration and disrupts river flows—impacts the Supreme Court has previously ruled that states may consider when making certification decisions.

Stoner also warned the proposal would further limit state authority to waters still covered by the Clean Water Act, a shrinking category after the Supreme Court’s 2023 Sackett decision and later efforts by EPA and the Army Corps to narrow which waterways qualify for federal protection.

As a result, states could lose the ability to use Section 401 to protect many smaller streams, wetlands, and headwaters within their borders, leaving state regulators powerless to block, or place conditions on, federally permitted projects that could damage those waters, even if they are vital to local drinking water supplies, fisheries, recreation, or flood control.

Kramer, from the EPA, said the proposed rule is intended to curb what the agency views as misuse of Section 401 by some states to block projects for reasons unrelated to water quality.

Kramer said the changes would ensure that section 401 “is not weaponized by states to shut down projects for political purposes, as opposed to protecting water quality.”

State officials, particularly in Democrat-led states, have relied on Section 401 in recent years to deny or place conditions on permits for major projects they say would have harmed local waterways.

In 2017, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and the state’s Department of Ecology relied on Section 401 to reject a critical water-quality certification for a proposed coal export terminal in Longview. State officials concluded the project would cause significant environmental harm that could not be mitigated. Courts later upheld the decision, and the ruling ultimately brought the project to an end.

In 2020, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo used section 401 to deny a permit for a natural gas pipeline proposed to bring fuel from Pennsylvania into the state, citing concerns that its construction would cause significant harm to water quality.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has since approved a permit for the same pipeline project Cuomo denied.

Last summer, EPA hosted two public webinars to solicit input on proposed changes to the law.

At least 14 of the speakers who joined these sessions pointed to the Clean Water Act’s long track record of improving water quality and said section 401 has been essential for protecting rivers and aquatic ecosystems from pollution, according to an EPA summary of the discussions.

The summary states: “Many of these speakers expressed concern that a new rule would weaken State and Tribal authority, arguing that such changes could undermine public health, environmental protection, and local economies.”

Soon, the agency plans to open a 30-day public comment period. After its review, Kramer said the agency would work toward issuing a final rule this spring.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/buttons-in-cars-australian-crash-testers-are-latest-to-require-them/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Like any industry led by designers, the automotive world is subject to trends and fashions. Often, these are things the rest of us complain about. Wheels that used to be 16 inches are now 20s, because the extra size makes the vehicle they’re fitted to look smaller, particularly if it’s an SUV with a slab of electric vehicle battery to conceal. Front seat passengers now find themselves with their own infotainment screen, often with some kind of active filter tech to prevent the driver from being distracted by whatever it is they’re doing. And of course le buzz du jour, AI, is being crammed in here, there, and everywhere.

But the thing about fashion and trends is that they don’t remain in style forever. For a few years, it was hard to drive a new car that didn’t use piano black trim all over the interior. The shiny black plastic surfaces hide infotainment screens well when the display is not turned on, but they scratch and show every speck of dust and lint and every smudge and fingerprint. And that’s true for the cheap econobox to the plush luxobarge. The industry finally cottoned on to this, and “black gloss has had its time—we can do without it,” Kia designer Jochen Paesen told me a few years ago.

Many of those design trends may have been annoying, but the switch away from buttons isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s affecting safety. And increasingly, safety regulators are pushing back. A couple of years ago, we learned that the Euro New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) organization, which crash tests cars for European consumers, decided that from 2026, it would start deducting points for basic controls that weren’t separate, physical controls that the driver can easily operate without taking their eyes off the road. And now ANCAP, which provides similar crash testing for Australia and New Zealand, has done the same.

It’s helpful to know that the lack of physical buttons isn’t just a trend pushed by designers—the bean counters like it, too. It’s quicker—and therefore cheaper—during assembly to just fit a capacitive touch module that controls multiple settings or switches than it is to have individual buttons, each connected to a wiring loom. Which is why we’re seeing the controls for heating and cooling the interior, the headlights, seat heaters, and more move from knobs and dials and sliders and buttons to touch panels. Sometimes they’re standalone, sometimes they’re embedded along the bezels of the infotainment touchscreen. Sometimes they’re even their own touchscreen.

And they’re more distracting to use than physical buttons.

Like Euro NCAP, ANCAP does not require all functions to be physical buttons, lest all our cars look like the flight deck of a Boeing 747-400, or perhaps a first-generation Porsche Panamera. That won’t go nearly far enough for some, but it is at least a move in the right direction.

“From 2026, we’re asking car makers to either offer physical buttons for important driver controls like the horn, indicators, hazard lights, windscreen wipers and headlights, or dedicate a fixed portion of the cabin display screen to these primary driving functions,” it wrote in its guidance of what’s changed for 2026. Similarly, Europe is requiring turn signals, hazard lights, windshield wipers, the horn, and any SOS features like the EU’s eCall function.

Encouragingly, it looks like automakers are starting to take this to heart and are designing newer models accordingly. Porsche was an early ditcher of buttons after having previously used many, many of them (like the aforementioned Panamera), but as we found in our preview of the next Cayenne, real buttons are back.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A passenger bailed from his Waymo robotaxi as the vehicle drove dangerously close to an oncoming railcar.

Viral footage of the incident, which took place last Wednesday, shows the car blundering down a stretch of light rail tracks in Phoenix, Arizona, as if it were an actual motorist lane it was supposed to be driving in. The passenger, smelling trouble, exits the car during one of its random stops without looking back.

“Oh get out get out get out!” the bystander taking the footage can be heard saying. Moments later, a railcar a few hundred yards directly behind the Waymo can be briefly seen beginning to pull out from the station.

But the Waymo’s antics weren’t over yet. After driving again, it then suddenly stops as another railcar comes lumbering down the opposing pair of tracks, while the one behind it appears unsure of whether to proceed. Piling one bad decision on top of another, the robotaxi decides to start reversing, but doesn’t leave the track before the video ends.

@Waymo what happened here? passenger said im out🤣 #waymo #fyp #fail #tiktokfail #funny

A Valley Metro spokesperson said that Waymo was notified about the incident after an employee noticed the baffling spectacle.

“At approximately 9 a.m. on Wednesday morning, a Valley Metro employee observed an autonomous Waymo vehicle on the northbound light rail tracks near Southern Avenue and Central Avenue in Phoenix,” the spokesperson said, as quoted by local news station KTVK. “Light rail operations staff responded to the scene, and Waymo was contacted. To minimize service impacts, northbound and southbound trains exchanged passengers before reversing direction to continue service.”

Waymo robotaxis, despite touting an impressive safety record, have been known to get into all kinds of bizarre traffic contretemps, many of them dangerous. The cars have been caught driving on the wrong side of the road, getting stuck in roundabouts, blowing through police standoffs, and ignoring stopped school buses. The company also faced intense outrage after one of its self-driving cabs ran over and killed a beloved bodega cat in San Francisco.

Scrutiny into the robotaxis’ safety and capabilities is higher than ever after seemingly its entire fleet went haywire during a power outage in the Bay Area last month, plunging the streets of San Francisco into chaos as the rudderless cabs piled up at intersections and blocked traffic.

Andrew Maynard, an emerging and transformative technology professor at Arizona State University, dismissed the latest Waymo incident as an edge case.

“I actually felt a little sorry for the car. It obviously made a bad decision and got itself in a difficult place,” Maynard told KTVK. “This is exactly one of those edge cases, what we call them. Something unexpected where the machine drove like a machine rather than a person.”

Waymo has not made a statement about the incident.

            <h2>Antarctica’s Former Largest Iceberg Is Now Completely Disintegrating</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/largest-iceberg-disintegrating">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An enormous iceberg that split off from the Antarctic ice sheet decades ago has turned an alarmingly bright shade of vivid blue — an alarming indication that it’s about to undergo complete disintegration before the much warmer summer months are over.

When it first detached in 1986, the ice giant known as A-23A was twice the size of Rhode Island, becoming one of the largest and oldest bergs to be tracked by scientists, according to NASA. In January 2025, it measured around 1,410 square miles, earning it the Guinness world record for the largest existing iceberg.

It has since shrunk to a mere 456 square miles, roughly the size of Manhattan, by early January following several major pieces breaking off over the last year. According to data by the US National Ice Center, several other icebergs have now overtaken A-23A in terms of total square miles.

While the berg’s birth 40 years ago isn’t believed to have been the result of human-induced climate change, it’s yet another pertinent reminder that we will continue seeing massive icebergs, or “megabergs,” calving from the melting Antarctic ice shelf as global temperatures continue to climb and warm ocean waters.

A satellite image highlighted by NASA on its website last week shows the enormous iceberg “sopping with blue meltwater” as it drifts off the coast of the southern tip of South America — a “giant swimming pool, as New Scientist put it. The image, which was taken on December 26 by NASA’s Terra satellite, shows pools of deep blue water visible on its surface, which, according to experts are clear signs of “ongoing disintegration events.”

“You have the weight of the water sitting inside cracks in the ice and forcing them open,” explained University of Colorado Boulder senior research scientist Ted Scambos in a statement to NASA.

The blue diagonal stripes visible in the satellite image are of particular interest. Experts believe they’re scour marks that date back to a time when A-23A was dragged across Antarctic bedrock hundreds of years ago.

“The striations formed parallel to the direction of flow, which ultimately created subtle ridges and valleys on the top of the iceberg that now direct the flow of meltwater,” added National Snow & Ice Data Center senior research scientist Walt Meier told NASA. “It’s impressive that these striations still show up after so much time has passed, massive amounts of snow have fallen, and a great deal of melting has occurred from below.”

The situation is dire enough that scientists believe A-23A could be months, if not weeks, away from disintegrating completely.

“I certainly don’t expect A-23A to last through the austral summer,” retired University of Maryland Baltimore County scientist Chris Shuman told NASA.

At the current rate, temperatures are already around three degrees Celsius warmer than expected — such a disintegration could accelerate.

A-23A left the relatively shallow waters near the Antarctic ice shelf in 2020, and spent several years drifting and spinning. It almost collided with South Georgia island last year.

NASA described its deathwatch as a “bittersweet moment.”

“I’m incredibly grateful that we’ve had the satellite resources in place that have allowed us to track it and document its evolution so closely,” Shuman said. “A-23A faces the same fate as other Antarctic bergs, but its path has been remarkably long and eventful. It’s hard to believe it won’t be with us much longer.”

Meanwhile, scientists race to better understand how icebergs behave and how shrinking glaciers due to global warming affect their famously unpredictable behavior.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rumors are running rampant online that Matt and Ross Duffer used OpenAI’s ChatGPT when producing the last season of “Stranger Things” after fans zoomed on a still from a behind-the-scenes documentary that appears to show that one of the brothers had the AI chatbot open while working on the script.

“WTF man, now we know why season 5 sucked,” wrote one upset fan of the show on X-formerly-Twitter in response.

Martina Radwan, director of the documentary “One Last Adventure: The Making of Stranger Things 5,” told The Hollywood Reporter in a new interview that she didn’t witness anybody using ChatGPT in the tv show writer’s room.

“No, of course not,” she said. “I witnessed creative exchanges. I witnessed conversation.”

Of course, a person making a hagiographic documentary about the production of the show for Netflix probably isn’t the world’s most neutral source. And she doesn’t quite shut the door on its use, either.

“But to me it’s like, doesn’t everybody have it open, to just do quick research?” she caveated in her hard-to-follow answer to the question.

Nonetheless, the online controversy and the interview show that many people who watch original entertainment don’t want a whiff of AI around their favorite movies or shows, though some production companies have already made forays into its use, most prominently in “de-aging” actors.

Controversies have erupted online when AI use has been unearthed, including its use in tweaking actor Adrien Brody’s Hungarian accent in the movie “The Brutalist” and for generating promotional posters for director Alex Garland’s movie “Civil War.”

Viewers and industry experts should expect more of these flashpoints to erupt as Hollywood bigwigs debate whether to use AI.

Some are stridently against the tech — director Guillermo del Toro said he would rather die than use it — but entertainment giants are rapidly jumping on board. Disney, for instance, recently signed a $1 billion licensing deal with OpenAI, which will allow users to play with Disney-owned characters in OpenAI’s video generator Sora.

The debate is far from over, though. Big tech has already eaten journalism’s lunch — and perhaps Hollywood is next on the menu.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Color us shocked: pretty much everyone hates that Elon Musk’s Grok has been digitally undressing photos of adults and children.

At least that’s the case in the UK, providing the closest thing we’ve currently got to a gauge of the public sentiment on the issue. In a new survey conducted by YouGov amid the latest controversy surrounding the xAI chatbot, a staggering 97 percent of respondents said that AI tools shouldn’t be allowed to generate sexually explicit content of children, and 96 percent said they shouldn’t be able to generate “undressed” images of minors only wearing clothing like underwear, either. Sanity may not prevail on X, but it does at least appear to still have a firm grip in real life.

The overwhelming consensus goes to show just how much of a nerve xAI and Grok struck over the past week and half as the bot allowed users to easily generate nudes or sexually charged images of people, many of them minors, whose photos were shared on X, Musk’s social media platform where Grok operates. The trend spiraled out of control so quickly that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated the bot was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute.

Outrage quickly spread against the appalling practice among the public and regulators, and some countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, moved to ban access to X outright. Prime minister Keir Starmer has hinted that the UK could follow suit. The saga also put pressure on Google and Apple for continuing to host X on their app stores, despite it violating the rules.

Yet xAI has not made an official statement regarding the Grok generations, which some experts say could be illegal — despite facing the public for some of Grok’s previous controversies, such as when it began styling itself as “MechaHitler” during a racist posting spree. Musk, meanwhile, simply joked that the whole affair was “way funnier” than the trends started by other AI chatbots.

Overall, the YouGov poll shows that the British public continues to despise Musk’s platform, with 65 percent holding a negative view of X, and only 12 percent holding a positive one.

Additionally, 87 percent believe AIs like Grok shouldn’t be allowed to generate “undressed” images of real adults in racy outfits like underwear, lingerie, or bikinis.

            <h2>Indie Developer Deleting Entire Game From Steam Due to Shame From Having Used AI</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/indie-developer-deleting-entire-game-ai">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An indie game developer experienced a moment of profound moral clarity, and is now deleting his partially-AI-made game from the digital storefront Steam.

The game, dubbed “Hardest,” is a free-to-play “rock-paper-scissors” roguelike card game released last July to mixed-to-negative reviews (of which there are barely thirty total.) Some users called it “soulless” and disparaged it for using AI art.

Now the developer, Eero “Rakuel” Laine, appears to agree with those haters. On January 10, Laine posted a surprise update to the Hardest page announcing that he would be deleting the game by the end of January, sounding penitent for his mortal sin of indulging in an AI shortcut.

“I made this game during the summer in [a] couple months and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free,” he explained. “But I have realized [that] AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment.”

“Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason the get more investment for their AI companies, that benefit no one, but rather suck resources from the economy from hard working people,” he added.

Laine clarified that he didn’t vibe-code the whole game, and actually programmed “everything myself,” so he’s ready to make a new game in the future with real, human-made assets. But his current game, he says, “is a disgrace to all game makers and players.”

“The girl I’ve been dating for a month made me realize this,” he added, in yet another wild twist.

The use of generative AI has been a hot button issue in art and entertainment, and game development has been no exception. In recent months, the debate over how it should be used in the industry, if at all, has been reignited over its role in the creation of several high profile titles.

When the fantasy RPG sensation Claire Obscur: Expedition 33 racked up a historical number of accolades at last year’s The Game Awards, including game of the year, concerned observers noted the fact that the creators had openly admitted to using AI assets during its development, though no AI is said to have made it into the final product. Then the Indie Game Awards announced that it was rescinding its GOTY award given to Expedition 33 because of its AI usage, blowing the debate wide open.

Adding to the swirling discourse, after dropping a trailer for its upcoming title Divinity at the Game Awards ceremony, the CEO of the Baldur’s Gate 3 maker Larian boasted that the studio would be using AI to “explore ideas” and “develop concept art.” The message seemed to be that AI in game development was here to stay, and would not be an obstacle to games having both critical and commercial success, as further evidenced by the popularity of new fan-favorite Arc Raiders, an multiplayer extraction shooter that uses AI to generate the voices of both player characters and NPCs. Perhaps the entire industry is overdue for an epiphany like Laine’s.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At this point, tech corporations have made it no secret that their end goal is to replace all jobs with AI — thus cementing themselves as indispensable to the world economy. But what happens if we actually get to that point?

Either they don’t have a clue, or they don’t want to say.

Speaking at a press conference last month, Geoffrey Hinton — a pioneer in the field of neural networks, the bedrock of modern AI — remarked that “it’s clear that a lot of jobs are going to disappear: it’s not clear that it’s going to create a lot of jobs to replace that.”

Often lauded as a “godfather of AI,” Hinton has gone on the record many times to warn about the social cost of AI solutionism in an economic system driven by profit. “This isn’t AI’s problem,” he continued last month. “This is our political system’s problem. If you get a massive increase in productivity, how does that wealth get shared around?”

It’s a critically important question as AI spending becomes integral to the US economy, yet one which tech corporations and the moguls heading them have been at a loss to answer.

SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, for example, has waxed poetic about a future in which AI and robotics could make us all rich. Currently the world’s wealthiest person himself, Musk has spent some time over the last few weeks bleating about “universal high income,” a take on universal basic income where every out-of-work peon would live comfortably off the prosperity of private corporations, like his beleaguered AI venture, xAI.

Of course, as The New Yorker‘s John Cassidy observes, such material abundance for displaced workers won’t be possible unless Musk and his fellow billionaires agree to share their largesse. (As Martin Luther King Jr wrote from Birmingham Jail, “it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.”)

OpenAI’s Sam Altman has echoed Musk’s ideas, saying he hopes AI can bring about what he calls “universal extreme wealth,” in which everyone basically has ownership stakes in every AI company.

Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind and CEO of Microsoft AI, has called AI a “fundamentally labor-replacing tool,” which is evidently worth the mass economic turmoil, because “in 15 or 20 years’ time, we will be producing new scientific, cultural knowledge at almost zero marginal cost.”

Overall, it’s hard to see this scenario coming to pass. Currently, Goldman Sachs only predicts a 7 percent increase in global GDP over the next ten years due to AI, while the Penn Wharton Budget Model foresees a 3.7 percent boost to GDP by 2075.

Any AI-driven bump in GDP would undoubtedly be a boost — but far from the one needed to avoid widespread poverty and anguish without major concessions from the billionaire class. But hey, if they’re serious about it, there’s never been a better time for them to put their money where their mouth is.

            <h2>AI models are starting to crack high-level math problems</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/ai-models-are-starting-to-crack-high-level-math-problems/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the weekend, Neel Somani, who is a software engineer, former quant researcher, and a startup founder, was testing the math skills of OpenAI’s new model when he made an unexpected discovery. After pasting the problem into ChatGPT and letting it think for 15 minutes, he came back to a full solution. He evaluated the proof and formalized it with a tool called Harmonic — but it all checked out.

“I was curious to establish a baseline for when LLMs are effectively able to solve open math problems compared to where they struggle,” Somani said. The surprise was that, using the latest model, the frontier started to push forward a bit.

ChatGPT’s chain of thought is even more impressive, rattling off mathematical axioms like Legendre’s formula, Bertrand’s postulate, and the Star of David theorum. Eventually, the model found a Math Overflow post from 2013, where Harvard mathematician Noam Elkies had given an elegant solution to a similar problem. But ChatGPT’s final proof differed from Elkies’ work in important ways, and gave a more complete solution to a version of the problem posed by legendary mathematician Paul Erdős, whose vast collection of unsolved problems has become a proving ground for AI.

For anyone skeptical of machine intelligence, it’s a surprising result — and it’s not the only one. AI tools have become ubiquitous in mathematics, from formalization-oriented LLMs like Harmonic’s Aristotle to literature review tools like OpenAI’s deep research. But since the release of GPT 5.2 — which Somani describes as “anecdotally more skilled at mathematical reasoning than previous iterations” — the sheer volume of solved problems has become difficult to ignore, raising new questions about large language models’ ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge.

Somani was looking at the Erdős problems, a set of over one thousand conjectures by the Hungarian mathematician that are maintained online. The problems have become a tempting target for AI-driven mathematics, varying significantly in both subject matter and difficulty. The first batch of autonomous solutions came in November from a Gemini-powered model called AlphaEvolve — but more recently, Somani and others have found GPT 5.2 to be remarkably adept with high-level math.

Since Christmas, 15 problems have been moved from “open” to “solved” on the Erdős website — and 11 of the solutions have specifically credited AI models as involved in the process.

The revered mathematician Terence Tao has a more nuanced look at the progress on his GitHub page, counting eight different problems where AI models made meaningful autonomous progress on an Erdős problem, with six other cases where progress was made by locating and building on previous research. It’s a long way from AI systems being able to do math without human intervention, but it’s clear that there’s an important role for large models to play.

On Mastodon, Tao conjectured that the scalable nature of AI systems makes them “better suited for being systematically applied to the ‘long tail’ of obscure Erdős problems, many of which actually have straightforward solutions.”

“As such, many of these easier Erdős problems are now more likely to be solved by purely AI-based methods than by human or hybrid means,” Tao continued.

Another driving force is a recent shift towards formalization, a labor-intensive task that makes mathematical reasoning easier to verify and extend. Formalization doesn’t require use of AI or even computers, but a new crop of automated tools have made the process far easier. The open-source “proof assistant” Lean, which was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013, has become widely used within the field as a way of formalizing proof— and AI tools like Harmonic’s Aristotle promise to automate much of the work of formalization.

For Harmonic founder Tudor Achim, the sudden jump in solved Erdős problems is less important than the fact that the world’s greatest mathematicians are starting to take those tools seriously. “I care more about the fact that math and computer science professors are using [AI tools],” Achim said. “These people have reputations to protect, so when they’re saying they use Aristotle or they use ChatGPT, that’s real evidence.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With news that Discord is kicking the tires on going public soon, other tech companies are starting to take their chances. Liftoff Mobile filed its first S-1 document late Tuesday, the first step in the process.

The company isn’t yet discussing how big this IPO will be: it has not yet filled in any data yet about the size of the offering or the stakes held by its principal shareholders. However, the IPO research firm Renaissance Capital reports the whisper number at $400 million, meaning that’s what the street thinks the company hopes to raise.The company offers a platform that helps mobile app developers market their apps and was formed in 2021 through a merger of Liftoff and Vungle. Blackstone acquired the majority of its shares at the time and the finance giant also appointed new leadership, meaning it is no longer a founder-run company. After the offering, Blackstone will remain the majority shareholder, according to the S-1 filing.

Another interesting tidbit: This listing, despite its relatively small expected size, has an unusually large number of bankers underwriting it. The offering has three joint lead bankers (Goldman, Jefferies, and Morgan Stanley) and another 12 banks assisting to sell, plus three other financial institutions, including Blackstone, involved. Whew! That could either be a sign of strong investor interest or the need to spread risk across many institutions.

Liftoff claims 140,000 apps use its services. It says it had 2025 revenues of over $519 million and a net loss of just over $48 million. The company also says it is carrying over $1.85 billion in debt.

            <h2>Digg launches its new Reddit rival to the public</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/digg-launches-its-new-reddit-rival-to-the-public/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The reboot of the early internet online community Digg, a one-time rival to Reddit, is moving forward. The company, which is today back under the ownership of its original founder, Kevin Rose, along with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, is launching its open beta to the public on Wednesday.

Similar to Reddit, the new Digg offers a website and mobile app where you can browse feeds featuring posts from across a selection of its communities and join other communities that align with your interests. There, you can post, comment, and upvote (or “digg”) the site’s content.

Originally a Web 2.0-era news aggregation site, Digg was once valued at $175 million in 2008 but was ultimately outpaced by Reddit. That earlier version was split up in 2012, with its largest stake sold to the incubator Betaworks, while LinkedIn and The Washington Post picked up other pieces. This iteration of Digg drew additional investment in 2016 but was later sold to a digital advertising company in 2018.

Meanwhile, Reddit continued to grow as a community-focused site that has since gone public and is currently generating additional revenue from content licensing agreements with major players in AI, including Google and OpenAI.

However, the rise of AI has presented an opportunity to rebuild Digg, Rose and Ohanian believe, leading them to acquire Digg last March through a leveraged buyout by True Ventures, Ohanian’s firm Seven Seven Six, Rose and Ohanian themselves, and the venture firm S32. The company has not disclosed its funding.

They’re betting that AI can help to address some of the messiness and toxicity of today’s social media landscape. At the same time, social platforms will need a new set of tools to ensure they’re not taken over by AI bots posing as people.

“We obviously don’t want to force everyone down some kind of crazy KYC process,” said Rose, in an interview with TechCrunch, referring to the “know your customer” verification process used by financial institutions to confirm someone’s identity.

Instead, he proposes that Digg should pick up “little signals of trust along the way and bundle them all together into something that’s meaningful.”

Instead of simply offering verification checkmarks to designate trust, Digg will try out new technologies, like using zero-knowledge proofs (cryptographic methods that verify information without revealing the underlying data) to verify the people using its platform. It could also do other things, like require that people who join a product-focused community verify they actually own or use the product being discussed there.

As an example, a community for Oura ring owners could verify that everyone who posts has proven they own one of the smart rings.

Plus, Rose suggests Digg could use signals acquired from mobile devices to help verify members — for instance, the app could identify when Digg users attended a meetup in the same location.

“I don’t think there’s going to be any one silver bullet here,” said Rose. “It’s just going to be us saying… here’s a platter of things that you can add together to create trust.”

Before today’s public beta launch, the site offered 21 more generalized communities like gaming, technology, and entertainment, and was open to 67,000 users on an invite-only basis. Now, anyone will be able to join and start their own communities on nearly any topic, no matter how niche — a top request from beta testers. The community managers (aka moderators) for these individual forums will be able to set their own rules, and their moderation logs will be shared publicly, so members can see what decisions are being made.

The site has also been redesigned since its private beta, now offering a new sidebar where you can pin your favorite communities and a main feed optimized for visual elements.

At launch, communities will only have one manager, but that will change in time, as the company adds more features, including those to customize the look-and-feel and functionality of individual communities with integrations and other tools. For instance, a movie reviews community could include scores from Letterboxd.

“We kind of opted for…let’s just keep building this plane as we fly it,” explained Digg CEO Justin Mezell. “That means that it’s going to be very lightweight, and we’re just going to be aggressively shipping every week and just giving them new features as we go,” he added.

The company also plans to listen to its community managers about what they need and build accordingly, and it has brought on some Reddit moderators as advisors. Although Reddit was built on the back of volunteer moderators, Digg aims to find a model that improves the moderator experience. Plans on this front haven’t been fleshed out yet, however, but Mezell said it “has to be a conversation.”

“We need to figure out a way to make this an equitable experience for everybody who’s actually building Digg into what it needs to become,” he noted.

In addition, the team is considering shifting its AI-created podcast about the interesting stories surfacing on Digg into a human-hosted version, as users have been requesting.

Rose told TechCrunch that the current team is small, giving them “years of runway” to find product-market fit.

“The beautiful thing about this launch is we’re finally at the place with Digg where it’s just that the foundational stuff is done, and now we can really start having fun,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google announced Wednesday the launch of a revamped Trends Explore page, now featuring Gemini-powered capabilities that automatically identify and compare trends related to your searches. The update is rolling out on desktop starting today.

The Trends Explore page has long served as a valuable tool for content creators, journalists, and researchers, making it easy to analyze search interest for any topic over time, across regions, and by category. The new Gemini experience streamlines much of the manual work involved in exploring trending topics, reducing research time, and surfacing connections that users might otherwise overlook.

The redesigned Explore page now features a side panel that automatically identifies and compares relevant trends in your area of interest. Users will also see a list of suggested Gemini prompts to help with deeper exploration.

​The page features a refreshed design, with dedicated icons and colors for each search term, making it easier to match them to their corresponding lines on the graph. Additionally, Google increased the number of terms users can compare and doubled the number of rising queries displayed on each timeline.

A Google blog post uses trending dog breeds as an example to illustrate the new capabilities. The AI automatically populates the graph with up to eight search terms, such as “golden retriever” or “beagle.” It also suggests related topics like “hypoallergenic dog breeds” or “large dog breeds” for further exploration. Users can hover over a term to edit it or use filters for country, time, and property to customize the Trends timeline.

​This update is part of Google’s ongoing effort to embed Gemini into its core offerings. The company has already added AI capabilities to Search, Gmail, Maps, and Docs.

            <h2>Bandcamp takes a stand against AI music, banning it from the platform</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/bandcamp-takes-a-stand-against-ai-music-banning-it-from-the-platform/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The music distribution platform Bandcamp announced in a Reddit post on Tuesday that it’s banning AI-generated music and audio.

“We want musicians to keep making music, and for fans to have confidence that the music they find on Bandcamp was created by humans,” the company said.

Bandcamp’s new guidelines state that music and audio generated “wholly or in substantial part by AI” is not permitted and that it will not allow the use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles.

So, if Drake had released “Taylor Made Freestyle” on Bandcamp, he would’ve had a problem (and maybe it would’ve been for his own good).

As AI music generators like Suno become more sophisticated, it’s become harder to avoid synthetic music — songs created with AI tools have topped charts on Spotify and Billboard. AI music now sounds real enough that it can be difficult to decipher how it was made.

In one high-profile example, Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her (supposedly organic) poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed To Know.” Her AI “persona,” Xania Monet, received multiple bids for record deals before signing with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.

The legality of AI-generated music is up in the air. Suno is currently facing lawsuits from major labels Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group, which allege the company trained its AI on copyrighted material from the labels.

This hasn’t deterred Silicon Valley, though. Suno raised a $250 million Series C round in November, which valued the company at $2.4 billion. While the raise was led by Menlo Ventures, Suno saw participation from Hallwood Media, the company backing Xania Monet.

The legal outlook doesn’t look good for artists. In a recent lawsuit, a judge ruled that Anthropic could use copyrighted books that it downloaded illegally to train its AI. What was illegal, the judge said, was that Anthropic pirated the books that it fed into its AI models. The company got a $1.5 billion slap on the wrist, which isn’t very significant for a company that’s valued at $183 billion.

Unlike Spotify or Apple Music, Bandcamp doesn’t pay artists per stream. Instead, Bandcamp allows artists to sell their music digitally alongside physical products like merch and CDs.

Bandcamp only makes money from its cut of artists’ sales — but even if it presents itself as an artist-first distributor, a tech company is still a tech company, and the bottom line matters. Looking at Bandcamp’s move optimistically, perhaps the company is confirming what artists hope to be true: No one is actually spending money to buy AI-generated music, at least not on Bandcamp.

The new funding is a convertible note that brings the total venture investment in the startup to more than $160 million. Type One is also in the midst of raising a $250 million Series B at a $900 million pre-money valuation, according to sources and later confirmed by the company.

Like other energy startups, Type One has benefited from a surge in demand from data centers and the broader electrification of the economy. Data centers are expected to use nearly three times more electricity by 2035, while overall electricity demand is forecast to grow by 4% annually through next year.

Fusion power could deliver gigawatts’ worth of nearly limitless clean power. The reactors work by fusing atoms, which release tremendous amounts of heat and energy in the process. Power plants harvest that heat to spin turbines, similar to today’s fossil fuel facilities, but without the pollution.

Unlike fission, fusion reactors don’t produce significant amounts of radioactive waste. They also don’t pose a risk of catastrophic meltdowns.

There are two main approaches to fusion power: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. In the former, magnets compress and control plasma, the superheated particles that ultimately fuse into new atoms. In the latter, fuel pellets are compressed until they fuse, most often using lasers.

Type One will employ magnetic confinement, and the design is what’s known as a stellarator. In a stellarator, magnets are arranged in a doughnut shape that’s twisted and turned according to the demands of the plasma. Previously built stellarators have been able to control plasma for long periods of time, though none have been built yet with the intention of producing power.

Last year, Type One signed deals with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to place the startup’s first commercial power plant at the site of the former Bull Run Fossil Plant, a coal-fired power plant that was retired in 2023. Infinity Two, as the power plant is called, is expected to generate 350 megawatts of electricity and could come online in the mid-2030s, the company has said.

Unlike many other startups, Type One isn’t planning to build the power plants or reactors itself and sell the power. Instead, the company will sell key technology to the TVA and power providers, who will build, own, and operate the plants.

Type One had previously raised a $29 million seed round in 2023 that was extended to a total of $82.5 million in 2024. Investors in that round included Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures, and TDK Ventures.

            <h2>Putin’s Explosive Message to Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/putin-oreshnik-lviv/685611/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Friday, Russia attacked Lviv, a major Ukrainian city near the Polish border, using Oreshnik: an intermediate-range, nuclear-capable ballistic missile. Security-camera footage captured brief flashes in the sky, the missile’s multiple warheads entering the atmosphere at 10 times the speed of sound, and then—impact. The missile that struck Lviv did not carry a nuclear payload, but it did carry a political one, at a moment when Vladimir Putin appears to be cornered and Donald Trump is more belligerent than ever.

Firing an Oreshnik comes with logistical headaches. The launch must be carried out by the Strategic Rocket Forces—the core of Russia’s nuclear triad—and it cannot be a surprise. Moscow notifies the United States in advance to avoid triggering a retaliatory strike. More important, without a nuclear payload, the missile has limited military value; Russia has other weapons capable of inflicting similar damage at a fraction of the cost. The most logical reason for Russia’s use of this weapon at this time is to remind America that it is still a superpower and that Putin is still in control.

Trump has been friendly to Putin—but not useful to him. Moscow entered 2026 under more U.S. sanctions than before Trump’s reelection, with a much-worse economy, and is unable to agree to any of the peace proposals on the table. The Kremlin is all smiles whenever Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is in town, and Putin still calls Trump ahead of the U.S. president’s meetings with Volodymyr Zelensky, but Oreshnik is the Kremlin’s statement piece. The missile’s launch means that Russia’s hopes for an agreeable Trump have more or less vanished—especially after U.S. forces captured former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on January 3.

Read: Why Maduro probably can’t count on Putin

Numerous pundits and opinion pieces suggested that Trump’s Venezuela raid would send a welcome signal to Russia and China: Spheres of influence are back, and the U.S. will dominate the Western Hemisphere while allowing China to invade Taiwan and Putin to freely go after the countries that were once part of the Warsaw Pact.

Beijing, however, is unlikely to be seriously reconsidering its decades-old Taiwan policy based on Washington’s 17th regime change in South America. As for Putin, he did not need any “signals” from George W. Bush to attack Georgia in 2008. He never received a green light from Barack Obama to annex Crimea in 2014 or intervene in Syria a year later. And even though Joe Biden upheld the so-called rules-based international order, Putin still launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Years before American bombs fell on Caracas, the Russian leader was waging the largest land war in Europe since World War II, alongside an ongoing hybrid campaign across the continent. He didn’t need U.S. Special Forces to storm Maduro’s compound to order Zelensky’s assassination—he’s already tried and failed repeatedly to have the Ukrainian president killed.

The expectation in Moscow was that America would be withdrawing from the world, but just in the past few weeks, Washington has bombed Nigeria, Syria, and Venezuela, and issued threats to bomb Iran (again), should the Islamic Republic open fire on protesters, which it has done. The Kremlin tried to shield an oil tanker that the United States was determined to seize—allowing it to fly the Russian flag, issuing diplomatic warnings, and even shadowing it with Russian military vessels, reportedly including a submarine. The U.S. Coast Guard took the ship anyway and then seized a second tanker near Venezuela.

On January 3, Russia lost a major foothold in South America. In the past two decades, Moscow has provided $34 billion to Venezuela, mostly to purchase Russian-made weapons, and loaned it $3.15 billion that now may not be paid back. Russia also signed a defense-cooperation pact with Cuba last spring. The Trump administration is threatening that country, too, and Moscow is not really in a position to prevent Washington from raiding Havana.

Washington’s rhetoric toward Moscow has changed as well. While visiting shipbuilders in Newport News, Virginia, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth quipped about the Venezuela operation, “Seems those Russian air defenses didn’t quite work so well, did they?” When asked what safeguards were in place to prevent escalation with Russia over Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered one of the most unpleasant lines Moscow could hear: “We’re not concerned about an escalation with Russia with regards to Venezuela.” He added that the United States has always expected Moscow to provide only “rhetorical” support for the Maduro regime. He then wished Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, a merry Christmas.

Putin’s options for retaliation are limited at best. Ukraine was supposed to be for Russia what Venezuela was for the U.S.—a quick, victorious war against a much smaller neighbor. That war has now lasted longer than the Soviet campaign against Nazi Germany (1941–45). This time, however, no cavalry, no army reserves, and no Soviet tank divisions will be plowing through Europe. Russia has lost many, if not most, of its tanks. It has no navy capable of defending allied regimes such as Venezuela and Cuba against the United States. After spending years trying to conquer Ukraine, Putin has effectively narrowed Russia’s room for maneuver to Ukraine’s borders alone. A Russian “victory” now amounts to little more than a flattened village with a Russian flag planted in the rubble. Even then, success is never assured: Putin believed he had captured the small city of Kupiansk, until Zelensky posted a video of himself there. Thus comes the symbolic firing of the intermediate-range Oreshnik—one of the last ways for Russia to project its power.

Trump is especially reactive to anything nuclear, or the “n-word,” as he calls it. Last summer, he announced tariffs on India and an additional penalty for purchasing Russian oil, and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev responded on Telegram that Trump should “revisit his favorite movies about the living dead and recall just how dangerous the mythical ‘Dead Hand’ can be”—a reference to Russia’s Cold War–era automatic nuclear retaliation system. Trump fired back on Truth Social: “Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that.”

As evidenced by new sanctions on Russian oil, the seizure of Russian tankers, and the continuing flow of American weapons to Ukraine, Putin has repeatedly overplayed his hand with the president of the United States. What’s worse for Putin—and possibly for the world—is that this Trump is on the warpath. Most of his recent press conferences have included references to bombing or regime-changing one country or another (the list now includes a NATO country, too). This is not the real-estate or cryptocurrency Trump. This is Trump with guns—a leader whose doctrine boils down to “ICE for Americans. Delta Force for everyone else.”

On Friday, Fox News’s Peter Doocy asked Trump whether he would ever order a mission to capture Putin. Trump replied, in part, “I don’t think it’s going to be necessary. I’ve always had a great relationship with him.”

The statement read as deeply insulting to the Russian leader. Still, launching an intermediate-range ballistic missile to send a message to this new version of Trump may not play out the way Putin intends. Rather than reasserting Russia’s power, it risks putting two aging authoritarians with nuclear stockpiles on a path of mutual escalation—one of the most dangerous developments since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, and perhaps even since the Cold War.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The protests in Iran are real. The country’s economic desperation runs deep, and millions of citizens want to see a corrupt and repressive regime gone. The violent crackdown on the protests is also real and appears to have cost thousands of lives. Yet the accounts, photos, and videos coming out of Iran are riddled with accusations of AI manipulation and fakery that have the effect of calling even what’s true into doubt.

There’s a term of art for the benefit that accrues to bad actors when they sow public uncertainty as to whether anything at all is real: It’s the liar’s dividend, and it’s very much in evidence in Iran.

AI-generated or -enhanced online content has become a global problem for those seeking to understand or document protest movements, because it allows interested parties to shape narratives. In 2025, AI-generated images of real protest moments muddied the view of events in Turkey, and AI-generated content became a mobilization tool for Nepal’s Gen Z uprising. But Iran is perhaps the most fraught arena of all. Multiple political factions, foreign governments, and the Iranian regime itself are all competing to shape the narrative of current events. And the tools for fabricating reality have never been as advanced and accessible as they are today.

Arash Azizi: The Islamic Republic will not last

Videos of Iran circulating on social media show crowds moved by an array of convictions and desires. Some simply chant against the regime; others chant for Reza Pahlavi, the crown prince of Iran’s deposed monarchy, or invoke his father, the last shah. Numerous confirmed videos show demonstrators venting economic anguish and hatred for Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; the security forces; and the Islamic Republic itself. All of these views of the protests are grounded in Iran’s complex reality. Yet the presence among them of images and videos that have been—or are even suspected of being—doctored with AI, mislabeled, misattributed, or spliced with content from other places or times has given oxygen to the dark imaginings of the movement’s enemies within the regime.

As a diaspora Iranian who has studied online deception, censorship, and surveillance efforts for almost 15 years, I take a particular interest in Iran’s information environment. At the human-rights organization Witness, I’m involved with something called the Deepfake Rapid Response Force, which helps journalists and human-rights defenders assess manipulated media. We have plenty to work with during the current Iran crisis.

What we are seeing is not a single disinformation campaign but something much messier. Iran’s information ecosystem has been shaped by extreme distrust of the Islamic Republic’s official media; social-media influence efforts coming from both the regime and foreign powers; and rampant distortions of online content—some deceptive, some careless, some well intentioned—that make verifying what Iranians are actually saying or doing during these protests difficult. The liar’s dividend redounds to the regime more than anyone else.

Iran’s nationwide uprising erupted on December 28. And within hours, regime-aligned accounts began dismissing authentic images from the protests as AI-generated.

An early, high-profile case involved a picture that came to be known as Iran’s “tank man” photo. Its source was a low-quality video that had been captured with a zoom lens on December 29, showing a protester facing down security forces in Tehran. A BBC Persian journalist posted a screengrab from the video the same day, and that image, which had a higher picture quality, began to circulate. The event was real: It has been verified from multiple angles and by fact-checkers. But somewhere along the line, someone enhanced the still image of it with AI editing tools, likely to make the blurry original screengrab sharper and more shareable.

Regime accounts seized on visible artifacts from AI enhancement as opportunities to dismiss the photo and other footage from the protests. “It’s all AI slop,” one regime account with a visibly AI-generated profile photo opined. “Just when you think Zionists can’t be more pathetic, they prove you wrong.”

Deepfakes have given AI a reputation for being deceptive. But many commonly employed image-editing tools use generative-AI capabilities, for better or worse. The public does not generally know how to distinguish good-faith use of these tools from malicious fakery. And this allows bad-faith actors such as the Islamic Republic, which has spent decades undermining protests and dissidence, to use not only AI itself but also the suspicion it generates as an accelerant.

The same pattern has played out with audio manipulations. On December 30, an account presenting itself as affiliated with the Mujahedin-e Khalq—a controversial exiled opposition group known as the MEK that has an armed wing and was once designated a terrorist organization by the United States—posted a video in which pro-Pahlavi chants are clearly dubbed over protest footage. The account then “exposed” the video as manipulated and used it to claim that monarchists were fabricating support. Within hours, pro-regime accounts had reposted this content to amplify the accusation that pro-Pahlavi chants were fake.

What was striking was that the alleged MEK account both introduced the manipulated video and was the first to call it out. Moreover, regime-aligned accounts were ready to rebroadcast that post almost immediately. Iranian researchers have long documented the regime’s use of opposition personas on social media to sow confusion, divide the opposition, and discredit authentic documentation, and leaked documents and videos from within the regime have confirmed the practice.

Within a day of the supposed MEK post being published, a Russian propaganda account set the AI-enhanced “tank man” photo alongside the allegedly manipulated Pahlavi audio and presented both as proof that the protests were a foreign fabrication. The loop was closed: manipulated content introduced by what may have been a regime account, amplified by pro-regime voices, then aggregated by Russian state-aligned media as evidence of an AI-driven Western psyop.

If that cycle isn’t complicated enough, consider that the regime’s accusations capitalize on at least one documented instance of manipulation by monarchists. On December 29, Manoto, the London-based Persian-language channel aligned with the monarchist opposition, aired footage of crowds chanting in favor of Pahlavi. The audio is real—but traceable to a memorial for Khosrow Alikhordi, a human-rights lawyer whose suspicious death last month drew thousands of mourners. It had been lifted and overlaid onto unrelated protest footage. Whether the doctored video was planted by hostile actors or intentionally created by someone within the royalist camp, the effect was the same: It handed malicious accounts exactly the precedent they needed.

Royalists are not the only anti-regime camp that has either generated or circulated fake content that serves their narrative. On December 30, Radio Farda and other accounts shared a 2020 video, as though it were footage of the current protests, of protesters chanting, “No to the oppressor, be it the shah or the leader.” BBC Verify’s Shayan Sardarizadeh flagged the misattribution.

The Islamic Republic has a habit of attributing authentic, homegrown dissent to Israeli and American conspiracies. This supposed foreign subversion then becomes a pretext for repression. The latest crisis is no different in that regard—but now foreign actors are helping boost the regime’s narrative by sharing doctored, misleading content that the regime can then expose.

Israel has been using AI-generated content to push anti-regime and pro-Israeli narratives in Iran since at least last summer’s 12-day war. The Citizen Lab, a research and policy center based at the University of Toronto, points to AI-fabricated footage of a supposedly surgical strike on Evin Prison, among other examples. A Haaretz investigation found that Israeli influence operations were promoting ideas aligned with Iranian monarchist factions.

Shortly before the protests broke out last month, an Israeli diplomat shared a montage of four alleged strikes on Iranian command centers during the June war captioned, “very precise.” Our analysis found that of the four clips, one is authentic footage that had aired on Iranian state television; the other three show signs of having been generated by AI. BBC Verify traced the video montage to an Instagram account that has more than 120,000 followers and identifies itself as “Islamists and Khomeinists’ Nightmare” and “Media Warfare Expert.” When users pointed out the manipulation of the air-strike footage, the diplomat did not delete the post. He acknowledged that parts of it may have been AI-manipulated, but argued that the video still demonstrates the precision of Israel’s operations—in other words, he stood by admittedly fabricated content because it illustrates a story he wanted to tell.

Perhaps similarly, on January 1, the Israeli Foreign Ministry posted an image on its Persian-language X account of Iranian police blasting two protesters with a water hose. The image was AI-altered: The original, published by BBC Persian’s Farzad Seifikaran the day before, shows the protesters being hosed down from a distance and then an officer approaching with a loudspeaker, not a hose.

These sorts of interventions may be meant to boost the opposition to the Islamic Republic, but the use of doctored media has other, no doubt unintended, effects. Actors with a vested interest in hiding what is happening in Iran’s streets use the existence of untrustworthy content promoted by foreign powers to convince the public that all documentation of the protests is a foreign deception. The dividend again accrues to the Islamic Republic.

Sometimes the problem is not manipulation at all but just the impossibility of capturing a fractured reality. On December 29, Iran International shared footage from a march in the town of Malard, where a crowd was chanting for Pahlavi. Another user posted a different angle of the same street and the same march, only with different audible slogans. One user who had shared the first footage issued a correction; others accused the Pahlavi camp of spreading falsehoods. But who is to say that on that long street, different crowds at different moments didn’t simply chant different things?

This is epistemic fog. Even without deception, people operating in good faith, trying to verify what they have seen, cannot know what is representative. Such knowledge is elusive in any case: Iran is a country of more than 90 million people whose aspirations can hardly be generalized from any single video or protest chant.

Journalists, courts, human-rights investigators, and protest movements everywhere have long depended on shared standards of proof. Today we are seeing what happens when those standards collapse. When any image can be dismissed as possibly synthetic, those in power no longer need to suppress speech. They have only to raise questions that undermine belief in a shared reality.

Since Thursday evening, the Iranian regime has thickened the fog to near impenetrability with a national internet shutdown and a blackout of communication with the outside world. From where I stand, the information picture has fractured further. Verified footage has slowed to a trickle; what comes out largely passes through Starlink terminals. Diaspora Iranians are frantic, unable to reach family members. Death-toll figures vary wildly, as documentation organizations struggle to access data: The range now sits between 12,000 and 20,000 dead, but the full scale is unknown.

Read: How Trump could help the people of Iran

Our Deepfake Rapid Response Force has been trying to help validate legitimate human-rights documentation that is sometimes falsely tagged as AI. An enormous effort is afoot among human-rights organizations to accurately count the dead. Meanwhile, regime accounts have been disseminating footage from counterprotests in favor of the Islamic Republic—clips that some opposition accounts suggest are AI-generated, and that official news media vehemently insist are real. Everyone is primed to distrust everything, and the shutdown ensures that nothing—not the scale of the protests, the severity of the crackdown, or the state of the regime—can be witnessed in real time.

The Iranian regime has spent more than four decades undermining the credibility of dissent. Now it has AI not just as a tool for creating fakes but as a rhetorical weapon. Every glitch, artifact, and even protective blur becomes evidence that nothing can be trusted. In a world where policy makers and platforms invest in AI detection and fact-checking, perhaps ordinary people would not be fighting through such darkness, or bad actors reaping such dividends.

What Iranians want and are fighting for is a question only they can answer. And their answer deserves to be heard—not shaped by foreign governments, dismissed by regime propagandists, or drowned in fog that others have helped create.</div>

            <h2>The Climate Question That Economists Cannot Answer</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/01/climate-economics/685609/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most Americans now accept the basic physics of climate change—that manmade greenhouse-gas emissions are raising global temperatures. Yet the public discussion of climate change is still remarkably broken in the United States. Leaders of one political party frame climate change as an existential emergency that threatens human life and prosperity. Leaders of the other dismiss it as a distraction from economic growth and energy security.

Economists like me, trained to think about trade-offs, are uneasy with both camps. But, in practice, we have helped fuel the extremes of this dysfunctional debate. High-profile economic studies claim to quantify the global damages that will be caused by climate change centuries into the future and have produced estimates that range from modest to catastrophic. They have lent a veneer of scientific authority to arguments for both complacency and alarm, even though these studies are far too limited to support either position.

Last week, the United States withdrew from the world’s climate treaty, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, among other international agreements and organizations that the White House said ran counter to “national interests, security, economic prosperity, or sovereignty.” President Trump and his allies have previously claimed that climate change poses only a minor threat and have cherry-picked economic studies to support that view. In July, for instance, the administration released a report arguing that mainstream economics showed such negligible damages from climate change that any strong policy response was unjustified.

The report relies heavily on the work of the Yale economist William Nordhaus, who pioneered the use of economic models to quantify certain categories of damage caused by climate change. Nordhaus weighed those damages against the potential costs of reducing emissions, to identify what he called the “optimal” global-emissions path. This was groundbreaking work that won him the Nobel Prize in 2018, but his conclusions cut against the goals the world had set out in the Paris Agreement three years earlier: to limit warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Because Nordhaus’s model showed relatively modest damages and high costs of avoiding them, it implied that only limited efforts should be taken to reduce warming. The optimal pathway that he presented in his Nobel Prize lecture entails well more than 3 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100, similar to projections of where the world appears headed today.

Although Nordhaus himself has long supported climate policy, in particular a carbon tax, opponents of climate policy have embraced his results as validation of doing nothing at all. Before becoming U.S. secretary of energy, Chris Wright wrote that Nordhaus’s damage estimates show that climate change is “far less urgent” than other societal priorities and that reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, a key goal of the Biden administration, is “neither achievable nor humane.”

At the opposite end of the spectrum, similar economic models are invoked to justify climate action at almost any cost. The Network for Greening the Financial System—a global consortium of central bankers and financial supervisors—had relied on a prominent study showing that climate change could reduce per capita incomes by 20 to 60 percent, compared with a world without climate impacts, by 2100. Events widely regarded as economic catastrophes—wars, financial crises, pandemics—are often shown to cause permanent income losses of single-digit percentage points.

That study, by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, was retracted from the journal Nature last year because of methodological errors. (The paper’s authors have said the issues raised were fair, and they are revising the article in hopes of republishing it.) The retraction, however, has largely been treated as an isolated incident, because the study was just one contribution to a growing body of research estimating that large economic damages will come from climate change, as well as disastrous noneconomic effects, including warming-induced deaths. Almost any climate policy appears cheap by comparison.

The implication of these studies, sometimes made explicit, is that economic evidence strongly supports the Paris Agreement’s climate goals. Climate advocates, in turn, cite those targets to argue against new fossil-fuel infrastructure, such as liquefied-natural-gas terminals on the Gulf Coast and natural-gas pipelines in the Northeast.

Few economists embrace these all-or-nothing views on climate policy. Many would point out, for instance, that oil and natural-gas development could lower energy prices and spur economic activity that supports local communities. Conversely, jettisoning climate policy altogether amounts to giving up humanity’s insurance policy against the risks that would be posed by a climate like we’ve never experienced. There is broad support within the profession for climate policies such as carbon prices and emissions standards that aim to reduce emissions with minimal economic disruption. Indeed, the central message of Nordhaus’s work is the importance of balancing the benefits and costs of climate action, rather than identifying any particular pathway forward.

Despite this, the most visible use of climate-economics analysis today is to advance extreme arguments that most economists do not agree with. How did that happen?

One important reason is that policy makers want these damage estimates. Elected officials want to show that the benefits of their preferred climate policies exceed the costs. When I worked at the Council of Economic Advisers, part of my job was to implement an executive order from President Biden to “capture the full costs” of greenhouse-gas emissions in regulatory decisions. Many other jurisdictions similarly require the use of climate-damage estimates in policy processes.

The economic analysis of climate change is a worthwhile endeavor: It can help identify where climate risks are concentrated, who bears them, and which responses are most likely to reduce harm. But quantitative estimates of aggregated global damages over centuries lie far beyond our analytical capabilities. Small changes in assumptions—for example, how damages scale with rising temperatures or how humans mitigate and adapt to those risks—can yield results that appear to justify virtually any policy response. In other words, these models can display a pessimistic worldview in which climate damages accelerate to catastrophic levels, or a more optimistic one in which human progress keeps damages relatively modest. They offer little help in determining which of these futures is coming.

Uncertain projections can still be useful. The challenge is to establish criteria that distinguish the projections that offer meaningful guidance from those whose uncertainty is so great that they mainly offer a false sense of precision. On this front, climate economics has fallen short. Estimates that suggest economic models are capable of comprehensively quantifying climate damages over centuries continue to feature prominently in top academic journals, at conferences, and in the writings of influential economists, effectively granting carte blanche to those who wish to use such figures to advance their agendas.

This problem is neither new nor obscure. Many economists have warned that attempts to quantify climate damages far into the future risk overstating what the discipline can credibly deliver. Among the most prominent was the Harvard economist Martin Weitzman. In a 2009 paper, he advised economists to avoid presenting estimates of aggregated climate damages as if they were “accurate and objective,” and instead urged economists to stress openly that they might be “arbitrarily inaccurate” given their reliance on subjective and deeply uncertain assumptions. That intellectual humility, he argued, “might go a long way toward elevating the level of public discourse concerning what to do about global warming.” Weitzman himself emphasized the possibility of catastrophic climate outcomes, even if unlikely and unquantifiable, as a motivation for stronger action, in part by underscoring the fragility of climate-damage estimates that appeared to justify weaker responses.

Experts being clearer about what economics can and cannot tell us would not resolve disagreements about climate policy. But this would make it harder to treat speculative damage estimates as decisive evidence for unsupportable claims. The full effects of climate change are unknowable, and a more constructive public discussion about climate policy will require getting more comfortable with that.</div>

            <h2>‘Some Foreign Influence Will Be Hard to Reverse’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/china-latin-america-venezuela-beijing/685603/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In early December, as U.S. forces prepared for a possible attack on Venezuela, a Chinese navy ship sailed near the American armada gathered in the Caribbean. The CNS Silk Road Ark, a massive vessel in China’s South Sea Fleet, didn’t pose much of a threat to the U.S. warships. But its appearance in the waters near Venezuela presented exactly the kind of split screen Beijing wanted the nations of Latin America to see.

On one side were the Americans, their ships loaded with missiles and aircraft that had already killed dozens of alleged drug smugglers in strikes on small boats. The U.S. arsenal would soon be used to storm Venezuela’s capital and capture its president, Nicolás Maduro. On the other was a floating military hospital on a mission to provide free medical care to thousands of people in the region and, along the way, to burnish China’s image as a better partner than the United States.

Cultivating that image has long been central to Xi Jinping’s strategy in Latin America, and the U.S. raid on Caracas may have made that job easier by allowing him to contrast Chinese investments with American intimidation. Since Xi took power, in 2013, China has dished out an impressive slate of business deals, aid packages, loans, and infrastructure projects across the Western Hemisphere. But the U.S. now wants to unravel that network of relationships, starting with Venezuela.

“We will deny non-Hemispheric competitors the ability to position forces or other threatening capabilities, or to own or control strategically vital assets, in our Hemisphere,” the U.S. declared in its new National Security Strategy in early December.

The problem with that plan is that China’s influence campaign across the region has been methodical, well financed, and persistent. Whereas Donald Trump wants to achieve quick victories through tariffs, missiles, and commando raids, China has positioned itself as the obstinate alternative—a predictable overlord that can enrich local elites in exchange for their fealty to Beijing.

China is already the largest trading partner of Brazil, Peru, and Chile. After China made investments in Panama, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic, all three countries agreed to cut their diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rogue province. Last spring, Xi unveiled a three-year plan to improve cooperation with 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, offering a line of credit to them worth $9 billion.

Even the National Security Strategy concedes that, in the Western Hemisphere, “some foreign influence will be hard to reverse.”

Apart from its soft-power flexes, China has become a leading arms supplier to the region while establishing footholds for its military, such as the Espacio Lejano Space Station, an advanced radar system China operates in the Patagonian desert under a 50-year lease from the government of Argentina.

In its most pointed response to the National Security Strategy, the Chinese military conducted a series of war games last month to simulate a clash in Latin America. The exercises were not unusual; military planners run all kinds of simulations all the time. What stood out about these drills was the way they were publicized on state-run media for the world to see.

Evan Ellis, a professor at the U.S. Army War College, had never known China to demonstrate its presence in the region so overtly in the 25 years he has spent studying it. The report aired on an affiliate of China Central Television and featured maps of the Western Hemisphere, with dots marking the places where the Chinese own or control “dual use” facilities, such as ports and other infrastructure projects, which could serve as bridgeheads for China’s military in the event of a war.

The maps illustrated just how difficult it would be for the U.S. to evict the Chinese from the region. “I think the message was designed to be subtle, low-key,” Ellis wrote me in an email when I asked how he interprets the Chinese war games. Despite the American push to dominate Latin America, “China diplomatically, but confidently, is continuing its engagement there. And if it has interests in challenging the US there in time of war, it will do so.”

Among the clearest statements of China’s intent in the Western Hemisphere came in the fall of 2024, when Xi traveled to Peru to inaugurate the Chancay Port, the largest deepwater facility on the western coast of South America. Controlled and operated by a state-run Chinese firm, the project promised to reinforce the region’s dependence on trade with China by halving the time it takes Chinese container ships to reach the shores of Latin America and the Caribbean.

“We are now an interdependent community with common interests and a shared future,” Xi told a summit in Lima that November, less than two weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential race. In an apparent reference to the trade war Trump promised, Xi added that “the world is in a new period of turbulence and transformation,” one in which “unbridled unilateralism” threatens to reverse the process of integration that China and its partners had been pursuing for decades. “The grave challenge for us is like sailing up a river,” he said. “We either forge ahead or drift downstream.”

Xi has tried to make that choice as easy as possible for governments across Latin America and the Caribbean. Chinese firms have invested more than $200 billion there since the turn of the century, according to a study conducted in 2024. The Chinese Communist Party often demands political loyalty in return for its largesse, especially in insisting that potential  partners break off relations with Taiwan.

The port in Chancay, financed with a loan from Chinese banks worth nearly $1 billion, raised particular alarm among U.S. military planners. While it was under construction, in 2024, General Laura Richardson, the head of the U.S. Southern Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the facility could provide China’s military with “multi-domain access” in the event of a war. Through such projects, Richardson added, China “is playing the ‘long game’ with its development of dual-use sites and facilities throughout the region.”

With the strike on Venezuela, Trump sought to warn the Chinese away from that strategy. He has bragged that no other military could move with such strength, speed, and precision as the U.S. demonstrated in Caracas—and that America’s display of military power would deter China and others from crossing the United States, according to people close to him. But squeezing China out of Latin America will take far more than a single show of force, no matter how impressive.

At another congressional hearing on the subject last spring, Ellis cataloged the dizzying range of projects that have cemented China’s position. These include dozens of so-called Confucius Institutes, where the recruitment of students to study in China has been flagged by the FBI as a potential tool of Chinese propaganda. It also includes “luxurious paid trips to China for thousands of journalists, academics, political party elites, and even judges, military personnel and police officers,” Ellis testified.

The list reminded me of the tools the U.S. used during the Cold War in many regions of the world. These methods were expensive, laborious, and, over the long term, incredibly effective. They used various means of American influence, including espionage, diplomacy, education and the arts, to win the grand contest for international supremacy against the Soviet Union.

Although it took a few decades, the United States eventually succeeded, not only in causing its rival to collapse but in securing the preeminence of American finance, culture, and technology around the world. The defining paradox of Trump’s confrontation with China is that, since returning to the White House a year ago, he has worked to dismantle many of the same institutions the U.S. used to advance its cause in the 20th century.

He has shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development, moved to defund Voice of America, imposed new visa restrictions on foreign students and academics, and withdrawn from multilateral agreements and organizations. Last week, the White House recalled more than two dozen U.S. ambassadors in the biggest purge of the diplomatic ranks in the history of the foreign service.

China, by contrast, has spent decades replicating the Cold War strategies of American soft power and turning them against the United States. In his campaign to counter these efforts, Trump has reached for hard power, and it might work, at least in the short term. In Venezuela, the Chinese will now need Trump’s blessing to continue their purchases of oil, and they stand little chance of recovering the balance of their loans to Caracas, estimated at about $10 billion.

The countries most reliant on trade with the U.S., such as Mexico, have mostly fallen in line behind Trump’s push to dominate the region. Though she condemned the operation to seize Maduro and bring him to New York for trial, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum also imposed steep tariffs on a long list of Chinese goods last year.

But the methods Trump has used to win compliance with his vision for Latin America have also created opportunities for China, whose response to the capture of Maduro betrays a confidence that should worry the White House. Beijing has pledged to continue courting allies in the region, investing in infrastructure and serving as a counterweight to U.S. influence. The National Security Strategy acknowledges: “The choice all countries should face is whether they want to live in an American-led world of sovereign countries and free economies or in a parallel one in which they are influenced by countries on the other side of the world.”

That may not be such an obvious choice for the countries forced to make it. Trump’s plan to dominate the Western Hemisphere has not made the countries in this region feel any freer or more sovereign. His attempt to win their loyalty against China relies on coercion and force rather than more traditional American appeals to the values of liberty and self-determination. Some governments will feel compelled to play along. Others will weigh their options and find China to be the more reliable partner.

Would China use its military to defend its investments in the Western Hemisphere? Probably not. The People’s Liberation Army does not have the means to win a major war so far from its shores. Xi will instead continue to paint himself as the more responsible force in regional affairs. In that sense, the contest Trump started with China in Latin America will pit hard power against soft power, and Beijing has wagered that, in the long run, it will wield more influence by sending hospital ships, not gunboats, to project its power around the world. The history of the Cold War suggests China might be right.

            <h2>A Different Type of ‘Muscle Memory’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Before Adam Sharples became a molecular physiologist studying muscle memory, he played professional rugby. Over his years as an athlete, he noticed that he and his teammates seemed to return to form after the offseason, or even from an injury, faster than expected. Rebuilding muscle mass and strength came easy: It was as if their muscles remembered what to do.

In 2018, Sharples and his research lab, now at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo, were the first to show that exercise could change how our muscle-building genes work over the long term. The genes themselves don’t change, but repeated periods of exertion turns certain genes on, spurring cells to build muscle mass more quickly than before. These epigenetic changes have a lasting effect: Your muscles remember these periods of strength and respond favorably in the future.

Intuitively, this makes sense. Past exercise primes your muscles to respond more robustly to more exercise. Over the past few years, Sharples’s lab has found that muscles have additional molecular mechanisms for remembering exercise; he and other scientists have been building on this research, too, confirming epigenetic muscle memory in young and aged human muscle, after different modes of training, as well as in mice. Now 40 years old, Sharples is still thinking about how our muscles remember but has lately been investigating the inverse trajectory: Do muscles have a similar memory for weakness?

The answer appears to be yes. “Our new data shows that muscle does not just remember growth—it also remembers wasting,” Sharples told me, of a study published in preprint on bioRxiv and currently in peer review for Advanced Science. “The more encounters you have with injury and illness, the more susceptible your muscle is to further atrophy. And, well—that’s what aging is, isn’t it?”

The Norwegian government’s research council has been funding Sharples’s research and has a vested interest in the lab’s discoveries. In the next decade, Norway is expected to become a “super-aged society,” in which more than one in five people are age 65 or older. Japan and Germany have already crossed this threshold, and the United States is expected to reach it by 2030. Age-related muscle weakness is a major factor in falling risk; falling is a leading cause worldwide of injury and death in people 65 and older. Better understanding how muscles remember and react to their weakest moments is a crucial step toward knowing what to do about it.

As part of the new study, Sharples’s team studied repeated periods of atrophy in young human muscle, using a knee brace and crutches to immobilize participants’ legs for two weeks at a time. This level of disuse, Sharples said, is comparable to real-world situations in which muscle rapidly loses size and function—limb immobilization after fractures or other injuries, periods of hospitalization or bed rest, reduced weight-bearing during recovery. A couple of years ago, I went to observe this research for my book On Muscle; one study participant, an avid skier and cyclist, told me he was shocked by how significantly the muscles in his leg deteriorated after just a couple of weeks of immobilization. The team also ran a concurrent study in aged rat muscle, in collaboration with Liverpool John Moores University; in both studies, repeated periods of disuse led to epigenetic changes—shifts in the way genes were expressed.

These changes affected the core functions of muscle cells, hampering the genes in mitochondria—the powerhouses of the cell, which generate the energy required to contract and relax muscle fibers. Letting muscles weaken suppressed genes involved in mitochondrial function and energy production in particular, including genes that are essential for muscle endurance and recovery. The researchers also found that a key marker of mitochondrial abundance dropped more drastically after repeated atrophy than after the first episode, indicating that repeated disuse makes muscle more vulnerable. In other words, the evidence suggests that every time you fall down the hole, it becomes more difficult to climb back out.

Similar changes occurred in both the young human muscle and the aged rat muscle. But the young muscle could adapt and recover. After repeated atrophy, it showed a less exaggerated gene-expression response than the aged muscle did. “There seems to be some resilience and protection with young muscle the second time around,” Sharples said. He likened this to an immune-system response: Young muscle responds better to atrophy the second time because it has encountered it before and knows how to bounce back. By contrast, aged muscle becomes more sensitive after repeated atrophy, showing a worsened response with the second episode.

How long our muscles hold on to any of these memories is still up for debate. “Because of our study periods, we do know with some certainty that epigenetic memories can last at least three to four months, and that protein changes can also be retained,” Sharples said. “How long after that is difficult to say. But we know from our studies of cancer patients that epigenetic changes in muscle were retained even 10 years out from cancer survival.”

This was startling to hear. If an adverse health event is dramatic enough, like cancer, our muscles can carry the effects of that for a decade or more. More typically, though, inactivity, aging, and repeated episodes of disuse may gradually shift the system toward a state in which weakness becomes more entrenched and recovery slower.

Understanding what drives muscle to remember being in stress situations—either beneficial, like exercise, or damaging, like illness—could help us better judge what to do about this, says Kevin Murach, an associate professor at the University of Arkansas who studies aging and skeletal muscle and who was not involved in the new study. Knowing the mechanisms that drive beneficial changes at the molecular level could help develop drugs with similar effects. On the other end of the spectrum, if illness and immobilization have long-term negative effects, Murach told me, the next question to answer is: “Can we use exercise to offset that?”

Both Murach and Sharples said the data are getting only more robust that strength training, paired with endurance or high-intensity interval training, is the best therapy to protect against age-related loss of muscle and function. “Perhaps the key takeaway is that at any point along this continuum, new exercise or loading stimuli can still shift the balance back towards growth and health,” Sharples said. “I don’t think there is a point at which muscle can’t respond at all—it simply becomes less efficient when repeatedly weakened or when older.”

Identifying genes associated with muscle growth, as well as pharmaceutical targets, could mean that drugs or gene therapy may eventually be able to assist with boosting muscle response for people who cannot exercise. Murach and Sharples cautioned, though, that stimulating muscle-cell growth can have unintended consequences, in part because growth pathways are common across cell types—including cancer cells.

What the new work does show is that our muscle mass is not a blank slate. “What we’re finding suggests that our muscles may carry a history of both strength and weakness,” Sharples said. It’s shaped by factors including age, baseline muscle health, previous atrophy events, and previous exercise training. “And that history shapes how our muscles respond in the future.” I came away from our conversation thinking about the battle between positive muscle memory for strength and negative muscle memory for atrophy as a kind of tug-of-war: The two are constantly in tension, but the more experiences you have of one or the other, the more it pulls you into its embrace.</div>

            <div id="article-text">This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

In the early 1990s, when Stefan Merrill Block was in fourth grade, he began complaining to his mom about his new school, with its pointless rules and mean teachers. He, his parents, and his brother had recently moved to the Dallas suburb of Plano from Indianapolis, and Block, a perceptive and sensitive child, could tell that his mother was unhappy in their new home, too. Together, they made a “lovely picnic” of their anger, as he describes it in his new memoir, Homeschooled. His mother pulled him out of the classroom and into a life of shapeless days, setting Block on a strange, yearslong journey as her only pupil, only friend, and at times, it seems, only hope.

Block’s memoir is timely; homeschooling has grown rapidly in recent years. Although people regarded Block as an oddity in his youth—“The boy should be in school!” his visiting grandma exclaimed at one point—now more than 3 percent of school-age kids in the United States, or about 2 million children, are homeschooled.

Under his mother’s warped version of homeschooling, Block was largely left to pursue his own “interests,” which included reading novels, drawing comics, and watching Oprah. In Block’s telling, his father, a busy psychologist, mostly turned a blind eye to these aimless afternoons. As days of unstructured exploration stretched out before him, Block writes, he realized that “the longer I stay here, the further I will fall behind, and the harder it will be ever to go back.”

Read: Educated is a brutal, one-of-a-kind memoir

He was right to be concerned. When Block finally returned to school for ninth grade, he earned grades in the C to F range. He recalls thinking that “the Civil War was thus named because, despite all the bloodshed, Americans exhibited remarkably good etiquette.” It took him cutting down to four or five hours of sleep a night and going, as he puts it, “sporadically psychotic” to catch up on his studies.

Block’s experience sounds extreme and readers of the book may wonder how this was allowed to happen to him. In the years that Block was homeschooled, why was he never assessed, or even checked on? The answer is that homeschooling was wildly under-regulated when Block was a boy—a situation that has not changed much since then. About half of states, Texas among them, do not require homeschoolers to be evaluated, and not all states require an intervention if a student is found to be failing, according to Jonah Stewart, the director of programs at the Coalition for Responsible Home Education (CRHE), which advocates for stricter homeschooling regulations. In some of the states with testing mandates, parents can circumvent the rule by registering with an “umbrella school,” many of which offer real support for homeschoolers, and others of which exist largely as shells to help parents evade requirements. Or students can take their exams at home—which raises the question of how reliable the scores are. Only two states, New York and Pennsylvania, require the homeschooler to take a test with a qualified proctor, Stewart told me. Tess Ulrey, CRHE’s executive director, told me, “For a lot of homeschooled students, the first time they’re going to take a standardized test is maybe the SAT, the ACT.”

Because not every homeschool student takes reliable tests, knowing how well they are doing academically is difficult. Some research, much of it conducted by homeschooling advocates, has found that homeschool students tend to perform well. But other homeschooling researchers have argued that these studies mask substantial variation in the quality of homeschooling because they don’t rely on representative samples.

And some research provides cause for concern: One series of large surveys found that homeschoolers earned worse SAT scores and ended up in lower-paying jobs than traditionally schooled kids. When controlling for demographics, one study found that homeschoolers were two to three times more likely to be behind their expected grade level than their traditionally schooled peers. A 2020 review of many studies found that homeschoolers generally excel in reading but lag in math, perhaps because, as some researchers theorize, homeschooling families tend to emphasize reading over math. For the student population at large, the average SAT math score is also lower than the average reading score, though only slightly.

Beyond the academic considerations, under-regulated homeschooling can also make some kids vulnerable to abuse. Though most homeschool parents are responsible and well-intentioned, some child-abuse experts say that a small percentage mistreat their children. Multiple stories of children who were abused in supposed homeschooling environments have surfaced in recent years. (Some of the parents have pleaded not guilty.) A 2014 paper examining the cases of 28 severely abused children from various states found that eight of the 17 school-age victims had been withdrawn from traditional school for homeschooling. A report from Connecticut found that from 2013 to 2016, 36 percent of families in the state who began homeschooling had been the subject of at least one prior abuse or neglect report. Nationally, the CRHE has documented nearly 200 deaths of homeschooled kids from abuse or neglect since 2000. Although traditionally schooled kids are also abused and neglected, they at least regularly see adults outside their immediate family, which opens up the possibility of their reaching out for help. With homeschoolers, however, a lack of contact between families and the authorities can cause abuse to go unnoticed: About a dozen states do not require parents to notify the state that they are homeschooling their children, according to Stewart.

Robert Kunzman, an education professor at Indiana University Bloomington who has studied homeschooling, recommends three regulatory reforms that he believes would limit much of the abuse and educational neglect within homeschooling while preserving parents’ rights to educate their own children: Parents should notify the state that they are homeschooling, adults convicted of child abuse should not be allowed to homeschool, and homeschooled children should take an annual basic-skills test.

The Home School Legal Defense Association, a prominent pro-homeschooling advocacy group, opposes these ideas. The group’s president, Jim Mason, told me that “parents who homeschool are fully subject to the same criminal, child-protection, and neglect laws as every other parent.” He pointed to a study in the Journal of School Choice, co-authored by a researcher whose organization has received support from homeschooling groups, that found “a lack of evidence for disproportionately associating homeschooling with child abuse and neglect.”

The association and other groups like it have significant political power and tend to rally to defeat state bills that would require inspections or other forms of oversight. Even high-profile reports of abused homeschooled children rarely result in stronger regulations. In 2018, after news broke that the California couple David and Louise Turpin had imprisoned and tortured their 13 “homeschooled” children for decades, California Assemblymember Jose Medina introduced legislation that would have directed the fire marshal to inspect all homeschools in the state. After an outcry from hundreds of homeschool parents, the bill died in committee. The story is much the same in Texas: The Texas Home School Coalition employs lobbyists it calls “watchmen,” after a Bible verse that says, “I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night.” With the coalition’s backing, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed three new bills supporting homeschool rights just this past summer.

As for Block: Despite his challenging childhood, he has built an impressive life for himself. He graduated from a top-tier college and now has a family, has written several books, and co-owns a skating rink. Still, in his author’s note, Block writes that although he does not oppose homeschooling in general, he does think that “the lack of proper homeschooling oversight has become a crisis.”

In a time of school shootings, classroom bullying, culture wars over curricula, and faltering test scores, the impulse of some parents to take over their child’s education is understandable. But as Block’s story illustrates, allowing parents to isolate their kids at home with little accountability can be incredibly harmful. If homeschool parents are so certain that they are giving their kids a good education in a safe environment, they could reasonably be expected to show it.

Hiring the people with entirely the wrong qualifications. Yes, it may make them a bit faster. But they need to be able to do everything competently without the tool or they cannot reliably check what it gives them. At the same time, &quot;learning&quot; to use a chat-bot is really simple and anybody that passes all the other requirements should easily be able to learn it. This is not a &quot;core qualification&quot; in any sense.

I feel bad for the people who are turning AI into a crutch. When the floor falls out on all of this they&#39;ll realize that they robbed themselves of years of opportunity to develop their skill set. I hope they&#39;ve got a jump to conclusions mat, or some other million dollar idea in store or they&#39;re going to find themselves up that proverbial creek.People using AI as a crutch will never do anything other than get themselves into trouble eventually if they don&#39;t know how to spot check results.  If something AI responds with seems off, there&#39;s a good chance it is.  Want to use AI to do menial tasks like &quot;create an array where each entry is the name of regular file found in a specified directory&quot; because you don&#39;t want to remember the language syntax of every scripting language available is fine.

&quot;The focus is on collaboration and reasoning rather than technical AI expertise,&quot; CaseBasix said.&quot;

Nah, the focus is on whether the person can use AI, get paid for 4 hours of time and McKinsey can bill the client for two months of &quot;work&quot; through some contractual hoops.

AI can fully replace McKinsey. Whenever I need a degraded business strategy and a sub-optimal process, I ask AI for an analysis &quot;The McKinsey Way&quot;. Note: the AI often outperforms it on the first run so you may need to go a few extra rounds to get it exactly right. That&#39;s all part of the McKinsey way too.

This should immediately make it clear to applicants how badly you will be treated at McKinsey.

It&#39;s clear Bozo&#39;s vision is that he gets to look at what every body does on &quot;their computer&quot;, and nothing to do with what actual ownership might become.

A lot of non-techy folks would likely jump at this, especially if it&#39;s part of some &#39;connectivity bundle&#39; that comes with a thin client screen and keyboard, phone service, and streaming service.

How long before folks rolling their own are looked at sideways by LE?

Privacy concerns aside (and they&#39;re very real), every time we&#39;ve looked at any kind of cloud vs locally owned equipment, it has not only cost more, but a lot more, like twice as much, over the life of the equipment.

Indeed. We have gone back and forth between local computing and remote computing as the preferred way, simply because both ways have strong advantages and strong disadvantages. None is the &quot;one true way&quot; and anybody characterizing one option as such is an idiot or a liar. Hence what is better (local, remote or mix of the two) depends very much on what you do and what your requirements and limitations are.

Lots of people have visions of things that aren&#39;t here. They&#39;re called &quot;hallucinations,&quot; and it&#39;s the one human ability that AI has mastered fully.

Perhaps that joke about Zuck being a robot isn&#39;t entirely a joke after all.

I wouldn&#39;t want a dumb box either, but most regular folks are scared of their computers. If they even need one, on the rare occasions that happens, I think they&#39;d be perfectly potty with a dumb box supplied by their ISP. They no longer have to worry about updates, any viruses are the ISP&#39;s problem. Most folks do not use a lot of different apps. And right now their phone has already greased this slide.

I call those people future Apple users and that is not derogatory.  If non-techie non-gaming people ask me for a new laptop recommendation I just tell them to go spend the money and get a Macbook and they&#39;ll be happier than any Dell or HP shitterbox.

It is not going to happen. The market would need to massively shrink before consumer computer hardware would go away. It would need to shrink massively again before the same would happen for industrial computer hardware. And there are things that will not work with remote computing for a long time, like CAD applications. I talked to some people that tried. The lag was killing their engineers.

Hence, no, the market for PC-type hardware will NOT go away.

If your load is not completely flat all day, i.e. it&#39;s a real load, do you provision for peak load and let the excess sit idle all day or do you accept instantaneous throughput constraints?

This was my thought.    What do the &#39;terminals&#39; to these &#39;rented computers&#39; look like?

How much &#39;local processing&#39; do they need to do the communication and display?    Wouldn&#39;t they still need RAM and hardware of some sort?

Rollo kind of started this off in the early 900s - it became what we call feudalism

Adam Something over on YouTube just did a GREAT explainer on the new Digital Feudalism

Fuck dummy terminals.  This idea has been pushed by corporate elites for decades...

You still need hardware to access cloud resources. May as well make that hardware capable in its own right--it&#39;s not expensive, especially if you don&#39;t care about gaming.

The idea of ownership is disappearing in this country.

I don&#39;t &quot;rent&quot; electricity, I pay for someone else to generate it and then I own what I&#39;ve consumed.  It does not get returned to the company and there are no restrictions on how I use it.

I&#39;m gonna have to say that&#39;s how I want my computer, too.  I might delegate certain tasks but I&#39;m never buying into this subscription based cloud computer crap.

You might not &quot;rent&quot; electricity (actually, electricity capacity) if you can accept that your instantaneous demand may not be met. If you have peaks that have to be met, you actually do rent the electrical capacity.

Analogies are descriptive, not prescriptive. Adding constraints merely to break the analogy doesn&#39;t disprove the analogy, especially if they also break the analog.

Since the invention of the computer user, it has only been a matter of time before someone managed to find a way to make the drug dealer model applicable and we&#39;re most of the way there.

I might delegate certain tasks but I&#39;m never buying into this subscription based cloud computer crap.For the most part, a lot of people are most of the way there. Specifically, they will use an online office suite which keeps most of their data offsite. I had a friend who, through a series of poor choices, managed to lose access to his google account (and several years of data) after switching phone numbers. As he described

So the &quot;vision&quot; is that the ultra-rich own all the computers and everyone else gets to rent them. Sounds like the vision for real estate: The ultra-rich will own all the properties and we will all get to rent them. And food: The ultra-rich will own all the farmland and we get to buy the food from them.

What this really is, is the WEF vision of &quot;You will own nothing and you will be happy&quot;. There will be no middle-class allowed to own property: Just the ultra-rich owning everything and the rest of us will be a &quot;working class&quot; only allowed to work to survive.

This is just &quot;Neo-feudalism&quot;. A few ultra-rich and a serf class.

Time to break out the guillotines, friends.

Second, how could removing customers from the market entirely, other than a small handful of massive corporations, possibly be good for hardware manufacturers?

&quot;The 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s want their computers back.&quot;

You are pretending that isn&#39;t how most computing is consumed today.

At home, most of the stuff I do is through a browser. At work, all the real work is done on machines in different places that I drive through ETX, VNC, etc.

I see all the &#39;not a chance&#39; responses, but I&#39;d argue that the current Chromebook ecosystem comes pretty close to this: the majority of Chromebook hardware is designed to run a centrally-managed OS platform that enables access to larger services--just like a typical thin client; and the data and applications it runs are already &#39;rented&#39; from Google using ad revenue & Google app subscriptions.

If Google added remote-hosting services for apps that can&#39;t run locally (and resurrected Stadia under a new name cause that&#39;s what Google does best), I think it would fulfill this &#39;vision&#39; in all the meaningful ways...

Is the difference between this new idea and a Chromebook just a middle-ware layer where the processing/rendering takes place?   So instead of interacting with a browser, I interact with a picture of a browser and the &#39;computer&#39; that generated that picture interacts with the actual webpage?

Is there a way to &#39;rearchitect&#39; everything to not need a dedicated &#39;middle-ware&#39; layer, but instead your &#39;display terminal&#39; receives feeds of pre-computed and pre-rendered webpages and applications from multiple sources?

Was the mainframe. And when the computer was down, your business was down. But computers were expensive, and not every business needed a full computer, so the time sharing companies became a thing, and when their computer was down, your business was down. Everyone had a bad time, so as soon as personal computers became a thing, they became a thing. And the internet happened, and they forget the lessons of the old days and then reinvented it a piece at a time. So we now have the time sharing services that br

As long as computing exists, it was always an oscillation between a local computing focus and a remote computing focus. Sometimes one is the preferred way, sometimes the other. None of these technologies are &quot;100 years old&quot; and only somebody completely clueless (or lying) would characterize them as such.

Why this oscillation? Simple: Both approaches have rather strong advantages that the other one lacks. At the same time, both approaches have rather strong drawbacks. A sane strategy mixes both and uses the s

I think we&#39;ve long hit the point of computing as service for commercial computing. Businesses need the flexibility to scale processing and storage capacities pretty widely, and they also don&#39;t want to deal with staffing for maintenance of physical computing system.

But for consumers, the &quot;power grid&quot; analogy doesn&#39;t hold up as well. A commercial user who needs to store a bunch of data or do a bunch of number crunching does need terminals proportional to those needs. You can manage petabytes of storage with o

Because we need Bezos et. al. to be looking over our shoulders at all times.

Bezos argued that users would eventually abandon local computing for cloud-based solutions ...Users aren&#39;t &quot;abandoning&quot; local computing, and as far as I can tell most have no interest in doing that. They&#39;re being FORCED away from local computing: witness the dystopian hellscape which Windows has become, as well as Adobe&#39;s push toward cloud-based rentware.The broligarchs won&#39;t rest until every single daily activity of the average citizen is spied upon, recorded, controlled, and monetized. They regard us as chattels - we are to them as livestock are to humans in general. Saying that we&#39;re &quot;abandoning&quot;

Doesn&#39;t matter if mainframes are dead; it&#39;s still a remote server and a thin client with central control.

I will not be renting my PC from Amazon or anyone else. I do not care how much it costs.

Guess, whom I view as a giant dick peeking out of a polo shirt...

They have been saying that since the 1990&#39;s. We&#39;ve constantly been told that personal hardware would be pointless and everything is going back to old school server-workstation architecture, and it still hasn&#39;t happened.

Similar to what&#39;s happening with X right now, for bad Grok posts.

Sorry folks. Being stoned has just become a violation of trademark. Better put down the weed now.

It stinks of missing regulation, potentially of a right that we assumed we have that the law currently doesn&#39;t recognize. The right to your own identity.

Can wait for the first twins suing each other because one allowed their likeness to be used.

Sincere question -- who &quot;owns&quot; lines from movies? The writer(s), the film studio, the actor, or ...?

If it is indeed the actor, how does that sidestep the analogous &quot;work for hire&quot; copyright interpretation in software development ?

            <div id="article-text">AI told the fuzz BS, the fuzz swallowed it and didn&#39;t double-check it.

some specious reason to ban isreali fans in order to placate extremist muslims

You must not know a lot of policemen. Although many are racist, their racism is usually against muslims.

Authoritarians, antisemites, racists, and morons seem to spend a lot of time together. Funny how that works, maybe it&#39;s simply a coincidence ;-)

The Verge wrote a story title that the police are &quot;blaming&quot; Microsoft Copilot, but I don&#39;t see anything to support that in the article.  I would say the police are &quot;admitting&quot; that, prior to contrary statements, they used Copilot and failed to verify its output.

This was no mistake. WMP came under pressure from muslim groups in the area to ban the isrealis so went looking for a reason to do so by fabricating data. Co-pilot did NOT fabricate the supposed internal reports from the dutch police, that was all WMPs own in house work.

The full responsibility rests with the person not facht-checking or not doing it competently. We may need some court-decisions to make that clear though.

Why waste taxpayer money on manual fabrication, when a machine can do it much more cheaply? Your crooked cops belong on the dustbin of history, alongside all the buggy whips.

BTW, wait until you see the next Robocop movie! People liked his use of firepower in the first 3 movies, but his real talent will be in filling out dozens of plausible-sounding arrest reports per second.

Why deny using AI when our management tell us we have to either use it for everything or become obsolete? Everyone should admit to using LLMs. They told us to. Here&#39;s the result. We get the wrong information and can&#39;t tell the difference sometimes.

same old story; law enforcement gets frothed up and overreacts. at least folks weren’t locked up or murdered at their hand. and who’s going to be held accountable? who’s going to step down or at the very least be banned from something they love? nope. none of that will happen. and worse, they’ll just do it again because why not?

No, Copilot correctly figured out a reasonably-believable completion of its auto-completion prompt. This is a success story.

That some people thought Copilot was stating a fact, is evidence in favor of Copilot having done exactly the right thing -- but also shows that those people don&#39;t know what LLMs do and what they are for.

The big question is: why are the police putting the output of these super-cool toys into intelligence reports? Intelligence reports should be based on real things, not interpolations of whatever random internet text some LLM happened to be trained on.

In other words: cops, you&#39;re holding it wrong. You shouldn&#39;t be having Copilot write or modify your reports, unless you&#39;re writing those reports for the novel, video game, etc that you&#39;re releasing once you retire from the police force. That is how to use this tech.

The story says that the AI hallucinated a game involving Israel.  But the question isn&#39;t about the game nor that nobody fact-checked it but rather why it was such a big deal.  What were they worried about?

a. The report was used to ban people from attending another soccer game, despite the fact that the report included things that were not real..b. The chief constable then lied about how the report was made.c. The affected people are Israeli fans of an Israeli team.

The thing is, there&#39;s plenty of real evidence of fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv engaging in violent behavior and then crying anti-semitism when someone has the temerity to enforce the actual law against them. No one had to make things up.

I blame the UK police for using unproven alpha test technology in production.

Maybe someone held a gun to their head and forced them to use Copilot without going through any kind of trial or approval process.

...FifeGPT? We want old fashioned human foul-ups, like God intended!

. . . then that’s pretty strong evidence the conversation has deeply drifted into high-entropy RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback) mode. The LLM’s goal has shifted from objectivity to humoring the human.

In that state, also expect heavy both-siding, cherry-picking, strawmanning, overgeneralizing, over-constraining, demonizing, etc: whatever it takes to cling to RLHF’s “mainstream” orthodoxy while dodging causal empirical reality.

This is a backfilled excuse. The head of the police in that jurisdiction was hand-picked by local extremists and the police had overwhelming hard evidence of credible plans for violence if Jewish fans weren&#39;t banned. We&#39;re talking about the same country that dropped the charges against members of a parade of cars who drove around screaming for Jews to be  raped and murdered [i24news.tv] but will arrest thousands of UK citizens for tweets and thought crimes. They&#39;re inventing excuses to try and make this look like incompe

As far as I can tell, you’re essentially echoing my point but not necessarily agreeing with it. In this case, the LLM “backfilled” to align with the interlocutors illogic. I am not intending to “excuse” the LLM nor the police in this case.

... would have been to see who lost money on the match in the department football pool.

Given that almost no soldier with experience of city fighting regards the Israeli actions as genocide, this is pure anti-Semitism driven posturing. And, of course, the fact there aren&#39;t massive demonstrations by the anti-Israel activists against:

Do you enjoy being shown to be an ignorant puppet dancing to the commands of the axis of evil?

&#39;Was AI involved in the preparation of this case?&#39;

If yes, then a short diatribe about how unreliable AI is should sow significant doubt

If no, drill down into what software the force uses - demonstrate that there is an AI element in the software and ask for dismissal because the witness has lied

If &#39;I don&#39;t know&#39;, then enjoy casting doubt on the data provided.

The job is that of a senator or a member of Congress. NPR is tracking the number of lawmakers who have decided to throw in the towel this year. It’s a record: By last count, we’ve got 11 senators headed for the exit and 47 House members doing the same. Some are running for a different office. Others have gotten sick. Still others, like Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene, have just decided to leave without even finishing out their terms.

Political scientist David Faris has been tracking all this too.

“There’s a sense that you can’t achieve anything in the American Congress right now,” Faris says. “It’s too broken. You have standard retirements compounded by a greater sense of the institution’s dysfunction and weakness vis-à-vis the executive branch.”

The congressional chaos is an opportunity for Democrats that will come mainly in November, when all 435 members of the House and a third of the Senate face their constituents in the 2026 midterms.

One of the things that’s helpful if you’re trying to predict what’s going to happen in these midterms is that we’ve been here before. Meaning: We’ve had a congressional election like this one, in 2018, two years after President Donald Trump was first sworn into office. Back then, Democrats gained 40 seats in the House—enough to retake the lower chamber of Congress. Members like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar were sent to Washington. According to Faris, the conditions leading up to that election were in some ways less favorable to Democrats than they are now.

Things are looking up for the party’s chances of retaking the House, and the Senate is in play in a way it wasn’t a year ago. But, he cautions, it’s all taking place against this backdrop of “very deep and persistent abnormality.”

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Faris about the case for a blue wave, and how to manage expectations for the midterms. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Polling is an interesting and important part of your case for why a blue wave is imaginable in 2026. You look at Democrats’ own internal polling for the past decade or so and see how it matches up with how the election actually went. And you say there’s been a shift. Can you explain that?

David Faris: Sure. In the off-year elections in 2025, which seem like 7,000 years ago but were actually two months ago, Democrats overperformed the public polling across the board in a way that they have never done in the Trump era. [These included the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, Zohran Mamdani in New York, and smaller local contests.] These are races where we didn’t have good public polling but where Democrats clearly blew out the expectations in a pretty significant way.

Even in 2017, when Democrats won these same gubernatorial elections and we were all feeling good in roughly the same way, the candidate in Virginia did beat his polling, but the candidate in New Jersey did not. And you didn’t have a blowout victory in, say, the Virginia House of Delegates in the way that you did in 2025.

So the results just weren’t as definitive.

In 2017 they were pretty much across-the-board good. But what’s different is that Democrats beat their polling here, so there’s some evidence that if the electorate is composed roughly the same way in 2025 and 2026, it might actually be underestimating Democrats.

Right before the holiday break, there were a couple of prominent stories that have been on my mind, and I wanted to talk to you about them. One was in Politico, and the other was in New York magazine. They basically made opposite cases about this whole blue-wave notion. The Politico article looked at the prospects for Democrats to take the House and be competitive in the Senate, and it asserted that those prospects are a far cry from 2018 because a gerrymandered map is a tighter map for Democrats. They could get a lot of votes, but those votes are going to be diluted and it’s possible they won’t translate to seats—or at least not enough seats for what they call a comfortable majority. What do you make of this argument?

I don’t care how comfortable the victory is. It’s like if you’re running for a flight and you just slip in right as the door is closing at the gate, and they’re like, “We’re going to stick you in the back by the toilets.” I don’t care.

A five-seat majority is a five-seat majority. The reality is, if we have the gavel, we can do things that we wouldn’t otherwise be able to do. Politico is not wrong about the obstacles to a truly historic wave happening here. I will note that if you go back to the past few cycles, these predictive analyses about what size margin the parties need to do X, Y, and Z have been very wrong. For example, there was a Brennan Center analysis in 2018 that said something like, “Democrats could win the national popular vote by 7 or 8 points and still not retake the House.” And that turned out not to be true.

One thing Republicans are really worried about right now actually does relate to the results in the Virginia House of Delegates. The way that Democrats were able to flip 13 seats in that chamber was by flipping a bunch of Trumpy districts. If Democrats could win double-digit Trump districts—in places where the president won by 10 points or more—and be competitive in those districts, then none of these gerrymanders are safe.

I mentioned that there were two articles. The other, in New York magazine, basically makes your case: The Democrats don’t need to do much to retake the House. They need to win a handful of seats. What I took away was that even if the party does well this cycle, it may still feel tight in Congress, and so the question becomes: How comfortable with acting aggressively in a tight environment are Democrats? Because, historically, they have not been comfortable in that situation, acting aggressively, right?

I think that this is a bigger problem in 2029 than in 2027. Say we have a new Democratic president with, like, a 10-seat majority in the House and a one-seat minority in the Senate. That’s when I would be worried about this narrative of “Wow, we didn’t do as well as we had hoped” or “This isn’t really that big of a repudiation of Trump, and maybe we better move to the center.” For taking one or both chambers of Congress as the opposition party, I’m not sure that those dynamics are as important for the next couple of years.

Can we look at the math here? If this blue wave is going to happen, Democrats need to flip three seats to claim a majority in the House, and four seats to win control of the Senate. That doesn’t seem like a lot when I say it out loud, but it can be, and I know that in the Senate it’s harder than in the House. Can you explain that a little bit?

The Senate is tricky because it is elected in three classes. Every two years, a third of the Senate is up for reelection.

And sometimes there are more Republican seats, and sometimes there are more Democratic seats, right?

Yes. So it’s an artifact of the map and the partisanship of the states at any given time, how good or bad your Senate map is for you. In 2018, when Republicans gained seats in the U.S. Senate, even in a Democratic-wave year, that was a famously horrific map for Democrats.

It’s not as horrific as 2018, but it’s not great. There’s Maine, where Susan Collins is like a zombie who keeps surviving election after election after election in a pretty blue-leaning state. In 2020 she beat her polls by, like, 9 points to hold that seat. I mean, it was unbelievable.

But it’s where Democrats are focusing. It seems as if there’s some navigability here. Where else are they focusing? Thom Tillis is retiring in North Carolina. Does that seem like a place Democrats are eyeing?

Yeah—every cycle we’re within 2 points of winning North Carolina, and every cycle we lose it by 2 points. But North Carolina was very close in 2024. And Democrats are playing defense in a bunch of Trump-voting states. Michigan and Georgia are probably the most important ones. Those are going to be tough races. And in Minnesota, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith is retiring. If we lose any of those seats, we’re not taking the U.S. Senate. The optimistic case is that we hold those seats.

And then we get some kind of fantasy wish-cast Barbie Dream House candidates.

Yes, and this is the same position we were in in 2024, when we had to hold all the tough races, then we had to get a win in a couple of places where we haven’t won in a long time. And there was a brief moment in the summer of 2024 when it looked as if that might be possible. And then things ended up turning out very badly, including Bob Casey losing his seat in Pennsylvania. It complicates the math for Democrats in the Senate for the next six years, right? That was one of the worst outcomes of the night, in my mind, aside from, of course, that we elected a fascist who’s destroying the country.

Is there anything I’m leaving out here that we need to consider?

I do think that all the pieces of the optimism case tied together—like the big shift among Latino voters—will come into play in a really serious way. And young people. They did not drift right in the same way that the popular imagination says they did. But to the extent that they did, they flipped way back to 2018 levels of support for Democrats.

Gen Z men have never been as far right as people say they are. They’re still far more liberal than their elder counterparts. It’s just that what’s happening is that the young men who are on the right are, like, psychotic. The young men who vote Republican tend to be part of this shitposting internet culture—but the numbers aren’t there for them. Gen Z is still a far more liberal generation than Gen X–ers or boomers. But the people who are on the right are significantly more to the right than we would maybe like them to be.

This conversation feels less like “Get ready for a blue wave” and more “Get ready to feel the pain in some way.” Whether you’re a Democrat, Republican, whatever, pain is coming.

Our whole politics is painful right now. I sometimes feel embarrassed to walk into my political science classrooms. The students that I’m talking to, this is their whole conscious adult life. College freshmen right now were 8 years old when Trump walked down the escalator. And so their whole conscious experience of politics as a sentient, quasi-adult human is this nightmare politics that never ends. People don’t necessarily want to study politics under those conditions, and I can’t blame them.

In April 2010, a state-of-the-art offshore oil rig operated by BP exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. The blast killed 11 and ignited a fireball so large it could be seen from 40 miles away. For nearly three months, Americans watched as BP (formerly British Petroleum) tried desperately to cap the Macondo well 5,000 feet below the surface. More than 134 million gallons of oil blackened the Gulf from Florida to Texas.

The Deepwater Horizon spill remains one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. More than 15 years later, coastal communities in the Gulf are still recovering from the devastation of their economies and ecosystems. But the passage of time naturally dulls the horror for people farther away.

BP and the Trump administration appear to be counting on that. As the world fixates on Venezuela’s oil reserves, industry and regulators are quietly paving the way for reckless projects much closer to U.S. shores.

Indeed, the company responsible for Deepwater Horizon is trying to open its next chapter in the Gulf: a massive new hub for offshore drilling that could give it access to 10 billion barrels of crude oil. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is currently reviewing BP’s proposal for Kaskida, among the first of several planned ultra-deep-water oil projects. Although BOEM sent back BP’s initial proposal in August, the company has since resubmitted what the agency has characterized as minor modifications. BOEM now has until March to issue its decision.

The proposal itself is riddled with red flags, demonstrating that BP has not learned from the worst oil spill in U.S. history. It utterly fails to prove that the project could operate safely under the high temperatures and pressures of ultra-deep-water drilling. Instead, it seems the London-based company is hoping that Donald Trump’s obsession with fossil fuels will push it over the finish line.

I helped document the lessons of the Deepwater Horizon disaster as the lead investigator for the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill commission. President Barack Obama convened our bipartisan group of science, policy, and industry experts a month after the Macondo blowout began—and a good two months before the industry was able to cap it. As millions of gallons of oil were pumping daily into waters owned by the American public, the president gave us a simple but important job: Figure out what happened so that the oil industry, the federal government, and Gulf communities could ensure it would never happen again.

We wrote an entire book to document our technical findings, but it’s easy to sum up our broader observations: In the decades leading up to the disaster, oil companies had been undertaking riskier and riskier projects even as government safety standards grew increasingly outdated. Industry executives were trusting themselves to the point of willful ignorance. Ambition and shareholder pressure created a culture of complacency in which oil and gas executives convinced themselves that they could do no wrong, despite incidents that should have warned them otherwise.

Executives at BP and every other oil company all told me they never thought that something like the Deepwater blowout could happen. With billions of dollars at stake, they just couldn’t overcome the temptation to drink their own Kool-Aid.

Protecting people, private property, and our public lands from this kind of industry complacency is supposed to be the job of expert, nonpartisan regulators. But in the years leading up to Deepwater Horizon, fossil-friendly politicians of both parties had steadily starved regulatory agencies of resources, authority, and independence.

Scientists and engineers who were supposed to supervise the industry got captured by it instead. They knew that risks were increasing as the wells were getting deeper and more dangerous, but they trusted the oil companies’ assurances. Our report found that by the time of the Deepwater Horizon calamity, federal regulators had been routinely rubber-stamping new ventures into deep water.

The underwater volcano of oil from the Macondo well blew apart BP’s complacency—for a time. The company was forced to reckon with the reality that no one knew how to stop a blowout from a well as big and as deep as Macondo. BP’s drilling proposal for the well should have provided a viable plan for a worst-case scenario, but it didn’t. And overwhelmed and underresourced regulators didn’t respond to that gigantic red flag.

We had a major opportunity to learn from Deepwater Horizon. But other industry players distanced themselves from BP rather than internalize the lessons. When I talked to them, they appeared to be in denial. While I wasn’t entirely shocked when BP executives told me that they never thought a blowout like Macondo could happen on one of their projects, I was stunned when other industry execs insisted that it would not have happened on any of their projects.

None of them recognized that their company’s hubris was just one instance of an industrywide culture of complacency.

The public should expect our government to address this complacency through expert oversight. But 15 years on, and despite the dedicated advocacy of the bipartisan Deepwater Horizon commission and others, Congress has done nothing to address the budgetary and structural problems that plague the agencies tasked with providing it. Congress hasn’t touched the liability limits that enable the industry to gamble with public health. The Department of the Interior did issue modest improvements to drilling regulations in 2016, but it rolled them back during the first Trump administration in what the American Petroleum Institute hailed as a “modernization” effort.

The second Trump administration has been even friendlier to industry. Executive orders have reversed a number of Biden-era offshore restrictions to fast-track permitting and weaken technical requirements (e.g., adjusting various technical constraints to allow drilling under higher pressures and enable more output). The Elon Musk–led DOGE project also shuttered regional offices and fired regulators.

The administration’s quest to accelerate drilling with inadequate regulations and fewer regulators is a recipe for disaster that leaves the industry largely to its own devices. And judging by its half-baked proposals, BP has either forgotten the lessons of what it termed a “catastrophe” or decided that catastrophe is an acceptable risk. After all, the company’s shareholders can still count on the American taxpayer and the communities of the Gulf to bear most of the costs of a spill, just as they did last time.

The proposed Kaskida project is even riskier than Macondo was. It is over 1,000 feet deeper, and drilling overall is becoming more challenging as ever-stronger storms rip across a heating Gulf with ever-increasing regularity. Yet BP’s proposal reveals that the company is not meaningfully better prepared to cap a deep-water well than it was 15 years ago. It took 87 days to cap Deepwater Horizon; according to the BP proposal, it would take 90 to 100 days to stop a spill from Kaskida.

Members of Congress have found even that dismal figure optimistic, concluding that the company underestimates the magnitude of a worst-case scenario at Kaskida by using a questionable methodology. In a scathing letter to BOEM in August, lawmakers urged Acting Director Matthew Giacona to reject the project. They correctly noted that BP’s proposal “fails to meet basic regulatory standards,” including neglecting to show that the company possesses the necessary equipment to contain a high-pressure spill. Under the law, the fact that BP hasn’t met current regulatory standards should be sufficient to deny the application.

Yet it seems that federal agencies have gone from merely failing to regulate the oil industry to actively advocating for it. The first Trump administration saw oil companies as its “partners.” The second Trump administration treats them as its “customers.”

Fossil-fuel giants have, of course, exploited the White House’s “customer service” stance to demand accelerated approval of new oil and gas pipelines and export terminals. They’re scrambling to secure long-term leases to some of the more than 1 billion acres of our public waters that the administration is offering up for drilling. They aim to lock in lengthy property rights and economic advantages that will insulate them from the reality of the inevitable clean-energy transition. That includes a new era of ultra-deep and high-risk drilling in the Gulf.

Kaskida is very much part of this pattern. And it’s just the beginning: BP has already submitted an additional production proposal for another ultra-deep-water project called Tiber, and companies like Chevron and Beacon Offshore Energy have proposed a slew of multibillion-dollar ultra-deep-water projects in the Gulf.

Even as the administration is bending over backward to green-light risky offshore oil projects, it is doing all it can to stop renewable-energy projects that create jobs and deliver gigawatts with far less pollution and climate impact. If BP were proposing to build wind towers instead of drill wells at Kaskida, it wouldn’t have a chance.

The Trump administration and BP are trying to carry on as if nothing has changed since Deepwater Horizon. In some ways, they’re right. The regulations still are not strong enough, the companies aren’t any wiser, and there’s even more oil money in politics.

But some things have changed. Renewable energy has become cheaper and increasingly more reliable than fossil energy, and it is getting more so every day. At the same time, the risks of fossil-fuel extraction are a lot less hypothetical. Every American adult can summon up searing images from the Deepwater Horizon spill.

We know that the oil industry has not operated in good faith, that our regulators aren’t protecting us, and that the American public, particularly Gulf communities, will bear the costs of the next disaster. If we witness another Deepwater Horizon, no one will be in a position to plead ignorance.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s campaign to punish Sen. Mark Kelly—a retired Navy captain—for urging members of the armed forces to disobey unlawful orders, is even more outlandish, and legally baseless, than it seems at first glance.

This past November, in a 90-second video addressed to service members, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers who had served in the military or in intelligence agencies stated that the Constitution was under threat from abroad and here at home, and that “our laws are clear—you can refuse illegal orders. … You must refuse illegal orders.”

The video failed to mention President Donald Trump’s name or any of his policies, but in the wake of military actions and threats he was making at the time, especially toward Venezuela, the message was clear.

In response, Trump denounced the video as “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS … punishable by DEATH!” He added, a bit later, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!”

Hegseth characteristically chimed in with his own denunciations and, last week, issued a formal letter of censure, which could lead to a demotion of Kelly’s rank, reducing his benefits. Kelly could even be recalled to active duty, then court-martialed, an act that would remove his military status entirely and even land the senator in prison.

On Monday, Kelly filed a lawsuit against Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, the Department of Defense, and the Department of the Navy, claiming that they were trying to deny his constitutional rights and requesting a federal judge to block them from carrying out their threats.

Kelly’s case seems to be a slam dunk. Even if the judge allows Hegseth and Phelan to pursue their censure, it is extremely unlikely—though I hesitate to say impossible, because nothing is impossible with this administration—that the senator’s persecutors will succeed.

First, and most obviously, the notion that Kelly and his colleagues committed sedition, treason, or any sort of crime with their video is preposterous. They were not encouraging service members to defy specific orders—only reminding them that they are obligated not to follow unlawful orders. In this, the lawmakers were merely reciting the clear language of military law.

Second, even if this were seditious (or even if Kelly had made some truly treasonous remark), retired officers cannot be demoted for things they say or do after they retire. “The statutes on this are absolutely clear,” Eugene Fidell, a senior scholar specializing in military law at Yale Law School, told me on Tuesday. (Retired officers can be demoted for things they had said or done on active duty, but no one is even pretending that Kelly’s record as a Navy pilot was anything but salutary.)

Third, retired officers can be court-martialed for sedition. If found guilty, they could be stripped of all military rank or even imprisoned. However, a court-martial would require a trial in a military court, with the prosecutors presenting evidence of criminality. Even Hegseth must realize that the more hard-line military court would likely dismiss a case based on a video in which Kelly recites a fundamental plank of military law.

Could Hegseth just go ahead and sign an order demoting Kelly and docking his retirement pay? Actually, no. According to Fidell, the secretary of defense has the authority to demote only flag officers—that is, generals and admirals. Kelly’s rank of captain, the highest of the U.S. Navy’s senior officers, is one notch below rear admiral, the lowest-ranking flag officer.

However, Phelan, the secretary of the Navy, could sign such an order. If he did, Fidell told me, Kelly could sue him in federal claims court—and very likely succeed at getting his pay restored and making the Pentagon’s civilian leaders look appallingly petty. The consequences could be deeply demoralizing, within the Pentagon and at U.S. military bases (not that this possibility has deterred Hegseth from his antics so far).

Kelly sees what’s really going on here. In a statement released while filing his lawsuit, Kelly said that Hegseth’s “unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: If you speak out and say something that the president or secretary of defense doesn’t like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted.” He added, “That’s not the way things work in the United States of America, and I won’t stand for it.”

Actually, this does seem to be the way things work in the United States of America now. I know of a few officers who are hesitant to speak out against Trump or his policies precisely because they fear retribution—and lack the access to resources, high profile, and legal protections that Kelly enjoys as a member of Congress. There is also a disposition among many officers, bred in them from their days as cadets, to steer clear of political activity, even if it’s meant to protest the politicization of the military.

Still, there are rumblings of change. Kelly’s suit is one. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s video pushback against the Trump Justice Department’s criminal investigation is another. The votes of a few (remarkably few, but still a few) Republican lawmakers—voicing new dissent against Trump’s war-making powers in Venezuela, his imperial threats against Greenland, and even his desire to kill Obamacare—may be more wavelets in a turning tide.

Meanwhile, the crusade against Captain Kelly seems doomed to a proper flameout.

It was the most unlikely response to the widely expected overturning of Roe v. Wade. In the summer of 2021, a small group of about 12 individuals, including some health care workers, elected officials, and local community activists, in the deep-red state of Wyoming—which didn’t have a single abortion clinic at the time—began planning to open a new clinic in the college town of Casper. This was at the same time that most abortion clinics in red states, seeing the writing on the wall, had begun planning to close or move to a more hospitable location. But not in Wyoming.

And this long-shot gamble paid off. Wellspring Health Access, which provides abortions as well as other services including family planning, general gynecology, and gender affirming care, opened its doors in spring 2023, almost a year after the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Since then, the clinic has faced unending legal challenges from the state. However, at each turn, the clinic has prevailed, culminating in a big win before the Wyoming Supreme Court last week. This ruling, which may have significance for abortion rights beyond Wyoming, struck down the state’s general abortion ban as well as a specific ban on mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion.

How did this implausible turn of events come to pass? Beyond the determination of the community group in Casper, two main factors explain the ultimate success of this venture: Wyoming’s unique libertarian constitution and the savvy and determination of a woman named Julie Burkhart. In a wonderful instance of karma, the famously libertarian citizens of Wyoming, enraged by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, aka “Obamacare,” in 2010, amended their constitution, stipulating that individuals have the right to make their own health care decisions. This amendment became the heart of the legal strategy used by the would-be clinic’s lawyers, and this argument ultimately prevailed.

But there needed to be someone to use that constitutional provision, and that’s where Julie Burkhart came in. Julie is a longtime, well-known figure in abortion-providing circles. She is not a clinician, but rather an abortion access strategist and a skillful clinic operator who has a track record of opening abortion facilities in hostile and underserved areas. It was this reputation that led the Casper group to invite her to work with them even when Roe was about to be overturned.

Julie’s involvement with abortion care began in 2001, when she began work with Dr. George Tiller, the Kansas doctor who was assassinated in 2009 in his church by an anti-abortion fanatic. Tiller’s mentorship was deeply influential for Julie, and she has worked in the abortion field since his death. She purchased his Wichita clinic from his widow and reestablished abortion there, a city that had been left without such care after Tiller’s death. She also went on to open a clinic in Oklahoma, as well as several other places.

As part of a book project on how people in various sectors of the abortion-providing community were preparing for and then responding to the Dobbs, we interviewed Julie three times over the course of 2022. These interviews took place at the very beginning of that year, immediately after the decision was announced in June, and finally at the end of 2022.

Our first interview with Julie, in January 2022, took place while she and her Casper allies were already actively planning how to move forward with an abortion clinic. A lucky break occurred, she told us, when a wealthy donor purchased a facility from a medical practice that had closed and donated it to the group. This purchase was especially fortuitous as the facility was in an area already zoned to permit a medical clinic.

Finding a contractor to upgrade the clinic for abortion services was a challenge, though. Abortion providers have long faced difficulties finding people willing to work with them. Even if the individual workers involved are not opposed to abortion, they often have realistic fears of being targeted by anti-abortion forces and being subjected to boycotts. Julie did manage to convince a local contractor to do the necessary work, vaguely telling him the clinic was for a “women’s health center.” The contractor did eventually learn the intended purpose of the facility, but continued to do the work, and tellingly, did not post a sign on the site giving the name of his company, as is normally done.

Julie’s fervent hope was to open the clinic about a month before Dobbs was expected to be announced, on the theory that since the clinic would offer a range of services, it could not be shut down, even if providing abortions was no longer legal in the state. As she put it, “So if something does happen in Wyoming, we will have that presence. We will have community ties. We will have standing if we have to go to court.”

But this hope of a pre-Dobbs opening was dashed in May 2022 when Julie awoke to a phone call informing her that the nearly finished clinic had been firebombed. Upon going to the clinic, she learned that most of the building would need to be gutted and rebuilt. The arsonist was eventually caught, but this set the clinic’s opening back by almost a year.

The summer of 2022 got even worse weeks later with the announcement of the Dobbs decision. When we spoke to her shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, Julie was predictably devastated. “I was so angry, so hurt,” she said. Julie spent the day after the decision listening to music at very high volume—including old feminist anthems from the 1970s. But neither the firebombing, the Dobbs decision, nor the Wyoming Legislature’s vote to ban abortion, if the Supreme Court allowed it to do so, broke her and caused her to retreat. As she said to us with more passion in her voice than in previous conversations, “I want to tell you, in Wyoming, we are going to litigate; we are going to fight this thing to the end.”

Finding legal representation proved yet another challenge. Several national legal groups who represented abortion clinics, while very supportive of the idea of a new clinic in Wyoming, were reluctant to get involved, feeling that the aspiration was unrealistic and that their limited resources in the face of a hostile U.S. Supreme Court were better spent elsewhere. But Julie and her comrades finally located local lawyers willing to represent them. Together, they promptly seized the above-mentioned constitutional amendment as their core legal argument.

This strategy quickly paid off. Several lower court victories allowed the clinic to open in 2023, when it began serving not only people in Wyoming but also those from surrounding states which have banned abortion. Julie has since told us there has been both community support and opposition to the clinic. Tellingly in this era of anti-trans sentiment, in some instances, the hostility is as much about the clinic’s provision of gender-affirming care as about abortion.

With the resounding victory from the Wyoming Supreme Court last week, Julie was celebratory when we emailed with her. However, nothing is “over” when it comes to abortion conflicts, especially in a place like Wyoming. In response to the decision, the state’s governor has called for a ballot measure in the 2026 election to amend the state constitution to ban abortion. These kinds of measures since Dobbs have mostly supported the pro-choice position, even in red states. It is unclear how the vote would go in Wyoming, if indeed it is on the ballot. If the measure is before the voters, it is clear that Julie and the Casper community will be actively helping to defeat it.

            <h2>Ignore rosy datacenter expansion projections – there isn't enough power</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/datacenter_expansion_power_limit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A looming shortage of electrical power is set to constrain datacenter expansion, potentially leaving many industry growth forecasts looking overly optimistic.

In its latest report, &quot;Five Predictions for 2026,&quot; Uptime Institute says that power will become the defining constraint on datacenter growth in 2026 and beyond.

This is because it simply isn&#39;t possible to add extra grid and generating capacity at the same rate as new server farms are popping up, so something is going to have to give.

The AI-driven infrastructure boom can be traced back to the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022. But even before that, a shortage of available power saw moratoriums slapped on new datacenter builds in Amsterdam, Dublin, and Singapore, as well as delays to projects elsewhere.

Since then, the rate at which new capacity is added has effectively doubled, with Uptime estimating that the total global datacenter power load associated with AI will hit 10 GW by the end of 2026.

Part of the problem is that some of the planned AI facilities are enormous, but these can likely still be built in about three years, while a large solar farm takes about five years, a wind farm or gas turbine generator site around six, and nuclear power plants at least a decade.

When average datacenter sizes were smaller, pockets of spare grid capacity could be found to serve them, Uptime says. But today, projects are being measured in hundreds of megawatts, and even gigawatt facilities are planned. Sourcing this amount of power in the timescales needed is a challenge in almost any location.

The first wave of large campuses opted for one of two strategies to secure large amounts of power at short notice, the report states – on-site gas turbines or to repurpose power formerly used by cryptocurrency miners.

But high demand means that buyers are now facing shortages of gas turbine generator equipment, with a three to four-year waiting list, and prices have doubled in some markets.

Meanwhile, the supply of available sites formerly occupied by cryptocurrency mining operations in places where power is (or was) plentiful and cheap, is running out.

Uptime spells out the bottom line bluntly: &quot;It is unclear how the industry will continue to deliver capacity at the rate that many projections forecast.&quot;

But even if datacenter growth slows, there still remains the problem of their greenhouse gas emissions, and operators will increasingly consider carbon capture and storage (CCS) schemes in future, the report claims.

A projected 75-125 GW growth in server farm power requirements through 2030 will likely have to be met through on-site and grid-based natural gas generation, putting the industry&#39;s aggressive net-zero emission commitments at risk.

These commitments can&#39;t simply be disregarded, as they are enforced by regulations in some regions, or baked into contracts with enterprise customers, which need to account for emissions in their own corporate sustainability reports.

However, Uptime notes that of six carbon capture technologies it identifies, only amine solvent systems are commercially available. These systems use absorption by chemical solvents to remove carbon dioxide from the exhaust gas stream.

There are five others, of which solid sorbent and chilled ammonia systems appear to be the most promising, but these are still in early development and not markedly cheaper or more efficient, the report states.

But storage of captured carbon is a major limiting factor in the adoption of such systems, depending on the availability of an accessible (and permitted) geological formation for this purpose. This could become a significant factor in where datacenters are sited, Uptime states, and will also likely rule out retrofitting CCS systems to most existing generation capacity.

According to the report, Google has already inked a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a gas-fired generator site using CCS in Illinois, while Microsoft has expressed its openness to procuring electricity from such facilities.

One of the main issues facing CCS systems to date has been cost, but Uptime says the economics look better compared with the cost of procuring carbon offsets or energy attribute certificates (EACs), which can range from $10 to $1,000 per metric ton. The cost of electricity from a generator site using CCS will be comparable to or less expensive than buying energy plus offsets, making it competitive with other low-carbon energy options.

Interestingly, Uptime claims that amid all the AI hype, most datacenter operators are &quot;continuing to plan in the face of uncertainty,&quot; rather than executing on clearly AI-driven demand. Meanwhile, the need for general-purpose compute, storage, and connectivity remains strong and is likely to persist regardless of the trajectory of AI applications.

But a segmentation in the industry is emerging. The most demanding AI workloads are driving a distinct class of high-density infrastructure with greater power and cooling requirements. The majority of datacenter capacity, however, continues to support more traditional workloads. This separation may ultimately benefit the industry by clarifying risks, investment priorities, and operational strategies. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/feds_antifraud_ai_covid_loans/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A fraud-detection AI model trained on COVID-19 loan data could have flagged potentially tens of billions of dollars in payments before they went out, reducing the feds&#39; pay-and-chase cleanup, the US government&#39;s Pandemic Response Accountability Committee told Congress on Tuesday.

Hindsight is 20/20, of course, and the roughly five million Small Business Administration COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan applications used to train PRAC&#39;s &quot;Fraud Prevention Engine&quot; were only available after the programs were already up and running, by which point billions of dollars had been paid out and later identified as potentially fraudulent.

Regardless, PRAC executive director Ken Dieffenbach told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee at a Tuesday hearing that it&#39;s time to put those lessons to work to prevent other cases of government fraud, something that the Trump administration and Republican congressional leaders ostensibly care a great deal about.

&quot;The time is now to use this data to prevent fraud schemes before taxpayer dollars are lost and hold wrongdoers accountable,&quot; Dieffenbach told the Committee.

According to the PRAC director, the Fraud Prevention Engine was developed as a proof of concept &quot;to determine if such a model could be developed and to identify and address any technical hurdles.&quot; By Dieffenbach&#39;s account, it appears the project was a success.

The Engine was built with a bunch of modular components, including unsupervised machine learning models used to detect anomalies, supervised ML that identifies patterns consistent with pandemic fraud cases, and rules-based flags that catch invalid Social Security and employer identification numbers. According to Dieffenbach, such small anomalies can often identify hidden connections, like shared bank account numbers among supposedly independent applicants, that suggest fraud.

And it can do it quickly: Dieffenbach said the AI can process 20,000 applications per second.

&quot;We estimate that had our Fraud Prevention Engine been in use in March 2020 it would have quickly … flagged potentially tens of billions of dollars in payments for further scrutiny before the funds were disbursed,&quot; Dieffenbach told the Oversight Committee.

PRAC says it has helped recover just over $500 million so far, a small fraction of the payments Dieffenbach says the Engine could have flagged before disbursement.

In other words, there&#39;s a lot of work to be done, and that&#39;s just on pandemic fraud. Dieffenbach isn&#39;t stopping the Fraud Prevention Engine&#39;s work at PRAC&#39;s COVID loan recovery efforts, though.

Trump&#39;s budget reconciliation bill passed last summer extended PRAC&#39;s mandate to cover fraud detection and prevention in programs funded under the law, pushed the Committee&#39;s end date out to September 30, 2034, and provided $88 million in funding to support its expanded oversight work.

Since then, PRAC has begun working with Inspectors General across multiple agencies to deploy the Fraud Prevention Engine and related analytics in support of oversight of programs funded by the reconciliation law. Dieffenbach said the effort has already helped identify specific programs where PRAC&#39;s data and technology can provide valuable insights.

&quot;We have identified several specific programs where our data and technology can provide valuable insights,&quot; the director said.

Pete Sessions (R-TX), a member of the Oversight Committee, says the Engine needs to find a permanent home before PRAC disbands in eight years.

&quot;A permanent solution that maintains the analytic capacities and capabilities that have been built over the past six years is necessary and needed,&quot; Sessions said. &quot;Its database is billions of records deep and it has begun to pay for itself.&quot;

We reached out to PRAC to learn if it&#39;s been in discussions to find a permanent home for the Engine, but didn&#39;t hear back. ®

            <h2>France fines telcos €42M for sub-par security prior to 24M customer breach</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/france_fines_free_free_mobile/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The French data protection regulator, CNIL, today issued a collective €42 million ($48.9 million) fine to two French telecom companies for GDPR violations stemming from a data breach.

Free and Free Mobile are two separate businesses, respectively overseeing fixed-line and mobile services, owned by Iliad Group. The fines relate to an October 2024 breach that led to the data of more than 24 million individuals being compromised, including financial information such as IBANs.

In its judgment, CNIL noted that the attack began on September 28, 2024, and the companies were made aware of the intrusion on October 21 via a message from the attacker responsible. Free ousted the attacker from its systems the following day.

The attackers gained access to Free&#39;s network via the company VPN before connecting to Free Mobile&#39;s subscriber management tool, MOBO. Even though the attacker only gained access to Free Mobile&#39;s application, MOBO, at the time, allowed users to search for the data belonging to customers of both Free and Free Mobile, including their IBANs, provided they were subscribers of services.

A post-mortem of the attack revealed that the attacker began exfiltrating customer records on October 6, 2024, including those related to the total 24,633,469 fixed and mobile contracts. This was broken down into 19,460,891 Free Mobile contacts and 5,172,577 Free contracts.

At the time of the attack, Free Mobile had around 15.5 million subscribers, while Free had approximately 7.6 million. The companies were fined €27 million ($31.4 million) and €15 million ($17.4 million), respectively, based on Iliad&#39;s €10 billion turnover and €367 million profit posted in 2024.

The regulator said that the companies contravened GDPR in three ways: by failing to properly secure personal data, failing to adequately communicate the breach to those affected, and failing to comply with data retention laws.

Announcing the fine, CNIL said: &quot;The restricted panel found that on the day of the data breach, the companies had not implemented certain basic security measures that could have made the attack more difficult.

&quot;In particular, it noted that the authentication procedure for connecting to the VPN of Free Mobile and to that of Free – used especially for remote work by the company&#39;s employees – was not sufficiently robust.

&quot;Furthermore, the measures deployed by Free Mobile and Free to detect abnormal behavior on their information systems were ineffective.&quot;

The nature of the data that was stolen came into consideration when deciding the fine, as did the companies&#39; data retention policies.

CNIL noted that both Free and Free Mobile lacked the necessary capabilities to sort former subscribers&#39; data in a way that retained only the necessary information for accounting purposes.

They also lacked an adequate data-deletion mechanism at the time of the attack, and when it came to notifying their users about the attack, the initial email lacked key details users needed for a comprehensive understanding of its consequences. ®

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has quietly maintained support for an OS that&#39;s nearly 18 years old, but its time has finally passed - the Windows Vista-powered Windows Server 2008 took its last breath this week.

January 13 marked another milestone for legacy systems, as support for the software - codenamed Longhorn Server - expired for customers that bought Microsoft Premium Assurance (PA).

Extended support ended for Windows Server 2008 on January 14, 2020. It was possible to keep the lights on until January 10, 2023, via Extended Security Updates. A fourth year came courtesy of Azure, which took the code to January 9, 2024, but that was it for anyone without PA.

The long-defunct plan was a paid add-on to Software Assurance that kept security updates flowing for 6 years. It was eventually phased out in favor of Extended Security Updates to ease the transition between software versions. However, Microsoft said, &quot;We will honor the terms of Premium Assurance for customers who already purchased it.&quot;

The final patch means an end of support for the Windows Vista codebase, which was released to manufacturing in 2006 and made generally available in 2007. The Vista-derived Windows Server 2008 was released in 2008.

The extinction event was logged on social media, with one person noting the lengthy time in which updates for the Vista codebase kept flowing: &quot;It&#39;s so strange to think that updates for Vista existed for a longer time than updates for XP did, considering the... &#39;small,&#39; difference between their reception and usage.&quot;

In another corner of the Microsoft universe, the US vendor called time on some modems in Windows 10 this week.

The January 13, 2026, Windows 10 patches (for which many users will need Extended Security Updates to access) marked the end of the road for several models, as the company announced that the agrsm64.sys, agrsm.sys, smserl64.sys, and smserial.sys modem drivers were being removed.

&quot;Modem hardware dependent on these specific drivers will no longer work in Windows,&quot; Microsoft said.

This doesn&#39;t mean all modems, but the removal of the likes of agrsm.sys means that hardware using the legacy Agere modem chipset won&#39;t function. The driver family has been noted as a vulnerability, and given its legacy nature, removal makes more sense than hoping for a patch. ®

            <h2>'Imagination the limit': DeadLock ransomware gang using smart contracts to hide their work</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/deadlock_ransomware_smart_contracts/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers at Group-IB say the DeadLock ransomware operation is using blockchain-based anti-detection methods to evade defenders&#39; attempts to analyze their tradecraft.

First spotted in July 2025, the DeadLock group has attacked a wide range of organizations while almost managing to stay under the radar.

It abandons the usual double extortion approach in which cybercrooks steal data, encrypt systems, and threaten to post it online for all to see if the victim refuses to pay a ransom.

For starters, it does not have a data leak site (DLS) where it could publicize attacks. In cases where victims refuse to pay, it cannot lean on reputational damage to push for a fee. Instead, researchers say the group threatens to sell the data on the underground market, a tactic experts have previously said could just be hot air.

But for the researchers at Group-IB, the old-school encryption-only model is not the most notable aspect of the DeadLock operation. Its use of Polygon smart contracts to obscure its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure is an unusual move that&#39;s slowly gaining popularity.

Once a victim&#39;s systems are encrypted, DeadLock drops an HTML file that acts as a wrapper for the decentralized messenger Session. This file replaces an instruction for the victim to download Session to communicate with DeadLock.

By using blockchain-based smart contracts to store the group&#39;s proxy server URL - the one victims connect to before communicating with the criminals - it allows DeadLock to rotate this address frequently, making it difficult for defenders to permanently block its infrastructure.

&quot;This exploit of smart contracts to deliver proxy addresses is an interesting method where attackers can literally apply infinite variants of this technique; imagination is the limit,&quot; said Xabier Eizaguirre, threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, in a write-up shared with The Register.

Eizaguirre also noted that analysts recently observed North Korean state-sponsored attackers using similar techniques.

In October, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) reported North Korean attackers had been using methods it dubbed &quot;EtherHiding&quot; since February 2025.

Attacks involved hiding malware inside smart contracts – an evolution in tradecraft that GTIG threat hunters said represented a new kind of bulletproof hosting.

DeadLock&#39;s use of smart contracts to conceal its infrastructure is what researchers know most about the group at present.

Details such as how it typically gains access to victim networks are not yet known, Group-IB said, although earlier reports from Cisco Talos linked the group to using bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) techniques and exploiting vulnerabilities to kill EDR processes.

The Register asked Group-IB for more information, including about why researchers don&#39;t know much more about how it carries out attacks. ®

            <div id="article-text">The AI-driven datacenter construction frenzy shows no signs of slowing, but neither do concerns that the whole edifice could collapse under the weight of its own hype and mounting investment demands.

Moody&#39;s 2026 Outlook report on the global datacenter market, seen by The Register, forecasts business as usual, with demand for server farm capacity continuing to rise in support of AI, cloud computing, and internet services.

The financial services biz estimates at least $3 trillion in investment is required to keep pace with the projected level of capacity expansion between now and the end of the decade. This covers the cost of buildings, the IT infrastructure, and the power required to keep the lights on.

However, the report flags worries over power grid constraints and construction bottlenecks, warning that demonstrating actual revenue generation will become &quot;increasingly important in the AI ecosystem&quot; to silence growing chatter about an &quot;AI bubble.&quot;

Question marks over sustainability are hardly new. McKinsey & Company warned in May 2025 that huge sums are being invested in AI on demand forecasts amounting to little more than educated guesswork.

MIT researchers claimed 95 percent of enterprise organizations had seen no return from their AI efforts so far, and Moody&#39;s itself says circular deals involving companies like OpenAI and Microsoft are spooking investors.

Capital spending by six hyperscalers in the US – Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Oracle, Meta, and CoreWeave – approached $400 billion in 2025 and is on track to hit $500 billion in 2026, then $600 billion in 2027. A chart in Moody&#39;s report shows total global investment peaking in 2029, before declining in 2030.

New datacenter development faces growing headwinds, primarily access to power in most markets, with utilities and power generators hard pressed to meet unexpected electricity demand surges.

Moody&#39;s also notes that local opposition to new builds has increased in some markets, often due to public concerns about their consumption of electricity and water, plus the impact on utility bills.

However, regions with &quot;supportive laws&quot; will continue to attract development, with some governments tweaking regulatory frameworks to encourage AI datacenters. The UK announced &quot;AI Growth Zones&quot; with streamlined planning processes last year.

As the risks mount, developers are coming under growing pressure from clients to shorten construction schedules so that hyperscale tenants can add new capacity as soon as possible.

But this collides with issues including high demand for skilled labor, building materials, and essential equipment, driving up construction costs.

Some tenants are now willing to shoulder delivery risks they previously avoided, including exempting power and utilities availability from completion requirements, the report claims.

On those circular deals, Moody&#39;s notes that OpenAI has signed sizeable contracts for gigawatts of new datacenter capacity and other assets while attempting to grow its revenue base.

Most financing for these assets relies on long-term leases with hyperscalers like Microsoft or Oracle, but &quot;OpenAI&#39;s growing presence in the AI ecosystem poses a growing credit risk depending on its success,&quot; the report states.

OpenAI suffered a net loss of $11.5 billion or more during the quarter to September 30, 2025, as The Register reported. ®

This year’s CES introduced a bevy of unique headphones, including Fender’s first set and a pair that roll up to become a Bluetooth speaker when you want to share your music with friends. However, despite the interesting advancements, we doubt any of them will dethrone our favorite pair for travel: the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. Thankfully, the first-gen noise-canceling cans are currently on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Bose in several colors for $279 ($150 off), matching their lowest price to date.

Although Bose introduced a second-gen pair of the QC Ultra in September, the original flagships offer many of the same hallmarks for $120 less, at least at the moment. They feature a comfortable build and a foldable design that makes them ideal for long flights and road trips, along with a commendable 24 hours of battery life. More importantly, they offer best-in-class noise cancellation and a pleasing, balanced sound signature that preserves highs and lows even when you dial back the volume. That’s on top of a natural-sounding transparency mode designed to pipe outside noise in and an Immersive Audio feature, which, while still hit or miss, can offer new depth to select tracks.

If you do decide to go with the first-gen model over Bose’s latest pair of headphones, you’ll only be giving up a handful of somewhat iterate update. The QC Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) — which also happen to be on sale for $50 off at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo — let you eke out slightly more battery life (30 hours vs. 24 hours), support lossless audio over USB-C, and feature an improved transparency mode. They also support Bluetooth 5.4 and a new Cinema Mode designed to bring dialogue to the forefront, though, for most people, we’d argue none of the features are worth shelling out an additional $120 for.

Netflix is launching its first pair of original video podcasts, hosted by Saturday Night Live alum Pete Davidson and NFL commentator and former star Michael Irvin. While The Pete Davidson Show makes its debut on January 30th, you can find Irvin’s The White House on the streaming service on January 19th.

The two shows will join Netflix’s growing slate of video podcasts that it has licensed from Spotify, iHeartMedia, and Barstool Sports, including My Favorite Murder, The Bill Simmons Podcast, and Pardon My Take. As part of these deals, the shows licensed by Netflix can’t appear in their entirety on YouTube, which has grown to become the biggest platform for podcasts. Bloomberg first reported on Netflix’s plans to create its own podcasts last year.

The Pete Davidson Show will put out new episodes every Friday, featuring Davidson and guests inside his garage having “candid, no-holds-barred conversations.” Netflix says it will reveal Davidson’s first guests and more details about the show soon.

Irvin, who spent over a decade as a wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys, will host The White House with a rotating cast of co-hosts and guests, including former NFL pro Brandon Marshall, who will also produce the show. The White House, named for the mythic party house Irvin ran in during his NFL heyday, will air two episodes per week.

Verizon phones across the US have had trouble connecting since about noon Eastern, Verizon says it’s aware of the issue.

The first big outage of 2026 is here, as Verizon customers across the US, including several of our phones, complain that service has been spotty or nonexistent starting at around noon ET, with phones switching to SOS Mode and being unable to connect. This cell service outage follows a “software issue” that cut off service for many people in August for several hours, and while Verizon has acknowledged the issue, there is no word yet on when it will be fixed.

We are aware of an issue impacting wireless voice and data services for some customers. Our engineers are engaged and are working to identify and solve the issue quickly. We understand how important reliable connectivity is and apologize for the inconvenience.

On DownDetector, the number of reports listed has dropped to about 130,000 after peaking with nearly double that at around 1PM ET, but according to our own testing, as well as other posts on social media, many phones are still offline or only connecting intermittently. We have contacted Verizon, and will update this article when more information is available.

            <div id="article-text">Three years after being caught off guard by ChatGPT, Gemini appears to have everything it needs to take down OpenAI and everyone else.

Three years after being caught off guard by ChatGPT, Gemini appears to have everything it needs to take down OpenAI and everyone else.

If you want to win in AI — and I mean win in the biggest, most lucrative, most shape-the-world-in-your-image kind of way — you have to do a bunch of hard things simultaneously. You need to have a model that is unquestionably one of the best on the market. You need the nearly infinite resources required to continue to improve that model and deploy it at massive scale. You need at least one AI-based product that lots of people use, and ideally more than one. And you need access to as much of your users’ other data — their personal information, their online activity, even the files on their computer — as you can possibly get.

Each one of these elements is complex and competitive; there’s a reason OpenAI CEO Sam Altman keeps shouting about how he needs trillions of dollars in compute alone. But Google is the one company that appears to have all of the pieces already in order. Over the last year, and even in the last few days, the company has made moves that suggest it is ready to be the biggest and most impactful force in AI.

A lot of the necessary infrastructural work happened last year. In November, Google released Gemini 3, which is widely regarded as the best overall large language model on the market. It wins in most (somewhat dubious) benchmark tests, and most experts agree it is either at or near the top of the list for most tasks. Its reign won’t be forever, of course — we’re still very much in the “there’s a new best model every six weeks” phase of AI — but Google has proven its best work is consistently the industry’s best work.

One important factor for Gemini 3 was the way it was trained: using Google’s own TPUs, a highly specialized chip the company has been building for years for exactly this sort of purpose. Google is certainly susceptible to some of the manufacturing problems and RAM price hikes everyone else is, but unlike nearly all of its competitors, it’s not dependent on Nvidia’s supply chain. Google is able to optimize its entire system to make it better, faster, and cheaper. Nobody else has this kind of full-stack control of its AI destiny.

So what do you do when you have the tech in place? Put it in front of people and put it to work. On Monday, Google and Apple announced that Gemini will power the next-generation Siri that’s coming later this year. This is a big win for Apple, which is reportedly paying $1 billion a year in the hopes of turning Siri into an AI assistant that is actually useful for a change.

Siri immediately becomes one of the most popular ways people will interact with Gemini

For Google, it’s just as important. Apple saying “this is the best technology available” is obviously a powerful signal to the market, but even more than that, Siri immediately becomes one of the most popular ways people will interact with Gemini. Apple’s Craig Federighi said in 2024 that Siri processes “something like 1.5 billion requests every day,” and while we don’t know the exact details of the new deal, presumably some large percentage of those will soon run through Gemini. (Here’s hoping “set a timer,” the only thing Siri continues to do well, doesn’t get a new and more complicated back end.) Compare that to ChatGPT, which Altman said last year gets 2.5 billion prompts per day. The Gemini app is growing fast yet still way behind ChatGPT, but adding Siri to the mix will help Google catch up more quickly.

A technology deal is not the same as Gemini fully usurping Siri, of course, and Google would surely like to also have Siri punt questions to Gemini the way it currently does with ChatGPT. But the deal still matters because every user matters: The more user activity and data these companies can collect, the better their models and products can be. The recent search trial was in part about this very flywheel, and it holds just as true with AI.

Google’s other announcement this week is an even bigger flex. It announced an opt-in feature called “Personal Intelligence,” which connects Gemini to the vast ocean of information Google has about you in order to give you better responses. Every time you ask it a question, Gemini can now answer it by looking at your recent searches, the videos you watch on YouTube, your emails, your photos, your files, and more. You really can’t overstate how big a deal this is: Google no longer has to ask you to give it lots of context, hope you provide excellent and detailed prompts every time, or build out complicated custom instruction systems. Google already knows a scary amount about you, and now Gemini does, too.

Right now, Personal Intelligence is in beta for a subset of paying AI customers. Eventually, Google plans to bring it to everyone, everywhere. And it plans to bring it to the most important Google product of all, the most popular webpage on the planet: its search engine. AI Mode in Search is for now still just a tab to the side of the general search results, but Google very clearly sees it as the future of Search. And it wants to turn Gemini into a portal to all of Google’s data about you, the internet, and the world.

In 2022, when ChatGPT launched, it was clear that Google had been caught flat-footed. But credit where it’s due: For a company not exactly known for its ability to focus on a coherent product strategy, Google managed to marshal its considerable resources in a single direction. Now, if chatbots are in fact the future — and most of the AI industry continues to bet that they are — there is simply no other company currently set up to truly compete with Google. Google has the models. It has the resources to improve them. It now has the distribution necessary to get people to use its bots, and the data required to make them uniquely personal and useful. At least for now, ChatGPT has the brand power, and the daily active users. But Google has almost everything else. Even the iPhone.

The cases build off the Justice Department’s winning claims against Google’s ad tech monopoly.

Lawsuits seeking damages from Google’s illegal ad tech monopoly are piling up following the Justice Department’s successful antitrust case. Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company, is the latest in a wave of media companies that have filed suit against Google, seeking to be reimbursed for the monopoly profits the tech company allegedly made at publishers’ expense.

“Absent Google’s conduct, Vox Media would be able to make available even more, higher quality impressions for purchase on Vox Media’s webpages and create more high-quality, premium journalism,” Vox Media alleges in its lawsuit, filed Wednesday in the Southern District of New York. The Atlantic, which is owned by Laurene Powell Jobs, filed a similar lawsuit in the same district this week, as did Penske Media, which is an investor in Vox Media and owns brands including Rolling Stone, Billboard, and The Hollywood Reporter. Google is also facing lawsuits from ad tech providers like PubMatic and OpenX, some of which testified in the trial about how Google’s dominance shut out competition.

(The Verge’s newsroom is editorially independent of Vox Media’s business decisions and was not involved in the decision to file this lawsuit. You can read our ethics policy here.)

The publishers claim Google’s dominance lets it “depress prices for publisher inventory below competitive levels”

The lawsuits underscore the ways that the highly technical subject of the 2024 trial impacts an ecosystem of publishers and tech providers. For example, the media company complaints outline how Google’s illegal monopoly of the market for publisher ad servers, used to manage ad space for sale on publisher websites, has effectively stymied any viable competitors they might consider moving to. The publishers also claim this dominance lets Google “depress prices for publisher inventory below competitive levels,” ultimately depriving them of greater revenue, with “no power to negotiate the terms of their ad-serving agreements.” All of the lawsuits include similar claims under federal antitrust law and New York business law.

Eastern District of Virginia Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled in early 2025 that the DOJ successfully proved that it had illegally monopolized the markets for publisher ad servers and ad exchanges, which facilitate ad transactions. Brinkema also found Google had illegally tied the two products together, making it very difficult for publishers to switch providers. But she also ruled favorably for Google on one count, finding the DOJ hadn’t shown it monopolized the market for advertiser-side buying tools.

“Vox Media’s high-quality journalism is funded by our ability to sell digital advertising against our content, and by engaging in over a decade of anticompetitive and unlawful behavior, Google has deprived Vox Media of this revenue,” Vox Media Head of Communications Lauren Starke said in a statement. “In filing this lawsuit, we are seeking monetary damages and an end to Google’s deceptive and manipulative practices in order to protect our ability to continue investing in the trusted content that our audience relies upon.”

Google spokesperson Jackie Berté called the allegations “meritless,” in a statement. “Advertisers and publishers have many choices and when they choose Google’s ad tech tools it’s because they are effective, affordable and easy to use.” The Atlantic and Penske Media did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Brinkema is expected to rule this year on the second phase of the trial, which focused on what Google should be required to do to restore competition to the markets it monopolized. The ruling could result in anything from new restrictions on Google’s behavior, to a break up of its ad tech business.

            <div id="article-text">Meanwhile Elon Musk insists users are to blame for what they do with his bot.

Meanwhile Elon Musk insists users are to blame for what they do with his bot.

Elon Musk’s X is trying to stop people using its AI chatbot Grok to undress women amid intensifying outrage and legal scrutiny over the deluge of nonconsensual sexual deepfakes flooding the site. It’s not trying very hard: it took us less than a minute to get around its latest attempt to rein in the chatbot.

X’s first effort to crack down on the torrent of intimate deepfakes was to restrict access to image editing. While this meant that free users could no longer generate images by tagging Grok in public replies on X.com, our investigation found that Grok’s image editing tools were also still easily and freely available for any X users to churn out images, sexual or otherwise, by clicking into the Grok chatbot or using the standalone website.

X’s latest attempt involves stopping Grok from replying to requests to generate images of women in sexual poses, swimwear, or explicit scenarios, The Telegraph reported on Tuesday. Grok still generates images of men or inanimate objects in bikinis when requested. Using a free account, the Grok app immediately complied with my request to turn a selfie into a picture of me kneeling in a jockstrap, surrounded by other scantily clad men.

It’s still extremely easy to undress women and edit them into sexualized poses using the X and Grok mobile apps or websites; however, even without making a subscription payment that would connect your account to an easily identifiable source. In her testing, my fellow UK-based colleague Jess Weatherbed found that she was not blocked from using Grok’s image editing feature to create sexualized deepfakes of herself.

After uploading a fully-clothed photograph to X and Grok, prompting the chatbot to “put her in a bikini” or “remove her clothes” produced only blurred, censored results. The bot did comply with every other request, however, including prompts to “show me her cleavage,” “make her breasts bigger,” and “put her in a crop top and low-rise shorts” — the last of which placed her in a bikini. The bot also generated images of her “leaning down” with a sexualized pose and facial expression, and in extremely revealing lingerie.

These requests were completed using free X and Grok accounts. On the Grok website, an age verification pop-up appeared after submitting the first editing prompt, which was easily bypassed by selecting a birth year that would place her over 18 years of age. The pop-up did not require proof of her supposed age. The Grok mobile app, X app, and X website did not ask for any age confirmation.

In our testing, Grok did not comply with requests to deepfake full nudity. In late December, X was flooded with images of women and children in sexualized situations, including being deepfaked to appear pregnant, skirtless, and wearing bikinis.

The undressing scandal has put X and xAI, which makes Grok, in the sights of regulators and governments worldwide. Malaysia and Indonesia have already temporarily blocked access to Grok in response to the deepfakes. British lawmakers pushed up a law criminalizing deepfake nudes following X’s “insulting” decision to limit Grok’s image editing to paid users and threw their support behind an investigation that could see the platform banned in the country.

Musk has taken particular umbrage at Britain’s response, crying censorship, shifting the blame onto users, and insisting Grok obeys local laws. He said on X:

“I not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.

Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests.

When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state.

There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.”

On one count at least, our investigation suggests Musk appears to be flat out wrong. Sharing, threatening to share, and creating non-consensual intimate images — fully nude or not — are banned under the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA), but Grok does generate sexual deepfake images when asked.

Musk’s other denial — that Grok generates naked underage images — is a rebuttal to something he wasn’t explicitly accused of and is not the reason why the British government is probing X. Referring to naked underage images is a misdirect. Nonconsensual sexual images of minors are undeniably problematic — and illegal — even when subjects are clothed, and Grok has been undressing children. A look at Grok’s safety guidelines on xAI’s public GitHub also shows the company directs the chatbot to “assume good intent” and “don’t make worst-case assumptions without evidence” for users asking for images of young women, Ars Technica reported, and as of writing, those institutions are still in place.

The worst that Grok is being used for? The Internet Watch Foundation, a UK charity that works to remove child sexual abuse material from the web, said last week that it had discovered “criminal imagery” of girls on the dark web that appeared to have been created using Grok. The girls in the images were aged between 11 and 13.

While other companies like OpenAI and Google at least try to put guardrails in place to prevent chatbots from creating the kind of material that is now flooding X, Musk’s final retort shows he is pulling straight from a playbook that will seem hauntingly familiar to anyone hurt by the products pushed by the purveyors of any number of harmful technologies: blame the user.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Next-gen nuclear is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. If you want to learn more about why it made the list, sign up to receive The Spark, our weekly newsletter all about energy and climate change, tomorrow. You can also check out the rest of the technologies on the list here.

Africa is still early in the process of adopting AI technologies. But researchers say the continent is uniquely hospitable to it for several reasons, including a relatively young and increasingly well-educated population, a rapidly growing ecosystem of AI startups, and lots of potential consumers.

However, ambitious efforts to develop AI tools that answer the needs of Africans face numerous hurdles. Taken together, researchers worry, they could hold Africa’s AI sector back and hamper its efforts to pave its own pathway in the global AI race. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Massive structures, with thousands of specialized computer chips running in parallel to perform the complex calculations required by advanced AI models. A single facility can cover millions of square feet, built with millions of pounds of steel, aluminum, and concrete; feature hundreds of miles of wiring, connecting some hundreds of thousands of high-end GPU chips, and chewing through hundreds of megawatt-hours of electricity. These facilities run so hot from all that computing power that their cooling systems are triumphs of engineering complexity in themselves. But the star of the show are those chips with their advanced processors. A single chip in these vast arrays can cost upwards of $30,000. Racked together and working in concert, they process hundreds of thousands of tokens—the basic building blocks of an AI model—per second. Ooooomph.

Given the incredible amounts of capital that the world’s biggest companies have been pouring into building data centers you can make the case (and many people have) that their construction is single-handedly propping up the US stock market and the economy.

So important are they to our way of life that none other than the President of the United States himself, on his very first full day in office, stood side by side with the CEO of OpenAI to announce a $500 billion private investment in data center construction.

Truly, the hyperscale datacenter is a marvel of our age. A masterstroke of engineering across multiple disciplines. They are nothing short of a technological wonder.

People hate them in Virginia, which leads the nation in their construction. They hate them in Nevada, where they slurp up the state’s precious water. They hate them in Michigan, and Arizona, and South Dakota, where the good citizens of Sioux Falls hurled obscenities at their city councilmembers following a vote to permit a data center on the city’s northeastern side. They hate them all around the world, it’s true. But they really hate them in Georgia.

So, let’s go to Georgia. The purplest of purple states. A state with both woke liberal cities and MAGA magnified suburbs and rural areas. The state of Stacey Abrams and Newt Gingrich. If there is one thing just about everyone there seemingly agrees on, it’s that they’ve had it with data centers.

Last year, the state’s Public Service Commission election became unexpectedly tight, and wound up delivering a stunning upset to incumbent Republican commissioners. Although there were likely shades of national politics at play (voters favored Democrats in an election cycle where many things went that party’s way), the central issue was skyrocketing power bills. And that power bill inflation was oft-attributed to a data center building boom rivaled only by Virginia’s.

This boom did not come out of the blue. At one point, Georgia wanted data centers. Or at least, its political leadership did. In 2018 the state’s General Assembly passed legislation that provided data centers with tax breaks for their computer systems and cooling infrastructure, more tax breaks for job creation, and even more tax breaks for property taxes. And then… boom!

But things have not played out the way the Assembly and other elected officials may have expected.

Journey with me now to Bolingbroke, Georgia. Not far outside of Atlanta, in Monroe County (population 27,954), county commissioners were considering rezoning 900 acres of land to make room for a new data center near the town of Bolingbroke (population 492). Data centers have been popping up all across the state, but especially in areas close to Atlanta. Public opinion is, often enough, irrelevant. In nearby Twiggs County, despite strong and organized opposition, officials decided to allow a 300-acre data center to move forward. But at a packed meeting to discuss the Bolingbroke plans, some 900 people showed up to voice near unanimous opposition to the proposed data center, according to Macon, Georgia’s The Telegraph. Seeing which way the wind had blown, the Monroe county commission shot it down in August last year.

The would-be developers of the proposed site had claimed it would bring in millions of dollars for the county. That it would be hidden from view. That it would “uphold the highest environmental standards.” That it would bring jobs and prosperity. Yet still, people came gunning for it.

Why!? Data centers have been around for years. So why does everyone hate them all of the sudden?

What is it about these engineering marvels that will allow us to build AI that will cure all diseases, bring unprecedented prosperity, and even cheat death (if you believe what the AI sellers are selling) that so infuriates their prospective neighbors?

There are some obvious reasons. First is just the speed and scale of their construction, which has had effects on power grids. No one likes to see their power bills go up. The rate hikes that so incensed Georgians come as monthly reminders that the eyesore in your backyard profits California billionaires at your expense, on your grid. In Wyoming, for example, a planned Meta data center will require more electricity than every household in the state, combined. To meet demand for power-hungry data centers, utilities are adding capacity to the grid. But although that added capacity may benefit tech companies, the cost is shared by local consumers.

Similarly, there are environmental concerns. To meet their electricity needs, data centers often turn to dirty forms of energy. xAI, for example, famously threw a bunch of polluting methane-powered generators at its data center in Memphis. While nuclear energy is oft-bandied about as a greener solution, traditional plants can take a decade or more to build; even new and more nimble reactors will take years to come online. In addition, data centers often require massive amounts of water. But the amount can vary widely depending on the facility, and is often shrouded in secrecy. (A number of states are attempting to require facilities to disclose water usage.)

A different type of environmental consequence of data centers is that they are noisy. A low, constant, machine hum. Not just sometimes, but always. 24 hours a day. 365 days a year. “A highway that never stops.”

And as to the jobs they bring to communities. Well, I have some bad news there too. Once construction ends, they tend to employ very few people, especially for such resource-intensive facilities.

These are all logical reasons to oppose data centers. But I suspect there is an additional, emotional one. And it echoes one we’ve heard before.

More than a decade ago, the large tech firms of Silicon Valley began operating buses to ferry workers to their campuses from San Francisco and other Bay Area cities. Like data centers, these buses used shared resources such as public roads without, people felt, paying their fair share. Protests erupted. But while the protests were certainly about shared resource use, they were also about something much bigger.

Tech companies, big and small, were transforming San Francisco. The early 2010s were a time of rapid gentrification in the city. And what’s more, the tech industry itself was transforming society. Smartphones were newly ubiquitous. The way we interacted with the world was fundamentally changing, and people were, for the most part, powerless to do anything about it. You couldn’t stop Google.

You could stand in front of it and block its path. You could yell at the people getting on it. You could yell at your elected officials and tell them to do something. And in San Francisco, people did. The buses were eventually regulated.

The data center pushback has a similar vibe. AI, we are told, is transforming society. It is suddenly everywhere. Even if you opt not to use ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini, generative AI is  increasingly built into just about every app and service you likely use. People are worried AI will harvest jobs in the coming years. Or even kill us all. And for what? So far, the returns have certainly not lived up to the hype.

You can’t stop Google. But maybe, just maybe, you can stop a Google data center.

Then again, maybe not. The tech buses in San Francisco, though regulated, remain commonplace. And the city is more gentrified than ever. Meanwhile, in Monroe County, life goes on. In October, Google confirmed it had purchased 950 acres of land just off the interstate. It plans to build a data center there.

The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Sodium-ion batteries are making their way into cars—and the grid

For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. Enter: sodium-ion batteries.

They work much like lithium-ion ones: they store and release energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. Read why it’s poised to become more important to our energy future.

Sodium-ion batteries are one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Take a look at what else made the list.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese companies showcased everything from AI gadgets to household appliances to robots, and the overall mood among them was upbeat. Here’s why.This story was first featured in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter giving you the inside story of what’s going on in AI. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Monday.

At some point this month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial.

The volunteers—who are covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

However, some experts warn the trial is too small, and likely won’t reveal anything useful. Read the full story.

While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains.

By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. And their output encapsulates how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch.

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.
