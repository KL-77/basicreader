            <h2>TR-49 is interactive fiction for fans of deep research rabbit holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/tr-49-is-interactive-fiction-for-fans-of-deep-research-rabbit-holes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve ever fallen down a Wikipedia rabbit hole or spent a pleasant evening digging through college library stacks, you know the joy of a good research puzzle. Every new source and cross-reference you find unlocks an incremental understanding of a previously unknown world, forming a piecemeal tapestry of knowledge that you can eventually look back at as a cohesive and well-known whole.

TR-49 takes this research process and operationalizes it into an engrossing and novel piece of heavily non-linear interactive fiction. Researching the myriad sources contained in the game’s mysterious computer slowly reveals a tale that’s part mystery, part sci-fi allegory, part family drama, and all-compelling alternate academic history.

The entirety of TR-49 takes place from a first-person perspective as you sit in front of a kind of Steampunk-infused computer terminal. An unseen narrator asks you to operate the machine but is initially cagey about how or why or what you’re even looking for. There’s a creepy vibe to the under-explained circumstances that brought you to this situation, but the game never descends into the jump scares or horror tropes of so many other modern titles.

Your only real form of interaction with the world of TR-49 is through a sepia-toned tube display on the left and a four-character split-flap on the right that serves as the computer’s only input. You quickly discover that entering specific sequences—each with two letters followed by two numbers, as suggested by the game’s name—brings up library catalog-style entries referring to a vast web of literary works that form the core of the game’s wider fiction.

While the catalog contains short excerpts from each of these discovered works, it’s the additional notes added to each entry by subsequent researchers that place each title in its full context. You’ll end up poring through these research notes for clues about the existence and chronology of other authors and works. Picking out specific names and years points to the codes and titles needed to unlock even more reference pages in the computer, pushing you further down the rabbit hole. Picture something like Her Story, but replace the cinéma vérité surveillance video clips with a library card catalog.

You’ll slowly start to unravel and understand how the game world’s myriad authors are influencing each other with their cross-pollinating writings. The treatises, novels, pamphlets, and journals discussed in this database are full of academic sniping, intellectual intrigue, and interpersonal co-mingling across multiple generations of work. It all ends up circling a long-running search for a metaphysical key to life itself, which most of the authors manage to approach but never quite reach a full understanding.

As you explore, you also start to learn more about the personal affairs of the researchers who collected and cataloged all this reference material and the vaguely defined temporal capabilities of the information-synthesis engine in the computer you’ve all worked on. Eventually, you’ll stumble on the existence of core commands that can unlock hidden parts of the computer or alter the massive research database itself, which becomes key to your eventual final goal.

Through it all, there’s a slowly unfolding parallel narrative involving Liam, the unseen voice guiding you through the research process itself. Through occasional voice clips, Liam eventually hints at the existence of a powerful and quickly encroaching threat that wants to stop your progress by any means necessary, adding a bit of dramatic tension to your academic pursuits.

I’m being intentionally vague about the specifics here because I think TR-49‘s subtle and well-crafted sci-fi world-building is best experienced by exploring the game for yourself. There’s a real satisfaction in staring at a once impenetrably obtuse research note, recalling a bit of information from a recent cross-reference, and feeling your understanding suddenly click into place. And while the vocal performances can verge on cheesy, the writing captures the monomaniacal intensity of truly obsessive academics to a tee.

One of the game’s best features is a “Notes” sub-menu, which automatically outlines relevant facts (and potential facts) about various authors, groups, and publications as you discover them. This means you don’t have to take page after page of hand-written notes to keep track of the game’s complex connections (and potential connections), as you do in games like Blue Prince or Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. It makes for a much smoother puzzle-solving experience, even if the automatic notes sometimes pick up on things you may have missed while skimming.

TR-49 also benefits from being relatively compact compared to some other narrative deduction games. A diligent investigator can reach a conclusion in four or five hours, depending on how thorough they want to be. That makes it relatively easy to keep the broad outlines of the game’s dense but parsable world in your head over a couple of evening play sessions.

There are bound to be some people who see TR-49 as akin to a homework simulator, with painful flashbacks to all-nighters spent desperately researching a last-minute college term paper. For anyone who knows the inherent appeal of diving deep into a previously unknown world, though, TR-49 is an engrossing work of world-building fiction presented in a truly memorable way.</div>

            <h2>Demand for Intel's processors is apparently there, but the supply is not</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/core-ultra-series-3-launch-may-be-hampered-by-chip-shortages-says-intel/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel reported its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2025 yesterday, and the news both for the quarter and for the year was mixed: year-over-year revenue was down nearly imperceptibly, from $53.1 billion to $52.9 billion, while revenue for the quarter was down about four percent, from $14.3 billion last year to $13.7 billion this year. (That number was, nevertheless, on the high end of Intel’s guidance for the quarter, which ranged from $12.8 to $13.8 billion.)

Diving deeper into the numbers makes it clear exactly where money is being made and lost: Intel’s data center and AI products were up 9 percent for the quarter and 5 percent for the year, while its client computing group (which sells Core processors, Arc GPUs, and other consumer products) was down 7 percent for the quarter and 3 percent for the year.

That knowledge makes it slightly easier to understand the bind that company executives talked about on Intel’s earnings call (as transcribed by Investing.com). In short, Intel is having trouble making (and buying) enough chips to meet demand, and it makes more sense to allocate the chips it can make to the divisions that are actually making money—which means that we could see shortages of or higher prices for consumer processors, just as Intel is gearing up to launch the promising Core Ultra Series 3 processors (codenamed Panther Lake).

Intel CFO David Zinsner indicated that Intel is “prioritizing [its] internal wafer supply to data center” and having more of its consumer chips made externally. Substantial portions of the Core Ultra Series 3 processors are manufactured at Intel, after the company primarily used TSMC’s chip factories for the Core Ultra Series 2 designs.

“We can’t completely vacate the client market,” said Zinsner, but Intel is “shifting as much as we can over to data center to meet the high demand.”

Compounding this is that yields for the new 18A process—that is, the number of chips in a wafer with no defects that can work as designed—are still improving. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said that “while yields are in line with our internal plans, they are still below what I want them to be.”

Yields are currently improving by 7 or 8 percent every month, according to Intel. But that could be building on pretty low initial yields—reporting from last summer suggested that just 10 percent of the chips coming off of the 18A production lines were meeting Intel’s requirements at the time. Intel predicts that its supply will have ramped up enough within the next few months to help alleviate shortages.

“I do believe that the first quarter is the trough,” said Zinsner. “We will improve supply in the second quarter.”

When Intel can start making enough chips to meet its demand, it ought to help brighten the company’s earnings reports.

“We delivered [our Q4 2025] results despite supply constraints, which meaningfully limited our ability to capture all of the strengths in our underwriting markets,” said Tan. “We are working aggressively to address this and better support our customers’ needs going forward.”

Intel has been signaling for a while now that it was selling essentially all of the chips it could get its hands on. Intel investor relations VP John Pitzer said last month that Intel would be selling more of both its Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake Core Ultra Series 2 chips for consumers, as well as its Granite Rapids chips for data centers, if it could get more of them.

As Intel seeks to improve its position in the short term, the company also says that it’s still making progress on its future manufacturing nodes, including different versions of the 18A process and the upcoming 14A process. Intel is working to engage “potential external customers” who would use the 14A process to make their own chips. If these third parties decide to use Intel’s manufacturing facilities, Intel expects to know about it “starting in the second half of this year and extending into the first half of 2027,” and then it expects to build out manufacturing capacity based on the number of external customers it finds.

On the chip design side, Intel also expects to have its first next-generation Nova Lake chips ready “at the end of 2026.” We don’t know much about Nova Lake yet, but it should be Intel’s next architecture to cover both desktop and laptop processors, while Panther Lake chips are intended mainly for laptops. At least part of the chip will also be manufactured using the 18A process.</div>

            <h2>DHS keeps trying and failing to unmask anonymous ICE critics online</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-ice-critic-wins-fight-to-stay-anonymous-as-dhs-backs-down/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has backed down from a fight to unmask the owners of Instagram and Facebook accounts monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Pennsylvania.

One of the anonymous account holders, John Doe, sued to block ICE from identifying him and other critics online through summonses to Meta that he claimed infringed on core First Amendment-protected activity.

DHS initially fought Doe’s motion to quash the summonses, arguing that the community watch groups endangered ICE agents by posting “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things.” This was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties,” DHS alleged. DHS’s arguments echoed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who has claimed that identifying ICE agents is a crime, even though Wired noted that ICE employees often post easily discoverable LinkedIn profiles.

To Doe, the agency seemed intent on testing the waters to see if it could seize authority to unmask all critics online by invoking a customs statute that allows agents to subpoena information on goods entering or leaving the US.

But then, on January 16, DHS abruptly reversed course, withdrawing its summonses from Meta.

A court filing confirmed that DHS dropped its requests for subscriber information last week, after initially demanding Doe’s “postal code, country, all email address(es) on file, date of account creation, registered telephone numbers, IP address at account signup, and logs showing IP address and date stamps for account accesses.”

The filing does not explain why DHS decided to withdraw its requests.

However, previously, DHS requested similar information from Meta about six Instagram community watch groups that shared information about ICE activity in Los Angeles and other locations. DHS withdrew those requests, too, after account holders defended their First Amendment rights and filed motions to quash their summonses, Doe’s court filing said.

To defeat DHS’ summonses, Doe shared all his group’s online posts with the court. An attorney representing Doe at the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, Ariel Shapell, told Ars that Doe’s groups posted “pretty innocuous” content, like “information and resources about immigrant rights, due process rights, fundraising, and vigils.”

It’s possible DHS caved due to lack of evidence supporting claims that Doe’s groups’ posts carried implicit threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder any federal official,” as DHS had argued. But it’s also possible that DHS keeps trying and failing to unmask ICE critics due to strong First Amendment protections working to preserve the right to post anonymously online.

The attempt to unmask Doe’s accounts came as criticism of ICE is mounting nationwide, and a win could have given ICE broad authority to attack that growing base of critics if DHS had dug in and its defense actually held.

DHS’s withdrawal of the summonses could signal that the argument the agency tried to raise—weirdly using a statute tied to the “importation/exportation of merchandise” to seize “unlimited subpoena authority” of ICE critics online—is clearly not a winning one.

Meta did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment. But Meta did play a role in challenging DHS’ summonses, initially by seeking more information from the agency and then notifying account holders to provide an opportunity to quash the summonses before information was shared.

So far, the playbook for community watch groups on Facebook and Instagram has been to follow Meta’s advice in order to block identifying information from being shared. But it remains unclear if Meta may have complied with DHS’s requests if account holders were not able to legally fight to quash them, perhaps leaving a vulnerable gray area for community watch groups.

For Doe and any others involved in “MontCo Community Watch,” DHS’s withdrawal of the summonses likely comes as a relief. But this wasn’t the first time DHS tried and failed to unmask online critics, so it’s just as likely that fears remain that DHS will continue trying to identify groups that are posting footage to raise awareness of ICE’s most controversial moves.

ICE critics have used footage of tragic events—like Renee Good’s killing and eight other ICE shootings since September—to support calls to remove ICE from embattled communities and abolish ICE.

Tensions remain high as US citizens defend both their neighbors and their own constitutional rights. Most recently, shocking footage of ICE using a 5-year-old boy as bait to trap other family members intensified calls to defund ICE. Public backlash also raged after videos showed ICE removing a US citizen from his home in his underwear. That arrest happened while ICE was conducting a warrantless search that a whistleblower warned is becoming the new ICE norm after an internal memo said that agents can enter homes without a judicial warrant.

Some politicians are starting to take up the call to diminish ICE’s power. On Thursday, the majority of House Democrats voted to defund ICE, which Politico noted was a “remarkable shift from when dozens of them voted to expand the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement authority just one year ago.” Of course, the ICE budget bill passed anyway, since Republicans control the House, but with public approval of ICE tanking, any ongoing pushback could hurt Republicans in midterms and eventually even doom ICE if momentum is sustained.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump White House yesterday posted a manipulated photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minnesota civil rights attorney who was arrested after protesting in a church where a pastor is allegedly also an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem posted what seems to be the original photo of Armstrong being led away by an officer yesterday morning. A half hour later, the official White House X account posted an altered version in which Armstrong’s face was manipulated to make it appear that she was crying.

“The White House shared an AI-edited photo of Nekima, depicting her in tears and scared when, in actuality, she was poised, determined, and unafraid,” NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said yesterday.

Reader-added context on X said, “This photo has been digitally altered to make Nekima Levy Armstrong appear to be in distress. The Director of DHS herself posted the unedited photo in an earlier announcement.” White House Deputy Communications Director Kaelan Dorr defended the post after criticism of the image manipulation.

“Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue. Thank you for your attention to this matter,” Dorr wrote. The White House post with the manipulated image called Levy Armstrong a “far-left agitator” who “orchestrated[ed] church riots in Minnesota.”

A DHS press release about the arrest used the same image posted by Noem, without the alteration.

Jordan Kushner, an attorney for Levy Armstrong, said, “It is just so outrageous that the White House would make up stories about someone to try and discredit them. She was completely calm and composed and rational. There was no one crying. So this is just outrageous defamation.”

Speaking to The Associated Press, Kushner also said that the “video Levy Armstrong’s husband shot ‘dismantles what they claim’ and that the video would be released soon.”

Protesters disrupted services on Sunday at the Cities Church in St. Paul, chanting “ICE OUT” and “Justice for Renee Good.” The St. Paul Pioneer Press quoted Levy Armstrong as saying, “When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents is almost unfathomable to me.”

The church website lists David Easterwood as one of its pastors. Protesters said this is the same David Easterwood who is listed as a defendant in a lawsuit that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison filed against Noem and other federal officials. The lawsuit lists Easterwood as a defendant “in his official capacity as Acting Director, Saint Paul Field Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”

Levy Armstrong, who is also a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch, was arrested yesterday morning. Announcing the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote, “WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP.” Bondi alleged that Levy Armstrong “played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.”

Noem said Levy Armstrong “is being charged with a federal crime under 18 USC 241,” which prohibits “conspir[ing] to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.”

“Religious freedom is the bedrock of the United States—there is no first amendment right to obstruct someone from practicing their religion,” Noem wrote.

St. Paul School Board member Chauntyll Allen was also arrested. Attorneys for the Cities Church issued statements supporting the arrests and saying they “are exploring all legal options to protect the church and prevent further invasions.”

A federal magistrate judge initially ruled that Levy Armstrong and Allen could be released, but they were still being held last night after the government “made a motion to stay the release for further review, claiming they might be flight risks,” the Pioneer Press wrote.

Kushner called the arrests a “farce” and alleged that Bondi and Noem ordered the arrests only so they could celebrate them on social media, according to the Pioneer Press. “This doesn’t happen in a legitimate prosecution,” Kushner said. “These are officials making a political decision, and purposely making a political spectacle and a political circus out of the court system for their own purposes.”

Kushner also “said federal agents detained one of Armstrong’s friends two days [previously], using force to tackle her in a hotel lobby, under the mistaken impression she was Armstrong,” the Pioneer Press wrote.

Marques Armstrong, Levy Armstrong’s husband, said she offered to turn herself in after the mistaken detention of her friend.

“Initially they agreed and then a call came from up high and said, ‘No, we have to take her there (at the hotel).’ They wanted her in handcuffs,” he was quoted as saying. An “agent took photos and said it won’t go on social media. I knew it was a lie,” he also said.

The White House’s posting of a manipulated version of the arrest photo could be used in Levy Armstrong’s legal defense. As the New York Times wrote, her lawyer could argue that the post was an improper extrajudicial statement that may prejudice potential jurors and that it shows the Justice Department filed charges vindictively. We contacted Kushner about the manipulated photo and case today and will update this article if he provides any comment.

The NAACP called for the release of Levy Armstrong, Allen, and a third arrestee, William Kelly. “Their arrests violated their constitutional rights and NAACP demands their immediate release,” the NAACP said. “Ms. Armstrong and her fellow demonstrators gathered peacefully at a church over the pastor’s alleged leadership within the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The protests follow the increase in ICE activity and the fatal shooting of Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good.”

The Justice Department also tried to bring charges against journalist Don Lemon, but a judge rejected the charges. Lemon was at the demonstration but said he was there as a journalist and not a protester.</div>

            <h2>Telly’s "free" ad-based TVs make notable revenue—when they’re actually delivered</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/tellys-free-ad-based-tvs-make-notable-revenue-when-theyre-actually-delivered/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Telly, a company that accepts advertising data instead of cash for its TVs, has reportedly had a hard time getting its “free” TVs into people’s homes.

Telly debuted in May 2023. Its dual-screen design can show ads, even when people aren’t watching. Although the smaller, secondary screen can be used for more helpful applications, like showing the weather or sports scores, its primary purpose is to serve as a billboard south of the 55-inch primary display. Owners cannot disable tracking or cover up the secondary screen (or they have to pay for the TV, which Telly claims is worth $1,000), and they must fill out a lengthy, detailed survey to get one.

When it debuted its TV, Telly said it expected to ship 500,000 devices that summer. In June 2023, the startup said 250,000 people signed up to get a Telly. In a 2024 press release, Telly said that it planned to ship “millions more in 2024.”

But a report from Lowpass this week, citing a “Q3 update sent to investors in November 2025,” said the startup had 35,000 TVs in people’s homes at that time. In Q2 2025, there were 28,000 Telly TVs in use, the note said, according to Lowpass.

The publication reported that the investor note suggests Telly will order 100,000 TVs from supplier Foxconn and increase deliveries soon.

Telly declined to comment to Lowpass and didn’t respond to Ars Technica’s requests for comment.

So what gives? Based on early registration numbers, it seems Telly has generated enough interest to ship more than 35,000 TVs.

One issue seems to be poor shipping. Per the investor note that Lowpass reviewed, Telly claimed that FedEx delivered 10 percent of its shipments of Telly TVs broken. Since moving to a different company—seemingly Samsung partner RXO, based on Reddit posts—fewer Tellys are arriving broken, the company reportedly said.

As Lowpass noted, dozens of online complaints claim that the free TVs, which ship directly from Telly, were broken upon arrival. The Verge also reported receiving a broken unit in September.

Today, the subreddit dedicated to Telly TVs seems to show numerous other technical difficulties Telly users are experiencing. Technical complaints are common on subreddits for tech gadgets, but the forum highlights the problems Telly owners might encounter.

Telly’s reported failure to meet its high shipment goals or even fulfill reported demand demonstrates the scaling complexities startups can face. While some companies struggle to get people interested in their product, Telly’s “free” pitch has been successful enough to lure thousands. But in its early stages, Telly has reportedly struggled with its direct-to-consumer model and smaller team compared to other TV makers.

Still, Telly’s ad-centric business model may be starting to show its value. The investor update reportedly said Telly made $22 million in annualized revenue in Q3 2025. This could equate to about $52 in advertising revenue per Telly in use per month ($22 million divided by 35,000 TVs divided by 12 months in a year is $52.38).

That’s notably more than what other TV companies report, as Lowpass pointed out. As a comparison to other budget TV brands that rely heavily on ads and user tracking, Roku reported an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $41.49 for 2024. Vizio, meanwhile, reported an ARPU of $37.17 in 2024.

The investor note reportedly said that Telly recently raised $350 million in debt funding over two rounds. The note didn’t specify when the funding occurred or how much equity Telly has raised overall.

As smart TVs at every price point increasingly rely on software-integrated advertisements and user tracking to offset declining hardware margins and rising competition, Telly argues that its premise is forward-thinking, not far-fetched. Some longtime Telly users point to the sets’ decent image and audio quality but question their reliance on an (included) streaming stick to access popular apps, their default AI-avatar home screen, and repetitive ads.

The Verge writer Emma Roth said her Telly showed her “three of the same ads in Spanish (which I don’t speak) in a row.” There’s also concern about potentially invasive uses of the TV’s integrated camera and mic.

As the leaked investor report highlights, there are plenty of other challenges standing in the way of free, ad-supported TVs. Still, Telly’s early ARPU figures are notable enough to keep the idea alive.</div>

            <h2>TikTok deal is done; Trump wants praise while users fear MAGA tweaks</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-finalizes-trump-deal-that-allows-bytedance-to-maintain-some-control/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The TikTok deal is done, and Donald Trump is claiming a win, although it remains unclear if the joint venture he arranged with ByteDance and the Chinese government actually resolves Congress’ national security concerns.

In a press release Thursday, TikTok announced the “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC,” an entity established to keep TikTok operating in the US.

Giving Americans majority ownership, ByteDance retains 19.9 percent of the joint venture, the release said, which has been valued at $14 billion. Three managing investors—Silver Lake, Oracle, and MGX—each hold 15 percent, while other investors, including Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell’s investment firm, Dell Family Office, hold smaller, undisclosed stakes.

Americans will also have majority control over the joint venture’s seven-member board. TikTok CEO Shou Chew holds ByteDance’s only seat. Finalizing the deal was a “great move,” Chew told TikTok employees in an internal memo, The New York Times reported.

Two former TikTok employees will lead the joint venture. Adam Presser, who previously served as TikTok’s global head of Operations and Trust & Safety, has been named CEO. And Kim Farrell, TikTok’s former global head of Business Operations Protection, will serve as chief security officer.

Trump has claimed the deal meets requirements for “qualified divestiture” to avoid a TikTok ban otherwise required under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. However, questions remain, as lawmakers have not yet analyzed the terms of the deal to determine whether that’s true.

The law requires the divestment “to end any ‘operational relationship’ between ByteDance and TikTok in the United States,” critics told the NYT. That could be a problem, since TikTok’s release makes it clear that ByteDance will maintain some control over the TikTok US app’s operations.

For example, while the US owners will retrain the algorithm and manage data security, ByteDance owns the algorithm and “will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.” The Trump administration seemingly agreed to these terms to ensure that the US TikTok isn’t cut off from the rest of the world on the app.

“Interoperability enables the Joint Venture to provide US users with a global TikTok experience, ensuring US creators can be discovered and businesses can operate on a global scale,” the release said.

Perhaps also concerning to Congress, Slate noted, while ByteDance may be a minority owner, it remains the largest individual shareholder.

Michael Sobolik, an expert on US-China policy and senior fellow at the right-leaning think tank the Hudson Institute, told the NYT that the Trump administration “may have saved TikTok, but the national security concerns are still going to continue.”

Some critics, including Republicans, have vowed to scrutinize the deal.

On Thursday, Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass.) complained that the White House had repeatedly denied requests for information about the deal. They’ve provided “virtually no details about this agreement, including whether TikTok’s algorithm is truly free of Chinese influence,” Markey said.

“This lack of transparency reeks,” Markey said. “Congress has a responsibility to investigate this deal, demand transparency, and ensure that any arrangement truly protects national security while keeping TikTok online.”

In December, Representative John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), chair of the House Select Committee on China, said that he wants to hold a hearing with TikTok leadership to discuss how the deal addresses national security concerns. On Thursday, Moolenaar said he “has two specific questions for TikTok’s new American owners,” Punchbowl News reported.

“Can we ensure that the algorithm is not influenced by the Chinese Communist Party?” Moolenaar said. “And two, can we ensure that the data of Americans is secure?”

Moolenaar may be satisfied by the terms, as the NYT suggested that China hawks in Washington appeared to trust that Trump’s arrangement is a qualified divestiture. TikTok’s release said that Oracle will protect US user data in a secure US cloud data environment that will regularly be audited by third-party cybersecurity experts. The algorithm will be licensed from ByteDance and retrained on US user data, the release said, and Vice President JD Vance has confirmed that the joint venture “will have control over how the algorithm pushes content to users.”

Last September, a spokesperson for the House China Committee told Politico that “any agreement must comply with the historic bipartisan law passed last year to protect the American people, including the complete divestment of ByteDance control and a fully decoupled algorithm.”

“I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok!” Trump said on Truth Social after the deal was finalized. “It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice.”

However, it’s unclear to TikTokers how the app might change as Trump allies take control of the addictive algorithm that drew millions to the app. Lawmakers had feared the Chinese Communist Party could influence the algorithm to target US users with propaganda, and Trump’s deal was supposed to mitigate that.

Not only do critics worry that if ByteDance maintains ownership of the algorithm, it could allow the company to continue to influence content, but there is now concern that the app’s recommendations could take a right-leaning slant under US control.

Trump has already said that he’d like to see TikTok go “100 percent MAGA,” and his allies will now be in charge of “deciding which posts to leave up and which to take down,” the NYT noted. Anupam Chander, a law and technology professor at Georgetown University, told the NYT that the TikTok deal offered Trump and his allies “more theoretical room for one side’s views to get a greater airing.”

“My worry all along is that we may have traded fears of foreign propaganda for the reality of domestic propaganda,” Chander said.

For business owners who rely on the app, there’s also the potential that the app could be glitchy after US owners start porting data and retraining the algorithm.

Trump clearly hopes the deal will endear him to TikTok users. He sought praise on Truth Social, writing, “I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.”

So far, the Chinese government has not commented on the deal’s finalization, but Trump thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping in his Truth Social post “for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal.”

“He could have gone the other way, but didn’t, and is appreciated for his decision,” Trump said.

Experts have suggested that China benefits from the deal by keeping the most lucrative part of TikTok while the world watches it export its technology to the US.

When Trump first announced the deal in September, critics immediately attacked him for letting China keep the algorithm. One US advisor close to the deal told the Financial Times that “Trump always chickens out,” noting that “after all this, China keeps the algorithm.”

On Thursday, Sobolik told Politico that Trump “got played” by Xi after taking “terrible advice from his staff” during trade negotiations that some critics said gave China the upper hand.

Trump sees things differently, writing on Truth Social that the TikTok deal came to “a very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.”

Whether the deal is “dramatic,” “final,” or “beautiful” depends on who you ask, though, as it could face legal challenges and disrupt TikTok’s beloved content feeds. The NYT suggested that the deal took so long to finalize that TikTokers don’t even care anymore, while several outlets noted that Trump’s deal is very close to the Project Texas arrangement that Joe Biden pushed until it was deemed inadequate to address national security risks.

Through Project Texas, Oracle was supposed to oversee TikTok US user data, auditing for security risks while ByteDance controlled the code. The joint venture’s “USDS” “coinage even originated from Project Texas,” Slate noted.

Lindsay Gorman, a former senior advisor in the Biden administration, told NYT that “we’ve gone round and round and ended up not too far from where we started.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk tried to pick a fight with a major airline CEO — who says thanks for all the additional business you’re bringing in with your public tantrum, sucker.

“We love these PR spats that drive bookings on Ryanair,” the budget airline’s chief Michael O’Leary said at a news conference in Dublin on Wednesday, as quoted by CNN. “And we want to thank him sincerely for the additional publicity.”

The trash talking began last week when the Irish airline, the largest in Europe, said it wouldn’t install its fleet with Starlink technology, a satellite-based internet service operated by Musk’s company SpaceX. O’Leary claimed that the Starlink antennas would add drag to the planes and drive up fuel costs.

Musk could barely hide the sting he felt from the snub. He initially responded by calling O’Leary “misinformed” and added that he doubted Ryanair “can even measure the difference in fuel use accurately.”

Smelling controversy, O’Leary went on a interview with the Irish radio station Newstalk to taunt the world’s richest man.

“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,” O’Leary said. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot. What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”

Musk, naturally, took the bait. O’Leary was no longer merely “misinformed,” but a “retarded twat who needs to be fired,” he seethed in response to the official Ryanair X account joking that wifi on planes was a scam.

Musk even threatened to buy out the airliner and posted a poll asking his fans whether he should “restore Ryan as their rightful ruler” once he does. Clearly, Grok was not consulted before putting up the poll: the “Ryan” Musk is presumably referring to is the Irish billionaire Tony Ryan, who died in 2007.

O’Leary didn’t back down. Tagging Musk’s account, the Ryanair account announced that it was launching a “Great Idiots seat sale” dedicated to “Elon and any other idiots on ‘X,&#39;” and that O’Leary would be giving a press conference “to address (undress??)” Musk’s “latest Twitshit.” (Yes, they went there.)

“The insufferable, special needs chimp currently running Ryan Air is an accountant,” he fumed in response to the announcement. “Has no idea how airplanes even fly.”

Ryanair and its CEO, not unlike Musk, are no strangers to controversy and often actively court it. Musk, though, is being thoroughly outdone at his own shtick. At the Wednesday conference, O’Leary gloated about the success of the “Big Idiot Seat Sale” and said he wasn’t bothered by Musk’s tirades.

“As anybody with teenage children would know, you’re frequently called an idiot and a twat at home,” he said, per CNN. “I don’t need to go outside to be insulted.”

He also said that while only European citizens could own European airlines, Musk was welcome to pour money into the company. “We would think it’s a very good investment, certainly a significantly better investment than the financial returns he is earning on X.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s an agonizing time for the labor market in the US, where unemployment is on the rise and wages are stagnant. Though there’s raging debate over what degree of blame AI holds for the sorry state of the job market, one thing’s for sure:workers are growing increasingly furious with the tech, which they perceive as undercutting what little job security they had.

Business leaders, as a result, are becoming anxious about the blowback — even as they rhapsodize about the coming AI revolution.

At the World Monetary Fund summit at Davos, for instance, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva launched into a talk on AI by calling it a “major factor for economic growth.”

“We see potential to up of 0.8 percent boost to growth over the next years, but it is hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it,” she fretted.

Her anxious comments come after a year of dramatic layoffs and hiring slowdowns, in which major firms have often pointed at AI. Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, for example, said in September that he’d cut 4,000 customer support jobs because he “needs less heads” thanks to automation. In October, Amazon initiated its largest round of layoffs ever, slashing 14,000 office jobs while citing AI as a major factor.

It should come as no surprise to those same business leaders that John Q. Public is growing increasingly angry over the narrative that AI is taking its jobs.

In its Global Talent Trends 2026 report flagged by CNBC, the analytics firm Mercer found that shop-floor concerns about AI-fueled job loss have surged from 28 percent in 2024 to 40 percent in 2026.

The firm’s research also found that 62 percent of employees feel their leaders underestimate the psychological and emotional impact of AI. And why shouldn’t they? Executives have spent the last year bragging about the supposed AI revolution, rhetoric they’ve used to game enough investment dollars to fundamentally alter the US economy.

Workers, in turn, shouldn’t be blamed for taking their lead — though in today’s economy, it seems they’re the only ones expected to pay the price.

            <h2>There’s Reportedly a Car Secretly Following Every Tesla Robotaxi, and the Reason Why Is So Absurd You Aren’t Going to Believe It</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Tesla launched its Robotaxi service last summer, it came with an embarrassing caveat. Sitting in the front of each of the vehicles were human “safety monitors” who stuck out like sore thumbs — contradicting CEO Elon Musk’s promises that the service would hit the road fully driverless. That the silent human employees sat in the front passenger seat, instead of the driver’s, only served to further underscore how Musk had speciously weaseled his way out being true to his word.

Now, over half a year into the service’s launch, Musk insists that Robotaxis will start giving rides in Austin, Texas “with no safety monitor in the car,” he announced on his website X on Thursday. This comes about a month after fans spotted several of the cabs driving around without any occupants, prompting Musk to confirm that fully driverless testing was underway.

But hold your horses and runaway self-driving cars, because this appears to be another bit of deception. The EV blog Electrek reports that instead of supervising from inside the vehicle, it now appears that the safety monitors are simply watching from a car that follows the Robotaxis throughout their entire trips — a Rube Goldberg-style workaround that illustrates the lengths Musk will go to keep up a charade of progress.

According to Electrek, this new operating procedure can be seen in a vlog shared by Tesla enthusiast Joe Tegtmeyer on Thursday, which shows two black Teslas conspicuously tailing the red Robotaxi. Tegtmeyer himself comments on it during the video, calling them a “chase car” that he suspects are there for “validation.”

Tesla has struggled to refine its self-driving technology, including its Robotaxi software. The driverless-but-not-quite-superviserless cabs have already gotten into numerous accidents, have been spotted ignoring speed limits and other traffic laws, on top of instances of driving dangerously or erratically. The human monitors have also been forced to make interventions to prevent a potential accident, and have even at times taken complete control of the vehicles.

Musk once said Tesla was being “paranoid” about Robotaxi safety, and the automaker is clearly caught in a tug of war in which it knows that its tech isn’t ready for primetime, but also has to show some semblance of keeping up with Musk’s promised timelines, which include claiming that the Robotaxi service would have over 1,000 cars in its fleet “within a few months” — it currently only has around 30 — and that over a million self-driving Teslas would be deployed across the US by the end of 2026.

His latest announcement only highlighted that there was “no safety monitor in the car” and made no mention of the tailing vehicles. While you can’t fault Tesla for going the safe route by still supervising its cabs, absurd as its new methods are, it’s clearly misleading its fans and investors into thinking it’s on the pathway to full autonomy. Having an extra vehicle tail every Robotaxi obviously can’t be scaled up if those promised thousands end up roaming cities across the country.

            <div id="article-text">In less than two weeks, NASA is scheduled to launch its Artemis 2 mission, the first crewed journey to the Moon in over half a century. The Space Launch Rocket has already been rolled out to the launch pad, setting the stage for a historic mission.

While the crew won’t be attempting to land on the lunar surface this time around — that milestone is reserved for Artemis 3 — it’s an extremely ambitious and highly complex mission.

And as CNN reports, some experts aren’t convinced of NASA’s reassurances that the Orion spacecraft that will carry the astronauts is safe to use.

Specifically, NASA has spent years since its successful uncrewed Artemis 1 mission studying how the extreme temperatures during reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere affect Orion’s heat shield.

The Orion capsule sustained major damage after making its return in 2022. It cracked and chipped as a result of the extreme conditions during reentry.

Over two years after the mission concluded, NASA said it had identified the root cause, with engineers determining that the “gases generated inside the heat shield’s ablative outer material called Avcoat were not able to vent and dissipate as expected.”

“This allowed pressure to build up and cracking to occur, causing some charred material to break off in several locations,” the agency wrote in a December 2024 statement.

Yet instead of making major material changes to the heat shield itself after the fact — the Artemis 2 heat shield was assembled and installed even before the Artemis 1 mission — NASA opted to adjust the Artemis 2 mission’s flight path instead, to ensure a gentler reentry.

“Based on the data, we have decided — NASA unanimously and our decision-makers — to move forward with the current Artemis II Orion capsule and heat shield, with a modified entry trajectory,” former NASA administrator Bill Nelson announced at the time.

But not everybody is convinced that the space agency has sufficiently addressed the issue ahead of its first crewed Moon mission.

“What they’re talking about doing is crazy,” former NASA astronaut and heat shield expert Charlie Camarda told CNN.

Camarda has since teamed up with several other NASA research scientists, calling on the agency to heed their warnings.

“We could have solved this problem way back when,” he told the broadcaster. “Instead, they keep kicking the can down the road.”

NASA made changes to the way it applied the special Avcoat material to the Orion capsule from a honeycomb-like structure, as applied during Apollo missions, to larger blocks in order to simplify manufacturing, testing and installing it.

The material is designed to char and erode during “skip reentry,” a maneuver that NASA uses in which the spacecraft skips over the atmosphere like a stone before diving in. However, when it dipped back in during Artemis 1, gases built up below the heat shield, causing it to crack and break off.

The space agency is adamant that its new reentry path for Artemis 2 won’t result in gases building up in a similar manner.

“We won’t go as high on that skip, it’ll just be a loft,” Artemis flight director Rick Henfling told CNN.

Still, Camarda and other former NASA astronauts and engineersare warning that there could still be danger.

“The reason this is such a big deal is that when the heat shield is spalling — or you have big chunks coming off — even if the vehicle isn’t destroyed, you’re right at the point of incipient failure now,” thermal protection materials expert and NASA veteran Dan Rasky told CNN. “It’s like you’re at the edge of the cliff on a foggy day.”

How much of a danger a cracked heat shield poses remains a subject of debate.

“Will the heat shield crack? Yes, it’s going to crack,” former NASA astronaut Danny Olivas, who worked on the heat shield investigation, told CNN.

Nonetheless, Olivas is convinced that NASA did enough. Even if it were to crack, he says, the space agency built in redundancies in the form of several layers of defense below the Avcoat layer that will keep astronauts safe.

“I think in my mind, there’s no flight that ever takes off where you don’t have a lingering doubt,” he added. “But NASA really does understand what they have. They know the importance of the heat shield to crew safety, and I do believe that they’ve done the job.”

NASA’s recently sworn-in administrator, Jared Isaacman, is equally convinced.

“We have modified our reentry profile,” he told CNN affiliate WESH last week. “We have regained margin to safety, and I feel very good about that with Artemis 2.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year saw the highest vinyl record sales since 1984, signaling a strong desire among music enthusiasts to return to a simpler time of physical media.

Even cassette tapes are making a comeback, with major artists including Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift releasing their material on the iconic plastic, four-inch audio reels.

Now, self-described “party slam” metal band Party Cannon is taking the nostalgia play — often framed as an act of defiance against greedy and AI-slop-infested streaming platforms — to a new level.

The Scottish outfit announced that its new EP, “Subjected to a Partying,” will launch on a Nintendo N64 cartridge. Inventory, however, will be limited to just 100 copies.

“We are going where no slamming death metal band has gone before — Nintendo 64,” the band wrote in a statement posted to Instagram. “That’s right, it’s time to get N or get out.”

“To celebrate Daryl ‘The Frogman’ Boyce’s first release as our new vocalist, we decided to make it something truly special, and there’s nothing more special than a console that’s lifespan ended in 2001,” the band wrote.

The band appears to have touched a nerve, selling out its US inventory of the unique cartridges in less than a day.

It’s not exactly an ideal format for a new music release. Nintendo’s 64 Game Pak can hold up to just 64 megabytes, and the earliest versions were limited to a paltry 12 megabytes. Besides, you’ll need an N64 console and a TV with the right input to play the record.

As a result of those technical limitations, Party Cannon had to get creative, limiting the cartridge release to just four songs, while the full release will feature eight, including live tracks and remixes. However, the ROMs will also feature live video of a recent festival appearance at an era-appropriate resolution of just 320 by 240 pixels.

“Load up your N64 and have an IQ-lowering blast from the past,” reads the band’s tongue-in-cheek description on their website.

The audio quality has also taken a hit, judging by the band’s colorful description.

“[Vocalist] The Frogman sounds like unfettered pressurized sewerage pouring all over these tracks, and we couldn’t be happier with how disgusting these vocals are, it’s a new era of Party Slam,” the band gloated in its announcement.

It’s not the first time the metal band has released its music on an outdated gaming system. Last year, the band released a single on the Sega Genesis cartridge, a 16-bit console that was discontinued in 1999.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, a University of Alaska, Fairbanks undergraduate student was detained by police after ripping off pieces of AI-generated art that were hung up at a student art exhibit — and chewing them up in protest.

As the school’s student newspaper The Sun Star reported, undergraduate student Graham Granger was arrested for criminal mischief after masticating at least 57 of the 160 images that had been carefully arranged by fine arts student Nick Dwyer.

The incident was an eyebrow-raising illustration of the collective exhaustion with being surrounded by the outputs of generative AI, a fierce debate that has gripped the art world. Some, like Dwyer, see it as a powerful tool for self-expression. Others, like Granger, argue it’s quite the opposite, undermining human authorship and taking away from artists who don’t use AI for their work.

Now, in an interview with The Nation, Granger, a film and performing arts major, has spoken out about what motivated him to turn his teeth into weapons against the AI onslaught.

“It’s a protest against the school’s AI policy specifically and it’s performance art because I needed something that would elicit a reaction,” he told the publication. “So this could reach more people.”

It’s unclear which policy Granger was referring to exactly. The University of Alaska’s academic misconduct policy states that “work that is created by an artificial intelligence engine is covered by the student code of conduct.”

“Work submitted for credit that was created by AI-engines can be addressed using the academic misconduct portion of the student code of conduct,” the policy reads.

However, whether arts students are allowed or encouraged to make use of the tech remains unclear.

Granger also revealed that his act wasn’t premeditated, admitting that he didn’t even “know about the exhibit before that day.”

But once he spotted Dwyer’s work, a series of AI-generated images that explore “AI psychosis” and the crafting of false memories, he was appalled at what he saw, particularly when contrasted with other, non-AI art displayed at the exhibit.

“And then I saw the AI piece and it was just — as an artist myself, it was insulting to see something of such little effort alongside all these beautiful pieces in the gallery,” Granger told The Nation. “It shouldn’t be acceptable for this ‘art,’ if you will, to be put alongside these real great pieces.”

“It’s art that takes away from its own substance by not being made by the artist himself,” he argued.

“I think artificial intelligence is a very valuable tool,” Granger said. “I think that it has no place in the arts. It takes away a lot of the human effort that makes art.”

Dwyer appears to have a very different take on the matter. His defaced exhibit was meant to explore his own struggles with “AI psychosis,” a recently-coined term used by health professionals to describe the experience of people experiencing delusional episodes after using AI tools like ChatGPT.

Before they were chewed up by Granger, the pictures depicted Dwyer and his AI chatbot, which he says he fell in love with.

The incident left a bad taste in Dwyer’s mouth — sorry — comparing it in his remarks to The Nation to slashing someone’s tires to protest the oil industry.

However, Dwyer has since decided to drop the charges against Granger, admitting that he’s been trying to rely on generative AI less.

“I’m trying to wean myself off,” he told The Nation.

            <h2>Apple iPhone just had its best year in India as the smartphone market stays broadly flat</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/apple-iphone-just-had-its-best-year-in-india-as-the-smartphone-market-stays-broadly-flat/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s iPhone is gaining ground fast in India, shipping about 14 million units in 2025, based on market data shared exclusively with TechCrunch.

Yet the country’s overall smartphone market stayed largely flat at around 152–153 million devices. That means that across the full-year of 2025, Apple’s market share of shipments rose to a record 9%. This is up from 7% in 2024, Counterpoint Research data shows, making it the iPhone’s strongest year yet in the world’s second-largest smartphone market by volume.

The gains were driven by the iPhone’s product portfolio, growing aspirational demand and wider availability across sales channels, Counterpoint Research’s director for devices and ecosystems, Tarun Pathak, said.

Apple has repeatedly pointed to India as a standout market in recent quarters, with CEO Tim Cook saying the company set an “all-time revenue record in India” on its last earnings call in October. CFO Kevan Parekh also said iPhone’s active install base hit an all-time high in India and the company set a quarterly record for upgraders, highlighting Apple’s push to expand its user base beyond just new buyers, though the company did not disclose detailed figures for India on the call.

Beyond shipments, Apple has been widening its footprint in India by ramping up local manufacturing and broadening its retail reach. Last month, the company opened its fifth Apple Store in the country — its first in Noida — as part of a broader retail expansion that began in 2023.

Apple is also sharpening its services pitch in India. Earlier this month, it introduced Apple Creator Studio — a subscription bundle of creative apps such as Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro — priced at ₹399 a month ($4.35) in India. That’s around 66% cheaper than the $12.99 a month it charges in the U.S., underscoring how the company is tailoring pricing to deepen its reach in the country.

That strong iPhone year came against a market that has largely stopped growing. India is set to log its fourth straight year at about the same shipment level of 152 million units, Counterpoint estimates, with the October–December quarter down 8–10% year-over-year despite the festive season.

Longer replacement cycles, fewer feature phone users upgrading to smartphones, and the growing popularity of refurbished devices are among the key reasons the market has struggled to grow, Pathak told TechCrunch.

Even as overall shipments stagnated, India’s premium segment continued to expand. Smartphones priced above ₹30,000 (around $327) grew 15% year-over-year in 2025 and accounted for a record 23% of total shipments — the highest share ever — according to Counterpoint.

That shift has helped brands with stronger premium portfolios, including Apple, gain ground even as the mass market slowed.

By volume, China’s Vivo led India’s smartphone market in 2025 with a 23% share of shipments, per Counterpoint, followed by Samsung at 15% and Xiaomi at 13%.

Apple remained outside India’s top three by shipments despite its record year, underlining how the market is still dominated by mass-market Android brands even as premium devices take a growing share.

Counterpoint expects India’s smartphone market to slip about 2% in 2026, warning that rising memory prices could squeeze demand in the sub-₹15,000 (under-$170) segment and force phone makers to cut cashback offers, trim specifications or raise prices. Even so, average selling prices are forecast to rise 5% in 2026 after a 9% increase in 2025, suggesting the premiumization trend is set to continue.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

            <h2>TikTok users freak out over app’s ‘immigration status’ collection — here’s what it means</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the change in TikTok ownership, TikTok users in the U.S. are collectively freaking out over the company’s updated privacy policy after being alerted to the changes through an in-app message. The revised document details the U.S. joint venture’s conditions for using its service, including the specific location information it may collect. Many users are also posting to social media about language found in the policy, which says that TikTok could collect sensitive information about its users, including their “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status.”

But despite the panic, this disclosure isn’t new — and it doesn’t mean what many users fear. The same language appeared in TikTok’s privacy policy before the ownership deal closed, and it’s primarily there to comply with state privacy laws like California’s Consumer Privacy Act, which requires companies to agree to disclose to consumers what “sensitive information” is collected. Similar disclosures appear in other social media apps’ policies.

To understand why users are concerned — and why the policy reads this way — it helps to look at both the current political climate and the legal requirements TikTok is navigating.

Specifically, the policy states that TikTok could process information from users’ content or what they may share through surveys, including information about their “racial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information.”

It’s not surprising that Americans would find this type of language troubling, especially given the current political climate.

The escalation of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has led to widespread protests across the country, which have now come to a head in Minnesota. On Friday, hundreds of businesses closed their doors in an economic blackout to protest the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the state. The move follows weeks of clashes between Minnesota residents and ICE agents, which have led to thousands of arrests and the death of American citizen Renée Good.

But the privacy policy language predates these concerns. In TikTok’s earlier policy, updated on August 19, 2024, the company explained that some of the information it collects and uses may “constitute sensitive personal information” under state privacy laws.

It then proceeded to list those same categories as examples. The legal reason is straightforward.

The policy’s specificity around types of “sensitive information” has to do with state privacy laws, like California’s California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The latter, for instance, requires businesses to inform consumers when they collect “sensitive information,” which the law defines as including things like:

Of note, citizenship and immigration status were specifically added to the category of “sensitive personal information” when California Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB-947 into law on October 8, 2023.

Because of the in-app alert timed to the deal’s closure (a requirement because of the new legal entity), many people are now reading through TikTok’s terms for the first time. Seeing this language and fearing the worst, they are posting to social media about their concerns and warning others; some are even threatening to delete their accounts.

But what TikTok’s policy is actually saying is that, as part of operating its app, it may process sensitive information — especially if it’s the subject of someone’s video — and that it’s agreeing to process that sensitive information “in accordance with applicable law.”

The policy even references the CCPA by name, as an example of the applicable laws TikTok is agreeing to.

“TikTok is required under those laws to notify users in the privacy policy that the sensitive personal information is being collected, how it is being used, and with whom it is being shared,” explains Jennifer Daniels, a partner at the law firm Blank Rome, where she provides counsel on regulatory and general corporate law matters.

Her colleague, Philip Yannella, co-chair of Blank Rome’s Privacy, Security, and Data Protection Practice, points out that TikTok likely decided to include this language in its privacy policy because of litigation concerns. For instance, he says that lately, he has seen several demands under the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) from plaintiffs’ lawyers who alleged “the collection of racial, immigration, and ethnic data.”

A similar type of disclosure to TikTok’s can be found in other social media apps, though some companies keep the explanations more high-level, while others, like TikTok, will list out the precise categories that are legally defined as “sensitive information” for additional clarity.

Still, at least one lawyer consulted by TechCrunch noted that spelling out these specific sensitive details so precisely can actually make things less clear to the end users.

As a point of comparison, Meta’s privacy policy gets fairly granular, too, though it doesn’t specifically include “immigration status” as one of its examples of sensitive information:

Users on social media often share deeply personal topics, explains Ashlee Difuntorum, an associate at Kinsella Holley Iser Kump Steinsapir (KHIKS) and a business litigator with experience representing software and technology companies.

“TikTok is essentially saying that if you disclose something sensitive, that information becomes part of the content the platform technically ‘collects,’” she tells TechCrunch. “Policies like this often look alarming because they’re written for regulators and litigators, not for ordinary consumers. That said, the wording can understandably strike users as intrusive when it’s laid out so bluntly.”

TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.

Of course, sharing content on social media sites isn’t without risk, particularly under authoritarian governments that target their own citizens. These apps collect gobs of data, and governments can enact laws to gain access to it.

Ironically, the decision to move TikTok’s U.S. operations to the U.S. under new ownership was due to this exact concern, but with China then seen as the potential threat.

Chinese laws require companies to assist with state intelligence and data security, including its 2017 National Intelligence Law and its 2021 Data Security Law. The fear among U.S. lawmakers was that TikTok’s ownership by a Chinese entity, ByteDance, could put U.S. citizens at risk, either via surveillance or subtle changes to the app’s algorithm designed to influence people or promote Chinese propaganda.

Now, people in the U.S. are more worried about their own government’s potential surveillance rather than China’s.

            <h2>Who’s behind AMI Labs, Yann LeCun’s ‘world model’ startup</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/whos-behind-ami-labs-yann-lecuns-world-model-startup/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Yann LeCun’s new venture, AMI Labs, has drawn intense attention since the AI scientist left Meta to found it. This week, the startup finally confirmed what it’s building — and several key details have been hiding in plain sight.

On its newly launched website, the startup disclosed its plans to develop “world models” in order to “build intelligent systems that understand the real world.” The focus on world models was already hinted at by AMI’s name, which stands for Advanced Machine Intelligence, but it has now officially joined the ranks of the hottest AI research startups.

Building foundational models that bridge AI and the real world has become one of the field’s most exciting pursuits, attracting top scientists and deep-pocketed investors alike — product or no product.

World Labs, a direct rival founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, became a unicorn shortly after coming out of stealth. After launching its first product, Marble, which generates physically sound 3D worlds, World Labs is now reportedly in talks to raise fresh funding at a valuation of $5 billion.

There’s little doubt that VCs would be equally eager to invest in LeCun, adding credibility to rumors that AMI Labs might be raising funding at a $3.5 billion valuation. According to Bloomberg, VCs in talks with the startup include Cathay Innovation, Greycroft, and Hiro Capital, to which LeCun is an advisor. Other potential investors reportedly include 20VC, Bpifrance, Daphni, and HV Capital.

Regardless of who writes the checks, investors may want to note an important detail: As LeCun has made clear, he is AMI’s executive chairman, not its CEO. Instead, that role belongs to Alex LeBrun, previously co-founder and CEO at Nabla, a health AI startup with offices in Paris and New York.

LeBrun’s transition from Nabla to AMI is part of a partnership announced last December by Nabla, which develops AI assistants for clinical care and to which LeCun has been an advisor. In exchange for “privileged access” to AMI’s world models, Nabla’s board supported LeBrun’s shift from CEO to chief AI scientist and chairman, clearing the way for his new role.

As AMI Labs’ CEO, LeBrun will be surrounded by familiar faces. After Facebook acquired his previous startup, Wit.ai, the serial entrepreneur and AI engineer worked under LeCun’s leadership at Meta’s AI research laboratory, FAIR. According to reports, the duo will also be joined by Laurent Solly, who stepped down as Meta’s vice president for Europe last December.

The talent overlap between AMI and Meta likely won’t stop there. LeCun told the MIT Technology Review that his former employer could well be AMI’s first client. But he has also been publicly critical of some of Meta’s strategic choices made under Mark Zuckerberg’s direction. More broadly, the Review interprets AMI Labs as a contrarian bet against large language models (LLMs).

The limitations of LLMs that LeCun has pointed out include hallucinations, which are a serious concern in contexts like medicine, as LeBrun also knows firsthand. AMI Labs’ CEO told Forbes that a big reason he took the role was the prospect of applying its world models to healthcare. But the startup will also target other high-stakes applied fields.

“AMI Labs will advance AI research and develop applications where reliability, controllability, and safety really matter, especially for industrial process control, automation, wearable devices, robotics, healthcare, and beyond,” it wrote in its mission statement. “We share one belief: real intelligence does not start in language. It starts in the world.”

Unlike generative approaches, which LeCun and his team see as poorly suited for unpredictable data such as sensor input, the startup promises that its AI systems will not only understand the real world, but also have persistent memory, the ability to reason and plan, and be controllable and safe.

The startup plans to license its technology to industry partners for real-life applications, but says it also plans to contribute to building the future of AI “with the global academic research community via open publications and open source.” LeCun said he plans to keep his professor position at NYU, where he teaches one class per year and supervises PhD and postdoctoral students.

This means that the French-born researcher will remain based in New York, but he told the MIT Technology Review that AMI Labs “is going to be a global company [that’s] headquartered in Paris.” The news was welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who expressed his pride that LeCun, who is also a Turing Prize winner, chose Paris. “We will do everything we can to ensure his success from France,” he said.

The startup will also have offices in Montreal, New York, and Singapore, but its decision to pick Paris for its headquarters will help consolidate Paris’ reputation as an AI hub, where it will join the ranks of H, Mistral AI and several international labs, including FAIR. It’s fitting, perhaps, that AMI is pronounced a-mee — like “ami” in French, which means “friend,” LeCun has pointed out.

            <h2>Waymo probed by National Transportation Safety Board over illegal school bus behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has opened an investigation into Waymo after its robotaxis have been spotted illegally passing stopped school buses numerous times in at least two states.

The NTSB is specifically focusing on the more than 20 incidents that have occurred in Austin, Texas, it said in a post on X on Friday.

“Investigators will travel to Austin to gather information on a series of incidents in which the automated vehicles failed to stop for loading or unloading students,” the NTSB said in a statement to TechCrunch. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, and the safety board will publish a more detailed final report in 12 to 24 months.

It’s the first time Waymo has been investigated by the NTSB, but it’s the second investigation launched into Waymo over its school bus problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation opened a similar probe in October.

Waymo also issued a software recall last year to address the problem. But previous software updates have not been enough to stamp it out, and in Austin, Texas — where the bulk of incidents have been captured on camera — the school district has asked the company to suspend operations during pickup and drop-off times.

The new investigation comes as Waymo is in the middle of a rapid expansion around the United States. Just this week, the company started offering a robotaxi service in Miami, adding to its operations in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.

“We safely navigate thousands of school bus encounters weekly across the United States, and the Waymo Driver is continuously improving. There have been no collisions in the events in question, and we are confident that our safety performance around school buses is superior to human drivers,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s chief safety officer, said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We see this as an opportunity to provide the NTSB with transparent insights into our safety-first approach.”

The NTSB is different from the NHTSA in that it is not a federal regulatory agency. It cannot issue fines or penalties. Rather, the safety board usually performs deep investigations to identify root causes of problems in the transportation world. When an investigation is complete, the board often holds hearings and issues non-binding recommendations.

The first notable incident where a Waymo vehicle passed a stopped school bus happened last September in Atlanta. The Waymo pulled out of a driveway and crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from the bus’ right side. The robotaxi then turned left and proceeded down the street while kids were getting off the bus.

Waymo said at the time that the vehicle was unable to see the stop sign or flashing lights, and has since said that it addressed this particular scenario with a software update.

But as Waymo patched the specific scenario it encountered in Atlanta, some of the company’s vehicles were caught passing stopped school buses in Austin, Texas. Local news outlet KXAN published videos it received from cameras mounted on school buses that showed Waymo vehicles making illegal maneuvers on multiple occasions.

“We continue to engage productively with the Austin Independent School District and applaud their reported success in reducing human-driven violations around school buses from 10,000+ a year,” Peña said.

            <h2>The Rippling/Deel corporate spying scandal may have taken another wild turn</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/the-rippling-deel-corporate-spying-scandal-may-have-taken-another-wild-turn/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Justice has reportedly opened a criminal investigation into HR and payroll startup Deel over allegations that it hired a corporate spy to leak information on its biggest rival, Rippling, reports The Wall Street Journal.

In an emailed statement to TechCrunch, Deel says that it is “not aware of any investigation. We will always cooperate with the relevant authorities and provide any necessary information in response to valid inquiries.”

Deel’s statement then makes its own allegations against Rippling. It points to its own lawsuit that alleges its rival has been on a “smear campaign,” claiming it’s beating the competitor in the market, and adding, “the truth will win in court.” Rippling declined comment.

This is arguably the biggest drama between two HR startups ever.

To recap, Rippling sued Deel in May, and revised the suit in June, alleging that its rival planted a corporate spy. The Rippling employee was caught in a sting operation and confessed to being a paid spy for Deel in an Irish court via a sworn written statement that reads like a Hollywood movie. The employee testified that he took Rippling’s sales leads, product roadmaps, customer account info, names of superstar employees, whatever was asked for, and handed it over to Deel executives.

Rippling’s suit, which is ongoing, charged its rival with violations of the federal racketeering law (known as the RICO statute and typically used against organized crime) among other laws it cited. But despite using phrases like “criminal syndicate,” this was a civil suit, not a criminal prosecution.

Deel countersuited Rippling, also alleging spying by impersonating a customer, among other claims.

The man who confessed to spying agreed to testify in Rippling’s case, and Rippling agreed to pay him for legal and travel expenses, according to the man’s cooperation agreement released as a court document and seen by TechCrunch. Deel is now calling the man Rippling’s “paid witness.”

But the man also went back to court alleging that his family was living in terror because he believed men from Deel were following him. Deel’s lawyer initially denied this but later discovered that Deel did hire surveillance.

Rippling scored the most recent win, at the end of November, when it obtained bank records. The records indicated that Deel transferred funds into an account held by the wife of Deel’s COO, and 56 seconds later that account transferred the same amount to an account held by the confessed spy.

In the meantime, another court document shows that Deel’s founder and CEO Alexandre Bouaziz, who has been called “the mastermind” of the spying plot in Rippling’s lawsuit, has hired high-powered lawyer William Frentzen to represent him. Frentzen is a partner with Morrison Foerster’s white-collar defense group and was formerly the chief of the corporate and securities fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.

Rippling’s lawyer is none other than Alex Spiro of white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel. Spiro is a former prosecutor for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office who is known for his big personality and long list of celeb clients, ranging from Elon Musk to Jay-Z.

So it’s all sounding like a plot from a John Grisham novel, with a sprinkle of the show “Suits” on top.

None of this has stopped investors from backing Deel or Rippling. In October, Deel announced it hit a $17.3 billion valuation after raising $300 million led by Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Rippling hit a $16.8 billion valuation in May after raising $450 million from investors like Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs Alternatives, and Y Combinator.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">​If you thought 2025 couldn’t get any crazier, the streaming world had one more surprise up its sleeve before the year ended.

Netflix, already the largest streaming platform with over 325 million subscribers, took a bold step by acquiring Warner Bros.’ film and television studios, as well as HBO, HBO Max, and other assets. The deal, announced in early December, will bring together some of the most legendary franchises, such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC Comics properties, among others, all under one roof.

​The scale of this megadeal has stunned industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to disrupt Hollywood as we know it.

We’re here to break down exactly what’s happening with the Netflix–WBD deal, including the latest developments, what’s at stake, and what could come next.

​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) revealed it was exploring a potential sale after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.

For years, WBD has struggled under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by declining cable viewership and fierce competition from streaming platforms. These financial pressures forced the company to consider major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.

​The bidding process quickly became competitive. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant. Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with Paramount initially viewed as the frontrunner.

But ultimately, WBD’s board determined that Netflix’s offer was the most attractive, despite Paramount offering approximately $108 billion in cash. Paramount’s bid aimed to acquire the entire company, while Netflix’s offer focused specifically on the film, television, and streaming assets.

Additionally, Netflix recently amended its agreement to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per WBD share, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. The deal is valued at approximately $82.7 billion.

Even after Netflix emerged as the preferred buyer, tensions with Paramount remained high, as the rival company continued to pursue Warner Bros.’ assets.

​Paramount persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD for several months. Still, the board repeatedly rejected its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take.

Last week, Paramount filed a lawsuit seeking more information about the Netflix deal. The company continues to assert that its offer is far superior.

Given the unprecedented scale and market impact of the deal, regulatory scrutiny is intense and remains a significant obstacle to closing the transaction. Earlier this week, it was reported that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is scheduled to testify before a U.S. Senate committee about the deal, a move that highlights just how seriously lawmakers are taking these concerns.

In November, prominent lawmakers — Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal —  voiced their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.

Should regulators block the acquisition, Netflix would be obligated to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee. It remains unclear whether Warner Bros. would remain an independent company or revisit previous acquisition proposals.

​Reactions from the entertainment industry have been largely negative. The Writers Guild of America has been among the most vocal critics, demanding that the merger be blocked on antitrust grounds.

Additionally, insiders worry that the acquisition will squeeze independent creators and diverse voices out of the spotlight, ultimately narrowing the range of stories that get told. There are also widespread concerns about potential job losses and lower wages.

For creators and theaters, uncertainty remains around release windows. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has stated that all films planned for theatrical release through Warner Bros. will continue as scheduled. However, he also hinted that, over time, release windows may be shortened, with movies coming to streaming platforms sooner than before.

​What does all this mean if you’re a Netflix or HBO Max subscriber?

Netflix executives have reassured viewers that HBO’s operations will remain largely unchanged in the near term. At this stage, the company says it’s too early to make any definitive announcements about potential bundles or app integration.

Regarding pricing, Sarandos has stated that no immediate changes will occur during the regulatory approval period. However, subscribers should be aware that Netflix has historically raised subscription prices regularly, so price increases are possible once the acquisition is finalized. Netflix tends to hike its rates every year or two.

A WBD stockholder vote is expected around April, with the deal anticipated to close 12 to 18 months after that vote. However, regulatory approvals are still pending, and scrutiny could shape the final outcome.

            <h2>Winter Ice Could Humble the United States</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/01/ice-winter-storm-danger/685737/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Open up the government’s national weather-alert map, and pretty much the entire eastern half of the country is painted one color or another. A thick pink band stretches from New Mexico, across Texas, then through Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont—a winter-storm warning. To the north, a dark-blue splotch around the Great Lakes—extreme-cold warning. And then a narrower, deep-purple band through the Southeast, from East Texas up through the Carolinas—ice-storm warning.

By Sunday, when the storm peaks, more than half of the people in the lower 48 will be experiencing some combination of snow, sleet, and freezing rain. Sixteen states and Washington, D.C., have declared states of emergency. Colder-than-usual air from Canada will drift across the eastern United States and meet up with an atmospheric river from the Pacific. The U.S. “didn’t have any hurricanes last year, but this is definitely the equivalent of a hurricane, from Texas to the Northeast,” in terms of its potential for power outages and wind damage, Ryan Maue, a meteorologist and the former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told me. Those in the band with an ice-storm warning, he said, should think of “preparing for a hurricane—except it’s ice.” Many of these regions aren’t used to getting this kind of winter weather. And as one man in North Carolina posted on X, “Ice will humble you fast.”

“Two or three inches of snow, we can handle that,” Maribel Martinez-Mejia, the director of emergency preparedness for the North Central Texas Council of Governments, told me. But, she said, more than a quarter inch of ice is a challenge; her region could see about half an inch or more. That amount can add as much as 500 pounds of weight to a power line and cause an outage. “The power grid is vulnerable to ice,” Jason Shafer, a meteorologist and the chief innovation officer at PowerOutage.us, told me. “It’s hard to winterize the system,” in part because doing so is expensive. Many places don’t have the money to spend on that project, especially if ice is a rare threat. So lines snap, and trees do too—onto the lines, sometimes. One way to avoid that is to put the lines underground, but, Shafer said, “we built everything overhead in this country.”

Even if a power line doesn’t break, ice can make it so cold that it doesn’t send out enough power, Autumn McMahon, a vice president at Oklahoma Electric Cooperative, told me—“so linemen would have to go out and literally break the ice off of the power lines.” (Much of her state is expected to experience “considerable disruptions to daily life,” according to the National Weather Service.)

But before they can fix a line, workers have to be able to get to it. Ice makes that more difficult, Tony Robinson, a former administrator of FEMA Region 6 who now works for National Emergency Management and Response, told me. Utility companies are good at restoring power relatively quickly during a storm, but “if the ice is too bad and they’re not able to get their equipment to the site”—well, that slows things down. And delayed power restoration “is obviously concerning,” the Oklahoma-based meteorologist Alan Gerard told me, “especially since many homes in this part of the country are not insulated or prepped for cold weather.” Pipes can freeze or burst, and people could be without water.

This is the type of storm that can tighten the aperture of people’s lives for a time. Thousands of flights have already been canceled. The safest way to drive on an ice-slicked road is not to drive at all. In a power outage, keeping warm can mean hunkering down in one room of the house, blanketing the windows and doors overnight, and staying put.

Then there’s the snow. Snow poses far less of a risk of power outages than ice does, but it is a hazard on roads, especially in areas that may not have snow plows. But even then, ice is a sneaky villain: States are aggressively pretreating their roads for snow and sleet, “but with freezing rain, it just washes that away, and then you’re left with an ice rink,” Rachel Riley, the director of the Southern Climate Impacts Planning Program, told me. Maue is particularly concerned about areas that get ice then snow, which can create a crust on surfaces that’s then difficult to shovel.

Whatever version of frozen water hits the ground this weekend will linger. Much of the country will remain cold into next week or even into early February. Icy piles of snow will line icy sidewalks that line plowed and salted roads. Maue has been saying that the country will be “entombed” in ice.

But some areas are just going to be quite cold, with a fresh layer of snow—a relative rarity in some of those places. That can bring unfamiliar challenges but also unfamiliar delights. Kids may have “their first real snow,” North Carolina Governor Josh Stein said at a press briefing yesterday. But much of the state, he said, will see not snow, but ice. Today, he took a more urgent tone, telling residents to be prepared to be stuck at home for a few days. “This is a serious storm,” he said. “We are taking it seriously, and so should you.”</div>

            <h2>The Rumbles Within Trump’s GOP</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/01/trump-gop-greenland-pushback/685740/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Earlier this month, Representative Blake Moore of Utah, a Republican, signed a bipartisan statement about Donald Trump’s aggressive pursuit of Greenland that, by the standards of the Trump-loving GOP, amounted to a rare and sharp rebuke of the president. “Sabre-rattling about annexing Greenland is needlessly dangerous,” Moore and Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, a Democrat, said in the statement.

The 45-year-old Moore is in just his third House term, but he’s no rank-and-file member of Congress. For the past two years, he has served as the vice chair of the Republican Conference—the same leadership perch from which Mike Johnson leapt to the House speakership after the mid-session ouster of Kevin McCarthy. Moore also happens to be, with Hoyer, the co-chair of the Congressional Friends of Denmark Caucus, and it was in that capacity that he delivered his warning to Trump. “The last thing America needs,” Moore and Hoyer said, “is a civil war among NATO that endangers our security and our way of life.”

When I spoke with him yesterday, Moore seemed relieved to see that, at least for the moment, the president’s sabers had calmed down. “I think we’ve landed in a really good spot relatively quickly,” Moore told me by phone the morning after Trump announced that he had reached “the framework of a future deal” with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Moore had yet to be briefed on the developments in Davos, but he said he was happy that the administration had backed off its threat of slapping tariffs on European allies that had opposed Trump’s Greenland endeavor.

Trump’s obsession with acquiring the territory of a long-standing NATO ally has posed yet another test for Republican leaders who have allowed him to largely ignore Congress on both foreign and domestic policy. “I have no intention of getting in the way of President Trump and his administration,” Johnson told reporters Wednesday. He was speaking about the president’s tariff authority, but he could have been referring to any number of issues on which the administration has stretched or entirely obliterated the normal bounds of executive power—including unilaterally dismantling congressionally authorized federal agencies and capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a military raid without even notifying lawmakers. Johnson might still be in lockstep with Trump, but some congressional Republicans have shown signs of wavering. GOP lawmakers joined Democrats to force a vote first on releasing the Epstein files and then on extending expiring health-insurance subsidies.

A few Republicans on Capitol Hill, such as Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, had taken a much stronger stand in opposition to Trump’s move on Greenland than their colleagues usually would have. One House Republican, Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska, had suggested that an unauthorized military attack on the island could lead to the president’s impeachment—with GOP support. (Whether Bacon’s prediction is correct is another matter.)

Perhaps it’s no coincidence that Tillis and Bacon are planning on leaving Congress at the end of this year, unlike Moore. The most recent member of the Republican leadership to openly defy Trump, former Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, lost her job as House Republican Conference chair and then her seat in relatively quick succession.

Yet Moore’s close ties to Denmark—his family has roots there dating back to the 16th century, a spokesperson told me—and his leadership post make this a tricky moment for him. “Folks don’t recognize how long-standing our ally relation with Denmark is. It’s one of our longest ever,” Moore said. During our conversation, he mixed in praise for the administration’s renewed focus on Arctic security while making clear that, unlike Trump, he does not think that the United States needs to possess Greenland. “There is already so much we can accomplish without having to purchase, acquire, own that land to achieve the outcome that we want,” Moore said.

Moore told me that Congress would need to approve any “sustained military presence” or “trillion-dollar acquisition of Greenland.” And breaking with Johnson, he said that Congress should take a more active role in tariff policy. “I believe we need to be far more involved in all trade discussions,” Moore said.

In his and Hoyer’s statement, they warn that “an attack on Greenland” would “tragically be an attack on NATO.” But when I asked Moore if he agreed with Bacon that a military incursion could lead to Trump’s impeachment, he dismissed the possibility altogether. “There was no potential of an attack on Greenland or military operation there,” he said. “It’s not even in the realm of possibility.”

So, I asked Moore, did Trump back down on Greenland, or did his heavy-handed pressure successfully force NATO to make concessions they would not otherwise have made? Despite his earlier condemnation of “sabre-rattling,” Moore adopted the more charitable view of Trump’s approach. He compared Trump’s pursuit of Greenland to the president’s aggressive first-term push for NATO countries to boost their contributions to the alliance. “President Trump’s a tough negotiator, and people know that,” Moore said. “Denmark is going to stand firm, too, and they should be able to because” they bring a lot to this table, Moore continued. He noted that “if we come to an agreement, I only think it’s going to be a net positive for everybody.”

Moore’s optimistic response struck a familiar note. His brief break with the president was more a hairline fracture than a full rupture. And it still doesn’t take much—in this case, the barest outlines of a diplomatic agreement—for Trump to bring a jittery congressional Republican back into the fold. But as global crises mount and the midterm elections near, the president is discovering that his party is not quite as sanguine as it once was.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The Sports Conspiracy That’s Too Easy to Believe

The San Francisco 49ers will not be playing in the Super Bowl, because they lost to the Seattle Seahawks by a disgraceful score of 41 to 6 over the weekend. But of course, “someone wins, someone loses” is never the whole story in sports.

Some fans are now buying into the narrative that the team had no chance because it suffered a suspicious number of devastating injuries over the course of the season (as well as in recent past seasons) … To explain this, some fans pointed to the fact that the team’s practice field and stadium are near an electrical substation and suggested that the electromagnetic waves emanating from it could be weakening players’ bodies, making them especially susceptible to soft-tissue injuries such as tendon tears and muscle strains.

Learn to handle “no.” Rejection doesn’t have to be ego-shattering—and the people most likely to push through it tend to share a specific quality, Anna Holmes writes.

Debate. The Smithsonian’s reputation as the “nation’s attic” belies its unique ability to shape the country’s narrative, Lily Meyer argues.

            <h2>‘We Are Learning to Bully Back’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-greenland-europe-denmark-nato/685735/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The meeting, by the time it convened, seemed pointless. Some joked that it could have been an email.

When European Union leaders agreed to gather yesterday, the plan was to ready their response to President Trump’s tariff threat, an outgrowth of his insistence that the United States take over the territory of one of their members. But the day before they met, Trump backed down, spectacularly. He swore off further tariffs and embraced terms for negotiations about Greenland, the Arctic territory he covets, that bear little resemblance to his maximalist demands for ownership. Instead, he accepted options that he likely could have secured months ago, without threatening war against a NATO ally.

So the European summit in Brussels was anticlimactic. The worst had already been avoided. “We began the week with a form of escalation—threats, invasion threats and tariff threats—and we have returned to a situation that seems much more acceptable,” French President Emmanuel Macron remarked as he arrived yesterday evening at the Europa building, the seat of the European Council.

The sense of relief, however, belied a new reality. After years of insults and ultimatums aimed by Trump at Europe, the fiasco arising from his far-fetched campaign to acquire Greenland has undermined America’s relationships with some of its richest and most powerful allies—perhaps permanently. One senior European diplomat told us about a “significant and probably irreversible rupture” between Europe and the United States. Another official said that European countries are continuing to compile lists of sectors in which they could create leverage and “hit the Americans if they try something like this again.” Several officials told us there was renewed talk of strengthening Europe’s nuclear arsenal, currently maintained by only France and Britain, to guarantee protection outside the U.S. umbrella. These people, like others we interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to address matters candidly.

This is the outcome of Trump’s monthslong pursuit of Greenland—distrust and a deepening dedication to European independence. The mercurial way in which the president retreated served only to harden European attitudes. His about-face was so abrupt, and so unaccounted for, that senior officials in Europe are scratching their heads about what, exactly, changed his mind. They’re speculating about criticism on Capitol Hill, caution from his military advisers, and chaos in the stock market.

In the absence of meaningful insight, many are converging on an explanation that emphasizes their own role. “We are learning to bully back,” the second European official said. “We’ve been too shy over the past years to apply counterpressure. There is a sense this stops now.”

Trump felt emboldened to pursue his territorial designs on Greenland after the successful U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, on January 3. But he didn’t wake up on January 4 and decide that he wanted to extend U.S. influence in the high north. He expressed interest in buying Greenland during his first term, in 2019. And when he returned to office last year, his aides began developing options for him, according to former U.S. officials.

Different ideas were discussed, including sending everyone in Greenland a check as a way to buy their allegiance. Officials at the National Security Council came to see the creation of a sovereign wealth fund for Greenland as a preferable alternative. Before he was dismissed as national security adviser, Michael Waltz chaired at least one White House meeting in which Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, presented various parts of the picture. The intelligence angle involved public opinion on Greenland and how its residents might be moved to vote for independence from Denmark in a referendum.

But the Trump administration had done itself no favors when its emissaries arrived in Greenland, even before his second inauguration, for a slapdash visit that sparked resentment. Officials in Copenhagen were equally put off by signals from Washington. “Greenland is today a part of the kingdom of Denmark,” the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said in February. “It is part of our territory, and it’s not for sale.” In April, she warned, “You cannot annex another country.”

By this time, European leaders had become grimly familiar with friendly fire from their American ally. In 2018, Trump tried to undermine Angela Merkel, then Germany’s chancellor, saying that “the people of Germany are turning against their leadership.” The attacks didn’t remain strictly rhetorical. He put tariffs on a wide range of EU products, most notably import duties on steel and aluminum, citing national-security concerns. Retaliatory tariffs from the European Union focused on American products, including motorcycles, bourbon, and jeans. Former U.S. officials told us that trade—Trump’s belief that Europe is getting the better of the United States—underpins his broader resentment against the continent.

The depths of that resentment became clear when he began to tease the use of military force, arguing that the United States needs Greenland for unexplained reasons of national security and insisting that Denmark can’t defend the giant swath of polar land. When our colleague Michael Scherer asked the president if the strike in Venezuela had changed his calculus about using force to take Greenland, he didn’t rule it out. Aides and allies proceeded to threaten Denmark with force, using the kind of online hyperbole that is Trump’s stock-in-trade. The White House repeatedly maintained that nothing was off the table.

Danish officials, told that they couldn’t defend Greenland, took steps to defend it.

Last week, the government in Copenhagen dispatched more soldiers and military equipment to the island. On the same day, foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland traveled to the White House. Both sides appeared dug in, but they agreed to form a working group to address the president’s concerns. Five other European Union member states, along with Britain and Norway, also sent small numbers of troops to Greenland, as part of a reconnaissance mission to plan for future deployments and signal that Arctic security was a priority.

The mobilization rattled Trump, according to European officials, who said he interpreted it as a move against the United States. He threatened to impose a 10 percent import tax on goods from the eight European countries, beginning in February. He also addressed an angry letter to Norway’s prime minister, in which he complained about not being awarded a Nobel Peace Prize and warned that peace would no longer be his sole objective.

The European Union responded swiftly, reviving plans to enact nearly €100 billion in tariffs prepared last year but suspended until February. France also pushed for an extraordinary measure that would have limited U.S. access to Europe’s internal market. Germany, the bloc’s biggest economy, signaled that it was open to the so-called trade bazooka. In diplomatic cables, member states warned that the sovereignty of the EU was at stake. There was initially fear that Italy, where senior officials had derided the move to send soldiers to Greenland, might be a holdout. But European diplomats told us that timely statements from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen underscored that the bloc would respond as a whole. They also said that simultaneous European coordination about how to respond to Trump’s invitation to his Board of Peace—a minuscule number of EU members signed up—reinforced solidarity. In a rambling speech that European officials could not believe was coming from the lips of an American president, he repeated his demand for U.S. ownership of Greenland while also seeming to acknowledge reality. “Our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland,” he said, confusing the Nordic nation for Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, another Nordic nation.

Away from the lectern, the stock-market plunge—as well as concerns about the bond market and Treasury yields—had unnerved some of the president’s top aides, a White House official and a close outside adviser told us. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chief of Staff Susie Wiles were among those who alerted the president, who was making his own round of calls to gauge Wall Street’s reaction. Trump’s aggressive use of executive power in his second term has largely gone unchecked, but his most significant other climbdown—rolling back some tariffs not long after his so-called Liberation Day—also came after a severe market reaction.

“For him, the economy is the markets, and he still begrudgingly listens,” the outside adviser, who is in regular contact with the president, told us.

The Europeans made NATO’s secretary-general, Mark Rutte, the point person to negotiate with Trump. “Rutte explained to him that he had a way out,” a European official told us. “He immediately cashed in on that.”

Trump walked back his tariff threat and declared victory. “Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,” he wrote on Truth Social. A senior U.S. official told us Rutte had mastered Trump’s dealmaking approach to diplomacy, saying the secretary-general “went big” by suggesting that he could greatly enhance the U.S. security presence. “He understands how to talk to the president,” this person said.

Virtually nothing was committed to paper, and the framework is still vague. It envisions bilateral discussions between the United States and Denmark to ensure that the U.S. military can operate adequately on Greenland, as well as broader NATO efforts to defend the high north. Possible outcomes include updating the 1951 defense agreement, erecting barriers to Chinese and Russian investments on the island, and granting U.S. access to natural resources buried deep beneath the ice. These topics will likely preoccupy the working group established last week, and they reflect objectives that Danish leaders had, for months, indicated they would endorse, if Washington would only ask. At a NATO meeting the same day, military officials discussed ways of granting U.S. sovereignty over small parts of land in Greenland to fortify its position, akin to British bases in Cyprus. But Danish leaders immediately pushed back on the idea of ceding any sovereign territory.

The White House didn’t respond to specific questions, but Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, issued a statement saying, “As President Trump has repeatedly stated, the details of the Greenland deal will be finalized and released in due time. When this deal is signed, it will achieve America’s long-held strategic goals in the Arctic Region, at very little cost, forever.”

People in Trump’s orbit were surprised that European leaders stood up to the president as forcefully as they did; the White House had been counting on the continent folding out of fear of a trade war, or of a further U.S. drawdown of support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Pentagon officials had never devoted meaningful attention to drafting plans for an invasion of Greenland, according to U.S. officials.

“I do not think there was really a military plan to take Greenland,” one of the officials told us. “I don’t think the people of Greenland needed to start filling sandbags.”

That such a scenario was ever remotely conceivable has alienated Europe in ways that Washington won’t soon be able to repair, European officials said. For the foreseeable future, these countries will continue to depend on the United States in varied ways, above all for security, defense, and intelligence. But their leaders are already pledging to accelerate their efforts to stand on their own, and to work together to counterbalance bigger powers, including not just Russia and China but also now the United States. That’s why Mark Carney, the Canadian premier, was so well received in Davos, delivering a frank acknowledgment that the international order maintained by American power was over.

Less tangibly, the disgust in Europe for Trump’s way of doing business—his swaggering, swindling, scornful style—can’t be erased. It extends even to Europe’s far-right parties, which might otherwise find common cause with Trump.

The American president gave Europeans reason for renewed outrage even after he agreed to disarmament over Greenland, disparaging the sacrifice of soldiers from NATO allies in the American-led war in Afghanistan. “They stayed a little back, a little off the front lines,” Trump said in an interview on Fox Business. About a thousand soldiers from U.S. allies were killed in combat. They tell a different story.

            <h2>The Online World Where Iranians Were Free</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/iran-protests-internet-blackout/685724/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Weeks after the uprising in Iran turned violent, no one has been able to count the dead. The state has yet to lift the internet shutdown it launched on January 8, making the information blackout the longest and most severe one that Iranians have ever experienced. More than 90 million citizens have no internet access, which has made it impossible to know the true extent of the government’s violence against protesters. The few images that have leaked out, via Starlink-satellite connections or people who have left the country, reveal a brutal crackdown that has left thousands dead. “They are killing us. It’s carnage,” a friend in Iran wrote when she finally reached me through WhatsApp on January 17. Fellow Iranians in the diaspora tell me that they have received similar messages.

This communication void has left Iranians paralyzed, in and outside Iran. For more than two decades, Iranians have used the internet, social media, and satellite-TV technology to build a vibrant public sphere beyond the strict regulatory parameters of the state. In everyday acts of posting and circulating non-state-aligned content, Iranians have normalized all that the regime forbids, including dissident poetry readings, impromptu street concerts, and images of parents mourning children killed in protests. Although the state has blocked most foreign social-media apps, platforms, and news websites; introduced more censorship and surveillance; and raised fees to access the internet, Iranians have managed to use this alternative media sphere to push the boundaries of permissible public speech. Now there are fears that even if internet services return, they will likely be under stricter state control.

Iran was an early adopter of email and the internet. The government invested in and promoted their use in the 1990s as a way to advance academic research and boost the economy after the war with Iraq. By the turn of the 21st century, ordinary Iranians were patronizing internet cafés—Tehran alone had about 1,500 by 2001—and meeting in online chat rooms. In these lively virtual spaces, they discovered they could create a freer, more secular, and more democratic world beyond the suffocating politics and economics of the Islamic Republic.

During the country’s 2009 Green Movement, Iranians used virtual spaces to help coordinate protests and consolidate their support for political reforms. Songs such as “Yar-e Dabestani-ye Man” (“My Elementary Schoolmate”) circulated on phones and blogs, conjuring visions of a gentle, united march toward political progress.

The state responded by creating the Internet Police and other intelligence units to monitor online spaces. The government had long shied away from a total internet ban in part because it seemed too economically costly, given just how many Iranian businesses rely on online communications. Despite restrictions on X, Telegram, Instagram, and other social-media apps, most Iranians know how to circumvent these measures and have been active users.

Even with the regime’s curbs on communication, egregious acts of repression have led to mass outrage, first online and then in the streets. When a young woman named Mahsa Jina Amini died in police custody in 2022 after being arrested for improper veiling, the Woman, Life, Freedom uprising erupted, in part because Iranians had spent years nurturing a collective vision online of Iran’s future—one that included a living wage, political freedom, dancing in the streets, care for the environment, and compassion for Afghan-refugee children. These wistful desires were faithfully captured in Shervin Hajipour’s song “Baraye,” which poetically described “the longing for an ordinary life,” became an instant anthem for the uprising, and went on to win a 2023 Grammy for Best Song for Social Change. The state ultimately repressed this uprising, but also loosened some of its rules. Women effectively won the battle over headscarves. Many now go without.

The pervasiveness of the alternative public sphere online eventually led the state to create its own productions and flood these spaces with state-aligned talk shows. The regime’s supporters also engage in online spaces, and social media offers the state a way to spy on its subjects and punish any influencers who become too famous or subversive.

These efforts have hardly curbed skepticism of the regime. One viral Instagram clip of an online show featured a young man with the kind of beard and suit that many associate with the regime. He observed that the Islamic Republic “no longer has its people by its side like before,” adding, “Regimes fall in minds before they fall in actuality.” Many interpreted this clip to mean that the regime was bleeding support even among loyalists. Another clip of a state-sanctioned online show circulated on social media had students debating an official who supported enforcing the hijab; one student asked, “Who gives the right to the government to interfere in the personal freedoms of the people?”

Much like social media elsewhere, the relative openness of these online Persian-language spaces has made them vulnerable to conspiracy theorists, state-backed disinformation campaigns, and foreign meddlers. For example, vocal royalists in the diaspora who went years without much support in or outside Iran now find themselves bolstered by foreign efforts to foment regime change by promoting the monarchy. Reports in late 2025 revealed an Israeli-funded online Persian-language campaign promoting Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former shah of Iran. The enormously popular satellite-TV channel Iran International, which regularly covers Pahlavi’s speeches and supporters, is reportedly funded by Saudis.

Perhaps these foreign-backed influence campaigns helped lay the groundwork for the growing call in Iran for a return to a monarchy. Extreme U.S. sanctions and the June 2025 war with Israel have further compromised the regime’s position by causing the rial to crash. But the Islamic Republic is ultimately to blame for calls for regime change, given its decades-long intransigence to demands for reform, its crackdown on dissidents, and its woeful economic mismanagement and corruption.

As the death count rises from the state’s violent response to peaceful protests, the Islamic Republic’s internet blackout has proved more insidious. In shutting down all of the online spaces where Iranians have found ways to dream, build, connect, and organize, the state has seized control over the country’s narrative and suppressed all avenues for hope—for now. Still, Iranians have spent years cultivating a reality beyond the state’s ideological strictures. If they can no longer enjoy the liberties of this virtual world, perhaps Iranians will be only more motivated to pursue these freedoms in the real one.</div>

            <h2>The Firewall Against Chinese Cars Is Cracking</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/china-electric-cars-america/685734/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two decades ago, a California company called Tesla Motors almost single-handedly created the electric vehicle as we now know it. Elon Musk’s company has dominated the industry across the globe ever since. But last year, for the first time in a long time, the world’s biggest seller of EVs wasn’t Tesla. It was the Chinese auto giant BYD.

The secret to BYD’s success is simple: The company makes high-tech electric and hybrid cars and sells them at incredible prices. The tiny BYD Seagull costs as little as $8,000 in China, and it’s a megahit in several countries. The Chinese car industry—not just BYD but also its many competitors that also make affordable cars—is quickly taking over the world. In Europe, Chinese models make up nearly 10 percent of new-car sales, in large part because they’re typically thousands of dollars cheaper than options from homegrown Volkswagen and Renault. And in Mexico, about 20 percent of new cars are made in China.

But you won’t find the Seagull or any other cheap Chinese models in the United States. The Biden administration levied steep 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs and then essentially banned them for reasons of national security. (U.S. officials have said that the cars could transmit sensitive data back to Beijing.) For its part, the Trump administration has continued to keep out Chinese imports and push American-made gas cars instead.

Recently, however, the wall around Chinese cars has started to crack. Earlier this month, in a speech at the Detroit Economic Club, President Trump expressed enthusiasm for letting Chinese automakers build their vehicles in the United States: “If they want to come in and build the plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbors, that’s great,” he said. Then, last week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his country would open the door to China’s cheap cars, slashing the tariff rate from 100 percent to just 6 percent. Canada’s car industry is deeply intertwined with America’s; those 100 percent tariffs were enacted in solidarity with Washington. If Chinese imports can gain a foothold in America’s neighbor to the north, then perhaps it is only a matter of time before they do so in the U.S. as well. “It’s the first step,” Dan Hearsch, an auto-industry analyst at the consulting firm AlixPartners, told me. “It’s an inevitability that Americans will buy Chinese cars.”

These developments don’t mean that a Xiaomi YU7 will be in millions of American driveways by the end of this year. But the road map for how Chinese cars could come to the U.S. has never been clearer. The deal to spin off TikTok, finalized just yesterday, proves that any cybersecurity concerns around Chinese EVs are surmountable if policy makers want the cars badly enough. Similar to how TikTok is now run by a U.S. entity, Chinese-designed cars could be manufactured in factories in Michigan or Ohio—even with American-made parts. And today, Reuters reported that the Trump administration has pushed out the Commerce Department official whose office spearheaded the ban on Chinese car tech. (The personnel change “should not be read that deeply into as reflective of broader Administration thinking or decision-making,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told me in an email.)

The global auto industry seems to think that the floodgates could open. At CES earlier this month, the Chinese auto giant Geely Auto previewed new SUVs and signaled that it might announce a U.S. debut in the next two or three years. (A Geely spokesperson told me in an email that the company “continues to monitor market opportunities in North America.”)

As the rest of the world gets behind the wheel of Chinese cars, it’s hard not to feel like Americans are missing out. And the upside to cheaper cars becomes harder to ignore as the average sticker price for a new car in America hovers around a staggering $50,000. Chinese EVs almost certainly wouldn’t cost $8,000 in the U.S.—especially if they’re made with American labor. But China’s advanced manufacturing techniques, or simply the companies’ desire to price these cars so they can entice buyers to try new brands, mean that they would almost certainly be cheaper than the competition. There is a long history of Americans going for foreign newcomers because they’re the cheaper and more efficient option: Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, and Kia all got their start in the U.S. that way.

Read: The backlash against car prices is here

China’s automakers don’t always hit home runs right away. Nio, a luxury brand known for its battery-swapping EVs, largely fell flat in Europe with models priced similarly to those from BMW and Mercedes-Benz. But Chinese car companies are good at figuring out what the locals want. Take BYD: The auto giant has debuted a plug-in hybrid station wagon in Europe, a boxy electric micro-car in Japan, and a rugged hybrid truck in Mexico. The cars that Geely showcased at CES, in Las Vegas, were large SUVs with big wheels, opulent interiors, and three rows of seats—not unlike a Ford Explorer. When I saw them, the first thing I thought was that they looked like cars Americans would buy.

Chinese cars built in the U.S. could be a win-win, Hearsch said: Decades ago, when Toyota and Honda came to the U.S., “they created jobs, they brought the manufacturing here, and they raised the overall level of quality through competition.” China’s automakers, he added, “may have a similar effect.” Or at least that’s the rosy view. For the American car industry, competing against China is a terrifying proposition. Not only are Chinese automakers edging out traditional car companies elsewhere in the world, such as in Europe and Latin America, but they’re also what Chinese people now prefer to buy—meaning that Western companies can’t count on the massive profits they once scored in China. Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, never misses an opportunity to warn of the threat that American automakers now face from China. “They’re really impressive companies, as I have said many times publicly,” he told me in an interview last week. Ford is now preparing some countermeasures. In August, the company announced that it would build a $30,000 electric pickup truck to try to keep up with Chinese automakers.

Efforts like that had better work out if Ford has any hopes of staying relevant. If Chinese EVs arrive here soon, U.S. automakers will have few defenses. The Trump administration spent much of last year rolling back policies meant to boost electric cars. Automakers have been all too happy to double down on what they know how to build, and build profitably: gas-powered cars. Just yesterday, General Motors announced that the revived $30,000 Chevrolet Bolt EV won’t stick around after next year, in order to free up factory space for gas-powered crossovers. Maybe Americans truly prefer gas cars—or maybe the EVs they’ve been offered have simply been too expensive or just not that great. It’s hard to imagine that Americans will want to keep buying $50,000 gas-guzzling SUVs if they have the option of buying high-tech Chinese EVs for half the price.

All of this could devastate an American auto industry that has already shrunk a lot over the decades. GM was the world’s largest private employer as late as the 1970s, but now its footprint is only a fraction of its former size. And Ford has largely thrown in the towel against Toyota and others on nearly everything but pickup trucks and SUVs. But at the rate the Chinese automakers are moving, even that might not be enough to guarantee a future.</div>

In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s useless satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

And by the way, did you know that the United States spent only $10,000 on the last land that it outright purchased? In 1944, the country bought Water Island, 500 volcanic acres in the Caribbean just south of St. Thomas; it had purchased the Virgin Islands (including St. Thomas) from Denmark a few decades earlier.

Water Island was not then owned by Denmark, but rather the Danish East Asiatic Company. By World War II, the United States wanted Water Island too, to support military operations on St. Thomas, so it scooped up the land for a bargain.

This, however, was not the last time the United States tried to purchase land, and not even that decade. Two years after the Water Island purchase, the Truman administration offered Denmark $100 million in gold to buy … Greenland.

How did you do? Come back next week for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that the vaunted Athenians, inventors of democracy, most commonly selected their political officeholders by chance? Bronze tokens representing the adult men of Athens would be slotted into a carved-stone device called the kleroterion, then dice would be repeatedly dropped into the contraption to rule out tokens until only the number required to hold office remained.

The proper poli-sci term for this is sortition, which also applies to how the United States selects people for jury duty today. But imagine the rest of U.S. democracy working like that: You’re tossing out your junk mail when you notice a letter from the feds—congrats, the big government Plinko board has decided you’re serving one year in Congress. Good luck!

And by the way, did you know that—speaking of snow monsters—the U.S. State Department in 1959 issued guidance on yeti expeditions? It informed Americans who wished to hunt for the abominable snowman that they would have to comply with certain rules set by Nepal: They needed to pay for a permit, they had to share any photographic evidence they found, and they were allowed to capture the yeti alive but could kill it only “in an emergency arising out of self defence.”

Alas, this did not mean that State officials believed in the monster. Rather, they were trying to show their support for Nepalese sovereignty—and thus keep the country out of the clutches of a boogeyman that scared Americans even more than the yeti: communism.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.</div>

Why don&#39;t the 49 other states just leave D.C. and join the Republic of California?

Because those other states are busy taking in refugees from California.

I&#39;ve heard of a fat Nazi who got rich on California&#39;s subsidies, but decided he should not pay taxes, so he chose a disease-ridden shit hole to escape to.

The WHO showed its value (or lack thereof) kowtowing HARD to Xi and China during the COVID outbreak, cheerfully parroting whatever narrative China wanted to promulgate.

This is even more ironic in the light that the US pays a grossly disproportional share of WHOs budget both in assessed and &quot;voluntary&quot; contributions - MULTIPLES of what China pays.

Sure, I think there should be a world health organization, but why should the US pay the lion&#39;s share?It&#39;s funny how at the end of the day, all these organizations

Is this in-group signalling BS such a habit that you even have to do it online? What is your specific criticism of the comment?

On the contrary, Ayn Rand can&#39;t even imagine a working economy in her fiction, let alone creating ideas that work in the real world.

The smart people took the shots. The pure blooded got sick or dead.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... [nih.gov]

They should be careful! Soon they have not only ICE and National Guard in the country, but a carrier - or two - in front of their coast!

so what happens when the federalies get pisssy that california decided to join WHO on its own? will the “states rights” zealots defend this? my guess is no, they won’t. i wonder why.

It&#39;s not so much that they care anything about WHO (other than their mandates, which somehow Gavin was immune to) but it&#39;s simply because it&#39;s a way to &quot;own Trump&quot;.

If you read the summary, you&#39;ll find they allege these fees affected everybody, not just the people that used contactless payment. You could contest this but you&#39;d find there is economic theory about &quot;who pays&quot;, even in a simple case like a tax, and serious thinkers wouldn&#39;t take your argument seriously.

If Apple is secretly pulling illegal tactics they should be held accountable for that, wouldn&#39;t you agree?

Happy now?
Well, the new owners and the Administration probably are.  Even more data in the hands of billionaire sycophants that will (probably) be enthusiastically turned over to the Feds whenever they ask.  Can&#39;t wait to see how the relationship evolves if/when there&#39;s a democrat administration.  Thankfully, I&#39;ve never had a TikTok account and never will...  And, in any case, I never put social media (or banking) apps on my phone.

TikTok Now ADMITS To Collecting Even More Data About Its Users

If you think that China wasn&#39;t previously collecting 100% of collectable data from American users of the system, you don&#39;t understand how China works.

The headline is wrong.  It should be:TikTok Now ADMITS To Collecting Even More Data About Its UsersIf you think that China wasn&#39;t previously collecting 100% of collectable data from American users of the system, you don&#39;t understand how China works.Like it matters anymore.  China could have blatantly admitted to massive data collection over and over again in the EULA you never read. Tends to make every argument about prior notification pointless and hypocritical.

>&quot;It&#39;s easy to tap &quot;agree&quot; and keep on scrolling through videos on TikTok, so users might not fully understand the extent of changes they are agreeing to with this pop-up. &quot;

99.9% are going to click on agree immediately and start scrolling.

99.9% of those who actually choose to pull up the agreement  don&#39;t understand it or what actually changed.

So maybe 0.01% of users might be giving informed agreement.

And yes, I just went through one of those on some other software- I was in the 0.1% who tried to read it,

If the Biden administration did this to a Jan 6th rioter I&#39;ll bet you&#39;d be mortified.

But you&#39;re a fascist. Fairness, truth and morality arn&#39;t things you consider important anymore.

Yeah... Goverment is corruptSo you&#39;re celebrating a protestor being arrested for protesting and then her photo being digitally altered to shame her by the goverment.

Of course the arguement &quot;Ooh goverments are all corrupt so you shouldn&#39;t take sides&quot; means nothing to you. You don&#39;t really belive that, you belive nothing. You have no values, just like most trump supporters. You argue in bad faith because there is no good faith for you anymore.

A quote from Treebeard seems appropriate here:

&quot;I am not altogether on anybodyâ(TM)s side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me...[but] there are some things, of course, whose side I am altogether not on.&quot;

You choose your politicians. If you vote for a lizard to prevent the wrong lizard getting in, then you are part of the precipitate, not the solution.

Your Government, BOTH SIDES, is corrupt, contaminated, and being repurposed to end your life as slowly, and as profitably, as possible. This outright lying about people arrested by ICE, the colluding with despots to send people to Argentina for torture, and lying to the courts about it, the co-opting of the justice department to attack us citizens who protest, the kleptocracy, hiding the Epstein files in violation of the law passed by the congress, hiding of Jack Smith&#39;s report on the classified documents case, the sending of masked troops into US cities to intimidate, harass, beat and murder US citizens. The support of Russia&#39;s invasion, the threats of invading NATO allies, the ignoring of orders of the courts.  These things are not on both sides. This is Trump and his republicans.

  These things are not on both sides. This is Trump and his republicans.There are two key strategies that many autocrats utilize to control the masses.  The first is to divide the people by demonizing a party or demographic.  The second is to claim that there are no sides, arguing that whatever evil is done by the autocrat is the same as what is done by the opposition.

What do you think ICE will start doing once they run out of people to kidnap? It&#39;s coming down to a MAGA purity test. Do you back cheeto 100%? Oh you disagree on a particular point? Uh oh here comes meal team six.

is fast becoming a meme in its own right: Dumb Shit Americans Say.

There&#39;s a lot of hyperbole (imo) about Trump and adjacent stuff.

The government running public disinformation campaigns against individual defendants ... and modifying pictures...  idk.

Too close to Soviet times https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

Dumb Republican No Brains tricked by lies again.

1. There were no fakes, cheap or otherwise, posted by the Biden administration.

2. Unless you are saying that this woman was a top-ranking official in the Biden administration, then it is not &quot;turnabout&quot;, it is orchestrated violence against someone who has not wronged you or been involved in any activity you believe (falsely, as it turns out) of having wronged you. Unless you are proposing that any time a Republican insults a Democrat governer, any innocent Republican can be arrested completely at random under a &quot;turnabout seems fair&quot; doctrine, then you don&#39;t believe turnabout is fair in the slightest.

There were no fakes, cheap or otherwise, posted by the Biden administration.Biden personally misrepresented Charlotte, Maga, Jan 6, etc. All involved bad things, but Trumps words or actions or inactions were intentionally misrepresented for political gain.
And Biden&#39;s supporter, allies, and employees, did so too. Often taking things to extremes. 

The Dems defined the new normal at a very low level. That Repubs joined them there is hardly surprising. Its turnabout.

Charlottesville, not &quot;Charlotte,&quot; dumbass, and organizer Richard Spencer throwing Sieg Heils on camera there shows that it wasn&#39;t misrepresented at all.Trump&#39;s position on Charlottesville was intentionally misrepresented by Biden and others down the line. Trump did not support the neonazis. His good people on both sides comment was about those debating whether to remove confederate statues. Transcripts show this, the misrepresentation was intentional and political. 

Regarding the statues debate, some statues just honor the dead, and the ordinary soldiers who fight wars often have totally different motivations than the political class that decides to go to

This isn&#39;t a &quot;meme&quot;.  This is an effort at public humiliation before sentencing.

One need not &quot;reflexively defend perpetrators&quot; in order to be interested in objective truth.  Blurring out an image to protect identity is one thing.  Outright altering it like this shows events that didn&#39;t happen.  It&#39;s an outright lie.

The administration is too dumb to realize that a competent judge could drop the charges over this? Like the guy who was acquitted at throwing a sandwich at ICE agents.

The administration is too dumb to realize that a competent judge could drop the charges over this?> Performative intimidation. Doesn&#39;t have to stick, adherents will have forgotten about it and the pundits won&#39;t bring up a fail.

I don&#39;t know if this will actually hurt their case in court / before a judge, but it certainly can&#39;t help - at all.

Which, ya, I know is par for the course with this administration.  It&#39;s just dumb.

I don&#39;t think they care about the eventual disposition of the case.

It is more of a &quot;you can beat the rap, but you can&#39;t beat the ride&quot; kind of a deal.  You can clearly see that punishment has already been delivered.  A warning to any who step out of line.

The administration is too dumb to realize that a competent judge could drop the charges over this? Like the guy who was acquitted at throwing a sandwich at ICE agents.The judge didn&#39;t throw that one out, though.  He should have, but the jury took care of it.

There&#39;s a lot of hyperbole (imo) about Trump and adjacent stuff.On the contrary. They&#39;re doing so much evil that the media don&#39;t have the time to get most of them to the people. 
Although possibly right now, that&#39;s intentional to move the news cycle on from the fact that they&#39;re not releasing the Epstein files, and the likely reason that Trump has raped trafficked kids.

You&#39;re supposed to pound the table, not make shit up.

Why is the don&#39;t tread on me crowd silent now? This is what you&#39;ve been warning us about all along. Masked and armed federal agents are taking people away without warrants or due process. You certainly talk a big game about your numerous firearms and readiness. Wait, what&#39;s that you say? Being tread on gives you a boner?

ICE has documentation saying they&#39;re allowed to enter homes without warrants. https://www.forbes.com/sites/a...  [forbes.com]

1. Would you like me to list the people who were taken away by the Republican junta without warrants or due process? The list is rather long and I don&#39;t know if Slashdot has the disk capacity for it.

2. Deliberate perversion of evidence for the explicit purpose of damaging a defendent is denying them due process. Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done. That is what due process is.

Honestly, what saves the world from the fascist Trump regime is the staggering stupidity and incompetence of the clowns running it.

This week, the Department of Justice forged ahead with criminal investigations into Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey—just a few days after Minnesota filed suit against Homeland Security over its surge of federal agents in and around the Twin Cities. State Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty are also being roped in and face subpoenas. The federal government is considering whether to charge Minnesota officials with conspiracy to impede federal agents’ immigration enforcement duties, but the case is clearly doomed to the same failure that met President Donald Trump’s efforts to prosecute political adversaries New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey. While those cases fell on technicalities, the investigations of the Minneapolis officials look likely to topple on more straightforward grounds: An administration that postures as fierce defenders of First Amendment rights is targeting these officials purely for their speech. While this effort is destined to fail, it still has the power to inflict long-term damage.

“The government may not take action based on the viewpoint of the speaker. Period, full stop,” former U.S. Attorney and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Harry Litman explained to Slate. Litman hosts the Talking Feds podcast, and he explained that the DOJ appears to be going after Walz and Frey through a federal statute that makes it a crime for local officials to conspire to prevent, force, intimidate, or threaten an officer who is required to perform their duties.

In order to prove Walz and Frey conspired against federal agents, the DOJ is likely going to attempt to use their public comments against them. For instance, Walz called the deployment of federal agents in Minnesota “sensationalized operations” and also put out a public statement urging people to “speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully.” Frey, during a separate press conference, made national waves when he said, “To ICE: Get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here.”

To almost anyone hearing those comments, Walz’s and Frey’s statements would not amount to a “conspiracy.” The obvious reality is that the Trump administration simply has beef with the public statements Walz and Frey have made and is trying to intimidate them and any other critics of ICE’s brutal—arguably murderous—recent tactics.

The issue for the DOJ in this case is that these statements don’t clear the bar of the federal statute it’s trying to invoke. “It has to be an agreement to use force, threat, or intimidation to impede federal officials,” Litman explained, and those threats have to produce imminent lawless action—known as the Brandenburg standard. Previous Supreme Court jurisprudence has confirmed this, with the court ruling that even speech where someone is calling for unlawful action is protected under the First Amendment, until and unless it actually results in a tangible crime. “The basic idea is that the First Amendment line is really robust and really extensive and it stops at the point, but only at the point, where some really bad shit is just about to go down because of your words,” Litman explained.

Another problematic element to the DOJ’s strategy is the fact that they have issued subpoenas to the state attorney general and the local prosecutor, both of whom have pledged to look into investigating Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good. Litman said it’s highly irregular to subpoena a prosecutor, and particularly problematic in this instance when the federal statute the DOJ is using to investigate may not hold up to scrutiny in court. On top of that, grand jury rules dictate that prosecutors cannot just hand out subpoenas in order to dig around for new information or to harass someone; they must be in pursuit of a legitimate crime.

To Litman, the bottom line is that the president is clearly using the threat of criminal prosecution to further threaten our constitutional democracy. As he told me, the message to local officials across the country who are already experiencing federal agents in their cities and to those who may be next is: “If you argue with me politically, I’ll see your ass in court—and maybe in jail.”

This week, President Donald Trump suffered a string of defeats that exposed the real limits of his power at home and abroad. First, his Justice Department abandoned its efforts to illegally appoint Lindsey Halligan, his former personal lawyer, as U.S. attorney, yielding to a furious judicial rebuke of its dirty tactics. Then the president dropped his threat to seize Greenland through military force or ruinous tariffs in the face of stiff international resistance. At almost the same time, the Supreme Court threw cold water on his bid to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, Minneapolis residents continue to protest, thwart, and document his violent assault on immigrant communities.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the vital lessons to be gleaned from these victories against the president’s abuses of power. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This story feels symbolic of the theme we wanted to talk about this week, which is that sometimes standing up to Trump really works. In November, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had illegally installed Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. attorney in Virginia and threw out her sloppy indictments of James Comey and Letitia James. But somehow Halligan refused to leave the office and kept claiming the title. When a different judge, David Novak, told her to stop, she filed this seething reply, with full backing from Pam Bondi’s DOJ, calling him a partisan hack. Tell us how he responded this week.

Mark Joseph Stern: This was one of the most incandescent judicial opinions I think I have ever seen. And, by the way, this is a Trump appointee; he’s not a flaming liberal. But Novak accused Halligan of wildly unprofessional conduct and openly breaking the law. This was a master class in dressing down the class clown. He wrote that her brief “contains a level of vitriol more appropriate for a cable news talk show and falls far beneath the level of advocacy expected from litigants in this Court, particularly the Department of Justice.”

Novak also pointed out that the chief judge of the 4th Circuit has made the ruling against Halligan’s appointment binding across the district, so Halligan was “simply flouting a judicial order because of a disagreement” by pretending to still hold the office. He wrote: “Ms. Halligan’s response asserts that she is free to act in an unlawful capacity, because she disagrees that she does so unlawfully. But that’s not how our legal system works.” And he went on: “The Eastern District of Virginia has long enjoyed the service of experienced prosecutors” who “shared an unwavering commitment to the Rule of Law, putting the interests of the citizens of the District before their own personal ambitions, as true public servants do. Unfortunately, it appears that this ethos has come to an end.”

Obviously, Novak was not backing down. He struck Halligan’s title as U.S. attorney from all relevant filings. And he said that while professional discipline—including potential disbarment—would have been appropriate, he would give Halligan “the benefit of the doubt” because of her unusual “inexperience” as a prosecutor. That was an extraordinary way to say: You are so unprofessional and inexperienced that I’m not even going to discipline you because you never had any business in this position in the first place.

The really important thing here is that, in a world in which these folks act as though they have boundless impunity to do what they want, it is incredibly important for judges to say no. It’s the cornerstone of how we think about the judicial role. That said, I have to read one more smackdown. Novak wrote: “No matter all of her machinations, Ms. Halligan has no legal basis to represent to this court that she holds the position. … This charade of Ms. Halligan masquerading as the United States Attorney for this District in direct defiance of binding court orders must come to an end.”

This is a historic dressing-down of somebody who thought they were made of Teflon. A few months ago, Halligan was asserting that she had the power to jail the president’s political foes on a pretext. And this humiliation is compounded by the fact that the chief judge of the district court posted a notice on Tuesday that the position of U.S. attorney was vacant—because even if Halligan had been appointed legally, her 120 days in the office were officially up. How did Halligan react to these slights?

She gave up, which is not what I expected. It was entirely possible that the Trump administration would attempt to reappoint her as interim U.S. attorney for another 120 days and try to fight this out till the end. Instead, it surrendered. Bondi announced on social media that Halligan would no longer seek to serve in the position. That is a victory for all the judges who stood up to this unlawful appointment. And it took me by surprise because the Justice Department’s filing earlier sounded like the opening salvo of a major battle over the limits of a president’s power to install his crony as top prosecutor. Then, when the DOJ got shot down and embarrassed and threatened with actual consequences, it just tucked in its tail and limped away.

There’s another topic I want to discuss in this same key. As late as Tuesday, America’s allies seem to be gearing up for a full-on confrontation with Trump over his deranged quest to seize Greenland. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney gave a stem-winder of a speech at Davos promising to defend Greenland’s sovereignty and bemoaning Trump’s “rupture” of the rules-based international order. Then, on Wednesday, in the face of all this, Trump just rolled over and gave up?

He conceded defeat. He said he was not going to use military force to seize Greenland, which was the threat that he had been pushing for days—tanking the markets, terrifying the allies, forcing Denmark and Greenland to prepare for possible battle with the United States. He just said: Never mind, I’m not going to do that. Then he purported to secure a deal with NATO that would give the U.S. unlimited access to Greenland, something we already have under current agreements. So he didn’t do anything at all. He imperiled the entire world order to end up with the status quo.

When Carney gave that speech, and world leaders gave him a standing ovation, I was worried. I wondered: Is this the provocation? Is this the moment we truly become a rogue nation? Are the tanks going to be rolling into Greenland? And instead, Trump gave up, just as he did with Halligan. The truth is that he’s weak. He is not the muscular president he pretends to be on television. When someone says no, and uses tools at their disposal to enforce that boundary, he stands down, because he is terrified of being defeated in a way that he can’t spin as a secret victory.

That’s particularly salient in a week when so many horrors have befallen residents of Minnesota who are standing up to genuine tyranny. It may be tempting to slide into defeatism. But your point is that Donald Trump is a cartoon strongman’s idea of a strongman, right? He’s not actually very strong. If people and institutions and businesses and government stand up to him, he crumples.

Let’s braid into that a conversation we had earlier in the week about the Supreme Court arguments over Trump’s attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve. The justices were like: What? You can’t do this. We can’t have the Fed at the mercy of a president who goes on pretextual fishing expeditions to go after people he doesn’t like. The point here seems to be: Don’t cede all this power to him. And maybe if SCOTUS would grow a spine, this could end tomorrow.

You observed on Wednesday that a lot of the justices sounded pissed. They were like: How did we get to this point? And it’s their own fault! They gave Trump so much leeway in all of these earlier cases to break the law. Then they seemed irked when he crossed the line that they had tried to draw in the sand over the Federal Reserve. They seemed to wonder: How could this happen? Well, look in the mirror. When you capitulate, you empower Trump to push further past your limits. That’s the lesson that the international community seems to have learned, and that our more courageous judges in the lower courts have learned. Let’s just hope that John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett are learning it now, because it’s one of the few things that could turn around this catastrophe.

With Trump, you’ve got to hold the line, or else you just get bowled over. That is what everyone out in the streets in Minnesota is doing right now, and we are seeing the results. The average protester blowing a whistle on the streets of the Twin Cities has shown more courage than John Roberts has in maybe his entire career.

It’s remarkable how many times Donald Trump acts like Donald Trump, and people come away dazed and stupefied, as if they haven’t witnessed the spectacle over and over before.

It happened again this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In his speech on Wednesday, our president doubled down on his odd obsession over Greenland, demanding U.S. ownership of the icy island, insisting that he needs it for national security, and telling European leaders, in the pose of a Mafia don, “You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember.”

Trump had threatened, a few days earlier, to impose 100 percent tariffs on European nations that opposed his takeover plans. It seemed, this time, he wasn’t going to back down from his own ruinous demands.

And then he backed down. Just a few hours after his speech, which was unusually hostile by even his standards, he emerged from a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, announced that they’d worked out the “framework of a future deal” on Greenland, so there’d be no need for an invasion or for any punitive tariffs. Asked about the details of this framework, Trump said, “We’ll have something in two weeks”—his usual timetable for putting off important decisions, or sometimes evading them altogether.

In other words, Trump the Godfather had once again transformed into the TACO Man—the derisive acronym for “Trump Always Chickens Out,” coined after the first couple of times he threatened tariffs, then backed off, early on in his second term as president.

But this time, the syndrome played out differently. The targets of the threat, in this case the leaders of European nations, were in the same room, watching in real time. They’d gathered earlier, to work out a unified stance, and they were energized by one of their own, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose speech, the day before Trump’s, laid out a clear path for how medium-sized countries, working together, can outmaneuver the dictates of large powers that abuse the rules they created for their own benefit. (Carney is no starry-eyed idealist, having once been the head of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada.)

In short, the Europeans did something that Trump, with some reason, thought they would never do—they held firm. They threatened to invoke the Anti-Coercion Instrument (nicknamed “the Bazooka”), which allows the European Union to counter economic pressure from third nations with tariffs and penalties of its own. The bazooka was designed as a deterrent—and it seems to have deterred. It was a major reason why Trump backed down. The financial markets’ response to Trump’s speech probably also played a role; the S&P 500 plunged 2.5 percent, some bankers worried about a run on the dollar and a sell-off of Treasury notes. (The stock market recovered its losses, and financiers’ panic abated, after the president chickened out.)

Many European leaders—and probably some of Trump’s aides too—heaved a huge sigh of relief. For all the wishful talk of “strategic autonomy,” at least by some EU members, they prefer mutually productive relations with the United States. The dollar still reigns supreme in global transactions, and a reliable U.S. military presence is crucial to Europe’s security, at least for the next decade.

Yet under Trump, relations with the U.S.—for not just the Europeans but all of America’s traditional allies—are neither productive nor reliable. And his backpedaling on Greenland, while welcome, doesn’t alter this clear reality. In fact, in some ways, it intensifies the pervasive aura of insecurity. Trump came to Davos so insistent in his belligerence, so determined to pursue U.S. interests as he saw them (however misguided he was about what those interests really were)—then, within hours, shifted 180 degrees with no explanation and only the vaguest outline of an alternative plan. How, from now on, can anyone take seriously any threat or promise Trump makes? He is still, by default, the leader of the free world and, by constitutional powers, the commander in chief of the world’s most lethal military establishment—yet how can anyone rely on anything he says?

We have been creeping, for some time now, toward this crisis (crisis is not too strong a word for what we’re facing), but the summit in Davos dramatized it. It did so in two ways. First, Trump’s speech was so hostile and his subsequent retreat was so airheaded. (No one could convincingly claim, as some have in the wake of previous reversals, that Trump was playing some wizard’s game of four-dimensional chess.) Second, and more important, the leading allies publicly talked about his behavior and found in Carney’s speech—which they greeted with (a rarity at Davos) a roused standing ovation—a way of moving out of the old order’s grip.

It’s unclear whether they’ll be able to sustain this pivot toward a “third way.” The United States still has, as Trump likes to put it, lots of “cards” to play in tit-for-tat games of leverage. Still, the landscape is changing. China is exploiting the trans-Atlantic transition (or, as Carney described it, the “rupture”), moving into markets that had previously been closed; even before his Davos speech, Carney signed a high-profile trade deal with Beijing. The EU negotiated a similar deal with South American nations, similarly designed to bypass Washington’s control. Denmark announced that it would sell its stockpile of U.S. Treasury notes, valued at $100 million, at the end of the month. This isn’t as much as it may seem; the EU holds about $10 trillion in U.S. assets. Still, it’s an unusual gesture fraught with at least symbolic significance.

Trump has responded to the growing discontent with dismissive contempt. In his Davos speech, he bellowed that, without the United States, much of the world “wouldn’t be making anything”; that without his own efforts, “you wouldn’t have NATO,” which gives us “absolutely nothing” in return; and that if America hadn’t entered World War II, “you’d all be speaking German”—a bizarrely crude thing to say in Switzerland, where the most commonly spoken official language is German.

Yes, the U.S. holds a lot of cards. But Trump doesn’t realize that the game is changing and that, under the emerging set of new rules, his cards are slowly but steadily declining in value.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

Over the past few weeks, previously unthinkable horrors have unfolded in Minnesota as federal agents working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement have shot Renee Nicole Good in the head, killing her, and arrested a 5-year-old boy just as he was arriving home from school. Erin Maye Quade is a Minnesota state senator who has now witnessed countless instances of federal agents arresting and detaining her constituents. This week, Maye Quade decided it was time to put out a blunt warning for the rest of America in the form of a TikTok video: “There may be people outside of Minnesota who are thinking: When this comes to my state, I’m white, or a U.S. citizen, or I live in a suburb or rural area, or a neighborhood with few or no immigrants, and this is something I won’t experience or see,” the senator said. “I’m here to dispel that myth for you. That is not the case.”

Maye Quade, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Apple Valley, emphasized just how ubiquitous immigration enforcement has become across rural, suburban, and urban Minnesota. ICE presence is so large it surpasses the number of local law enforcement members in the state’s 10 largest metro areas combined. These agents are not working from an organized list of known immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully, let alone a judicial warrant; instead they are operating at random. Maye Quade says she’s observed agents just driving around her town “looking for kidnappings of opportunity,” which she described as agents idling their cars and simply waiting for Black, brown, or Asian Americans to walk by, as they take out the trash, walk their dog, or run into a gas station. “They will swarm that person, kidnap them, and take them away.”

Maye Quade realized she should use what she has witnessed to warn her colleagues in other states, along with friends and family who don’t live in Minnesota. Her video has garnered more than 3 million views. “It sounds like a wartime diary,” Maye Quade said in an interview with Slate, but it wasn’t only that the senator gave a no-frills, boots-on-the-ground perspective that drew so much attention to her video. It was the fact that she simultaneously was offering advice on how to deal with federal immigration agents when they come to your town.

Two days after Maye Quade posted her TikTok, the Department of Homeland Security announced it had launched “Operation Catch of the Day” in Maine, the latest state to face an onslaught of federal agents. I asked Maye Quade what advice she would give residents there and across the country as they begin to deal with federal immigration agents.

“The first thing is to either put together your constitutional observer training now, or reach out to folks in Minnesota to get that training.”

That’s a reference to the Handbook for Constitutional Observers, a project by the advocacy groups Immigrant Defense Network and COPAL. It was created in response to Donald Trump’s second term in office and offers guidelines on how to legally observe and document law enforcement interactions and inform people about their civil rights and due process. Francisco Segovia, executive director of COPAL, explained that this training is specifically designed for folks who are not directly impacted by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, but who can still participate in helping educate people about their constitutional rights.

In Minnesota, Maye Quade explained that communities organized themselves by zones or regions, and established Signal chats to communicate about federal immigration activity. Participants were each assigned a role; some were in charge of vetting people who want to join the group, while others were assigned to commute around the community and report on any immigration enforcement activity. Local mutual aid networks were also stood up to ensure those impacted by federal agents’ immigration enforcement actions had food, medicine, rides to work and school, and safety patrols around them.

“DOPA forms—delegation of parental authority.”

This is a document that gives someone authority to take care of a child when their parents or guardians cannot, for up to one year. The designated adult can make decisions about a child’s care, custody, and medical treatment, but it does not give permission for adoption or marriage. The DOPA form does not take away a parent or guardian’s ability to make decisions for their child. Having this prepared in advance can ensure a child is taken care of in a worst-case scenario, as Maye Quade recounted instances of parents shouting out the names of their children and their school while being arrested by federal agents in hopes that someone will help them.

“Have whistles with you in your car and keep your cellphone charged.”

Maye Quade reaffirmed that it is not illegal to record a federal agent. However, if you do happen to encounter an arrest, it’s important to understand that agents don’t usually differentiate between protestors and observers. Anyone who happens to be around can be targeted, with the senator emphasizing that you should close your car vents and turn off the heat in case you are pepper-sprayed or tear-gassed. It’s also a good idea to keep water or saline spray with you, as both can help remove pepper spray from the eyes.

“Businesses should get very familiar with what their legal rights are.”

Businesses should understand when they have the legal authority to keep people off their private property and how they can enforce a code of conduct. Maye Quade also suggested businesses be prepared for an I-9 audit, when federal agents inspect whether a business has confirmed their workers’ identities and work authorizations. This process does not require a warrant, but agents have to give employers at least three days’ notice.

Here, Maye Quade also emphasized that businesses should become familiar with federal agents’ tactics. In one case, “they used a ruse of a pretend car crash in the parking lot to lure a day care worker out of her house,” she said, while in other instances federal agents have asked passersby for help outside businesses only to arrest them instead.

“The people that are being taken are like us.”

Despite the Trump administration’s insistence that federal agents are targeting “the worst of the worst,” immigrants who have committed crimes or are in the U.S. without permanent legal status, that is not what Maye Quade has witnessed in Minnesota. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and people who have been legally admitted into the country are all being targeted right now. “It’s literally just anyone who’s Black, brown, or Asian. Most of them have status and have broken no law,” she said.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/arrested-for-observing-ice-minnesota-lesson.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

As masked men dressed for war surrounded the car my friend Patty and I sat in, all I could think about were the moments that had led to my neighbor Renee Good’s death. “I’m not mad at you,” she had told her killer. These agents, who I had to assume were from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (they never identified themselves), were already banging on our windows and recording us. Then they pepper-sprayed the intake vent of the car. They were definitely mad at us.

“You’re under arrest!” the agents yelled. Terrified, I thrust my hands in the air and waited for instruction. They did not give me any—instead, they shattered our windows and pulled me out. I was roughly handcuffed and shoved into the back of an unmarked Subaru.

I was a recent volunteer to the neighborhood group that had organized to observe and report ICE after Operation Metro Surge began here in Minnesota weeks ago. The efforts had only increased since Good’s killing. In community chats, suspected ICE sightings are reported, their license plates checked against a constantly updated public spreadsheet. If they are confirmed, people in cars drive to the scene to record what the agents are doing and warn people that ICE is in the area with car horns and whistles. Recording, a legally protected action, occurs on public streets.

Most of the time, commuting (as it’s known in activist circles) is boring. You typically drive in circles around familiar streets. Volunteer dispatchers will help coordinate where people should go, but usually they just recommend sticking around areas with lots of brown people: restaurants, community centers, the kinds of places that make Minneapolis vital. Commuting has become so popular as of late that it’s common to hear a dispatcher request that listeners “please leave the call if you are not actively commuting.” Signal calls have limited space.

Occasionally, though, commuting is terrifying. “Have y’all not learned?” an agent provocatively asks a legal observer in a video that’s been circulating among volunteers, two days after Good was killed. Her response, “What’s our lesson here?,” angers him, and he tries to snatch her phone. Agents have also been known to follow commuters to their homes to intimidate them, which means “He’s following me to my house” has become another common refrain on the Signal chat. One time, I suggested that a woman on a call drive to a nearby gas station to meet me because an ICE vehicle was idling outside her home and she was audibly terrified.

I ended up in ICE custody shortly after beginning a commute on Jan. 11. Someone in our neighborhood chat had reported that ICE vehicles were pepper-spraying an observer. Patty and I, not far away, drove there. I was keenly aware of Good’s death when we arrived on the scene—it had been just four days and was a six-minute drive from where she was killed. This was the first time I had ever seen ICE agents in my life (I wasn’t joking when I said some commuter shifts are boring), and that’s when they pepper-sprayed the interior of our car and hauled us out of it. By the time the agents shoved me into that unmarked SUV, three minutes and 30 seconds had elapsed. We didn’t understand why we were being taken in: We hadn’t blocked their cars or done anything beyond routine observing.

Patty, separated from me, was subject to humiliation on her drive in. They called her ugly, took pictures of her, and referred to Renee Good as “that lesbian bitch.” They took us both to the Whipple Federal Building, a place where, the day before, three local lawmakers had been denied access. They had been trying to ascertain the conditions within. As I was being processed, shackled, and led into a cell, I wondered if I would be able to report to the outside world what it was like in there.

In a bare yellow cell, I tried to sleep, but when I closed my eyes, I could hear screaming and crying from deeper inside the facility. My requests to use the bathroom or to drink water were routinely ignored, met only after I banged on the one-way glass in my cell and begged agents directly.

I saw other detainees only when I was finally able to go to the bathroom—presumably, they were the other people that ICE was here to hunt. The looks on their faces horrified me. Through observation glass, I saw more than a dozen people crammed into a cell, seemingly lacking energy. They stared at the ground or at the wall. They didn’t talk to one another. One man pushed his face up against the one-way glass, either trying to see out or just desperate for any kind of stimulation.

Elsewhere, I saw a woman, through an observation glass, using the bathroom. She wore a garment to preserve her modesty, but that could not protect her from three leering agents who stood watching her, making small talk and laughing. She cried on the toilet.

I was lucky—after the eight hours I spent in custody, I was released with no charges. It helped that I had a lawyer, Emanual Williams, whom my family contacted as they tried to piece together what had happened to me.

After I got out, I called Williams to thank him. I asked him if it was difficult to come speak with me. Legal counsel is supposed to always be allowed in the building, even when it’s closed. He told me that things are changing at Whipple. “We’ve started to see a process that’s more dangerous towards U.S. citizens being detained, receiving charges, and being transported to federal jails,” he said.

Often, whether someone in custody gets to see their lawyer simply depends on who is working that day. “Some people at the door have said it’s not possible to see someone unless someone has retained us,” Williams said. “One time, I drove up to the guard post outside of the Whipple building, and they told me it was closed. One of the postmen—I think they were part of the police team—approached my vehicle with pepper spray.”

A video of the arrest of my cellmate, a legal resident named Dennis, shows his body being bent forward into an unmarked van as two agents try to force him in. Dennis’ face is placid. A third agent, trying to be helpful, gropes for pepper spray on his tactical vest.

“Do you want me to spray you?” he demands, thrusting it an inch from Dennis’ eye.

“Don’t spray him, don’t fucking spray him,” the agent in the front of the car scolds his partner, swatting the pepper spray away from Dennis’ face.

“I told him, ‘Go ahead,’ ” Dennis had said to me in our cell, laughing.

Patty and I weren’t the only ones detained for trying to alert people to ICE’s presence and filming agents. We’ve since met four others who had similar experiences. I was never charged with a crime; I now assume that my detention was meant to stop me from recording ICE officers.

The effort to intimidate observers continues, but they haven’t been discouraged. Minneapolis is so organized in its observer responses that increasingly, the agency has spread its activities to the surrounding area, where there aren’t as many residents mobilized, alerted to their presence, and filming them. ICE officers don’t want people to see what they’re doing, which is why it’s more important than ever to document it. My arresting agent stole my whistle. After I got out, I bought a pack of 24 more.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">exclusive The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency won&#39;t attend the annual RSA Conference in March, an agency spokesperson confirmed to The Register.

&quot;Since the beginning of this administration, CISA has made significant progress in returning to our statutory, core mission and focusing on President Trump&#39;s policies for maximum security for all Americans,&quot; CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy told us. &quot;CISA has reviewed and determined that we will not participate in the RSA Conference since we regularly review all stakeholder engagements, to ensure maximum impact and good stewardship of taxpayer dollars.&quot;

McCarthy declined to comment on whether the decision had anything to do with former CISA director Jen Easterly being named chief executive of RSAC last week.

Easterly, who was appointed to lead America&#39;s top cyber-defense agency under the Biden administration, joined her predecessor and CISA&#39;s first-ever director Chris Krebs in President Trump&#39;s line of fire back in July.

In a now-deleted LinkedIn post, the US Military Academy at West Point announced that Easterly - who graduated from West Point in 1990 - would return to the academy as a Robert F. McDermott Distinguished Chair in West Point&#39;s Department of Social Sciences, where she previously taught economics and national security.

Soon after, far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer criticized Easterly&#39;s appointment on X, and the next day, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll directed West Point to rescind Easterly&#39;s offer before she even began her new gig.

Last week, Easterly announced that she&#39;s joined RSAC as its new CEO, and almost immediately, rumors began swirling that Trump cybersecurity officials would boycott the industry&#39;s &quot;largest and most influential conference&quot; to protest Easterly&#39;s appointment.

NextGov reported that officials in the White House Office of the National Cyber Director, National Security Council, and CISA all discussed canceling their appearances at the annual conference in San Francisco.

The Register also reached out to the Office of the National Cyber Director and the National Security Council, and did not receive any response.

Federal cyber officials historically have active speaking roles at RSAC, with both Easterly and Krebs previously delivering keynotes, speaking on panels with other government network defenders, and talking to the press. In 2024, Easterly and co even wrangled nearly 70 tech providers into signing a Secure by Design pledge.

That all changed, however, last year, with the National Security Agency abruptly canceling its popular State of the Hack panel and CISA declining any press interviews or roundtable discussions.

In a last-minute addition to the 2025 agenda, however, Homeland Security boss Kristi Noem did appear on the keynote stage and said CISA had gone off the rails. She vowed to put the agency &quot;back on mission.&quot;

A year later, however, it appears that she&#39;s been sidetracked with ICE&#39;s militaristic occupation of major American cities. ®

The case, published on Ofcom&#39;s own enforcement register on Friday, centers on two statutory &quot;section 135&quot; notices issued to Meta on July 31, 2024, and June 19, 2025, under the Communications Act 2003.

Those notices required Meta to hand over data on how WhatsApp Business competes in the application-to-person messaging market – the unglamorous stuff companies use to ping customers about parcels, appointments, and login codes.

Ofcom said the information it received so far may not have been complete or accurate. In statutory requests like these, accuracy isn&#39;t a suggestion: it&#39;s a legal requirement, and failure to comply can trigger enforcement action under section 138 of the Act.

&quot;The information gathered through statutory information requests is a key part of Ofcom&#39;s work and informs how it carries out its statutory functions as a regulator,&quot; the watchdog said. &quot;It is therefore crucial that stakeholders provide accurate and complete information in a timely fashion.&quot;

Ofcom declined to say what details provided by Meta may have been questionable when asked by The Register.

In a statement to The Register, Meta said: &quot;We take regulatory obligations seriously and devote significant resources to responding to requests for information in a timely and accurate manner. We will cooperate with Ofcom in its investigation.&quot;

The probe adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches for Meta in the UK and Europe – from child protection age-checks to gambling ad scrutiny – as competition authorities globally tighten oversight of Big Tech.

Ofcom will publish further updates on its enforcement page as the inquiry develops. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You&#39;ve got to keep your software updated. Some unknown miscreants are exploiting a critical VMware vCenter Server bug more than a year after Broadcom patched the flaw.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-37079, is an out-of-bounds write flaw in vCenter Server&#39;s implementation of the DCERPC protocol that earned a 9.8 out of 10 CVSS rating. In other words: it&#39;s almost as bad as it gets.

DCERPC, which stands for Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls, allows software to invoke procedures and services on a remote system across a network. This bug can be abused by someone with network access to vCenter Server to send specially crafted network packets, potentially leading to remote code execution, and on Friday, both the vendor and the feds warned that this - or something along these lines - is happening.

&quot;Broadcom has information to suggest that exploitation of CVE-2024-37079 has occurred in the wild,&quot; the vendor warned in an update to its June 18, 2024 security advisory.

Also on Friday, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added this critical security hole to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog. This means federal agencies must patch the flaw by February 13 - again, we must note that Broadcom issued a software update that fixes this CVE more than a year and a half ago, and June 2024 would have been the optimal time to deploy the patch.

CISA&#39;s KEV lists the bug&#39;s use in ransomware campaigns as &quot;unknown,&quot; and Broadcom didn&#39;t provide any details about the scope of exploitation, or respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries about CVE-2024-37079&#39;s abuse. We&#39;ll update this story as we learn more about who is abusing this flaw, and what they are doing with the illicit access to enterprises&#39; vCenter Servers.

VulnCheck VP of security research Caitlin Condon told The Register that virtualization infrastructure - including Broadcom&#39;s vCenter Server - is a favorite target for both government-backed hackers and financially motivated cybercriminals.

&quot;As an example, CVE-2023-34048, a prior vulnerability in vCenter Server&#39;s DCERPC protocol, was exploited by at least three known China-nexus threat actors (Fire Ant, Warp Panda, and UNC3886),&quot; Condon said.

Condon said she&#39;s not surprised to see the bug being exploited by attackers considering details about the vulnerability have been public for more than a year.

&quot;It&#39;s common to see threat actors - including state-sponsored groups - opportunistically leveraging even older public vulnerability information to conduct new attacks, so it&#39;s not terribly surprising that the vulnerability has seen exploitation in the wild,&quot; she said.

&quot;While there are no immediate details on threat actor attribution or attacker behavior, vCenter Server should never, ever be exposed to the public internet, so it&#39;s likely the adversary already had a foothold in the victim environment,&quot; Condon added. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">updated If you think using Microsoft&#39;s BitLocker encryption will keep your data 100 percent safe, think again. Last year, Redmond reportedly provided the FBI with encryption keys to unlock the laptops of Windows users charged in a fraud indictment.

The government case [PDF], which claims defendants in Guam fraudulently collected pandemic unemployment benefits, represents the first publicly known instance of Microsoft providing BitLocker keys, according to Forbes.

BitLocker is a Windows security system that can encrypt data on storage devices. It supports two modes: Device Encryption, a mode designed to simplify security, and BitLocker Drive Encryption, an advanced mode.

For either mode, Microsoft &quot;typically&quot; backs up BitLocker keys to its servers when the service gets set up from an active Microsoft account. &quot;If you use a Microsoft account, the BitLocker recovery key is typically attached to it, and you can access the recovery key online,&quot; the company explains in its documentation.

The situation is similar for managed devices. &quot;If you&#39;re using a device that&#39;s managed by your work or school, the BitLocker recovery key is typically backed up and managed by your organization&#39;s IT department,&quot; the company says.

Microsoft provides the option to store keys elsewhere. Instead of selecting &quot;Save to your Microsoft Account,&quot; customers can &quot;Save to a USB flash drive,&quot; &quot;Save to a file,&quot; or &quot;Print the recovery key.&quot;

But customers are encouraged to entrust keys to Microsoft because as long as they have access to the account online, they can recover the keys, effectively making Redmond their digital doorman. However, in such circumstances, customers no longer have total control over access to their data.

Apple offers a similar device encryption service called FileVault, complemented by its iCloud service. The iCloud service also offers an easy mode called &quot;Standard data protection&quot; and &quot;Advanced Data Protection for iCloud.&quot;

With Standard data protection, Apple holds the encryption keys for iCloud data, with some exceptions (e.g. Passwords and Keychain). With Advanced Data Protection, the company has the keys only to iCloud Mail, Contacts, and Calendar.

Both Apple and Microsoft, like other companies, comply with government information demands they determine to be lawful. But they can&#39;t provide keys they don&#39;t control.

Apple says as much in its guidelines [PDF] for law enforcement: &quot;All iCloud content data stored by Apple is additionally encrypted at the location of the server. For data Apple can decrypt, Apple retains the encryption keys in its US data centers. Apple does not receive or retain encryption keys for [a] customer&#39;s end-to-end encrypted data.&quot;

That&#39;s not the case with BitLocker, where Microsoft may have access to encryption keys for a customer&#39;s end-to-end encrypted data if the customer allowed that during setup.

Microsoft explains that it does not provide governments with its own encryption keys. But it does not make that commitment with regard to its customers.

&quot;We do not provide any government with our encryption keys or the ability to break our encryption,&quot; the company says in its law enforcement guidance. &quot;In most cases, our default is for Microsoft to securely store our customers&#39; encryption keys. Even our largest enterprise customers usually prefer we keep their keys to prevent accidental loss or theft. However, in many circumstances we also offer the option for consumers or enterprises to keep their own keys, in which case Microsoft does not maintain copies.&quot;

It&#39;s a clear message to activist organizations and law firms that Microsoft is not building their products for you.

According to Microsoft&#39;s most recent Government Requests for Customer Data Report, covering July 2024 through December 2024, the company received a total of 128 requests from law enforcement organizations around the world, 77 of which came from US authorities. Only four of the requests during that period, three in Brazil and one in Canada, led to the disclosure of content.

After this story was filed a Microsoft spokesperson said, “With BitLocker, customers can choose to store their encryption keys locally, in a location inaccessible to Microsoft, or in Microsoft’s cloud. We recognize that some customers prefer Microsoft’s cloud storage so we can help recover their encryption key if needed. While key recovery offers convenience, it also carries a risk of unwanted access, so Microsoft believes customers are in the best position to decide whether to use key escrow and how to manage their keys.”

&quot;Microsoft is making a tradeoff here between privacy and recoverability,&quot; said Erica Portnoy, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an email to The Register. &quot;At a guess, I&#39;d say that&#39;s because they&#39;re more focused on the business use case, where loss of data is much worse than Microsoft or governments getting access to that data. But by making that choice, they make their product less suitable for individuals and organizations with higher privacy needs. It&#39;s a clear message to activist organizations and law firms that Microsoft is not building their products for you.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for an Okta voice-phishing campaign during which the extortionist crew allegedly gained access to Crunchbase and Betterment.

On Friday, the criminals leaked data allegedly stolen from market-intel broker Crunchbase, streaming platform SoundCloud, and financial-tech firm Betterment, and confirmed to The Register that they gained access to two of the three - Crunchbase and Betterment - by voice-phishing Okta single-sign-on codes.

SoundCloud in December confirmed it had been breached and the crooks accessed data belonging to about 20 percent of its users, which translates to about 28 million people, based on the company&#39;s publicly available customer count.

When asked about ShinyHunters&#39; claims, a SoundCloud spokesperson told us that the streaming platform is &quot;aware that a threat actor group has published data online allegedly taken from our organization,&quot; and directed users to a January 13 blog update for more information. &quot;Please know that our security team - supported by leading third-party cybersecurity experts - is actively reviewing the claim and published data,&quot; the spokesperson said.

ShinyHunters wouldn&#39;t say how they accessed SoundCloud&#39;s data, but added that it wasn&#39;t through the streaming platform&#39;s Okta credentials. They also claimed to have broken into &quot;a lot more&quot; companies in the Okta campaign than the two they leaked on Friday, but declined to say how many more or name any of the alleged victims.

According to the group&#39;s Friday blog post, the Betterment and Crunchbase data dumps contain more than 20 million and 2 million records respectively, while the SoundCloud leak totals more than 30 million records, all with personally identifiable information (PII).

Neither Crunchbase nor Betterment immediately responded to The Register&#39;s inquiries. We will update this story if we hear back from either company.

Hudson Rock co-founder and CTO Alon Gal said on LinkedIn that he had downloaded the Crunchbase files and that they contained PII, signed contracts, and other corporate data.

On Thursday, Okta Threat Intelligence warned customers about criminals using voice-phishing kits and campaigns to target victim organizations&#39; Google, Microsoft, and Okta accounts. A spokesperson for the identity services provider on Friday declined to share any additional information about the campaign or ShinyHunters&#39; claims.

&quot;At this time, we have no indication that Google itself or its products are affected by this campaign,&quot; a Google spokesperson told The Register.

The Register also reached out to Microsoft, asking if they or their customers&#39; data had been stolen in similar social-engineering scams, and will update this story if we receive any responses.

Last year, this same crime crew stole data belonging to hundreds of Salesforce customers in a rash of similar attacks. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hands On Uniontech&#39;s Deepin 25.0.10 release shows that the Chinese desktop world isn&#39;t waiting on Western tech. It&#39;s modern and good-looking, and (pausing only to sigh deeply) has built-in &quot;AI&quot;.

Deepin 25.0.10 is the latest point release of Uniontech&#39;s free community desktop, following the debut of Deepin 25 in June 2025.

The original release of Deepin 25 followed about 10 months after we looked at Deepin 23 in August 2024, but the distro does not look and feel radically different from the previous version. It has the same Deepin Desktop Environment as before: the Deepin 25 announcement mentions it being DDE 7, but we couldn&#39;t immediately see much difference from before: the Settings program has been reorganized and the file manager revamped, but it&#39;s not radical.

Deepin 25 doesn&#39;t look much different: no Wayland or anything here. Under the hood, though, things are changing. - Click to enlarge

Deepin has a new Wayland compositor called Treeland in development, which uses the Qt toolkit as used in KDE and LXQt – but for now, this is merely a tech preview: the current release still uses X11.

The desktop layout resembles Windows 11, with the main app launchers centered, leaving the leftmost position for a launcher for Uniontech&#39;s LLM bot, &quot;UOS AI&quot;. We opened it, agreed that we were over 18 and that we understood that the English-language experience might not be perfect, and after a few moments, we were left with a box to type in our query.

We asked it &quot;what Linux distribution is Deepin 25 based on?&quot; The result was reams of text, in which the model repeatedly stated that its training data was from 2023 and it couldn&#39;t access the web. It repeated that older versions of Deepin were based on Debian, but that it could not speculate about versions unannounced at the time of its training data. On the first boot, a welcome video shows off some of the LLM-powered features for Chinese language users, such as automatic document and text-snippet translation, explanations, summaries, and local file search.

We remain unconvinced that this tech is going to change the world any time soon, but for those who want it, it&#39;s there, built-in, and fairly well-integrated. This is an important part of the sales pitch in 2026, we fear – even in China.

Deepin 25 has a partially-immutable OS layout, which the company calls Solid, which is based on OSTree tooling. It protects some system directories, so even for the root user, we found /bin, /lib, /lib64, /sbin and /usr were read-only. It doesn&#39;t seem to do whole-system snapshots, though, and there are commands to disable and re-enable immutability – functions we last saw in openSUSE back in 2024, and a very different approach to Red Hat&#39;s whole-OS approach.

This version also includes Uniontech&#39;s cross-platform packaging system Linglong. The command ll-cli list showed some 20 installed Linyaps packages, including the email client, calculator and so on.

It&#39;s notable that English is a little less visible in this release. The initial bootup screen is in Chinese, and only the word English is actually in English. There are various US English keyboard settings available, but no UK English – only a region, so at least dates aren&#39;t in confusing middle-least-most significance order. (Coercing everyone into what this vulture still thinks of as Xkcd order would be fine with us: that&#39;s the order that they&#39;re written in Chinese, but delimiters are the actual words for &quot;year&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, and &quot;day&quot;.)

Deepin strikes us as a relatively simple and pragmatic distribution. There&#39;s no choice of desktops: it has its own, Windows-like offering – no GNOME versus KDE battle here. It doesn&#39;t engage with the Flatpak versus Snap debate; it has its own Linyaps format. It freely uses bits of Debian and Red Hat tech, but avoids being totally locked down like most Western immutable distros.

It&#39;s Sinocentric but supports some other languages and character sets, international search engines, and so on. It&#39;s not especially lightweight, but it takes a modest enough 6.7 GB of disk and a gig of RAM. It is a little fussy about hardware: we had problems with both VMware Workstation and on the metal on our testbed ThinkPad T420, although the live medium ran very smoothly on a newer Dell XPS 13.

Deepin 25&#39;s Settings app has been simplified and reorganized, as has the file manager. - Click to enlarge

It&#39;s not profoundly technologically radical, but Deepin does the job while looking fresh and modern and attractive. If this is a showcase of the state of the art of Chinese domestic desktop Linux, it really is not bad at all. China has taken FOSS tech developed in the West and used it to create its own OSes with its own desktops and its own tools and apps – which run on its own processors, too.

As we noted last August, tech like this doesn&#39;t have to be world-beating: it merely has to be good enough that China can rely on its own software running on its own hardware for it to risk invading Taiwan, even if that means destroying the Taiwanese chip-making industry on which Western tech relies.

If you want to take a look for yourself, the downloads page offers editions for AMD64, ARM64, and Loong64, plus a preview version for RISC-V. Its system requirements on x86-64 are modest enough: 8 GB of RAM, a big screen (1920×1080 or higher recommended), and at least 64 GB of disk space. ®

An internal presentation says nabbing users early ‘leads to brand trust and loyalty over their lifetime.’

Internal documents revealed as part of a child safety lawsuit hint at Google’s plan to “onboard kids” into its ecosystem by investing in schools. In this November 2020 presentation, Google writes that getting kids into its ecosystem “leads to brand trust and loyalty over their lifetime,” as reported earlier by NBC News.

The heavily-redacted documents, which surfaced earlier this week, are linked to a massive lawsuit filed by several school districts, families, and state attorneys general, accusing Google, Meta, ByteDance, and Snap of creating “addictive and dangerous” products that have harmed young users’ mental health. (Snap settled earlier this week).

Google has spent over a decade investing in products built for education, while establishing Chromebooks as a classroom staple. The 2020 document also includes a study on how the laptop brands used in schools have an “influence on purchase patterns.”

Another slide in the presentation highlights a 2017 story from The New York Times, bolding a quote that says Google is part of a battle to “hook students as future customers.” This quote appears multiple times in the presentation: “If you get someone on your operating system early, then you get that loyalty early, and potentially for life.” The document also suggests that YouTube in schools could create a “pipeline of future users” and creators.

At the same time, other slides discuss some of the challenges associated with bringing YouTube to schools, including how the platform is “often blocked” and how “efforts to make YouTube safe for schools have yet to work.” The documents also acknowledge the potential impact of YouTube on mental health, with one 2024 presentation showing a slide that says “many regret time lost when they unintentionally ‘go down the rabbit hole,’” or that YouTube “‘distracted’ them from work or even getting to bed on time.”’

In an emailed statement to The Verge, Google spokesperson Jack Malon says the documents “mischaracterize” the company’s work. “YouTube does not market directly to schools and we have responded to meet the strong demand from educators for high-quality, curriculum-aligned content,” Malon says. “Administrators maintain full control over platform usage and YouTube requires schools to obtain parental consent before granting access to YouTube for students under 18.”

Jury selection for the social media addiction trial will start on January 27th, 2026.

            <h2>Leak: Nvidia is about to challenge ‘Intel Inside’ with as many as eight Arm laptops</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-24</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel and AMD have split the Windows laptop market for years, but the x86 players may be getting outnumbered. It’s not just Apple MacBooks and MediaTek-based Chromebooks using Arm chips anymore. There are finally competent Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops running Windows, and — as soon as this spring — Nvidia will finally power Windows consumer laptops with Arm chips all by itself.

They won’t have an Nvidia graphics chip next to an Intel CPU, but rather an Nvidia N1 system-on-chip at the helm — and overnight, a Lenovo leak revealed that the company has built six laptops on the upcoming N1 and N1X processors, including a 15-inch gaming machine.

Dataminer Huang514613 posted the product names to X, which also include 14 and 16-inch models of the Ideapad Slim 5, two variants of the 15-inch Yoga Pro 7, and a Yoga 9 transforming 2-in-1.

You don’t need to take Huang’s word for it alone: this update page for the company’s Legion Space control software still shows the existence of a “Legion 7 15N1X11” gaming laptop, where the “N1X” refers to Nvidia’s gaming SoC.

And just by using Google, I found a publicly indexed web portal where Lenovo has listings for password-protected “Nvidia N1x Portal Prod” and Nvidia N1x Portal Test” websites, too:

Lenovo may be the world’s biggest laptop maker, but it isn’t the only one prepping such laptops. Dell was tipped to launch an Alienware gaming laptop by early 2026 as well, and it may have been prepping a Dell Premium laptop (now XPS) with Nvidia N1X as well. That’s already eight different Nvidia laptops that might be coming.

Three days ago, Digitimes reported that we should expect Nvidia to launch its N1 and N1X laptop platform this spring, with more devices available this summer, after a previous delay — and that the company already has N2 and N2X chips on the roadmap for late 2027.

While we don’t truly know how much power the N1 and N1X have, a Geekbench leak (which has to be taken with a grain of salt; fake specs have been planted there before) suggested the N1X variant may have as many CUDA cores as a desktop RTX 5070 graphics card and 20 CPU cores, like Nvidia’s GB10 “Superchip” in the DGX Spark mini-PC. I’m comfortable sharing that because Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has all but confirmed the N1 and GB10 are two halves of the same coin.

Nvidia’s Arm PC chips have been a long time coming, but the company has powered consumer devices with Arm before. Every Nintendo Switch carries an Nvidia Tegra chip, and that Tegra line previously powered tablets up to and including the original Microsoft Surface RT, as well as Nvidia’s one-off Shield handheld and Shield TV set-top-boxes. These ones are built in collaboration with MediaTek, though.

AMD is also reportedly working on its own Arm chips for future Microsoft Surface devices.

            <div id="article-text">Trump’s TikTok deal leaves lawmakers with even more questions.

Trump’s TikTok deal leaves lawmakers with even more questions.

TikTok finally closed a deal meant to bring it into compliance with the law that should have banned it a year ago, and the lawmakers who passed that law still don’t seem to know what’s going on.

The company announced Tuesday that its US service is now part of the separate TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, with parent company ByteDance holding just a 19.9 percent stake in that new entity. The rest is owned by Oracle and investment firms Silver Lake and MGX, as well as smaller investors including Michael Dell’s family investment firm. Oracle will store US data and the joint venture will “retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data.” The new entity will also “have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation.”

The sparse details in the press release shed little light on outstanding questions from the time that the deal was first announced, such as whether a licensing agreement for the algorithm can be crafted in a way that avoids the sort of relationship with ByteDance that would be prohibited by the law. Even lawmakers who supported the bill seem to be in the dark. “Does this deal ensure China does not have influence over the algorithm? Can the parties involved assure Americans their data is secure?” House Select Committee on China Chair John Moolenaar (R-MI) asked in a statement following the deal’s closure. “Those are questions that need to be answered as the Select Committee does oversight of this deal.”

Select Committee Ranking Member Ro Khanna (D-CA), one of the few lawmakers who opposed the initial bill and introduced another to repeal it, said in a statement that the deal “is once again causing uncertainty among many creators.” Khanna pledged to engage with people whose livelihoods depend on the app “to find the best way forward and to prevent changes that could disrupt the rapidly growing creator economy while prioritizing data security.”

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), who voted to approve the foreign aid package that included the divest-or-ban bill, later sought to create a legal extension for a deal to get done. President Donald Trump flouted the original bill’s deadlines anyway, and Markey later proposed calling off the ban legally. Now that a deal has been reached, Markey said in a statement, “this TikTok deal raises many more questions than answers.”

Trump has played a significant role in how the negotiations have played out, talking about the TikTok deal with China’s President Xi Jinping, and at one point bantering at a press conference with Oracle chairman Larry Ellison that they could “negotiate in front of the media” over the deal. Markey griped that the White House “has provided virtually no details about this agreement, including whether TikTok’s algorithm is truly free of Chinese influence,” despite repeated requests for details. The White House and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “This lack of transparency reeks,” Markey said. “Congress has a responsibility to investigate this deal, demand transparency, and ensure that any arrangement truly protects national security while keeping TikTok online.”

Adding to the frustration for many Democrats is the fact that some of Trump’s close allies, like Ellison, stand to gain from the arrangement. “This ‘deal’ helps Trump’s rich friends get richer in exchange for turning TikTok into a propaganda machine for the White House,” Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-NJ), who supported the initial bill, wrote on X. “The sparse information provided doesn’t address serious concerns about compliance with the law or address the national security threat posed by Beijing’s continued control of the platform.”

The company is developing a ‘new version’ of the characters that will offer a ‘better experience.’

Meta is “temporarily pausing” the ability for teens to chat with its AI characters as it develops a “new version” of the characters that will offer a “better experience.” The company made the announcement in an update to a blog post from October where the company had detailed more parental controls for teen AI use. The change blocking teens from accessing the characters will go into effect “starting in the coming weeks.”

”Since we announced our plans to build parental controls for AI characters in October, we started developing a new iteration of AI characters generally (i.e. for both adults and teens),” spokesperson Sophie Vogel tells The Verge. “Rather than building the parental controls twice (for the current AI characters and the new iteration of AI characters) we’re pausing teen access to the current version while we focus on the new iteration. When that new iteration is available for teens, it will come with parental controls.”

According to TechCrunch, “Meta said that it heard from parents that they wanted more insights and control over their teens’ interactions with AI characters, which is why it decided to make these changes.”

In October, Meta announced that parents would be able to block their teens’ access to one-on-one conversations with its AI characters, block their teens from talking with specific AI characters, and share insights with parents on the topics their teens discuss with Meta’s AI characters and its AI assistant. The original plan was to roll out the blocking controls for the characters early this year. However, in Friday’s announcement, Meta says it is still working on how to share insights with parents about the conversations their teens are having with Meta’s AI assistant. That feature is “coming soon,” Vogel says.

Last year, also in October, Meta changed Instagram teen accounts to allow teens to be able to see content that’s reflective of what might be shown in a movie rated for people that are 13 or older.

Update, January 23rd: Added information from a Meta spokesperson.

Correction, January 23rd: Clarified that Meta is still working on how to share insights with parents about the conversations their teens are having with Meta’s AI assistant.

            <div id="article-text">The US version of TikTok is now under the control of Larry Ellison’s Oracle and a number of investment firms.

The US version of TikTok is now under the control of Larry Ellison’s Oracle and a number of investment firms.

TikTok is officially under new ownership in the US, and that could spell big changes for the video-sharing app. On January 22nd, ByteDance – TikTok’s Chinese parent company — and a group of investors closed a $14 billion deal to spin off the platform’s US operations, introducing a new slate of American executives.

The Silver Lake investment firm, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and the cloud giant Oracle will each have 15 percent stakes in the new TikTok US Data Security (USDS) Joint Venture LLC. ByteDance will still hold a 19.9 percent stake in the company, in line with the divest-or-ban law that went into effect last year — though the deal was pushed through with help from President Donald Trump in persistent disregard of the law.

The most visible change so far has been a new terms of service, which is popping up for US-based users hopping onto TikTok. The new terms have some people worried, but some of the sections raising concerns aren’t actually new.

Here’s how the joint venture will impact the app and your feed.

Adam Presser, TikTok’s former global head of operations and trust and safety, will serve as the CEO of the US-based company, while Will Farrell, who previously worked as the head of security and privacy for TikTok’s US arm, will become the joint venture’s chief security officer.

Shou Zi Chew will remain the CEO of TikTok’s global operations under ByteDance, and will get a seat on the US-based joint venture’s board of directors, joined by six other Americans:

You don’t need to download a new app in order to gain access to the US version of the app; it should update automatically. The new app shouldn’t affect your ability to see content from other countries, at least according to TikTok’s USDS website.

The joint venture says the app will maintain “interoperability” with the TikTok used by the rest of the world, while providing users with a “global TikTok experience.” The same goes for US-based creators, as the site adds that TikTok US will ensure users can discover them “on a global scale.”

TikTok’s US arm will, however, use a new version of the platform’s algorithm that the joint venture will “retrain, test, and update” using US user data — a move meant to assuage fears that the Chinese government could push propaganda through it. Beyond that, we don’t know much else about how your For You feed will differ from those in other countries. We also don’t know how long the algorithm will take to retrain, and when it will launch.

One of the biggest changes to TikTok’s terms of service and privacy policy is that it will now collect your precise geolocation as opposed to just your approximate location — but only if you give the app permission to do so.

The updated terms also add a new section about collecting information from your AI interactions, “including prompts, questions, files, and other types of information that you submit to our AI-powered interfaces, as well as the responses they generate.” Though some users are calling attention to other areas of the agreement, the rest remains largely unchanged when compared to its previous policy, which was last updated on August 19th, 2024.

For example, text about TikTok collecting information that you provide about “your racial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information” was also present in the previous terms. Both terms also say the app will collect your location information and the messages you send on the platform, and that TikTok could share your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, and law enforcement requests.

The deal puts Oracle in charge of TikTok’s security and data privacy in the US, as well as the algorithm. TikTok’s USDS website also says the newly formed company will “safeguard the U.S. content ecosystem and have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation.”

With TikTok USDS in charge of what users see on the platform, some users have raised concerns about censorship, especially when it comes to content related to Palestine. Larry Ellison, who cofounded Oracle, has cozied up to President Donald Trump, joining a $500 billion initiative to build massive data centers in the US. Ellison also has ties to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and donated $16.6 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces in 2017, as noted by The Intercept.

Though TikTok USDS doesn’t provide any specifics surrounding content moderation, multiple social media companies have modified their policies to be more Trump-friendly over the past year, and the company’s new leadership could change things too. With a Trump ally owning a large chunk of TikTok, the US-based company may take Trump’s enthusiasm for censorship and distaste for content moderation into consideration. TikTok’s existing community guidelines ban hate speech, misinformation, and content that may mislead voters or interfere with elections — all of which could be contentious under a Trump ally.

Many users say they are deleting TikTok after seeing the terms of service pop-up, with some citing the “fascist owners” and links to Ellison. (Hard data on whether people are actually leaving is tougher to come by.) TikTokers are concerned about the changes to the platform’s algorithm and the potential influence of the Trump administration. Some creators are even calling on others to block Oracle’s TikTok account, as well as informing users how to disable geotracking.

But perhaps the bigger question is how all of these changes will impact the tone of TikTok and the kinds of videos that succeed on the platform. The ingredients that make a video go viral now belong to a completely different party — whether they use that power to further an outside agenda remains to be seen.

Kate Ruane, the director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, urges TikTok’s new owners in the US to remain transparent about their plans. “This deal is concerning because it hands control over speech on TikTok to a new consortium of investors with their own motivations for shaping online discourse,” Ruane says. “Anyone who witnessed the change in ownership of Twitter, now X, knows that ownership matters.”

The joint venture is catching the attention of lawmakers, too, with Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) saying the deal “raises more questions than answers.” Markey is also calling on Congress to investigate the deal and “ensure that any arrangement truly protects national security while keeping TikTok online.”

Unfortunately, there’s no word on when it will be available or how much it will cost.

Casio showed up to NAMM (CES for music gear nerds) this year with a prototype sampler called the SX-C1 that looks every bit the lovechild of a Game Boy and an SP-404. The top has a directional pad and four buttons just like you’d find on a game controller, flanking a 1.3-inch OLED screen. But at the bottom, there are 16 rubberized pads for triggering samples with crunchy pixelated number labels on them.

The device on display on the show floor was not fully finalized, so the specs are subject to change. Casio says that the final version will have 16 voice polyphony and record samples at 16-bit / 48kHz. It will also have 10 banks of samples, for 160 sample slots in total, spread over 64GB of internal storage. It will also come preloaded with samples harvested from classic Casio gear.

There are also two effects slots, as evidenced by the two thumbwheels labeled FX1 and FX2. What effects and exactly how they’ll be implemented is unknown right now, though a bitcrusher and a delay can clearly be heard in the demo clip below.

Similarly, there’s a grid-style step sequencer that’s giving serious TR-707 vibes. But again, there are no specs for the sequencer at this time. One thing we do know is that there will be proper sample trimming with a visible waveform like you get on the Roland SP-404MKII, the kind that isn’t available on more affordable and portable samplers like Teenage Engineering’s PO-33 or PO-133.

The SX-C1 will have a built-in mic and speaker and can be powered by AAAs for truly standalone operation. But it also has 1/8-inch line-in and line-out jacks, a headphone jack, and two USB-C ports. Those USB ports can be used for power and audio, so you could plug straight into your computer to sample your favorite YouTube clip.

This marks Casio’s return to the world of samplers after a very long absence. Its ‘80s models, including the FZ-1 and SK-1, were iconic, but things have been quiet since then. When the Casio SX-C1 sampler might be available, how much it will cost, and if it will ever even come to the US are all unknown at this time, but we’ve reached out to Casio for more details.

For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. The big question is: can the obvious risks of using AI for health-related queries be mitigated enough for them to be a net benefit? Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry.

Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy. The move marked a victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead. Read our story about what’s on the horizon.

This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance. Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.

Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.

While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance.

After all, wastewater contains saliva, urine, feces, shed skin, and more. You could consider it a rich biological sample. Wastewater analysis helped scientists understand how covid was spreading during the pandemic. It’s early days, but it is starting to help us get a handle on measles.

Globally, there has been some progress toward eliminating measles, largely thanks to vaccination efforts. Such efforts led to an 88% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that “nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine” since 2000.

Still, an estimated 95,000 people died from measles in 2024 alone—most of them young children. And cases are surging in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Last year, the US saw the highest levels of measles in decades. The country is on track to lose its measles elimination status—a sorry fate that met Canada in November after the country recorded over 5,000 cases in a little over a year.

Public health efforts to contain the spread of measles—which is incredibly contagious—typically involve clinical monitoring in health-care settings, along with vaccination campaigns. But scientists have started looking to wastewater, too.

Along with various bodily fluids, we all shed viruses and bacteria into wastewater, whether that’s through brushing our teeth, showering, or using the toilet. The idea of looking for these pathogens in wastewater to track diseases has been around for a while, but things really kicked into gear during the covid-19 pandemic, when scientists found that the coronavirus responsible for the disease was shed in feces.

This led Marlene Wolfe of Emory University and Alexandria Boehm of Stanford University to establish WastewaterSCAN, an academic-led program developed to analyze wastewater samples across the US. Covid was just the beginning, says Wolfe. “Over the years we have worked to expand what can be monitored,” she says.

Two years ago, for a previous edition of the Checkup, Wolfe told Cassandra Willyard that wastewater surveillance of measles was “absolutely possible,” as the virus is shed in urine. The hope was that this approach could shed light on measles outbreaks in a community, even if members of that community weren’t able to access health care and receive an official diagnosis. And that it could highlight when and where public health officials needed to act to prevent measles from spreading. Evidence that it worked as an effective public health measure was, at the time, scant.

Since then, she and her colleagues have developed a test to identify measles RNA. They trialed it at two wastewater treatment plants in Texas between December 2024 and May 2025. At each site, the team collected samples two or three times a week and tested them for measles RNA.

Over that period, the team found measles RNA in 10.5% of the samples they collected, as reported in a preprint paper published at medRxiv in July and currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal. The first detection came a week before the first case of measles was officially confirmed in the area. That’s promising—it suggests that wastewater surveillance might pick up measles cases early, giving public health officials a head start in efforts to limit any outbreaks.

There are more promising results from a team in Canada. Mike McKay and Ryland Corchis-Scott at the University of Windsor in Ontario and their colleagues have also been testing wastewater samples for measles RNA. Between February and November 2025, the team collected samples from a wastewater treatment facility serving over 30,000 people in Leamington, Ontario.

These wastewater tests are somewhat limited—even if they do pick up measles, they won’t tell you who has measles, where exactly infections are occurring, or even how many people are infected. McKay and his colleagues have begun to make some progress here. In addition to monitoring the large wastewater plant, the team used tampons to soak up wastewater from a hospital lateral sewer.

They then compared their measles test results with the number of clinical cases in that hospital. This gave them some idea of the virus’s “shedding rate.” When they applied this to the data collected from the Leamington wastewater treatment facility, the team got estimates of measles cases that were much higher than the figures officially reported.

Their findings track with the opinions of local health officials (who estimate that the true number of cases during the outbreak was around five to 10 times higher than the confirmed case count), the team members wrote in a paper published on medRxiv a couple of weeks ago.

There will always be limits to wastewater surveillance. “We’re looking at the pool of waste of an entire community, so it’s very hard to pull in information about individual infections,” says Corchis-Scott.

Wolfe also acknowledges that “we have a lot to learn about how we can best use the tools so they are useful.” But her team at WastewaterSCAN has been testing wastewater across the US for measles since May last year. And their findings are published online and shared with public health officials.

In some cases, the findings are already helping inform the response to measles. “We’ve seen public health departments act on this data,” says Wolfe. Some have issued alerts, or increased vaccination efforts in those areas, for example. “[We’re at] a point now where we really see public health departments, clinicians, [and] families using that information to help keep themselves and their communities safe,” she says.

McKay says his team has stopped testing for measles because the Ontario outbreak “has been declared over.” He says testing would restart if and when a single new case of measles is confirmed in the region, but he also thinks that his research makes a strong case for maintaining a wastewater surveillance system for measles.

McKay wonders if this approach might help Canada regain its measles elimination status. “It’s sort of like [we’re] a pariah now,” he says. If his approach can help limit measles outbreaks, it could be “a nice tool for public health in Canada to [show] we’ve got our act together.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.

Though ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives.

Some doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety [and] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”

The release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance.

But those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.

Pinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.

Sirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.

A different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.

For people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.

Since Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.

Some studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.

OpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.

An LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.

Even if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.

Lederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.

It’s supposed to be frigid in Davos this time of year. Part of the charm is seeing the world’s elite tromp through the streets in respectable suits and snow boots. But this year it’s positively balmy, with highs in the mid 30s, or a little over 1°C. The current conditions when I flew out of New York were colder, and definitely snowier. I’m told this is due to something called a föhn, a dry warm wind that’s been blowing across the Alps.

I’m no meteorologist, but it’s true that there is a lot of hot air here.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump arrived in Davos to address the assembly, and held forth for more than 90 minutes, weaving his way through remarks about the economy, Greenland, windmills, Switzerland, Rolexes, Venezuela, and drug prices. It was a talk lousy with gripes, grievances and outright falsehoods.

One small example: Trump made a big deal of claiming that China, despite being the world leader in manufacturing windmill componentry, doesn’t actually use them for energy generation itself. In fact, it is the world leader in generation, as well.

I did not get to watch this spectacle from the room itself. Sad!

By the time I got to the Congress Hall where the address was taking place, there was already a massive scrum of people jostling to get in.

I had just wrapped up moderating a panel on “the intelligent co-worker,” ie: AI agents in the workplace. I was really excited for this one as the speakers represented a diverse cross-section of the AI ecosystem. Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG had the macro strategic view; Enrique Lores, HP CEO, could speak to both hardware and large enterprises, Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh has the inside view on workforce training and transformation, Manjul Shah CEO of Hippocratic AI addressed working in the high stakes field of healthcare, and Kate Kallot CEO of Amini AI gave perspective on the global south and Africa in particular.

Interestingly, most of the panel shied away from using the term co-worker, and some even rejected the term agent. But the view they painted was definitely one of humans working alongside AI and augmenting what’s possible. Shah, for example, talked about having agents call 16,000 people in Texas during a heat wave to perform a health and safety check. It was a great discussion. You can watch the whole thing here.

But by the time it let out, the push of people outside the Congress Hall was already too thick for me to get in. In fact I couldn’t even get into a nearby overflow room. I did make it into a third overflow room, but getting in meant navigating my way through a mass of people, so jammed in tight together that it reminded me of being at a Turnstile concert.

The speech blew way past its allotted time, and I had to step out early to get to yet another discussion. Walking through the halls while Trump spoke was a truly surreal experience. He had truly captured the attention of the gathered global elite. I don’t think I saw a single person not starting at a laptop, or phone or iPad, all watching the same video.

Trump is speaking again on Thursday in a previously unscheduled address to announce his Board of Peace. As is (I heard) Elon Musk. So it’s shaping up to be another big day for elite attention capture.

I should say, though, there are elites, and then there are elites. And there are all sorts of ways of sorting out who is who. Your badge color is one of them. I have a white participant badge, because I was moderating panels. This gets you in pretty much anywhere and therefore is its own sort of status symbol. Where you are staying is another. I’m in Klosters, a neighboring town that’s a 40 minute train ride away from the Congress Centre. Not so elite.

There are more subtle ways of status sorting, too. Yesterday I learned that when people ask if this is your first time at Davos, it’s sometimes meant as a way of trying to figure out how important you are. If you’re any kind of big deal, you’ve probably been coming for years.

But the best one I’ve yet encountered happened when I made small talk with the woman sitting next to me as I changed back into my snow boots. It turned out that, like me, she lived in California–at least part time. “But I don’t think I’ll stay there much longer,” she said, “due to the new tax law.” This was just an ice cold flex.

Because California’s newly proposed tax legislation? It only targets billionaires.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. Read the full interview.

In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now. The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid.

Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again.

            <h2>How Flippa Is Removing the Language Barrier from Global Deal-Making</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-flippa-is-removing-the-language-barrier-from-global-deal-making">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, access to high-quality deal flow and sophisticated M&A infrastructure has been largely designed for well-connected investors and industry giants. Small businesses and independent founders, particularly those operating outside English-speaking markets, may often find the barriers even higher. Language, geography, and limited access to networks could mean that opportunity stops at the border.

Amidst this trend, Flippa, a platform for buying and selling digital businesses, is rewriting the script and dismantling those barriers. Under the leadership of CEO Blake Hutchison, the company has connected buyers and sellers across continents, linguistic differences, and price points, closing deals from $100,000 up to $10 million. Now, with the launch of its AI-powered multi-language Deal Room, Flippa is addressing what it sees as one of the last major points of disadvantage in global business deals and M&A, calling it the “Language Tax.”

Founded in 2009, Flippa has grown into a global marketplace where entrepreneurs can buy and sell digital assets ranging from e-commerce stores and SaaS businesses to YouTube channels, online communities, and mobile applications. According to Hutchison, the platform supports users from 189 countries, attracting over 450,000 new buyers in the last two years alone. “Our internal data shows that cross-border transactions now account for approximately 85% of all deals completed on the platform,” Hutchison says. “That growth has been especially pronounced in Europe. As a highly fragmented market with high cross-border trade volume but multiple operating languages, I believe Europe often faces structural friction in cross-border dealmaking.”

He notes that European businesses are increasingly being acquired by international buyers, with US-based acquirers representing a significant share of demand. Yet, as deal volumes continue to decline, Hutchison believes that language barriers have historically slowed or derailed otherwise viable transactions.

The company’s new multi-language Deal Room is designed to remove that friction entirely. Within the Deal Room, Hutchison notes that buyers and sellers can now negotiate and transact in their preferred languages. “For example, a French seller can communicate in French with an Italian or English-speaking buyer, who receives the message instantly translated into their own language,” he says, explaining how replies can be translated back in real time, while preserving the original message for verification and clarity.

Hutchison states, “Our goal is to make deal-making as efficient and approachable as possible. Whether you are a SaaS founder in Paris or an e-commerce operator in Berlin, you should be able to negotiate your exit in the language of your choice.”

Alongside the Deal Room translation tool, Flippa has also launched a fully localized French version of its platform, with Spanish scheduled to follow shortly. The expansion reflects the user demand and the reality that French and Spanish are not only widely spoken across Europe, but globally. Spanish is spoken by 550 million people globally, and is spoken widely across the US and Brazil. Similarly, French, being the 5th most widely spoken language in the world, has 321 million speakers, with 61.8% of those speakers living in parts of North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, significantly extending the global reach of European-founded businesses.

According to Hutchison, this shift comes as Europe’s M&A market continues to rise again, with an estimated USD412 billion in deal value, with mid-market and digital-first businesses representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Flippa’s role, according to Hutchison, has been to create infrastructure for businesses to source deals with greater reach than elite investment banks, but with a fraction of the cost.

“We often describe Flippa as the investment bank for the 99%,” Hutchison says. “The difference now is that geography and language no longer define who gets access. The demand for cross-border deals was already there. The technology simply needed to catch up.”

Flippa continues to integrate AI-driven discovery, valuation, and outreach tools through its proprietary LaurenAI engine. “The model is trained on more than 200,000 historical listings and transactions,” he explains. “The system then helps buyers identify opportunities, estimate enterprise value, and initiate conversations at scale.” It autonomously indexes the web to identify businesses across SaaS, e-commerce, apps, publishing, and next-generation media.

Human expertise remains embedded in the process, with certified brokers and M&A professionals supporting transactions once a match is made. As Hutchison puts it, “LaurenAI gives people the ability to access off-market deals and build pipelines the same way Wall Street players do, but without the barriers of capital or connections.”

He notes that entrepreneurs who may not feel confident negotiating complex deal terms in English can now access global liquidity without intermediaries or external advisors. At the same time, international buyers can gain visibility into high-quality European businesses that were previously difficult to source or engage.

As digital entrepreneurship continues to globalize, Flippa is positioning itself at the center of a more inclusive M&A ecosystem, one where language is no longer a tax on ambition and opportunities. Flippa’s multi-language Deal Room represents a structural shift in how global deal-making can be done. For founders and buyers alike, it signals a future where the next meaningful transaction can begin in any language, from anywhere in the world.

            <h2>French fintech Pennylane raises €175M</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/french-fintech-pennylane-raises-e175m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-based fintech Pennylane has just pulled off one of Europe’s most noteworthy funding rounds of the year, announcing €175 million in new capital to accelerate its push into artificial intelligence and expand its footprint across the continent. 
The round was led by growth investor TCV, with participation from Blackstone Growth and a group of existing backers that includes Sequoia Capital, DST Global, CapitalG and Meritech Capital.

What makes this raise stand out isn’t just the size of the cheque, though €175 million is hard to ignore in a selective funding market, but the strategic timing and purpose behind it. Pennylane says it didn’t need the capital to survive; it chose to raise now to double down on AI product development and prepare for a phase of market consolidation in European financial software.

Since its founding in 2020, Pennylane has positioned itself as more than just an accounting tool. It has built what it calls a financial operating system for small and mid-sized businesses and the accountants who serve them, bringing invoicing, payments, bookkeeping, and cash-flow management into a shared platform.

That unified approach taps a persistent pain point in Europe’s SME economy, where many companies still stitch together separate systems to manage their finances.

The new funds will support expanded R&D, particularly in generative AI, with early efforts already focused on building intelligent assistants that help accountants interpret data, automate routine bookkeeping, and deliver richer insights to their clients.

The company is also gearing up for regulatory shifts, including electronic invoicing mandates rolling out across several EU countries and refining localisation for key markets like Germany.

Pennylane’s latest round reportedly values the company at about $4.25 billion (€3.6 billion), reinforcing its unicorn status and standing among Europe’s higher-valued fintech startups. That valuation reflects both investor confidence and the company’s growing footprint: Pennylane is used by thousands of accounting firms and hundreds of thousands of businesses across several European markets.

This deal also underscores a broader trend in European tech: AI is moving beyond buzzy chatbots and large language models into critical business infrastructure.

Fintech tools, compliance software, and productivity platforms are increasingly weaving machine learning and automation into once manual workflows. For accountants juggling multiple clients in different jurisdictions, AI isn’t a luxury; it’s a practical way to keep up with regulatory complexity and expectations for real-time financial insights.

Strategically, Pennylane’s timing matters. European financial software is under pressure to modernise rapidly as digital tax reporting and e-invoicing standards become the norm rather than the exception.

By raising capital now, even without immediate pressure,  Pennylane is planting a flag as these shifts accelerate. The presence of heavyweight global investors like TCV and Blackstone signals that international capital still sees promise in Europe’s SaaS and AI stack.

But there’s a deeper dynamic at play. In Europe, fintech innovation often means balancing diversification with consolidation. Investors backing Pennylane now are betting that the company can serve as a common platform for both accountants and SMEs across borders, a role that gets harder as local regulatory regimes and market expectations diverge.

Generative AI, if deployed thoughtfully, could be what ties all those variations together, letting the platform adapt to local tax rules or reporting needs without keeping teams chained to repetitive work.

From Berlin to Barcelona, founders and investors alike are watching to see whether this latest bet on AI financial tooling pays off. In a funding landscape where some sectors have tightened, and valuations have been scrutinised, Pennylane’s ability to attract major global backers while maintaining founder control and avoiding unnecessary dilution signals that Europe’s fintech scene still has room to grow.

For businesses and accountants alike, the surge in capital behind AI-first tools could translate into more seamless workflows, smarter insights, and faster decision-making.

And if Pennylane’s vision plays out, it might not just be a win for one French unicorn, but a sign that European software can innovate too, not by mimicking Silicon Valley, but by solving problems that are uniquely local, and increasingly global.

            <h2>Can AI replace the humanity of Classical Music?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October 2021, the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn interpreted the first movement of Beethoven’s 10th unfinished symphony, which was completed with the use of artificial intelligence.

A team of computer scientists, music historians, musicologists, and composers developed the ‘Beethoven AI’ to analyze Beethoven’s music style and life, using the sketches he left behind of the 10th symphony, plus works from other composers that had a notable influence on his life, such as Johann Sebastian Bach, to generate pieces that reflect what he would have composed.

Beethoven AI, as others AI composition programs, produces music in the same way ChatGPT produces outcomes. It uses machine learning and algorithms to analyse musical data and patterns, and generative models to produce music based on inputted prompts.

Hence, the AI tool was trained by the team of experts and provided with all the necessary information for it to understand, be contextualized, and finally, be able to create something that Beethoven himself could have written.

This milestone raises an important question that becomes more relevant day by day: as technology becomes increasingly capable of initiating creativity, what remains distinctly human in the classical music world?

Can AI replace the sensitivity and humanity needed to compose, interpret, convey the emotions, or communicate the composer’s intended message?

Classical music has historically been a niche domain. It was born in the house of Jesus as the natural successor after choral music.

Whatsoever, only the most privileged ones, those of noble background or family with ties to music, could dedicate their lives to the study of an instrument or composition, and only those part of the aristocracy had the privilege to enjoy it.

Over time and thanks to globalization and the massive spread of information, classical music has expanded, allowing millions of people around the world to be delighted by it.

Digital platforms like Spotify and YouTube offer all audiences the opportunity to access an immense variety of compositions and recordings across history, democratizing classical music.

Simultaneously, social media allows traditional or innovative artists to showcase their interpretation of it, whether it is a classical performance of Campanella by Paganini or a modern version of The Four Seasons by Vivaldi, played as a trap variation.

The introduction of modern technologies has represented an opportunity for the classical music industry to find innovative ways to remain relevant in a fast-paced world.

The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has launched a digital concert hall, a streaming platform for users to access multiple recordings and content on demand. Similarly, the Philharmonia Orchestra uses Virtual Reality to create an immersive experience, allowing the audience to enjoy the concerts onstage, among the players.

However, the new technologies also symbolize a challenge and introduce concerns about the future of human creativity for the creative industries, including the classical music world.

AyseDeniz Gokcin, a Turkish pianist, uses AI to arrange pieces from iconic composers, adapting them to modern trends or to what they might have produced if they lived today, which risks displacing contemporary composers trying to establish their own voices.

From a symphony finished with AI, to the experience of listening to an orchestra being onstage with them, or to have the possibility of listening to your favorite composer in a modern, personalized style, technology brings clear advantages to the classical music industry.

A study in ‘Music Composition with AI’ made by the World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews (WJARR) highlights how AI technologies can improve efficiency and accessibility, preserve and enhance historical pieces, and unlock new possibilities for innovation in performance and education. Y

et, it also challenges the role of human artistry and raises concerns about the lack of emotional depth, ethical and legal issues, and the livelihoods of today’s musicians and composers.

AI can be a powerful tool and ally for those who are willing to work with it as an extension of human creativity and as a means to explore new ways of expressing themselves.

While those who see it as a threat can focus on seeing AI as a digital instrument that will never replace the touch of mankind, since it depends on artists to create, replicate, and generate outcomes.

Lastly, it is on us, creators and audiences, to make a conscious choice in how we use new technologies and to preserve humanity in a rapidly evolving world.

            <div id="article-text">As Europe races into the AI era, its policymakers are laying new pipes for the continent’s digital future. The European Commission’s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) promises to rewire the EU’s telecom landscape, with big implications for artificial intelligence infrastructure, connectivity equity, and the startup ecosystem.

Exposed as part of a broader push to make Europe “fit for the Digital Age,” the draft law aims to modernize how networks are built and regulated, from 5G towers in rural villages to fiber links between data centers.

I have to say it’s a bold vision of a more connected, innovative Europe, but one that must navigate a thicket of competing interests and unanswered questions.

For years, EU leaders have urged the creation of a true single market for digital services. The DNA is a centerpiece of that strategy, aligning with Europe’s Digital Decade goals for universal high-speed internet by 2030.

How can we translate this? Well, I think Brussels wants to turn the patchwork of 27 national telecom systems into one seamless network. The Act’s core objective is to “harmonise the EU connectivity sector by addressing delays, inconsistencies, and fragmentation”, removing barriers to cross-border operations and stimulating investment in very high-capacity networks.

This mirrors the logic behind earlier EU tech regulations;  just as the Digital Markets Act tackled Big Tech gatekeepers, the Digital Networks Act targets the digital plumbing beneath them.

This reform doesn’t come out of the blue.

A Commission white paper in 2024 warned that without cutting-edge digital infrastructure, Europe’s digital economy would stall. It painted vivid scenarios: doctors unable to perform remote surgery, smart farms and self-driving cars hamstrung by slow connections.

Secure and sustainable networks are one of the “cardinal points” of the EU’s 2030 digital agenda.

The DNA is Brussels’ attempt to meet those needs by boosting investment, standardizing rules, and making sure that every corner of Europe can plug into the opportunities of the digital age.

At its core, the Act hands telecom operators some long-sought gifts. One headline measure would grant carriers unlimited radio-spectrum licenses, ending the era of auctions that force telcos to periodically renew their rights.

For Europe’s big mobile providers, this change offers certainty: they can invest in 5G and future 6G networks without fearing their spectrum will expire.

Regulators argue this will “increase investment predictability” and accelerate network roll-out.

In theory, more cell towers could now reach remote areas, and companies might more freely trade or lease unused frequencies to new players.

The DNA couples permanent licenses with “use-it-or-share-it” obligations to prevent hoarding. If an incumbent isn’t using its spectrum in, say, a rural region, it could be forced to share it or lose it,  allowing a competitor or community network to serve that area.

It’s a nod to connectivity equity: Europe doesn’t want scarce wireless spectrum lying fallow while some communities remain underserved.

Broadband for all is the mantra, and long license tenures will come with accountability to deliver on coverage.

Another provision tightens the oversight of dominant firms. Under current plans, if a telecom operator holds significant market power (SMP) in one market (for example, fixed broadband), regulators could extend that designation to a closely related market (like mobile services).

In practice, this means big incumbents might face extra obligations, from transparency to price controls, across their range of services. The idea is to prevent giants from leveraging their dominance in one domain to squelch competition in another.

That could open space for smaller internet providers or innovative ISPs to compete, a boon for consumer choice and startup entrants.

A cohort of six member states,  including France, Germany and Italy, has pushed back, urging Brussels not to centralize control over frequencies and mergers.

Spectrum auctions have long been jealously guarded as national turf (they can fill state coffers, after all), and capitals are wary of one-size-fits-all rules emanating from the EU.

These governments also worry that encouraging pan-European telecom mergers (another idea floated in the reform) could reduce competition at home. In their joint memo, they caution that while a level playing field between telecoms and tech firms is a laudable goal, “this does not necessarily imply the same regulations should apply”to both sectors.

It’s a reminder that the DNA, for all its single-market ideals, must reckon with political realities: Europe’s telecom revolution won’t happen without consensus among very different national markets.

Perhaps the most contentious debate surrounding the Digital Networks Act has been over who pays for the next-generation networks. Telecom giants have spent years lobbying for a “fair share” contribution from Big Tech, arguing that bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix, YouTube, and cloud platforms should chip in to finance the infrastructure that carries their content.

The draft Act steers clear of any direct “network usage fee” on content providers. Instead, it reaffirms Europe’s commitment to net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic must be treated equally by providers.

Any cooperation with Big Tech will rely on voluntary “best practice” discussions moderated by EU regulators, not on legally mandated payments.

This decision followed intense pushback from many sides. Over the summer, consumer groups and tech industry alliances publicly warned against reviving the “fair share” idea under any guise, noting it had been “clearly rejected in previous consultations” for threatening consumers, competition and innovation.

Even a U.S.–EU trade agreement in late 2025 extracted a pledge from Brussels “not [to] adopt or maintain network usage fees”, highlighting the geopolitical stakes of singling out mostly American tech firms.

On the other hand, startups and digital rights advocates breathed a sigh of relief at the Commission’s stance. Allied for Startups, a coalition of European entrepreneurs, argued that net neutrality is essential for startup growth, preventing a two-tier internet that would “favour dominant players” and raise barriers for newcomers.

In their view, a “traffic tax” isn’t just about Google or Amazon’s bottom line, it would set a harmful precedent that could box out the little guys who rely on affordable, equal-access bandwidth to innovate.

By keeping the DNA free of explicit network fees, Europe is signaling that the open internet won’t be collateral damage in the drive for better infrastructure.

Beyond telecom boardrooms and Silicon Valley balance sheets, the Digital Networks Act is ultimately about the kind of digital society Europe wants to build.

A major motivation is preparing for a future where artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT devices are ubiquitous, and will demand unprecedented bandwidth and low latency.

The Commission’s own analysis stresses that only with the “highest performance” networks will transformative technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, remote health care, and smart grids reach their potential.

In simple terms: if data is the new oil, Europe needs better pipes to pump it.

The Digital Networks Act sits alongside Europe’s broader tech push by focusing on the infrastructure AI needs to scale. Beyond regulating AI, the EU is investing in next-generation networks, from fiber to 5G and 6G, through initiatives such as the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.

Faster rollout of these networks would underpin everything from AI-driven industry to cloud services, all of which depend on high-capacity, cross-border connectivity.

The Act also addresses connectivity equity. While Europe’s digital goals assume universal gigabit access and widespread 5G, large parts of the continent still lag behind.

The proposal combines simpler deployment rules with tougher coverage obligations, while allowing flexibility where older networks cannot yet be switched off. The aim is to expand access without letting rigid deadlines slow progress.

Whether this works will depend on execution. Investment still favors dense urban markets, and rural coverage remains a challenge. If the Act can meaningfully lift fiber and 5G reach across Europe, it could help ensure the AI economy extends beyond major tech hubs to the rest of the continent.

From the perspective of Europe’s startups and innovators, the DNA is a double-edged sword that tilts promisingly toward opportunity. On one side, the Act’s push to harmonize telecom rules could tear down barriers that have long frustrated young companies.

Today, a cloud services startup or an IoT device maker in Europe must navigate a maze of national regulations when scaling up, from differing network standards to separate certification hoops in each country.

By creating a more unified framework (for instance, common rules on spectrum and infrastructure access), the DNA could make it easier for a startup in Portugal to expand its services to Poland or Finland without running into 27 different regulatory roadblocks.

Startups rely on an open and predictable internet, and on this front the Commission’s approach offers some reassurance. By preserving net neutrality and rejecting new network tolls, the Act allows young companies to reach users on equal terms, without the risk that deeper-pocketed rivals can buy preferential treatment.

For small fintech or AI startups, avoiding additional network costs matters, and under the current proposal they won’t be asked to shoulder them.

At the same time, founders are reading the fine print carefully. Proposals around a “level playing field” raise concerns that telecom-style regulation could spill over onto digital services, including smaller platforms.

The balance remains fragile: regulate too little and dominant players squeeze out challengers; regulate too broadly and compliance costs can smother the next generation of European tech companies.

As an ambitious blueprint for Europe’s digital infrastructure, the Digital Networks Act embodies a careful balancing act. It must entice telecom operators to spend the billions needed to upgrade networks for an AI-driven future, yet not at the expense of the open internet or new challengers.

It seeks to unify Europe’s connectivity market while respecting that one size may not fit all in a Union of 27. In the coming months, EU lawmakers and member states will debate and tweak the proposal, and the stakes are high.

The outcome will shape not just who foots the bill for Europe’s next-gen networks, but also who can innovate on those networks in the years ahead.

There will be bumps on this road, resistance from powerful telecom lobbies, wrangling between capitals and Brussels, and possibly even transatlantic frictions.

In the end, the Digital Networks Act is about Europe’s place in the digital world. A continent that pioneered GSM mobile standards and championed data privacy now wants to set the standard for equitable, innovation-friendly networks.

Striking a balance between investment and fairness, between scale and competition, won’t be easy. But it’s essential. If the EU succeeds, the reward could be a resilient digital backbone capable of supporting AI breakthroughs and economic growth across all its regions, without leaving its core values behind.

If it stumbles, Europe risks buffering on the sidelines while others surge ahead.

The coming debate will reveal whether Europe can indeed reshape its digital DNA for the better, or if old divides will slow down this grand connectivity project.

Either way, the world will be watching the EU’s next move in this high-stakes telecom reboot.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <h2>When corporate knowledge becomes invaluable</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/when-corporate-knowledge-becomes-invaluable">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.
