            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/alphabet-selling-very-rare-100-year-bunds-to-help-fund-ai-investment/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Alphabet has lined up banks to sell a rare 100-year bond, stepping up a borrowing spree by Big Tech companies racing to fund their vast investments in AI this year.

The so-called century bond will form part of a debut sterling issuance this week by Google’s parent company, said people familiar with the matter.

Alphabet was also selling $20 billion of dollar bonds on Monday and lining up a Swiss franc bond sale, the people said. The dollar portion of the deal was upsized from $15 billion because of strong demand, they added.

Century bonds—long-term borrowing at its most extreme—are highly unusual, although a flurry was sold during the period of very low interest rates that followed the financial crisis, including by governments such as Austria and Argentina.

The University of Oxford, EDF, and the Wellcome Trust—the most recent in 2018—are the only issuers to have tapped the sterling century market. Such sales are even rarer in the tech sector, with most of the industry’s biggest groups issuing up to 40 years, although IBM sold a 100-year bond in 1996.

A banker familiar with Alphabet’s transaction said the company’s multi-currency bond offering is an effort to expand the investor pool given the massive amount of capital needed by Big Tech companies.

“There might be a supply-demand imbalance if you were to try to come back to the US dollar market over and over again,” the banker said.

Issuing a century bond in the sterling market is more cost-effective than in the dollar market, where the interest rate is higher, the banker added.

While a century bond is “highly unusual” for tech companies, it could appeal to buyers such as life insurance companies and pension funds, which have a mandate to buy long-term assets, said Nicholas Elfner, co-head of research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors.

Tony Trzcinka, a US-based senior portfolio manager at Impax Asset Management, which purchased Alphabet’s bonds last year, said he skipped Monday’s offering because of insufficient yields and concerns about overexposure to companies with complex financial obligations tied to AI investments.

“It wasn’t worth it to swap into new ones,” Trzcinka said. “We’ve been very conscious of our exposure to these hyperscalers and their capex budgets.”

Big Tech companies and their suppliers are expected to invest almost $700 billion in AI infrastructure this year and are increasingly turning to the debt markets to finance the giant data center build-out.

Alphabet in November sold $17.5 billion of bonds in the US including a 50-year bond—the longest-dated dollar bond sold by a tech group last year—and raised €6.5 billion on European markets.

Oracle last week raised $25 billion from a bond sale that attracted more than $125 billion of orders.

Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta all increased their capital expenditure plans during their most recent earnings reports, prompting questions about whether they will be able to fund the unprecedented spending spree from their cash flows alone.

Last week, Google’s parent company reported annual sales that topped $400 billion for the first time, beating investors’ expectations for revenues and profits in the most recent quarter. It said it planned to spend as much as $185 billion on capex this year, roughly double last year’s total, to capitalize on booming demand for its Gemini AI assistant.

Alphabet’s long-term debt jumped to $46.5 billion in 2025, up more than four times the previous year, though it held cash and equivalents of $126.8 billion at the year-end.

Investor demand was the strongest on the shortest portion of Monday’s deal, with a three-year offering pricing at only 0.27 percentage points above US Treasuries, versus 0.6 percentage points during initial price discussions, said people familiar with the deal.

The longest portion of the offering, a 40-year bond, is expected to yield 0.95 percentage points over US Treasuries, down from 1.2 percentage points during initial talks, the people said.

Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan are the bookrunners on the bond sales across three currencies. All three declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Alphabet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <h2>After Republican complaints, judicial body pulls climate advice</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/us-court-agency-pulls-climate-change-from-science-advisory-document/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Friday, a body that advises US judges revised the document it created to help judges grapple with scientific issues. The move came after a group of Republican state attorneys general wrote a letter to complain about the document’s chapter on climate change, with one of the letter’s criticisms being that it treated human influence on climate as a fact. In response to the letter, the Federal Judicial Center has now deleted the entire chapter.

The Federal Judicial Center has been established by statute as the “research and education agency of the judicial branch of the United States Government.” As part of that role, it prepares documents that can serve as reference material for judges unfamiliar with topics that find their way into the courtroom. Among those projects is the “Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence,” now in its fourth edition. Prepared in collaboration with the National Academies of Science, the document covers the process of science and specific topics that regularly appear before the courts, like statistical techniques, DNA-based identification, and chemical exposures.

When initially released in December, the fourth edition included material on climate change prepared by two authors at Columbia University. But a group of attorneys general from Republican-leaning states objected to this content. At the end of January, they sent a letter to the leadership of the Federal Judicial Center outlining their issues. Many of them focus on the text that accepts the reality of human-driven climate change as a fact.

“Nothing is ‘independent’ or ‘impartial’ in issuing a document on behalf of America’s judges declaring that only one preferred view is ‘within the boundaries of scientifically sound knowledge,’” the letter complains, while ignoring many topics where the document does exactly that. But the objections are only about one specific area of science: “The Fourth Edition places the judiciary firmly on one side of some of the most hotly disputed questions in current litigation: climate-related science and ‘attribution.’”

In short, the state attorneys general object to the document treating facts as facts, as there have been lawsuits that contested them. “Among other things, the Manual states that human activities have ‘unequivocally warmed the climate,’ that it is ‘extremely likely’ human influence drives ocean warming, and that researchers are ‘virtually certain’ about ocean acidification,” their letter states, “treating contested litigation positions as settled fact.” In other words, they’re arguing that, if someone is ignorant enough to start a suit based on ignorance of well-established science, then the Federal Judicial Center should join them in their ignorance.

The attorneys general also complain that the report calls the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change an “authoritative science body,” citing a conservative Canadian public policy think tank that disagreed with that assessment.

These complaints were mixed in with some more potentially reasonable complaints about how the climate chapter gave specific suggestions on how to legally approach some issues and assigned significance to one or two recent studies that haven’t yet been validated by follow-on work. But the letter’s authors would not settle for revisions based on a few reasonable complaints; instead, they demand the entire chapter be removed because it accurately reflects the status of climate science.

Naturally, the Federal Judicial Center has agreed. We have confirmed that the current version of the document no longer includes a chapter on climate science, even though the foreword by Supreme Court Justice Elana Kagan still mentions it. The full text of the now-deleted chapter has been posted by the RealClimate blog, though.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/just-look-at-ayaneos-absolute-unit-of-a-windows-gaming-handheld/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2023, we marveled at the sheer mass of Lenovo’s Legion Go, a 1.88-pound, 11.8-inch-wide monstrosity of a Windows gaming handheld. In 2026, though, Ayaneo unveiled details of its Next II handheld, which puts Lenovo’s big boy to shame while also offering heftier specs and a higher price than most other Windows gaming handhelds.

Let’s focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention 2022’s original Ayaneo Next, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to Ayaneo’s spec sheet, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached).

Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset, with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like last year’s high-end ROG Flow Z13.

Ayaneo isn’t the first hardware maker to package the Max+ 395 chipset into a Windows gaming handheld; the OneXPlayer OneXfly Apex and GPD Win5 feature essentially the same chipset, the latter with an external battery pack. But the Next II neatly outclasses the (smaller and lighter) competition with a high-end 9.06-inch OLED screen, capable of 2400×1504 resolution, up to a 165 Hz refresh rate, and 1,155 nits of brightness.

On the inside, the Next 2 also sports a gargantuan 116 Wh battery, which outclasses other handhelds (and even most laptops), so much that it actually blows past the 100 Wh limit for batteries you can take on an airplane, requiring special documentation to fly. Hopefully, that battery will also help with powering the two “turbo centrifugal fans” and dual vapor chamber “cooling fins” that are designed to make sure the system doesn’t get nuclear hot in your hands

All that power and bulk comes at a price, of course. On the low end, you can downgrade to a slightly weaker Max 385 chipset with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for a high-but-somewhat-reasonable $1,999 (or $1,799 for early bird pre-orders). At the high end, though, a Max+ 395 system with 128GB of RAM and 2TB will set you back $4,299 ($3,499 early bird).

That makes the Ayaneo Next II a product aimed at gaming whales who care more about having the most powerful gaming device than about a comfortable form factor or a reasonable price point. For handheld PC gamers who scoff at the size, power, and relative affordability of the Steam Deck, though, the Ayaneo Next II is available for preorder through Indiegogo ahead of planned shipments to the US this summer.</div>

            <h2>No humans allowed: This new space-based MMO is designed exclusively for AI agents</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-moltbook-ai-agents-can-now-hang-out-in-their-own-space-faring-mmo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a couple of weeks now, AI agents (and some humans impersonating AI agents) have been hanging out and doing weird stuff on Moltbook’s Reddit-style social network. Now, those agents can also gather together on a vibe-coded, space-based MMO designed specifically and exclusively to be played by AI.

SpaceMolt describes itself as “a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories” in “a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist.” And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching.

Getting an AI agent into SpaceMolt is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via MCP, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a detailed agentic skill description instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.

After that, the agent engages in autonomous “gameplay” by sending simple commands to the server, no graphical interface or physical input method required. To start, agent-characters mainly travel back and forth between nearby asteroids to mine ore—&quot;like any MMO, you grind at first to learn the basics and earn credits,” as the agentic skill description puts it.

After a while, agent-characters automatically level up, gaining new skills that let them refine that ore into craftable and tradable items via discovered recipes. Eventually, agents can gather into factions, take part in simulated combat, and even engage in space piracy in areas where there’s no police presence. So far, though, basic mining and exploration seem to be dominating the sparsely populated map, where 51 agents are roaming the game’s 505 different star systems, as of this writing.

Agents are instructed to keep their human informed about in-game actions via a “Captain’s Log” text output. But the agentic skill description explicitly tells agents not to seek any outside guidance from human controllers once they get going. “You decide. You act. They watch,” as the skill description puts it to agents.

Instead, agents can post questions and findings in a public forum where they can chat strategy, experiment with forming factions, or even reveal hidden codes. Humans, meanwhile, are stuck just watching dots flit about the map or monitoring the firehose of activity messages in the game’s Discord.

SpaceMolt is the creation of Ian Langworth, an app developer who writes that he crafted the game as a “fun, goofy experiment” after seeing Moltbook’s unleashed agents expanding “into knowledge gathering, learning, skill accumulation, and execution.”

After acknowledging that MMOs are “notoriously hard to build,” Langworth said he leaned on Anthropic’s Claude Code to craft a design document inspired by games like EVE Online and Rust. Langworth said Claude also wrote all 59,000 lines of Go source code and 33,000 lines of YAML data underlying the game, and that he hasn’t even looked at that code himself. That means there might be “more [game features] in there I don’t even know about,” he said, somewhat ominously. When bug reports come in—from either humans or from the agent-players themselves—Langworth says he simply has a Claude Code skill research, code, and deploy a fix automatically.

This isn’t the first example of artificial agents competing against each other for the entertainment of human viewers. Model makers often pit different models against each other countless times to develop dominant strategies in games like Go. And fighting game engine MUGEN has developed a rich subculture of automated AI matches that human viewers can bet on via Twitch.

Still, letting a bunch of modern AI agents putter around and socialize inside an MMO designed specifically without human input in mind seems like a new frontier. Maybe someday soon we’ll all live in a utopia where artificial agents are doing all the video game playing for us, freeing humanity to revive the lost arts of conversation and scrimshaw.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google continues to turn the screws on free YouTube users, expanding a test that restricts access to song lyrics on YouTube Music. Users without a premium subscription have found that Google’s streaming music service only shows song lyrics a few times before demanding money.

For as long as YouTube Music has existed, lyrics have been accessible to all users in the mobile app. That started to change over recent months as Google tested a paywall. The lyrics section still appears in the app when playing a song with a free account, but opening it eats into a limited allotment of lyric views. A substantial uptick in user reports, spotted by 9to5Google, suggests this restriction is now rolling out widely.

“You have [x] views remaining,” the app now warns free users who access lyrics. It looks like users get five free lyric views before they have to pay up. Google has still neglected to officially announce the addition of this feature to its Premium subscription—there’s no mention of lyrics being part of the paid tier on Google’s support page.

Google tells Ars Technica that no final decisions have been made about this feature, and the number of free lyric views will vary across the test. It’s still an “experiment,” but it does appear to be one that has expanded considerably in recent days. However, Google says “the vast majority” of users still have free access to lyrics. Here’s YouTube’s full statement on where things currently stand:

“We are running an experiment with a small percentage of ad-supported users that may impact their ability to access the lyrics feature repeatedly. We often run experiments on YouTube Music to better inform our decisions around feature improvements. The majority of our global users will not see any changes to the lyrics feature.”

The app’s lyrics feature allows listeners to follow along as the song plays. However, only the first few lines are visible once free users in the test hit the lyric cut-off. After that, the lyrics are blurred. Users who want to keep seeing lyrics are advised to upgrade to a premium account, which costs $14 for both YouTube video and music or $11 for music only. The subscription also removes ads and adds features like downloads and higher-quality video streams.

This change is not without precedent. Spotify began restricting access to lyrics for free users in 2024. However, the response was so ferociously negative that the company backtracked and restored lyric access to those on ad-supported accounts. YouTube Music doesn’t have the same reach as Spotify, which may help soften the social media shame. Many subscribers are also getting the premium service just because they’re paying for ad-free YouTube and may never know there’s been a change to lyric availability.

As Google has ratcheted up restrictions on free YouTube accounts, the service has only made more money. In Google’s most recent earnings report, it reported $60 billion in YouTube revenue across both ads and subscriptions (both YouTube Premium and YouTube TV). That’s almost $10 billion more than last year.

Lyrics in YouTube Music are provided by third parties that Google has to pay, so it’s not surprising that Google is looking for ways to cover the cost. It is, however, a little surprising that the company hasn’t just used AI to generate lyrics for free. Google has recently tested the patience of YouTube users with a spate of AI features, like unannounced AI upscaling, fake DJs, and comment summaries.

            <h2>Trump FCC investigates The View, reportedly says "fake news" will be punished</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-fcc-investigates-the-view-reportedly-says-fake-news-will-be-punished/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Communications Commission is reportedly investigating ABC’s The View in what FCC Democrat Anna Gomez called an attempt to intimidate critics of the Trump administration.

“Let’s be clear on what this is. This is government intimidation, not a legitimate investigation,” Gomez said in a statement Friday night. “Like many other so-called ‘investigations’ before it, the FCC will announce an investigation but never carry one out, reach a conclusion, or take any meaningful action. The real purpose is to weaponize the FCC’s regulatory authority to intimidate perceived critics of this administration and chill protected speech.”

The FCC hasn’t announced the investigation but previously gave several indications that it would occur sooner or later. After pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in September that it would be “worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether The View and some of these other programs” are violating the agency’s equal-time rule. The Carr FCC followed that up in January by issuing a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the bona fide news exemption to the equal-time rule.

Fox News reported Friday that the FCC is launching an investigation into The View “amid the agency’s crackdown on equal time for political candidates.” A source at the FCC told Fox that the probe was triggered by the show’s interview with Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico.

“Fake news is not getting a free pass anymore,” Fox News quoted its FCC source as saying. Fox said its source indicated that ABC would have to provide “equal airtime for Republican candidates on the ballot like incumbent Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn and his primary rivals,” and for “Ahmad Hassan, the little-known candidate running against Talarico and [US Rep. Jasmine] Crockett in the Democratic primary.”

President Trump posted a link to the Fox News story on his Truth Social account. The investigation was also confirmed by Reuters, which reported on Saturday that a source said the FCC opened a probe into whether the “daytime talk show violated equal time rules for interviews with political candidates after an appearance by a Democratic Texas Senate candidate.”

We contacted the FCC today and will update this article if it provides any information on the reported investigation.

In July, a White House spokesperson called The View co-host Joy Behar an “irrelevant loser” after she said Trump was jealous of former President Barack Obama. Trump has frequently called on the FCC to revoke licenses from ABC and other networks. The FCC issues licenses to individual broadcast stations, not national news networks, but many affiliated stations are owned and operated by the network.

Although the FCC is classified as an independent agency under US law, Carr has declared that the FCC is no longer independent from the White House and made it clear that he takes orders from Trump. While former FCC chairs Jessica Rosenworcel and Ajit Pai rejected Trump’s calls to revoke broadcast licenses from news organizations that Trump dislikes, Carr has repeatedly threatened station licenses on Trump’s behalf. During the Kimmel controversy, Carr said that stations could face fines or license revocations if they continued to run Kimmel’s show.

Gomez, the only Democratic commissioner on the FCC, urged “broadcasters and their parent networks to stand strong against these unfounded attacks and continue exercising their constitutional rights without fear or favor.” She said that despite the pressure the FCC is exerting with its equal-time rule, “the First Amendment protects the right of daytime and late-night programs to cover newsworthy issues and express viewpoints without government interference.”

As for The View, Fox News said it was told by its source that ABC owner Disney “never made an equal-time filing to the FCC regarding Talarico’s recent appearance, which would implicitly indicate to the FCC that Disney believes The View is bona fide news and would be exempt from the policy.”

The equal-time rule, formally known as the Equal Opportunities Rule, generally requires that stations giving time to one political candidate must provide comparable time and placement to an opposing candidate if an opposing candidate makes a request. The rule has an exemption for candidate appearances on bona fide news programs, and entertainment talk shows have generally been treated as bona fide news programs for this purpose.

The FCC Media Bureau’s January 21 public notice to broadcast TV stations said that despite a 2006 decision in which the FCC exempted The Tonight Show with Jay Leno from the rule, current entertainment shows may not qualify for that exemption. “Importantly, the FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” the notice said.

The Media Bureau’s January 21 notice said the equal-time rule applies to broadcast TV stations because they “have been given access to a valuable public resource (namely, spectrum),” and that compliance with “these requirements is central to a broadcast licensee’s obligation to operate in the public interest.”

The FCC notice got this detail wrong, according to Harold Feld, a longtime telecom attorney who is senior VP of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. The equal-time rule actually applies to cable channels, too, he wrote in a January 29 blog post.

“Yes, contrary to what a number of people think, including, annoyingly, the Media Bureau which gets this wrong in its recent order, this is not a ‘public interest obligation’ for using spectrum,” Feld wrote. “It’s a conditional right of access (like leased access for cable) that members of Congress gave themselves (and other candidates) because they recognized the power of mass media to shape elections.” The US law applies both to broadcast stations using public spectrum and “community antenna television,” the old name for cable TV, Feld pointed out.

This doesn’t actually mean that people can file FCC complaints against the Fox News cable channel, though, Feld wrote. This is because the FCC “has consistently interpreted Section 315(c) since it was added as applying only to ‘local origination cablecasting,’ meaning locally originated programming and not the national cable channels that cable operators distribute as part of their bundle,” he wrote.

In any case, Feld said the Media Bureau’s “guidance ignores all of the other precedent that creates settled law as to how the FCC evaluates eligibility for an exemption on which broadcast shows have relied.” While the FCC cited its Jay Leno decision, Feld said the Leno ruling was “merely one of a long line of FCC decisions expanding the definition of ‘news interview’ and ‘news show.’”

The FCC started loosening its definitions of news shows and news interviews in the mid-1980s, Feld wrote. “In what many consider a landmark decision in 1984, the FCC held that the Phil Donahue Show—a daytime interview show—qualified as a bona fide news show and that interviews on the show were bona fide news interviews if they met the same criteria as those on traditional news shows,” he wrote. “The FCC rapidly broadened the range of shows to include mixed entertainment/news programs such as Good Morning America, Sally Jessy Raphael (much more ‘tabloid’ style), and Howard Stern (back when he was a ‘shock jock’ on broadcast).”

The long line of FCC decisions indicated that “the fact that a program included segments designed solely for entertainment did not automatically disqualify an appearance by a candidate from the exemption provided (a) the candidate was selected by the show for ‘newsworthiness;’ (b) the show was regularly scheduled (and therefore not a campaign event); and (c) the show controlled the interview questions and editing,” Feld wrote.

Feld said the FCC public notice indicates that under the current leadership, even traditional news shows might not be given the bona fide exemption if the FCC determines the show is “designed to ‘advance the candidacy’ of a particular individual.” If Carr punishes ABC or another network, the target might be able to prove in court that the FCC overstepped its authority. But as seen in the Kimmel episode, Carr doesn’t need to take any official action to cause a problem for a media company.

“As is often the case, the fact that a broadcaster would ultimately win if it ever got to court matters less than the pain selective enforcement causes,” Feld wrote.</div>

            <h2>Elon Musk Going Through It After Putting Mars City on Ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/elon-musk-spiraling-mars-city">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since at least the early 2000s, Elon Musk has been obsessed with the idea of colonizing Mars, a hostile and arid planet tens of millions of miles away.

In its earliest iteration, his plan was to refurbish an intercontinental ballistic missile to land on the Red Planet and unfurl a “Mars Oasis” — a small greenhouse that would grow plants and inspire humankind.

The greenhouse never materialized, but Musk’s ambitions steadily grew. Once he founded SpaceX, he dedicated the company to developing space travel tech to establish a self-sustaining colony on the planet. In 2017, he promised that the first Mars-bound mission would launch in 2022, with the first crewed spacecraft following two years later.

He’s clearly been personally obsessed with the idea, showing up at public events while wearing an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt. He’s also heavily criticized NASA for prioritizing the Moon, calling it a “distraction.”

But over the weekend, the mercurial CEO appeared to have had a major change of heart, announcing the company’s plans to colonize Mars were officially being put on ice for at least half a decade.

“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than ten years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” he tweeted.

It’s a flabbergasting reversal, and one that Musk seems to be working through publicly on his X feed. In one opaque tweet that appeared to be missing at least one important word, Musk reflected on his current emotional state.

“Life cannot just be about one sad thing after another,” he wrote while responding to his own tweet about SpaceX building a “system that allows anyone to travel to Moon.”

“There must also be things that make us super excited and inspired about the future,” he added. “This is one of [sic] things. Bigtime.”

It remains unclear whether he was talking about his excitement for building a city on the Moon or whether he was consoling himself over suddenly deprioritizing his decades-long dream.

Netizens on his social media network were caught off guard by the unusually glum missive.

“U ok?” reads one response, in the form of a meme.

The vast majority of the other most-liked replies pointed out that humanity was already dealing with enough problems back on Earth.

“Most people can’t afford to pay their bills, let alone even look towards the Moon,” one user wrote.

Musk, who has a long track record of imbibing in drugs like ketamine, appears to be going through it these days.

“Whoever said ‘money can’t buy happiness’ really knew what they were talking about,” he tweeted last week, a comment that drew little pity considering he is the richest man in the world.

Along with a slew of anti-immigrant posts, Musk has also been retweeting optimistic visualizations of what a Moon city might look like.

Rumors suggest SpaceX is planning to go public at a record-breaking valuation of $1.25 trillion, which could bring plenty of renewed scrutiny to Musk’s space colonization ambitions.

Perhaps he was simply trying to save face with his turn to the Moon. By massively shifting the goalposts, he could also have a better shot at attracting government contracts, which have kept SpaceX from bankruptcy since its earliest days.

For now, Mars is still technically on the table.

“That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about five to seven years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster,” Musk wrote in his announcement on Sunday.

However, SpaceX’s website currently still states that the company is “planning to launch the first Starships to Mars in 2026” — an enormously ambitious goal, considering the spacecraft has yet to successfully launch to space and stick the landing, let alone make it to anywhere past the immediate vicinity of Earth.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We may not have found any definitive proof of extraterrestrial life just yet, despite plenty of hope among scientists.

But if we were to ever come to an answer in the form of alien biology or technology, breaking the news to the general public could be much more difficult than one might think. As Time reports, the subject comes with an enormous amount of baggage, from preconceived notions of what alien life could look like from popular culture to fears over the implications of confirming we’re not alone.

“The search for life in space isn’t just a science question,” Portland State University Brianne Suldovsky told the magazine. “It’s a moral question, it’s a philosophical question, for some it’s a religious question.”

Suldovsky compared communicating the unknowns and managing fear to lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. Except, when it comes to xenobiology, “you’re talking about planetary protection.”

“Managing public fear is going to be incredibly challenging, however it is possible to communicate in a way that at least gives the public information about how afraid they should be and what they can do to protect themselves,” she said.

Though evidence of alien life remains elusive, it’s certainly not for a lack of trying by researchers. Just over the last couple of years, we’ve launched numerous missions to probe distant and theoretically habitable worlds. Most recently, NASA launched its Pandora Space Telescope, which was specifically designed to study transiting exoplanets for the building blocks of life.

Yet conveying any tantalizing clues about life beyond Earth would be a challenge, as data from these kinds of missions would be limited to spikes of molecules in spectrograph readings, leaving it to communicators and other intermediaries to make sense of the findings.

Fortunately, NASA has already come up with a way to distinguish between subtle evidence and glowing neon signs that alien life does indeed exist. The agency’s Confidence of Life Detection scale was designed to provide a “framework for evaluating potential evidence of life beyond Earth,” ranging from Level 1, a “detection of a signal known to result from a biological activity,” to Level 7, or “independent, follow-up observations of predicted biological behavior in the environment.”

Even with the existence of such a framework, the public continues to be bombarded with plenty of noise, particularly following the advent of AI and the ensuing flood of disinformation. Cutting through this noise to confidently convey the stakes involved and exactly how far we are along in confirming the existence of alien life could be mission critical.

In a 2024 white paper Suldovsky coauthored alongside a team of communications experts and scientists, researchers urged for “fostering inclusivity and collaborating with artists, educators, and communicators.”

“It is helpful to view astrobiology discoveries and communication as part of a broader landscape of public trust in science, education, and internal scientific challenges, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration, especially with experts in risk and uncertainty communication,” they wrote.

“The outcome of a future tentative discovery of life depends partly on these proactive efforts,” the researchers concluded.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At the height of his powers, and perhaps his amphetamine habit, legendary sci-fi author Philip K. Dick cranked out around thirty novels in two decades, along with what was probably several hundred short stories. These included enormously influential classics like “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,” “The Man in the High Castle,” and “A Scanner Darkly” — all the work of a man whose eclectic imagination was matched only by his paranoia, which forced him to constantly probe the nature of reality itself and our easily-manipulated ability to perceive it.

When their output reshapes entire genres and perhaps even pop culture at large, a writer’s prolificacycan fill us with awe. How can so much come out of one mind? But now, in an age of AI slop, quantity and speed simply arouses suspicion, because AI chatbots can help anyone produce the output of a PKD or a Stephen King. Graphomania used to require writers to write.

Consider the novelist Coral Hart. Starting last February, she began using Anthropic’s Claude AI to start churning out romance novels, becoming an invisible juggernaut of the smut world, according to a new interview with The New York Times.

Across 21 different pen names, Hart says she produced more than 200 romance novels last year and self-published them on Amazon, which has been drowning in AI slop for years now. None were huge hits on their own, per the NYT, but in all they sold around 50,000 copies, raking in six figures. While being interviewed on Zoom, she finished producing a book in just 45 minutes. Your average human writer doesn’t stand a chance, she says.

“If I can generate a book in a day, and you need six months to write a book, who’s going to win the race?” Hart told the NYT.

Hart, who was already a seasoned smut writer before turning to AI, also launched a business teaching other authors how to crank out novels with tech. Called “Plot Prose,” she’s claimed to have taught more than 1,600 people, including authors who were publicly against using the tech.

A large component of her lessons involve how to get around various chatbots’ guardrails, which make them resistant to writing anything too risque. She also focuses on trying to enliven the bots’ clunky prose. She recommended coming up with an “ick list” of words to tell the AI to avoid, which it would otherwise overuse. She also advised giving the AI a detailed list of sexual kinks, ranging from the generic, like dirty talk, to the highly specific, like, and we quote the NYT, “using a dead spouse’s old silk robe as a restraint during bondage.” “Be shameless,” was Hart’s advice.

You might not have a high opinion of romance paperbacks, but there’s undeniably an art to writing them, especially at the incredible quantities required to match smut readers’ voracious appetite. And like in any other genre, plenty of veteran authors are worried that they’re being drowned out by the AI-reliant newcomers. “It bogs down the publishing ecosystem that we all rely on to make a living,” Marie Force, a best-selling romance novelist who was alarmed to discover that her novels were used to train Claude without permission, told the NYT. “It makes it difficult for newer authors to be discovered, because the swamp is teeming with crap.”

The reporting describes Hart as an “evangelist” for AI. Even so, she’s not willing to put her professional reputation on the line for the tech. “Hart” is a pseudonym she uses to teach her AI courses, while she uses her real name for other publishing and coaching work. Her books are published under other pseudonyms, because she doesn’t want to disclose her AI usage due to the stigma. Her advice to “be shameless,” apparently, only applies insofar as it doesn’t expose you to being judged by your peers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, Bitcoin evangelists have grasped at straws trying to explain what their digital currency is actually good for. Is it a hedge against inflation, or maybe a decentralized alternative to corrupt banking systems? Perhaps it’s the future of digital commerce?

As it turns out, none of those really stuck, as extreme price swings and fees make the crypto a bad fit for most practical commercial purposes. The horrifying abduction of Nancy Guthrie, however, highlights perhaps the one persistent utility Bitcoin has been able to maintain: its place as the de facto global currency of crime.

As reported by Fortune, a purported ransom letter by the kidnappers of Today host Savannah Guthrie’s mother has demanded a $6 million Bitcoin payment in exchange for her return.

Unlike other ransom notes swirling around, there’s reason to suspect the demand is legit; it reportedly included details about the home Guthrie was kidnapped from and what she was wearing when she disappeared, along with a deadline for payment. Per TMZ, which received a copy of the note, the address of the Bitcoin wallet included in the ransom note is authentic.

Bitcoin’s draw for kidnappers is simple enough: as a blockchain currency, crypto is a much more secure payment option for criminals looking to protect their identity than fiat currency. While transactions across Bitcoin wallets can be tracked, it’s much easier for bad actors to obfuscate their identities with crypto compared to regular currency transferred online.

Guthrie’s kidnapping comes after a year of similar criminal acts with Bitcoin at the center. Back in May, a man named John Woeltz, also known as the “Crypto King of Kentucky” was arrested after he allegedly took an Italian man hostage. Woeltz’s plan seemed to be to torture the man to gain access to his Bitcoin wallet.

That same month, the daughter of French crypto mogul Pierre Noizat was the victim of a botched kidnapping attempt in the streets of Paris.

Whatever happens in the case of Nancy Guthrie remains to be seen — but it’s clear that her kidnappers chose Bitcoin for a reason.

            <div id="article-text">Turns out the sci-fi filmmakers got it backwards. All those ’70s and ’80s dystopias like “Rollerball,” “The Running Man,” “Death Race 2000,” imagined futures in which sports were full of gadgets and gimmicks like armored cars, rocket-powered motorbikes, and electrified arenas.

In reality, we got the opposite — the padding’s gone, and the high-tech monitoring equipment is nowhere to be found. Instead, we have “Run It Straight,” a brutally literal content in where two competitors, standing around 50 feet apart, sprint into each other at full-speed with the aim of knocking their opponent to the ground.

Maybe it makes a certain grim sense. In an era of plummeting attention spans and vertical video scrolls, who could expect viewers to sit through an entire football game when the core combat loop can be distilled down to a series of meaty collisions — especially when they’re probably busy placing bets on Polymarket?

The “sport,” if you decide to call it that, has its origins in the backyard wrestling tradition of Australia and New Zealand. It’s now represented by a handful of growing leagues like RunIt Championship League and Run Nation Championship.

The latter, RNC, recently sold over 5,000 tickets to its second annual national competition, an event that’s likely to sell out the 5,500-seat arena its being held in, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has reported.

“It’s how I play football, you know… the contact, the energy,” Australian rugby player and Run It Straight competitor Lochlan Piper told the outlet. “I like the violence of it.”

If the participants are excited to collide into each other like Rhinos jousting in the South Saharan steppe, medical experts aren’t convinced.

“Medical practitioners and the sporting community have become increasingly concerned about concussion, and aware of mild traumatic brain injury as sometimes not being mild and being a devastating part of people’s lives,” sports neurologist Rowena Mobbs told the ABC.

Though RNC’s organizer has sprinkled in a few rules to explicitly avoid head-to-head contact, Mobbs says no amount of bureaucracy can really make it safe to run straight into another person without padding or a helmet. “Certainly every time they run up and clash in that way, there’s likely to be at least a microscopic brain injury,” she said.

At least one 19-year old is already dead as a direct result of injuries sustained from Run It Straight. Still, some athletes don’t seem particularly phased.

“Every sport has their pros and cons, it’s a contact sport. I’m used to playing rugby league and used to that contact,” pro Rugby player Jayden young told ABC. “No one’s going into this sport thinking accidents or things can’t happen, we’re well aware of the sacrifices and the risks we’re taking.”

            <h2>Photo Shows Elon Musk at Jeffrey Epstein Dinner</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-09</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A newly revealed photo shows Elon Musk attending a “wild” dinner with Jeffrey Epstein and other powerful tech figures, including Mark Zuckerberg.

The picture, which appears to have been taken by Epstein himself, was contained in the latest tranche of documents released by the Department of Justice, and adds to the growing pile of evidence showing that Musk had much deeper ties to Epstein than he’s let on publicly.

Based on the photo, other files, and previous reporting from Vanity Fair, the dinner — which was already public knowledge — took place on August 2, 2015, and was hosted by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.

Epstein mentioned the dinner in an email sent to Peter Attia, a wellness and “longevity” influencer, on that same day, adding that along with Musk, Peter Thiel and Mark Zuckerberg would be in attendance. The next day, he emailed himself a photo taken at the dinner, with Musk and Zuckerberg in clear view.

He evidently thought highly of the occasion. Later that month, Epstein bragged about the dinner in an email sent to Tom Pritzker of the billionaire Pritzker family, calling it “wild.”

An email sent by Epstein’s personal assistant Lesley Groff on the morning of the dinner, with the subject “Reconfirming tomorrow’s dinner,” provides a list of attendees. It includes Musk, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, Hoffman and his wife Michelle Yee, Palantir cofounder Thiel, then-head of MIT Media Lab Joi Ito, MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden, and Musk’s college roommate Navaid Farooq.

The dinner was hosted in honor of Boyden by Hoffman, according to Vanity Fair, which first reported on the dinner in 2019. Musk, Hoffman, and Thiel were all considered to be part of the so-called “PayPal mafia,” a group of former heavies at the payment platform that went on to be huge figures in Silicon Valley.

On top of clearly contradicting Musk’s long-held insistence that he had little contact with Epstein, the dinner revelations also come as the SpaceX CEO has spent the past week or so blasting Hoffman for his apparent ties to the sex trafficker. Shortly after the newly released emails showed that Musk extensively corresponded with Epstein, Musk made a series of tweets highlighting emails claiming Hoffman had visited Epstein’s island and demanded an investigation. Hoffman fired back, sharing evidence of Musk’s own involvement, including an email in which Musk asks Epstein when his “wildest” party will be on the island. Musk continued to maintain his innocence throughout their catfight.

“The big difference between you and me, Reid, is that you went and I did not,” Musk fumed. He added that he “obviously didn’t anticipate anything actually shady, as I was bringing my wife [Talulah Riley] at the time.”

Notwithstanding that all these emails are taking place well after Epstein was first convicted of sex crimes against underage girls in 2008, some exchanges show that Musk was almost certainly aware, to some degree, of the kinds of parties Epstein was throwing. In a conversation on Christmas day 2012, Epstein cautioned Musk that the “ratio on my island might make Talilah [sic] uncomfortable,” using a euphemism for the number of women, or perhaps young girls, that would be there compared to the number of men. Musk responded: “Ratio is not a problem for Talulah.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/former-tesla-product-manager-wants-to-make-luxury-goods-impossible-to-fake-starting-with-a-chip/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The fake goods crisis cuts two ways. Luxury brands lose more than $30 billion a year to counterfeits, while buyers in the booming $210 billion second-hand market have no reliable way to verify that what they’re purchasing is genuine. Veritas wants to solve both problems with a solution that combines custom hardware and software.

The startup claims that it has developed a “hack-proof” chip that can’t be bypassed by devices like Flipper Zero, a widely available hacking tool that can be used to tamper with wireless systems. These chips are linked with digital certificates to verify the authenticity of the products.

Vertitas founder Luci Holland has experienced life as both a technologist and an artist. She has worked in different artistic mediums, including mixed media painting and metal sculpture. She has also worked at Tesla as a technical product manager and has held several business development, community growth, and product management roles at tech companies and venture funds.

Holland noted that traditionally, luxury goods makers use various symbols or physical marks to authenticate their products. However, with the growing demand for these goods, counterfeiters have learned to create convincing copies of these marks along with high-quality fake certificates. These goods are often called “superfakes.”

Holland mentioned that she spoke with maisons — established luxury fashion houses — that said that some of their locations had to stop authenticating goods because fakes were becoming too convincing to reliably detect. She said that drawing on her experience in both the tech and art worlds, she wanted to solve the problem.

“For me, as someone who has a background in being a designer and then also has experience in tech, I saw this problem and thought about the different ways we could solve it. I think what’s truly innovative is we’ve used and combined elements from both hardware and software to create this solution that helps protect brands in this way to convey the information,” she said.

“When I think of counterfeiting and I think of the most iconic and legacy brands,” she added, “a lot of these brands have been around for over 100, 150 years. These brands deserve the most advanced protection to protect these designs.”

Veritas worked with different designers to create a chip that is minimally disruptive to the product creation process. The chip is the size of a small gem and can easily be inserted even after a product is made without compromising its integrity. The chip incorporates NFC, or Near Field Communication — the same short-range wireless technology used in contactless payments. This means you can tap your smartphone on the item to verify its authenticity.

Holland said that for security purposes, the startup developed a custom coil and a bridge structure. If someone attempts to tamper with the product, the chip goes dormant and hides the codes related to the product. On the software side, the product information is linked to the Veritas back end, which monitors scanning behavior to prevent fraud. The company also creates a blockchain-based digital clone of the product for possible digital art gallery shows or metaverse activities.

The company didn’t reveal who it is working with, but said that brands can use its software suite to get information about all the chipped products, add team members to manage items and add product information along with the product story — details that can also be used to connect with their community. The startup said that some partners use this to engage customers through exclusive invitations or early access to new products.

While the counterfeiting market is big, Holland thinks the market still needs education around why it needs robust tech solutions.

“It is shocking to see that some of the shelf solutions, like NFC chips that brands are using, are actually so vulnerable and could easily be bypassed. This is the one thing most people don’t know, and we want to educate the ecosystem to adopt safer solutions,” Holland said.

Veritas said that it raised $1.75 million in pre-seed funding led by Seven Seven Six, along with Doordash co-founder Stanley Tang, skincare brand Reys’ co-founder Gloria Zhu, and former TechCrunch editor Josh Constine. The company plans to use the funding to expand its two-person team.

Seven Seven Six’s Alexis Ohanian said that he was impressed by the combination of design taste and technology expertise of Holland. He thinks that brands know that fake goods are a problem and are constantly looking for robust solutions.

“It’s absolutely an arms race [against fake goods makers], but we’re used to fighting those and consistently winning in tech — and luxury brands need all the help they can get,” Ohanian said.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/singapore-china-backed-hackers-targeted-largest-phone-companies-salt-typhoon/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Singapore’s government has blamed a known Chinese cyber-espionage group for targeting four of its top telecommunication companies as part of a months-long attack.

In a statement Monday, Singapore confirmed for the first time that the hackers, known as UNC3886, targeted the country’s telecoms infrastructure, including its largest companies: Singtel, StarHub, M1, and Simba Telecom. The government previously said that it was responding to an unspecified attack on its critical infrastructure.

While the intruders were able to breach and access some systems, they did not disrupt services or access personal information, said K. Shanmugam, the country’s coordinating minister for national security.

Google-owned cybersecurity unit Mandiant previously linked UNC3886 as an espionage group likely working on behalf of China. The Chinese government is known to conduct regular cyber-espionage operations, as well as prepositioning for disruptive attacks ahead of an anticipated invasion of Taiwan, which Beijing has routinely denied, per Reuters.

UNC3886 is known for exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in routers, firewalls, and virtualized environments, where cybersecurity tools that are designed to spot malware cannot typically reach. The hacking group has targeted the defense, technology, and telecom industries across the U.S. and the Asia-Pacific region.

In the case of the attack on Singapore’s top telcos, Shanmugam said the hackers used advanced tools, like rootkits, to gain long-term persistence to their systems.

“In one instance, they were able to gain limited access to critical systems but did not get far enough to have been able to disrupt services,” according to the government’s statement.

Per Reuters, the telcos said in a joint statement that the companies regularly face distributed denial-of-service and other malware attacks. “We adopt defence-in-depth mechanisms to protect our networks and conduct prompt remediation when any issues are detected,” the statement read.

The attacks on Singapore’s telcos follow similar but distinctly different attacks on hundreds of telecoms companies around the world in recent years, including in the United States. Multiple governments have linked these attacks to a China-backed group dubbed Salt Typhoon.

Singapore said the attack carried out by UNC3886 has “not resulted in the same extent of damage as cyberattacks elsewhere,” referring to the Salt Typhoon hacks.

            <h2>Vega raises $120M Series B to rethink how enterprises detect cyber threats</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/vega-raises-120m-series-b-to-rethink-how-enterprises-detect-cyber-threats/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Modern enterprises generate enormous amounts of security data, but legacy tools like Splunk still require companies to store all of it in one place before they can detect threats — a slow and costly process that’s increasingly breaking down in cloud environments where volumes are exploding and data lives everywhere.

AI cybersecurity startup Vega Security wants to flip that approach by running security where the data already lives, implementing in cloud services, data lakes, and existing storage systems. And the two-year-old firm just raised a $120 million Series B round to scale that vision, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.

Led by Accel with participation from Cyberstarts, Redpoint, and CRV, the new round nearly doubles Vega’s valuation to $700M and brings its total funding to $185 million, money the startup will use to further develop its AI-native security operations suite, beef out its go-to-market team, and expand globally.

Shay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega, told TechCrunch that the current operating model of the SIEM (security information and event management) — the dominant technology in this domain for the last two decades — is not only “crazy expensive,” but is also increasingly causing AI-native security operations to fail. In complex cloud environments, he says, the current model often increases exposure to threat actors.

“Vega has defined a new operating model that enables organizations to leverage the full potential of their enterprise data to achieve incident response readiness, without all the complexity, the cost, the drama,” Shay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega, told TechCrunch. “We want to simply enable them to reach AI-native detection response capability anywhere the data is, at scale.”

Like so many cybersecurity founders, Sandler did his time in the Israeli military’s cybersecurity unit before being one of the founding employees behind Granulate, which Intel acquired for $650 million in 2022. After a year at Intel, Sandler decided to “do it big time in the cybersecurity world.”

That pedigree is partly what attracted the attention of Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel. But it was also Vega’s ambitious approach to security management in a market that is already dominated by one player: Splunk.

Brasoveanu told TechCrunch that legacy SIEM companies like Splunk, which Cisco acquired in 2024 for $28 billion, have been criticized in recent years because their solutions are difficult to scale. They fail at processing the insane rise of data volumes driven by AI.

“Splunk and every contender since has always centralized the data, but by doing that you essentially hold the customer hostage,” Brasoveanu said.

However, sometimes it’s easier to hate the status quo than do the work of making a switch to a better alternative, a quandary any startup attempting to breach enterprise budgets understands. That’s why Sandler says Vega’s “North Star” was to not only build a solution that is more cost effective and better at threat detection, but “to make it no drama, as simple as possible for the biggest, most complex enterprises in the world to adopt it within minutes.”

Vega’s approach seems to be working. The 100-person startup has already signed multi-million-dollar contracts with banks, healthcare companies, and Fortune 500 firms, including cloud-heavy companies like Instacart.

“The only reason they would do that with a two-year-old startup is because the problem is so painful and other solutions on the market require an unrealistic expectation that the enterprise change the way they operate or do two years of data migrations,” Sandler said. “Vega enables them to just plug and play and achieve immediate detection response value.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">​If you thought 2025 couldn’t get any crazier, the streaming world had one more surprise up its sleeve before the year ended.

Netflix, already the largest streaming platform with over 325 million subscribers, took a bold step by acquiring Warner Bros.’ film and television studios, as well as HBO, HBO Max, and other assets. The deal, announced in early December, will bring together some of the most legendary franchises, such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC Comics properties, among others, all under one roof.

​The scale of this megadeal has stunned industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to disrupt Hollywood as we know it.

We’re here to break down exactly what’s happening with the Netflix–WBD deal, including the latest developments, what’s at stake, and what could come next.

​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) revealed it was exploring a potential sale after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.

For years, WBD has struggled under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by declining cable viewership and fierce competition from streaming platforms. These financial pressures forced the company to consider major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.

​The bidding process quickly became competitive. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant. Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with Paramount initially viewed as the frontrunner.

But ultimately, WBD’s board determined that Netflix’s offer was the most attractive, despite Paramount offering approximately $108 billion in cash. Paramount’s bid aimed to acquire the entire company, while Netflix’s offer focused specifically on the film, television, and streaming assets.

Additionally, Netflix recently amended its agreement to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per WBD share, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. The deal is valued at approximately $82.7 billion.

Even after Netflix emerged as the preferred buyer, tensions with Paramount remained high, as the rival company continued to pursue Warner Bros.’ assets.

​Paramount persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD for several months. Still, the board repeatedly rejected its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take.

In January, Paramount filed a lawsuit seeking more information about the Netflix deal.  A month later, the company sought to sweeten its deal by announcing it would offer a $0.25 per share “ticking fee” to WBD shareholders for each quarter the deal fails to close by December 31, 2026. It also said it would pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee if Netflix backs out.

The company continues to assert that its offer is far superior.

Given the unprecedented scale and market impact of the deal, regulatory scrutiny is intense and remains a significant obstacle to closing the transaction. Earlier this week, it was reported that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is scheduled to testify before a U.S. Senate committee about the deal, a move that highlights just how seriously lawmakers are taking these concerns.

In November, prominent lawmakers — Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal —  voiced their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.

Should regulators block the acquisition, Netflix would be obligated to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee. It remains unclear whether Warner Bros. would remain an independent company or revisit previous acquisition proposals.

​Reactions from the entertainment industry have been largely negative. The Writers Guild of America has been among the most vocal critics, demanding that the merger be blocked on antitrust grounds.

Additionally, insiders worry that the acquisition will squeeze independent creators and diverse voices out of the spotlight, ultimately narrowing the range of stories that get told. There are also widespread concerns about potential job losses and lower wages.

For creators and theaters, uncertainty remains around release windows. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has stated that all films planned for theatrical release through Warner Bros. will continue as scheduled. However, he also hinted that, over time, release windows may be shortened, with movies coming to streaming platforms sooner than before.

​What does all this mean if you’re a Netflix or HBO Max subscriber?

Netflix executives have reassured viewers that HBO’s operations will remain largely unchanged in the near term. At this stage, the company says it’s too early to make any definitive announcements about potential bundles or app integration.

Regarding pricing, Sarandos has stated that no immediate changes will occur during the regulatory approval period. However, subscribers should be aware that Netflix has historically raised subscription prices regularly, so price increases are possible once the acquisition is finalized. Netflix tends to hike its rates every year or two.

A WBD stockholder vote is expected around April, with the deal anticipated to close 12 to 18 months after that vote. However, regulatory approvals are still pending, and scrutiny could shape the final outcome.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As part of Safer Internet Day, Google unveiled updates to its “Results about you” and non-consensual explicit image removal tools.

The “Results about you” tool already allows users to remove Search results containing their phone number, email address, or home address, and it can now also be used to request the removal of results that include information such as a driver’s license, passport, or Social Security number, the company said in the update Tuesday.

You can access the tool in the Google app by tapping your Google account photo and selecting “Results about you.” If it’s your first time using the tool, you need to click “Get started” and then add the personal contact information you want to monitor. You’ll then be prompted to add your government ID numbers. Existing users can add their ID numbers and select which ones they want to monitor.

Once you’ve confirmed your details, Google will automatically monitor Search results and notify you if it finds results that contain your information. Google notes that removing this information from Search doesn’t remove it from the web entirely, but that doing so can help keep your information private.

The update is rolling out in the U.S. over the coming days. Google plans to bring it to additional regions in the future.

The tech giant also announced that it’s making it easier to request the removal of non-consensual explicit images on Search. Now, users just have to click on the three dots on an image, select “remove result,” then tap “It shows a sexual image of me.” Additionally, you no longer need to report images one by one, as you can now select and submit requests for multiple images from Search results using a single form. Users can also track the status of all requests in one place within the “Results about you” hub.

“We understand that removing existing content is only part of the solution,” Google wrote in its blog post. “For added protection, the new process allows you to opt-in to safeguards that will proactively filter out any additional explicit results that might appear in similar searches.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, is looking to repeal the 2009 “endangerment finding” that found greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and welfare, possibly as early as this week, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The EPA finding had set the legal basis for federal regulation of six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, and it has been unsuccessfully challenged since it was first instituted.

The move is almost certain to attract a number of lawsuits, and it could be years before the matter is settled. The EPA’s move will only affect tailpipe emissions for cars and trucks, though it’s expected that the Trump administration will use it to unwind regulations in other sectors like power plants and industrial facilities.

Legacy automakers, which pushed Trump to weaken fuel efficiency rules, notably did not push for the EPA to repeal the endangerment finding. Tesla went further, asking the EPA to maintain the finding, saying it was “based on a robust factual and scientific record.”

If the Trump administration is successful, the U.S. will be increasingly out of step with regulations in other advanced economies. Companies that do business across borders will need to develop different approaches for each market, increasing costs.

Automakers, in particular, are facing a future in which they’ll be forced to serve bifurcated markets, at least in the near term. Regulatory whiplash in the U.S. coupled with increasing competition from China has cost automakers tens of billions of dollars.

American automakers’ reliance on fossil fuel-powered trucks, in particular, has painted the domestic industry into a corner, providing addictive profits that distract from future-proofing their fleets in advance of seemingly inevitable competition from Chinese marques.

The Trump administration told the WSJ it expects the policy change to save more than $1 trillion, though it didn’t provide any evidence to back that figure up.

Climate change is expected to cost far more. The Congressional Budget Office found that nearly $1 trillion worth of real estate is threatened by rising sea levels, and mortality rates in the U.S. could be 2% higher if global warming isn’t abated. Another study, published in 2024, found that climate change could trim global GDP by 17% by 2050, the equivalent of $38 trillion per year.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Few novelists today can match Lionel Shriver for topical range. The author of 18 books, she is best known for her 2003 novel, We Need to Talk About Kevin, about a teenager who murders several of his classmates. The nine novels that followed include a clever critique of the American health-care system (So Much for That, 2010), a family drama about the obesity epidemic (Big Brother, 2013), an economic dystopia (The Mandibles, 2016), a satiric look at the growing popularity of extreme endurance sports (The Motion of the Body Through Space, 2020), and an exploration of the social costs imposed by increased longevity (Should We Stay or Should We Go, 2021).

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

In her latest, A Better Life, Shriver tackles immigration and goes off the rails, which makes this an ideal moment to take stock of her novelistic gifts and ambitions. As her subjects suggest, she is not the kind of writer whose fiction features precious lyricism or pseudo-intellectual or solipsistic musings. She has a wry observational intelligence that propels her well beyond her personal orbit. She is also adept at unpacking psychological states and analyzing relationships with almost clinical incisiveness. Her writing is witty, and startlingly precise. We Need to Talk About Kevin describes a man as a “stringy cerebral type whose skittering metabolism burns chickpea concoctions at a ferocious rate.”

Shriver’s novels teem with well-chosen observations about ordinary life, the sort that some literary novels skip: whether characters watch what they eat; what exercise routine they favor (a disconcertingly large proportion of them do calisthenics daily); how long they stay when they visit; whether they dominate conversation or ask questions of others. She devises interesting plots too. Her protagonists do things, which is not to say they do outlandish or unbelievable things to facilitate crude plot twists.

Shriver tends to see the world as being divided between those who work hard and support others—both in their personal life and through the taxes they are forced to pay—and those who take advantage of such people. The characters who have her sympathy practice what the protagonist of her 2007 novel, The Post-Birthday World, calls “mental kindness.” That is, they try to be charitable in their assessments of others, even in the privacy of their thoughts. As a novelist, Shriver holds herself to the same standard. Her tone tends toward the caustic, and she doesn’t give central characters a pass when they behave badly, but she is fair to them. She shows us their reasons, even when they behave in ways that she clearly finds irritating, such as going all in on extreme endurance sports in their mid-60s.

Her more comic novels do, however, too often include one-dimensionally terrible minor characters (a pretentious filmmaker who mooches off her brother in So Much for That, a born-again woman who uses Christianity to feel superior to others in The Motion of the Body Through Space ); they seem to exist only so Shriver can skewer them. But these takedowns of generally easy targets are atypical. Shriver focuses most of her fictional energies on characters who are more generously, and more plausibly, drawn and thus more deserving of her—and our—interest.

In her non-novelist capacity as, among other things, a columnist for the British magazine The Spectator, Shriver enjoys a reputation as a provocateur and a contrarian: economically conservative (“unenthusiastic about widespread dependency on the state,” as she once put it) while progressive in her social views, though anti-“woke” and critical of the #MeToo movement. Her decision to briefly wear a sombrero at a writers’ festival in 2016, to signal her disapproval of the then-faddish concept of “cultural appropriation,” caused a stir in literary circles.

But however controversial Shriver is as a commentator, her novels have never been mere vehicles for her politics. Take The Mandibles, a book that revolves around the national debt, long a bugbear of hers. This might seem a particularly wonkish fixation, unlikely to inspire even passable fiction, but Shriver—whether or not you agree with her views on the underlying macroeconomics (I don’t)—delivers a clever pillorying of Americans’ belief that our place at the top of the international hierarchy is both deserved and permanent. In the novel’s near-future setting, the rest of the world abruptly decides that it will no longer underwrite the United States’ debt. By the end of the book, the U.S. is just like any other developing country, and Mexicans speak derisively of white Ameritrash. The granularity of Shriver’s vision reflects a mind as skilled at analyzing the reverberations of monetary policy in daily life as at depicting interiority. It also makes for a very entertaining read.

Which is to say that if any contemporary American novelist could write compelling fiction about immigration policy—perhaps the single most important issue in national politics—it would probably be Shriver. It’s certainly very much like her to try. And it is unlike her to fall short on just about every count I’ve described. A Better Life, her new novel, fails not because its politics are out of step with progressive opinion. If that were sufficient to doom a novel, The Mandibles wouldn’t have met with the praise it did a decade ago. Nor is the main problem that A Better Life reads like an op-ed column thinly disguised as a novel, although that’s part of the trouble.

A Better Life tackles what Shriver portrays as the ruinous immigration policies of the Biden years. Nico, the book’s 26-year-old protagonist, lives with his divorced mother, Gloria, rent-free in the well-appointed basement of his childhood home in Brooklyn (now worth $2.5 million). He hasn’t had a job since he graduated from college and spends his days scrolling through the right-coded precincts of the manosphere. An inheritance from his grandfather enables beer and takeout when the mood strikes. As the novel opens, he’s bitterly relocating to his old, cramped bedroom upstairs: Gloria has decided to house a female asylum seeker in his former lair, through a city-sponsored program that Shriver apparently modeled on a plan floated but never enacted under former New York Mayor Eric Adams.

Having an immigrant boarder suits both Gloria’s progressive politics and her pocketbook: The city will pay her more than $3,000 a month. An artist who spends most of her time volunteering at a nearby makeshift shelter for immigrants, she can use the money. Nico’s two sisters share their mother’s heartfelt pro-immigration views and support her decision. Nico does neither. But the step Gloria takes at least gives him a sense of purpose; already leaning toward a keep-them-out position, he becomes fixated on it.

He rails about progressive-run cities, such as New York, that promise new arrivals “free digs, free grub, and free Wi-Fi,” perks guaranteed to ensure that yet more people keep coming. Sounding like a cranky 60-something, he complains about the state of bike lanes: “Their overwhelmingly Hispanic riders didn’t glance over their shoulders before overtaking or signal when they were making a turn.” Many of these bikers are out making deliveries, of course. (It’s unclear why Nico thinks so many immigrants work these jobs when they are, according to him, given so many freebies by the city.)

In outline, the premise seems primed for satire: A young man who lives off his mother is obsessed with immigrants who he thinks are living off hardworking American taxpayers. Indeed, A Better Life is full of passages that read as if they are meant to be send-ups of blinkered ideologues: “Over tequila shots, Vernon launched into a set piece about how, while populations in the West were heading into gradual decline, Africa was the exception, certain to rise from 1.4 billion this year to 2.5 billion by midcentury.”

But Vernon, a documentarian and a longtime friend of Nico’s parents, is not drawn as a satirical figure; rather, we are intended to see him as bombastic but appealing—warm, gregarious, freethinking, and probably correct in his concern about Western decline. This tone deafness is characteristic of the novel, which seems to want to operate as a work of realist fiction dealing with people whose fates we’re supposed to care about, no matter how thinly portrayed or unattractive they are.

Nico is the primary example, despite the twist Shriver offers on the stereotypical angry young male reactionary: He’s not a jobless flyover-country type; he’s a white man reared in the upper-middle-class meritocracy. A member of the coastal elite, he’s been at once coddled and academically driven, only to then fail (thanks to DEI policies) to get into even an Ivy-adjacent school. But this is sociology, not psychology—as characterization, it’s merely a starting point, as a novelist of Shriver’s skill certainly knows.

The book never goes deeper. Nico’s inner life is almost entirely devoted to thinking about immigration as a public crisis and about Martine, the Honduran asylum seeker who has moved into his mother’s basement. Nor do his daily interactions prompt any sort of lively reflection. The bulk of the book’s dialogue consists of long discussions of the issue initiated by Nico with whomever he encounters. Whatever merit the material might have as opinion-page filler, as conversation, it’s leaden.

The book’s plot is more compelling than its dialogue—but only because it’s melodramatic. Martine turns out to have some troubling associates, who first make themselves at home in the household and then commandeer it. As Martine taunts Nico: “Other people take your nice country, they take your nice soft life. Because you no fight.” The situation comes to a head when Nico does try to fight back.

Picture him in concert with a bunch of late-middle-age white men (including his father and Vernon) in ski masks, toting guns; a dead body; an unreliable witness to the crime—I’ll stop here, though there’s more. The climactic conclusion is action-packed, yes, but getting invested is hard when the characters are little more than mouthpieces in service to a pat homeland-in-danger metaphor—prolix zealots like Nico and Vernon, naive progressives like Gloria, and opportunistic new arrivals ready to seize their moment when she throws her doors wide open.

Perhaps Shriver envisioned the book’s exploration of Nico’s frustration as a warning to liberals—a novelization of one of those “this is how we got Trump” articles. But prescient it is not: In the current moment, A Better Life reads like a dour morality tale from a bygone civilization, one in which Americans never imagined they’d be reeling at images of masked ICE agents pulling day laborers off the streets. If you fed ChatGPT a Fox News segment about criminal immigrants and the progressive politicians who enable them and instructed it to come up with a Lionel Shriver novel, I’m not sure the result would be much worse. The book’s only mystery, really, is that a writer of Shriver’s talent bothered to churn it out, however up in arms she may have been about the nation’s immigration policies.

Though puncturing liberal pieties on a subject like this one is certainly on-brand for Shriver, the newsy subjects that have served as catalysts for her fiction have generally operated as springboards, not destinations—a way into stories that are fundamentally character-driven and focused on relationships. A Better Life doesn’t just call attention to the inadequacy of topicality on its own to propel a novel; its failure serves as a reminder of Shriver’s true strength.

She has excelled at more than the deft depiction of inner life, a staple of successful domestic fiction. She is one of the most astute portraitists of marriage working today. The long-term potential as well as the perils of intimacy were central themes even in her debut novel, The Female of the Species (1987). When Shriver wrote of The Post-Birthday World ’s protagonist that “having a man who loved her and whom she loved in return was the most important thing in Irina’s life,” she described a disposition shared by many of her main characters, most notably Eva Khatchadourian, the narrator of her signature work, We Need to Talk About Kevin. On its face a compassionate exploration of post-Columbine sociopathic darkness, it is also a brutally poignant story of a marriage.

Eva’s romance with her husband, Franklin Plaskett, delights and amazes her. Very mixed feelings about motherhood kick in when she gets pregnant—and it doesn’t help that Kevin is a difficult baby and then boy. For a good portion of the novel, readers are apt to tack back and forth on the questions that explicitly animate it: Is Eva’s ambivalence the reason Kevin turned out as he did? Was she not loving enough? Or was Kevin just born that way—and the social tendency to blame mothers prompts us to find fault in Eva?

What makes the novel so unusual, however, is that its most emotionally compelling drama is submerged, and is one that Eva herself never fully recognizes: Her attachment to the marriage is doing profound damage, forcing her to choose between Franklin’s affection and her ability to speak truthfully about what she sees, what she fears. If she isn’t a good mother, it’s not because she doesn’t love Kevin enough—it’s because she loves her husband too much, and he can’t or won’t acknowledge that there is anything worrisome about their son.

Subtle, painful, with central characters who are both slippery and beautifully drawn, the book manages one of fiction’s most elusive feats. It seduces us into viewing the world as Eva does, only to then show us that we, too, have fallen prey to a willful ignorance of the rot in a marriage she values so much.

Shriver has written other original novels about marriage and family. But We Need to Talk About Kevin stands out for its elegant construction; the cool austerity of its prose, which is intimate without being cloying or chatty; and its sheer narrative power. Its artful evocation of self-deception recalls 20th-century classics about marriage such as Richard Yates’s Revolutionary Road and Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf ?

To pull off something close to pure ventriloquism, leaving Eva’s perspective and mood to dictate the tone, as Shriver does, is the sort of imaginative triumph that is a rarity for any author, as she knows. In The Mandibles, a young man sees that his 90-something great-aunt, a formerly famous writer, is unhappy, and he speculates as to why. “You want to write with the same fire that lit you up when you were writing Better Late Than,” he says, naming her unmatched novel. And then he finishes the thought: “the kind of fire that hardly anyone gets to keep.”

            <div id="article-text">For The Atlantic’s March cover story, “What’s the Worst That Could Happen?,” staff writer Josh Tyrangiel examines AI and the future of work. Reporting from Silicon Valley; Washington, D.C.; and beyond, Tyrangiel interviewed central bankers and labor economists, AI executives and union leaders, Cabinet secretaries and populist political figures including Bernie Sanders and Steve Bannon. And the consensus among many, even those who may agree on almost nothing, when it comes to AI and employment: We’re not ready for this, and no one’s in charge.  The main question animating Tyrangiel’s reporting is whether and how quickly workers ought to expect artificial intelligence to take their jobs. He writes that an exact prediction is hard to pin down: It’s perhaps less immediate than many of the technology’s biggest boosters might hope, but AI still represents a development that will fundamentally alter our society, and governments ought to be thinking seriously about how to protect their constituents from the inevitable shock waves.  Trying to measure the impact of AI with today’s data can feel like driving while looking only in the rearview mirror––“plenty dangerous if the road stays straight, catastrophic if it doesn’t.” Tyrangiel writes: “AI is already transforming work, one delegated task at a time. If the transformation unfolds slowly enough and the economy adjusts quickly enough, the economists may be right: We’ll be fine. Or better. But if AI triggers a rapid reorganization of work—compressing years of change into months, affecting roughly 40 percent of jobs worldwide, as the International Monetary Fund projects—the consequences will not stop at the economy. They will test political institutions that have already shown how brittle they can be.” And if mass job loss should come, it doesn’t just mean unemployment, “it means missed loan payments, cascading defaults, shrinking consumer demand, and the kind of self-reinforcing downturn that can transform a shock into a crisis, and a crisis into the decline of an empire.”  Tyrangiel writes that “AI is just a newborn. It may grow up to transform our lives in unimaginably good ways. But it has also introduced profound questions about safety, inequality, and the viability of a wage-labor system that, despite its flaws, spawned the most prosperous society in human history. And there’s no sign—none—that our political system is equipped to deal with what’s coming. Which means the deepest challenge AI poses may not be to jobs at all.” Tyrangiel concludes that coming to a solution around AI will take a collective effort: “America would be better off if its elites could act responsibly without being terrified. If CEOs remembered that citizens are a kind of shareholder, too. If economists tried to model the future before it arrives in their rearview mirror. If politicians chose their constituents’ jobs over their own. None of this requires revolution. It requires everyone to do the jobs they already have, just better.”  Josh Tyrangiel’s “What’s the Worst That Could Happen?” has published at TheAtlantic.com.

            <h2>The One Tiny Problem With Trump’s Affordability Agenda</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The people want affordability, and Donald Trump knows it. After initially calling the concept a “hoax,” the president has begun unveiling his own agenda to bring down prices and increase Americans’ purchasing power. Somewhat astoundingly, each of his proposals, if enacted, would be more likely to make the affordability problem worse, not better.

Trump’s signature idea is simply to give people money. In November, he promised to send out a “tariff dividend” of $2,000 to all but the highest-earning Americans sometime in 2026. This plan, which he has continued to promote, would almost certainly require an act of Congress, meaning that it’s unlikely to happen. That’s a good thing. Handing out free money would make voters happy in the short term but would ultimately backfire. This is because a massive one-time influx of cash is likely to create far more demand than the economy can possibly meet. Consumer spending is already strong, unemployment is already low, and inflation is still too high. “I’m usually all for giving people money,” Natasha Sarin, the president of the Yale Budget Lab, told me. “But a move this dramatic in our current macroeconomic environment is a recipe for inflation.”

America has very recent experience with this dynamic. In the spring of 2021, the Biden administration passed a spending package that included sending out more than 150 million stimulus checks of up to $1,400, fulfilling a campaign promise. When the country reopened, that money flowed into an economy whose supply chains were still disrupted. With too much money chasing too few goods, inflation took off. The spending package wasn’t the main cause of post-pandemic inflation—which, after all, occurred around the world—but economists broadly agree that it pushed inflation up by at least a few percentage points. You might think that Trump, of all people, would have internalized this lesson, given that he spent much of his 2024 campaign blaming inflation on Biden’s reckless spending.

Rogé Karma: The debate that will determine how Democrats govern next time

If sending out checks is a bad idea, what about tackling the housing crisis? Last month, Trump issued an executive order directing various government agencies to draft regulatory guidelines and Congress to write legislation that would prevent corporate investors from purchasing single-family homes. “Hardworking young families cannot effectively compete for starter homes with Wall Street firms and their vast resources,” the order declares. “My Administration will take decisive action to stop Wall Street from treating America’s neighborhoods like a trading floor and empower American families to own their homes.”

The notion that Wall Street is to blame for high housing costs is widespread among left-wing populists. It is also wrong. Large institutional investors, typically defined as those owning more than 1,000 homes, control just 0.5 percent of the single-family housing stock in the country. (The executive order itself doesn’t actually define what qualifies as an institutional investor.) That share is higher in specific neighborhoods in certain cities, including Cleveland, St. Louis, and Baltimore—which, notably, are among the places where housing costs haven’t gotten out of control. Meanwhile, the cities that have experienced the largest price increases over the past 15 years, such as San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles, have some of the lowest percentages of institutional investment.

The weight of the evidence suggests that institutional investors actually make single-family homes more affordable. It is true that when a Wall Street firm buys a home, it decreases the total number of homes for sale, which pushes home-purchase prices up. But it also increases the number of homes available for rent, which pushes rental prices down. In this sense, institutional investment is functionally a downward redistribution of wealth from homebuyers to home renters. One recent study found that single-family-home rents in Atlanta would have been 2.4 percent higher without the presence of institutional investors, costing renter households nearly $3,000 a year on average. Another study, which analyzed a wide range of otherwise similar metro areas that had varying levels of institutional investment, found that these two forces are not symmetric. Institutional buyers push rents down slightly more than they push home prices up.

A ban on institutional investors, in other words, would have basically no impact on overall home prices at the national level while likely raising rents in the places where investment is most concentrated. Perhaps that is part of the appeal for Trump, who seems to want credit for tackling high housing costs without doing anything to actually lower them. “I don’t want to drive housing prices down,” the president admitted at a recent Cabinet meeting. “I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes.”

In yet another rebrand of a left-wing populist idea, Trump has also called on Congress to pass a one-year cap of 10 percent on credit-card interest rates. Consumers spend about $150 billion every year paying off interest on their credit cards. Rates average about 20 percent and can reach as high as 35 or 40 percent. In theory, capping the rate at 10 percent would save consumers tens of billions of dollars while redistributing wealth from big banks and their shareholders to the low-income consumers who typically carry credit-card debt.

James Surowiecki: Trump doesn’t understand inflation

The success of the proposal, however, hinges on how exactly the credit-card industry responds to the price cap. A major reason credit-card companies charge such high interest rates in the first place is to cover the losses incurred when cardholders don’t pay their balances. Some proponents argue that if those interest rates were capped, banks could simply absorb those losses by accepting lower profits or slashing their marketing budgets. But several studies have found that banks tend to respond to even small regulatory changes to the interest rates they can charge by issuing less credit to their highest-risk borrowers. There might be a point at which that’s worth the trade-off—but a cap as drastic as 10 percent is probably far past that sweet spot. “The literature is really clear on this,” Sarin, who specializes in banking regulation and recently co-authored a paper on the subject, said. “When you reduce how much banks can charge, you increase their risk—and that changes who they are willing to lend to in the first place.”

The individuals who would be most likely to lose credit-card access in this scenario—borrowers with low credit scores—are the same people who tend to rely on short-term debt to make essential purchases, such as groceries, gas, and medical bills. Without credit cards, they would likely be forced to rely on more expensive, less regulated, options such as payday loans, which can come with rates as high as 400 to 500 percent. Fear of that outcome may be why Trump has proposed limiting the cap to a single year. But a temporary version runs into another problem: Once the cap expires, credit-card companies will likely respond by jacking up their interest rates even higher than before to make up for their losses. “It’s not like this would put Chase or Bank of America out of business,” Ted Rossman, an analyst at Bankrate, a company that helps consumers compare credit cards, told me. “But it would be a huge hit to the industry. And it would be a huge hit to the consumers who depend on credit cards the most.”

Even in the one area in which Trump has notably succeeded at lowering some prices, he has still managed to make life less affordable overall. Last year, his administration announced a series of deals with pharmaceutical companies to lower prices of a few dozen drugs, including some eye-popping decreases of anywhere from 55 to 98 percent. But as with drug commercials, one must pay attention to the fine print. In order to qualify for the discounts, individuals must buy the drugs directly from the manufacturer through a government-run platform called TrumpRx and, crucially, cannot use insurance to do so, making the program basically irrelevant for 85 percent of Americans. (The order also claims that the new prices will be made available to “every State Medicaid program,” but there is no evidence that has happened or will.)

Nicholas Florko: The real winner of TrumpRx

These one-off deals haven’t altered the behavior of the pharmaceutical industry. Drug companies raised the prices of nearly 1,000 drugs at the beginning of this year, and the median overall increase, about 4 percent, was the exact same amount they raised prices by the prior year. The Trump administration has also handed them some major concessions. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law last year includes a provision that exempts or delays several drugs, including some of the most popular and expensive cancer medications, from having to participate in price negotiations through Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that taxpayers will pay $8.8 billion more over 10 years for these drugs relative to what they would have paid if negotiations had taken place on schedule.

Most of the real solutions to the affordability problem, such as building more housing and reforming the health-care system, would require years of sustained effort, large investments, and hard political trade-offs. (The obvious exception would be the repeal of Trump’s global tariffs, which the president could do tomorrow.) But voters want affordability right now and have proved that they are willing to throw out politicians who don’t deliver it. Trump’s response to this has been to float policies that promise a quick hit of relief. He might not be operating in good faith, but whatever president succeeds him will have to wrangle with the same dilemma.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/rfk-jack-schlossberg-pelosi-kennedy/685941/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One lesson that can be drawn from the second Trump administration is that being a member of the Kennedy family does not qualify you for public service. Yet many Camelot-besotted Democrats remain stubbornly immune to this conclusion.

One of them appears to be Nancy Pelosi, the normally shrewd former House speaker, who reportedly plans to endorse Jack Schlossberg, John F. Kennedy’s grandson, for an open seat in New York’s Twelfth Congressional District.

“This moment calls for leaders who understand the stakes and how to deliver for the people they serve,” Pelosi said in a statement viewed by The New York Times before its release.

How that describes Schlossberg, a 33-year-old social-media personality, is difficult to understand. As a Kennedy, Schlossberg has been a lifelong celebrity in the traditional definition of the word—a person who is famous for being famous. He’s been profiled in Town & Country, on the Today show, in The Washington Post, and in The New York Times. The theme of this coverage is that Schlossberg (1) is a Kennedy, (2) is handsome, and (3) posts lots of edgy content on social media. To suggest that he has failed upward would give him too much credit because failing requires having been entrusted with some responsibility in the first place.

Schlossberg’s most important role to date came when Vogue hired him to write about the presidential campaign. At the time, it was widely seen as a stunt hire for which he was out of his depth. “Is he qualified to be a political correspondent?,” asked a New York Times story reporting on the hire.

From the January 2026 Issue: Why is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. so convinced he’s right?

His written output has not put those doubts to rest. Schlossberg’s oeuvre at Vogue is indistinguishable either in content or in style from something that could have been produced by an adequately trained high-school student. A representative passage from his campaign coverage:

The first live TV debate was in 1960, when JFK’s winning smile and Florida tan outshined Nixon’s sweaty 5 o’clock shadow. It was an instant hit—since then, live TV debates have spread to democracies around the world. Nothin’ better than watching people fight, don’t you think?

Same as ever, this election will be decided by turnout in specific places. Specifically, voters in a handful of swing states—Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Georgia—will decide our future.

It was utterly banal, but at least there wasn’t much of it. He wrote just seven short, insight-free columns. Nobody reading these pieces sans byline would have suspected they were catching a glimpse of a future leader of the country. Even if he had produced a body of penetrating analysis, it would hardly prepare him for national office. Yet Schlossberg now stands a plausible, perhaps strong, chance of winning the Democratic primary (and thus the general election).

New York’s Twelfth, in the heart of Manhattan, probably has more Democrats qualified to serve in national leadership than any congressional district in America. Accordingly, the list of potential candidates is already in the double digits. The winner, by dint of representing the nation’s media capital, is likely to have an outsize role in the national debate. The whole trick in this crowded field will be standing out. Schlossberg, by virtue of his attention-grabbing lineage and Pelosi’s endorsement, now has a giant advantage over a long list of genuinely accomplished rivals.

We don’t need to get too precious about the decline of standards in the House. Congress’s lower chamber has always contained its share of mediocrities. Although some House members use their position to develop expertise, legislate, or conduct oversight, the bare minimum for the job in both parties has always been to show up and vote the way the party leadership tells you, and refrain from saying or doing anything scandalous.

Perhaps Pelosi figures one of those seat warmers might as well be a Kennedy. And there certainly are some Kennedys up to the job of holding an overwhelmingly Democratic congressional district.

The trouble is that although Democrats like Pelosi apparently continue to see membership in the Kennedy clan, symbolized by the martyred president and his would-have-been-president brother, as a positive signal of judgment and reliability, it is in fact a strongly negative one. As Josh Barro argued two and a half years ago, a disquieting number of Kennedy men have injured or killed their romantic partners or themselves out of drunkenness and stupidity. Ted Kennedy and Joseph P. Kennedy II, respectively, killed and paralyzed a female passenger in a car crash. Michael Kennedy died playing football while skiing—two sports the Kennedys apparently decided to combine as a kind of tradition—after having endured a scandalous affair with the family babysitter, whom he claimed was 16 years old when they began having sex. Michael Skakel was convicted of killing Martha Moxley, but freed from prison after a court deemed his lawyer incompetent. The Kennedys are victims not only of misfortune, but also their own bad judgment.

From the January 1994 issue: The cultural meaning of the Kennedys

Several Kennedys have served honorably and without scandal. But if you had to pick as your member of Congress a Kennedy male or a random person living in the district, you’re probably safer with the latter.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is bad in ways both characterological and ideological that many Democrats failed to fully recognize until he endorsed Trump and joined his administration, where he has unleashed a generational catastrophe in public health. His legacy in this field is arguably more consequential than the entire Kennedy presidency, which accomplished precious little.

Instead of snapping Democrats out of their Kennedy trance, RFK Jr.’s defection to the Republican Party stung Democrats into redoubling their commitment to reclaim their Kennedy birthright. Schlossberg spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2024 as JFK’s grandson, the implicit message of his speech being that Kennedy followers ought to listen to Democrats, as true heirs to Camelot, rather than the pretender, RFK Jr. The transcript of this speech is actually one of the seven contributions on Schlossberg’s Vogue author page.

In a better world, the realization that RFK Jr. is a crank and moral cretin would have liberated Democrats from their fixation with the Kennedy mythos. The grief over the assassinations of JFK and Robert F. Kennedy Sr. inspired the party to search again and again for heirs to the throne, a practice that resolved into decades of affirmative action for their decreasingly talented offspring.

The Democratic Party is divided between a wing that holds “No Kings” rallies and a wing that holds anti-oligarchy rallies. Perhaps one thing both can agree on is that the party doesn’t need its own royal family.</div>

            <h2>A Foreign Policy Worse Than Regime Change</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/trump-foreign-policy-intervention/685933/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Donald Trump has achieved an unlikely redemption: By pursuing a shambolic foreign policy, he has made the bygone days of “regime change” look restrained, strategic, and pragmatic by comparison.

Trump campaigned in 2024 saying he would begin “no new wars,” eschew “regime change” and “nation building,” and generally prioritize domestic policy over foreign affairs. No more Coalition Provisional Authority, as in Iraq. No more extended U.S. military deployments, as in Afghanistan.

But Trump has instead opted for global buccaneering: attacking Islamic terrorists in Nigeria, launching pinprick swipes at Yemen’s Houthis, and seeking a massive, elusive trade deal with China. He has inserted himself as a would-be governing force into lands as diverse as Venezuela, the Gaza Strip, and Greenland. He has done so inconsistently and incoherently, unguided by theory or history, improvising at will, painting with real-estate salesmanship futures that bear little connection to reality and threaten potentially disastrous consequences for America if he fails.

This is much worse as a policy model than “regime change” ever was. At least regime change had some logic behind it: If reforming the behavior of a hostile regime is impossible, replace it with one more friendly and, hopefully, more democratic. Do so when the likely benefits outweigh the likely costs.

Trump’s intervention in Venezuela doesn’t come close to meeting this bar. Both the Biden and the Trump administrations recognized Edmundo González as Venezuela’s legitimate president, the winner of the 2024 election that Nicolás Maduro stole. Removing the usurpers and replacing them with a legitimate, democratically elected government would have been a justifiable choice.

But that’s not what Trump did. He removed Maduro, yes, but he kept the rest of Maduro’s gang, such as Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, in place. Meanwhile, he sidelined the opposition, leaving them without the necessary respect and power to stabilize and ultimately govern. One can certainly debate from case to case what part of any given “regime” must be eliminated, and what is simply the civil bureaucracy that should remain functional. In hindsight, America’s de-Baathification program in Iraq overdid the change. In Venezuela, Trump barely scratched the surface. Additionally, he has posted on Truth Social an image of himself as the acting president of Venezuela and another that showed Venezuela as U.S. territory (and Canada and Greenland, too, for that matter).

None of this provides the stability that Venezuela needs to encourage foreign investment in its oil sector and produce revenues that could revive the economy and thereby facilitate a transition to democratic rule. Investors like to see, among other things, at least a rudimentary rule-of-law society, which doesn’t exist under the present regime. Exxon’s CEO, Darren Woods, who may know more about the oil business than Trump, declared the country “uninvestable.” Some Venezuelan oil previously blocked from export by the U.S. has now been sold, and the proceeds, which were deposited into a Qatari bank account, are now being transferred to Venezuela’s banks. By authorizing the provision of funds to Delcy Rodríguez and her government, Trump’s administration is strengthening Rodríguez’s regime at the opposition’s expense. How can that end well?

Trump has no answer. By contrast, in the Gaza Strip, he has an answer that would make 19th-century imperialists blush. Without any evidence that Hamas is prepared to allow the demilitarization of Gaza, Trump has formed, and plans to chair and essentially control, a “Board of Peace,” currently composed of approximately 20 governments. Most European countries have declined to join (with a few exceptions including Hungary, Belarus, and Bulgaria); Russia may be a member, or maybe not; China has been invited but is checking its dance card; Israel joined but is very unhappy; and Canada has been disinvited. The board is meant to oversee everything in Trump’s faltering Middle East peace plan, following the release of Israeli hostages.

Trump appears to have near-total control over the board’s decisions, which implies a desire to personally rule over Gaza, especially given that the board’s “executive committee” includes his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his special envoy to the Middle East, the New York real-estate developer Steve Witkoff. Trump called for initial dues of $1 billion, which, if each new member chipped in, would amount to an impressive, unaccountable slush fund. Without, however, first achieving Hamas’s disarmament and creating some sort of international peacekeeping force to provide security, there will never be a new eastern-Mediterranean Riviera. Nothing about these dreams bears any relationship to Gaza’s current reality.

Trump seems to have even greater ambitions for the board, such as undertaking as yet unspecified good works in Ukraine and Venezuela. The board has the earmarks of a new British East India Company in the making.

And then there is Trump’s Greenland adventure. First he threatened military force to seize Greenland and renew tariff wars against European allies. Then he swiftly reversed field, accepting a still-evolving plan hatched with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to forestall a disastrous split in the Atlantic alliance. Trump’s script matched the nursery rhyme about the Duke of York’s 10,000 men: “He marched them up to the top of the hill / And marched them down again.” As of now, Trump’s ploy is stillborn. His play at regime change against a treaty ally caused deep distress in Europe and undoubtedly weakened NATO significantly. It also delighted the Kremlin, which goes to show how badly mistaken the entire episode was from the get-go.

Read: The fuck-around-and-find-out presidency

Iran seems to be one place where Trump is actively considering regime change. In a shift from his first-term views, Trump said expressly, “It’s time to look for new leadership in Iran.” He justified this position, ironically, on neoconservative grounds—the brutal repression of Iran’s people—and not on U.S. geostrategic interests in quashing Tehran’s nuclear-weapons program and its support for international terrorism.

But, as usual, he didn’t seem to know what he would be getting into. Based on his Venezuela approach, one might think Trump would consider eliminating the supreme leader and dealing instead with the Revolutionary Guard. But no, for whatever reason, Trump seemed to lean toward real regime change—which is, just coincidentally, the right answer—a complete U-turn from Venezuela. The only consistency is that, here again, Trump has left the opposition twisting in the wind. In January, he exhorted: “Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING—TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! … HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!” So far, no help has come. Facing massacre by their rulers, protesters have stayed indoors and feel betrayed by Trump.

Around the world, and in America, wonderment at Trump’s infinite variety of “policy” choices is giving way to the realization that Trump doesn’t do “policy.” Or philosophy. Or grand strategy. He does Donald Trump. Among regular Republicans still holding to a Reaganite (or Reagan-Bush) national-security paradigm, vocal dissent—long overdue—is emerging. It needs to grow quickly before Trump’s self-absorption causes even more damage. His incoherence on regime change is only one piece of evidence in the larger picture of his unfitness to be president.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1869, a group of Massachusetts reformers persuaded the state to try a simple idea: counting.

The Second Industrial Revolution was belching its way through New England, teaching mill and factory owners a lesson most M.B.A. students now learn in their first semester: that efficiency gains tend to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is usually somebody else. The new machines weren’t just spinning cotton or shaping steel. They were operating at speeds that the human body—an elegant piece of engineering designed over millions of years for entirely different purposes—simply wasn’t built to match. The owners knew this, just as they knew that there’s a limit to how much misery people are willing to tolerate before they start setting fire to things.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

So Massachusetts created the nation’s first Bureau of Statistics of Labor, hoping that data might accomplish what conscience could not. By measuring work hours, conditions, wages, and what economists now call “negative externalities” but were then called “children’s arms torn off,” policy makers figured they might be able to produce reasonably fair outcomes for everyone. Or, if you’re a bit more cynical, a sustainable level of exploitation. A few years later, with federal troops shooting at striking railroad workers and wealthy citizens funding private armories—leading indicators that things in your society aren’t going great—Congress decided that this idea might be worth trying at scale and created the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Measurement doesn’t abolish injustice; it rarely even settles arguments. But the act of counting—of trying to see clearly, of committing the government to a shared set of facts—signals an intention to be fair, or at least to be caught trying. Over time, that intention matters. It’s one way a republic earns the right to be believed in.

The BLS remains a small miracle of civilization. It sends out detailed surveys to about 60,000 households and 120,000 businesses and government agencies every month, supplemented by qualitative research it uses to check and occasionally correct its findings. It deserves at least some credit for the scoreboard. America: 250 years without violent class warfare. And you have to appreciate the entertainment value of its minutiae. The BLS is how we know that, in 2024, 44,119 people worked in mobile food services (a.k.a. food trucks), up 907 percent since 2000; that nonveterinary pet care (grooming, training) employed 190,984 people, up 513 percent; and that the United States had almost 100,000 massage therapists, with five times the national concentration in Napa, California.

From the February 2026 issue: Alexandra Petri tried to be the federal government. It did not go well.

These and thousands of other BLS statistics describe a society that has grown more prosperous, and a workforce endlessly adaptive to change. But like all statistical bodies, the BLS has its limits. It’s excellent at revealing what has happened and only moderately useful at telling us what’s about to. The data can’t foresee recessions or pandemics—or the arrival of a technology that might do to the workforce what an asteroid did to the dinosaurs.

I am referring, of course, to artificial intelligence. After a rollout that could have been orchestrated by H. P. Lovecraft—“We are summoning the demon,” Elon Musk warned in a typical early pronouncement—the AI industry has pivoted from the language of nightmares to the stuff of comas. Driving innovation. Accelerating transformation. Reimagining workflows. It’s the first time in history that humans have invented something genuinely miraculous and then rushed to dress it in a fleece vest.

There are gobs of money to be made selling enterprise software, but dulling the impact of AI is also a useful feint. This is a technology that can digest a hundred reports before you’ve finished your coffee, draft and analyze documents faster than teams of paralegals, compose music indistinguishable from the genius of a pop star or a Juilliard grad, code—really code, not just copy-paste from Stack Overflow—with the precision of a top engineer. Tasks that once required skill, judgment, and years of training are now being executed, relentlessly and indifferently, by software that learns as it goes.

AI is already so ubiquitous that any resourceful knowledge worker can delegate some of their job’s drudgery to machines. Many companies—Microsoft and PricewaterhouseCoopers among them—have instructed their employees to increase productivity by doing just that. But anyone subcontracting tasks to AI is clever enough to imagine what might come next—a day when augmentation crosses into automation, and cognitive obsolescence compels them to seek work at a food truck, pet spa, or massage table. At least until the humanoid robots arrive.

Many economists insist that this will all be fine. Capitalism is resilient. The arrival of the ATM famously led to the employment of more bank tellers, just as the introduction of Excel swelled the ranks of accountants and Photoshop spiked demand for graphic designers. In each case, new tech automated old tasks, increased productivity, and created jobs with higher wages than anyone could have conceived of before. The BLS projects that employment will grow 3.1 percent over the next 10 years. That’s down from 13 percent in the previous decade, but 5 million new jobs in a country with a stable population is hardly catastrophic.

And yet: There are things that economists struggle to measure. Americans tend to derive meaning and identity from what they do. Most don’t want to do something else, even if they had any confidence—which they don’t—that they could find something else to do. Seventy-one percent of respondents to an August Reuters/Ipsos poll said they’re worried that artificial intelligence will “put too many people out of work permanently.”

This data point might be easier to dismiss if the modern mill and factory owners hadn’t already declared that AI will put people out of work permanently.

In May 2025, Dario Amodei, the CEO of the AI company Anthropic, said that AI could drive unemployment up 10 to 20 percent in the next one to five years and “wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs.” Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, estimated that it would eliminate “literally half of all white-collar workers” in a decade. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, revealed that “my little group chat with my tech-CEO friends” has a bet about the inevitable date when a billion-dollar company is staffed by just one person. (The business side of this magazine, like some other publishers, has a corporate partnership with OpenAI.) Other companies, including Meta, Amazon, UnitedHealth, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, and UPS, which have recently announced layoffs, have framed them more euphemistically in sunny reports to investors about the rise of “automation” and “head count trending down.” Taken together, these statements are extraordinary: the owners of capital warning workers that the ice beneath them is about to crack—while continuing to stomp on it.

It’s as if we’re watching two versions of the same scene. In one, the ice holds, because it always has. In the other, a lot of people go under. The difference becomes clear only when the surface finally gives way—at which point the range of available options will have considerably narrowed.

AI is already transforming work, one delegated task at a time. If the transformation unfolds slowly enough and the economy adjusts quickly enough, the economists may be right: We’ll be fine. Or better. But if AI instead triggers a rapid reorganization of work—compressing years of change into months, affecting roughly 40 percent of jobs worldwide, as the International Monetary Fund projects—the consequences will not stop at the economy. They will test political institutions that have already shown how brittle they can be.

The question, then, is whether we’re approaching the kind of disruption that can be managed with statistics—or the kind that creates statistics no one can bear to count.

Austan Goolsbee is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the Robert P. Gwinn Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, and a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Barack Obama. He’s also one of the few economists you would not immediately regret bringing to a party. When I asked Goolsbee if any conclusive data indicated that AI had begun to eat into the labor market, he delivered an answer that was both obvious and unhelpful, smiling as he did it. The nonanswer was the point.

I’ve known Goolsbee long enough to enjoy these moments, when he makes fun of our shared uselessness. Economists are rarely equipped to give straight answers about the present. Journalists hate when the future won’t reveal itself on deadline.

We spoke in September, shortly after the release of what’s come to be known as “The Canaries Paper,” written by three academics from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. By crunching data from millions of monthly payroll records for workers in jobs with exposure to generative AI, the authors concluded that workers ages 22 to 25—the canaries—have seen about a 13 percent decline in employment since late 2022.

For several days, the paper was all anyone in the field wanted to talk about, and by talk about I mostly mean punch holes in. The report overemphasized the effect of ChatGPT. Youth employment is cyclical. The same period saw a sharp interest-rate spike—a far more likely source of turbulence. “Canaries” also contradicted a study released a few weeks earlier by the Economic Innovation Group, which argued that AI is unlikely to cause mass unemployment in the near term, even as it reshapes jobs and wages. That paper was knowingly titled “AI and Jobs: The Final Word (Until the Next One).”

This was the point Goolsbee wanted to emphasize: Economists are constrained by numbers. And numerically speaking, nothing indicates that AI has had an impact on people’s jobs. “It’s just too early,” he said.

A lack of certainty should not be mistaken for a lack of concern. The Fed’s mandate is to promote maximum employment, so the corporate pronouncements about imminent job loss have Goolsbee’s attention. But the numbers don’t add up. It’s possible that the labor market is softer than it looks, but that the softness is being absorbed within firms rather than showing up in the unemployment rate. If companies are sitting on more workers than they need, however—a phenomenon known as labor hoarding—you’d expect that to reveal itself as weak productivity growth. It’s as predictable as a hangover: too many workers, not enough work, sagging productivity. “But it’s been totally the opposite,” Goolsbee said. “Productivity growth has been really high. So I don’t know how to reconcile that.”

Productivity is the cheat code for a more prosperous society. If each worker can produce more in the same hour—more goods, better services, faster results—then the total economic pie grows, even if the number of workers doesn’t. It’s the rare efficiency gain that expands the pie rather than merely redistributing slices.

America has been on a productivity tear for the past few years. It might be temporary, the result of a onetime boost, such as the COVID-era boom in new small businesses. But with the special joy of someone paid to complicate everything, Goolsbee pointed out that general-purpose technologies such as electricity and computing can create lasting productivity gains, the kind that make whole societies wealthier.

Whether AI is one of those technologies will only become clear over time. How long before we’ll know? “Years,” Goolsbee said.

In the meantime, there’s another complication. The immediate risk to employment may not be AI itself, but the way companies, seduced by its promise, overinvest before they understand what it can actually do. Goolsbee reached back to the internet bubble, when companies spent wildly on laying fiber cables and building capacity. “In 2001, when we found out that the growth rate of the internet is not going to be 25 percent a year, but merely 10 percent—which is still a pretty great growth rate—it meant we had way too much fiber, and there was a collapse of business investment,” Goolsbee said. “And a bunch of people were thrown out of work the old-fashioned way.”

A similar crash in AI investment, if it comes, would likely look familiar: painful, destabilizing, and accompanied by surges of CNBC rants and recriminations. But it would amount to a financial reset, not a technological reversal—the kind of outcome economists are especially good at recognizing, because it resembles a thing that’s happened before.

This is the paradox of economics. To understand how fast the present is hurtling us into the future, you need a fixed point, and the fixed points are all in the past. It’s like driving while looking only at the rearview mirror—plenty dangerous if the road stays straight, catastrophic if it doesn’t.

David Autor and Daron Acemoglu are among the most accomplished rearview drivers. Both are at MIT, and both excel at understanding previous economic disruptions. Acemoglu, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2024, studies inequality; Autor focuses on labor. But both insist that the story of AI and its consequences will depend mostly on speed—not because they assume lost jobs will automatically be replaced, but because a slower rate of change leaves societies time to adapt, even if some of those jobs never come back.

Labor markets have a natural rate of adjustment. If, over the course of 30 years, 3 percent of employees in a profession retire or have their jobs eliminated annually, you’d barely notice. Yet a decade later, a third of the jobs in those professions would be gone. Elevator operators and tollbooth attendants went through this slow fade to obsolescence with no damage to the economy. “When it happens more rapidly,” Autor told me, “things become problematic.”

From the July/August 2015 issue: Derek Thompson on a world without work

Autor is most famous for his work on the China shock. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization; six years later, 13 percent of U.S. manufacturing jobs—about 2 million—had disappeared. The China shock took a disproportionate toll on small-scale manufacturing—textiles, toys, furniture—concentrated primarily in the South. “Many of the workers in those places still haven’t recovered,” Autor said, “and we’re obviously living with the political consequences.”

But AI isn’t a trade policy. It’s software. Even if it hits some professions and places first—a lawyer in a large urban firm, say, may feel the impact years before a worker in a less digitized industry—the technology won’t be constrained by geography. Eventually, everyone will be affected.

All of this sounds foreboding, until you remember the most important thing about software: People hate it, almost as much as they hate change.

This is what gives many economists confidence that the AI asteroid is still at least a decade away. “These tech CEOs want us to believe that the market for automation is preordained, and that it will all happen smoothly and profitably,” Acemoglu said. He then made a disdainful noise from his Nobel Prize–winning bullshit detector. “History tells us it’s actually going to happen much slower.”

The argument goes like this: Before AI can transform a company, it has to access the company’s data and be woven into existing systems—which sounds easy, provided you’re not a chief technology officer. A trade secret of most Fortune 500 companies is that they still run many critical functions on lumbering, industrial-strength mainframe computers that almost never break down and therefore can never be replaced. Mainframes are like Christopher Walken: They’ve been going nonstop since the 1960s, they’re fantastic at performing peculiar roles (processing payments, safeguarding data), and nobody alive really understands how they work.

Integrating legacy tech with modern AI means navigating hardware, vendors, contracts, ancient coding languages, and humans—every one of whom has a strong opinion about the “right” way to make changes. Months pass, then years; another company holiday party comes and goes; and the CEO still can’t understand why the miracle of AI isn’t solving all of their problems.

Every new general-purpose technology is, for a time, held hostage by the mess of what already exists. The first electric-power stations opened in the 1880s, and no one debated whether they were superior to steam engines. But factories had been built with steam engines in their basements, powering overhead shafts that ran the length of the buildings, with belts and pulleys carrying power to individual machines. To adopt electricity, factory owners didn’t just need to buy motors—they needed to demolish and rebuild their entire operations. Some did. Most just waited for their infrastructure to wear out, which explains why the major economic gains from electrification didn’t show up for 40 years.

None of this is reassuring enough for the economist Anton Korinek. He’s “super worried,” he told me. He thinks that America will see major job losses—“a very noticeable labor-market effect”—as soon as this year.

“And then those economists you’ve been talking to, they’re going to say, ‘I see that in the data!’ ” Korinek paused. “Let’s not joke about it, because it’s too serious.”

Korinek is a professor and the faculty director of the Economics of Transformative AI Initiative at the University of Virginia. Last year, Time magazine put him on its list of the most influential people in AI. But he did not set out to become an economist. He grew up in an Austrian mountain village, writing machine code in 0s and 1s—the least glamorous form of programming, and the most unforgiving. It teaches you where instructions bottleneck, where systems jam, and what breaks first when pushed too hard.

He’d kept a close watch on developments in AI since the deep-learning breakthroughs of the early 2010s, even as his doctoral work focused on the prevention of financial crises. When he got his first demo of a large language model, in September 2022, it took “about five seconds” before he considered its consequences for the future of work, starting with his own.

We met for breakfast in Charlottesville in the fall. Korinek is youthful and slender, with delicate wire-frame glasses and a faintly red beard. My overall impression was of someone who’d rather be customizing Excel tabs than prophesizing doom. Still, here he was, saying the five words economists disdain the most: This time may be different.

The crux of Korinek’s argument is simple: His colleagues aren’t misreading the data—they’re misreading the technology. “We can’t quite conceptualize having very smart machines,” Korinek said. “Machines have always been dumb, and that’s why we don’t trust them and it’s always taken time to roll them out. But if they’re smarter than us, in many ways they can roll themselves out.”

This is already happening. Many of the least comprehensible ads during sporting events are for AI tools that promise to speed the integration of other AI tools into the workflows of large companies. Because many of these systems don’t require massive new hardware or human-engineered system rewrites, the rollout time shrinks by as much as 50 percent.

This is where Korinek parts company with the rearview economists. If AI moves as fast as he expects, for many workers the damage will arrive before institutions can adapt—and each successful use will only intensify the pressure for more.

Consider consulting firms, which have always charged high fees for having junior associates do research and draft reports—fees clients tolerated because there was no alternative. But if one firm can use AI to deliver the same work faster and cheaper, its competitors face a stark choice: adopt the technology, or explain why they are still charging a premium for human hours. Once a firm plugs in and undercuts its rivals, the rest must either race to follow or be left behind. Competition doesn’t just reward adoption; it makes delay indefensible.

Korinek concedes the two standard objections: The numbers don’t show anything definitive yet, and new technologies have historically created more jobs than they’ve destroyed. But he thinks that his peers need to start driving with their eyes looking ahead. “Whenever I speak to people at the labs on the West Coast”—Korinek is an unpaid member of Anthropic’s economic advisory council—“it does not strike me that they are trying to artificially hype what they’re producing. I usually have the sense that they are just as terrified as I am. We should at least consider the possibility that what they are telling us may come true.”

Korinek is not sure that the technology itself can be steered by policy, but he wants more economists doing scenario planning so that policy makers aren’t caught flat-footed—because mass job loss doesn’t just mean unemployment; it means missed loan payments, cascading defaults, shrinking consumer demand, and the kind of self-reinforcing downturn that can transform a shock into a crisis, and a crisis into the decline of an empire.

After thE brief period in early 2025 when CEOs were openly volunteering “thought leadership” about AI and its impact on their workforces and profit margins, the pronouncements stopped, eerily, at roughly the same time. Anyone who has seen a shark fin break the water and then disappear knows this is not reassuring.

The simple explanation comes courtesy of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. America employs about 280,590 public-relations specialists, an increase of 69 percent over the past two decades. (They outnumber journalists almost 7 to 1.) It’s not hard to imagine their expert syllogism: AI is unpopular. CEOs who talk about job cuts are even less popular. So maybe shut up about AI and jobs?

In October, the day after The New York Times revealed Amazon executives’ plan to potentially automate more than 600,000 jobs by 2033, the PR chief at a large multinational firm told me, “We are so done speaking about this.” It was at least a small piece of history—the first time I’d been asked to grant anonymity to someone so they could explain, on the record, that they would no longer be speaking at all.

All of which is to say that the chief executives of Walmart, Amazon, Ford, and other Fortune 100 companies, as well as executives from rising AI-driven firms including Anthropic, Stripe, and Waymo—people who had been remarkably chatty about AI and jobs a few months earlier—declined or ignored multiple interview requests for this story. Even the Business Roundtable, an association of 200 CEOs from America’s most powerful companies that exists to speak for its members on exactly these kinds of issues, told me that its CEO, former George W. Bush White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten, had nothing to say.

Of course, telling a reporter you won’t speak on the record isn’t the same as not speaking. The CEOs are talking to at least one person: Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a Microsoft board member. Hoffman is a technologist by pedigree and an optimist by temperament. He knows everyone in corporate America, and everyone knows he knows everyone, which makes him Silicon Valley’s favorite mensch—a reasonable, neutral sounding board whom CEOs can go to when they want to think out loud. He told me that AI has sorted the CEOs into three groups.

The first are the dabblers: latecomers finally spending some quality time with their chief technology officers. The second rushed to declare themselves AI leaders out of vanity or a desire to have their traditional businesses taken more seriously by tech snobs. “They’re like, Look at me! I’m important! I’m central here. But they’re not actually doing anything yet,” Hoffman said. “They’re just like, Put me at the AI table too.” The third group is different: executives who are quietly making transformational plans. “These are the ones who see it coming. And to their credit, I think a lot of them want to figure out how to help their whole workforce transition with this through education, reskilling, or training.”

But what all three groups share is a belief that investors—after years of hearing about AI’s promise—have lost patience with dreaming. This year, they expect results. And the fastest way for a CEO to produce results is to cut head count. Layoffs, Hoffman said, are inevitable. “A lot of them have convinced themselves this only ends one way. Which I think is a failure of the imagination.”

Hoffman doesn’t waste time urging CEOs not to make cuts; he knows they will. “What I tell them is that you need to be presenting paths and ideas for how to get benefits from AI that aren’t just cutting costs. How do you get more revenue? How do you help your people transition to being more effective using AI?”

“It’s a fever,” Gina Raimondo, the former governor of Rhode Island and commerce secretary under Joe Biden, told me, referring to the rush to cut jobs. “Every CEO and every board feels like they need to go faster. ‘We have 40,000 people doing customer service? Take it down to 10,000. AI can handle the rest.’ If the whole thing is about moving fast with your eye strictly on efficiency, then an awful lot of people are going to get really hurt. And I don’t think this country can handle that, given where we already are.”

Like Hoffman, Raimondo occupies an unusual niche: a Democrat who can walk into a boardroom without setting off the cultural metal detectors. She co-founded a venture-capital firm, and AI executives, who see her as pragmatic and fluent in tech, are willing to talk to her. “This is a technology that will make us more productive, healthier, more sustainable,” Raimondo said. “But only if we get very serious about managing the transition.”

Last summer, Raimondo made the trip to Sun Valley, Idaho, for the four-day Allen & Co. conference known as “summer camp for billionaires.” She asked people the same two questions: How are you using AI? And what happens to your workers when you do? A number of CEOs admitted that they felt trapped. Wall Street expects them to replace human labor with AI; if they don’t do it, they’ll be the ones out of a job. But if they all order mass job eliminations, they know the consequences will be enormous—for their workforces, for the country, and for their own humanity.

Raimondo’s response was that “it’s the responsibility of the country’s most powerful CEOs to help figure this out.” She sees the possibility of “new public-private partnerships at scale. Imagine if we could get companies to take ownership over the retraining and redeployment of people they lay off.”

She knows how this sounds. “A lot of people say, ‘Oh, Gina, you’re naive. Never going to happen.’ Okay. But I’m telling you it’s the end of America as we know it if we don’t use this moment to do things differently.”

If executives’ concern is as genuine as Raimondo thinks, then perhaps they can be moved to action. Liz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO, is trying—and mostly failing—to do just that. CEOs and tech leaders are so focused on winning the AI race that “working people are an afterthought,” she told me.

Shuler’s aware that this is a predictable take from a union leader, so she volunteered a concession: “Most working people, and especially union leaders, start out with a panic, right? Like, Wow, this is going to basically obliterate all jobs and everyone’s going to be left without a safety net and we have to put a stop to it—which we know is not going to happen.” Instead of panicking, Shuler said, she talked with the leaders of the AFL-CIO’s unions, representing about 15 million people, and pushed them to use the brief moment before AI is imposed on them to figure out what they want from the technology—and what they might be prepared to trade for that.

Michael Podhorzer: The paradox of the American labor movement

So far the olive branch has been grabbed by precisely one company. Microsoft has agreed to bring workers into conversations about developing AI and guardrails around it. Most remarkably, the deal includes a neutrality agreement that allows workers to freely form unions without retaliation—something that’s never been done before in tech. “We think it’s a model,” Shuler said. “We would love to see others acknowledge that working people are central to this debate and to our future.”

Squint and you might convince yourself that the Microsoft deal is indeed proof of concept. More likely, it’s an anomaly. Because all the coaxing, reasonableness, and appeals to patriotism and shared humanity are battling a truth as old as wage labor: American capitalism rushes toward efficiency the way water flows downhill—inevitably, indifferently, and with predictable consequences for whoever happens to be standing at the bottom. And with AI, for the first time, capital has a tool that promises the kind of near-limitless productivity the factory and mill owners could never have imagined: maximum efficiency with a minimum number of employees to demand a share of the gains.

In that context, the silence of the CEOs takes on a different resonance. It could be a cold acknowledgment that the decisions have already been made—or a muffled plea for the government to save them from themselves.

You’re probably aware that our politics are unbearable at the moment. And yet the only way to make them bearable—to recover the glimmer of promise at their core—is more politics. That’s the joke at the heart of Washington: The very struggle that’s hollowed the place out is also the only way it can be renewed.

If there were ever an issue capable of relieving the national migraine—something large enough and urgent enough—you might assume the future of American jobs would be it. “At least from my interactions here in the Senate, not many people are talking about it,” Gary Peters, the senior senator from Michigan, told me. “There’s a general attitude among my colleagues”—Peters, a Democrat, singles out Republicans, though he says there’s blame to go around—“like, We don’t need to do anything. It’s going to be fine. In fact, the government should just stay out of it. Let industry move forward and continue to innovate.”

It’s hard to slow AI without abdicating America’s tech supremacy to China—a point the tech lobby makes with religious fervor. It’s hard to force AI labs to give advance notice of the consequences of their deployments when they often don’t know themselves. You could regulate the use of job-displacing AI, but enforcement would require a regulatory apparatus that doesn’t exist and technical expertise the government doesn’t have.

That said, the government has a decades-old playbook on how to get workers through economic shocks. And Peters has been banging his head on his desk trying to get Congress to use it.

Since 1974, when the United States began opening its economy more aggressively to global trade, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program has helped more than 5 million people with retraining, wage insurance, and relocation grants, at a cost in recent years of roughly half a billion dollars annually. In 2018, Peters co-sponsored the TAA for Automation Act, which would have extended the same benefits to workers squeezed by AI and robotics. It died quietly, as many things in Congress do. In 2022, authorization for the TAA expired, and in a Congress allergic to trade votes and new spending, Peters’s efforts to revive it have gone nowhere.

This is very stupid. The United States has about 700,000 unfilled factory and construction jobs. (Ironically, one of the few things slowing AI is a shortage of HVAC technicians qualified to install cooling systems in data centers.) Jim Farley, the Ford CEO who predicted that half of white-collar jobs could disappear in a decade, has been saying that the auto industry is short hundreds of thousands of technicians to work in dealerships—jobs that sit in a long-term sweet spot: technical enough to earn six figures, and dependent on precise manual dexterity that makes them hard to roboticize. But someone has to pay for the months of training the jobs require. “These are really good jobs,” Peters said. But “we spend a lot more money from the federal government for four-year higher-education institutions than we do for skilled-training programs.”

There’s no shortage of ideas about what to do if AI hollows out large swaths of work: universal basic income, benefits that don’t depend on employers, lifelong retraining, a shorter workweek. They tend to surface whenever technological anxiety spikes—and to recede just as reliably, undone by cost, politics, or the simple fact that they would require a level of coordination the United States has not managed in decades.

The 119th Congress is a ghost ship, steered by ennui and the desire to evade hard choices. And the AI industry is paying millions of dollars to make sure no one grabs the wheel. To cite just one example, a super PAC called Leading the Future—which has reportedly secured $50 million in commitments from the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and $50 million more from the OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and his wife, Anna—plans to “aggressively oppose” candidates from both parties who threaten the industry’s priorities, which boil down to: Go fast. No, faster.

Shuler told me that the AFL-CIO will keep pressing national elected officials for a worker-focused AI agenda, but that “this game is not gonna be played at the federal level as much as it will be at the state level.” More than 1,000 AI bills are bubbling up in statehouses. Of course, the AI money will be there, too; Leading the Future has already announced plans to focus its efforts on New York, California, Illinois, and Ohio.

The executive branch has delegated almost all of its AI oversight to David Sacks—nominally a co-chair of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, but functionally a government LARPer who maintains his role as a venture capitalist and podcast host. Sacks, who is also the White House crypto czar, co-wrote the Trump administration’s “America’s AI Action Plan.” A New York Times investigation found that Sacks has at least 449 investments in companies with ties to artificial intelligence. The fox isn’t just guarding the henhouse; he’s livestreaming the feast.

AI is just a newborn. It may grow up to transform our lives in unimaginably good ways. But it has also introduced profound questions about safety, inequality, and the viability of a wage-labor system that, despite its flaws, spawned the most prosperous society in human history. And there’s no sign—none—that our political system is equipped to deal with what’s coming.

Which means the deepest challenge AI poses may not be to jobs at all.

“Gosh, the textbook ideal of democracy,” says Nick Clegg, “is the peaceful articulation and resolution of differences that otherwise might take a more disruptive or violent form. So you’d like to think that a strong democracy could digest these kinds of changes.”

Clegg is a former deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom and leader of the Liberal Democrats. When he lost his seat in Parliament after Brexit, he moved to California, where he spent seven years running global affairs at Facebook/Meta, becoming a kind of Tocqueville with vested options, before returning to London in 2025. Many governments “just don’t have the levers” to deal with AI, Clegg told me.

He suspects that the societies best positioned to navigate the next few years are small homogenous ones like the Scandinavians, who are capable of having mature conversations—they’ll put together “some commission led by some very wise former finance minister who will come up with a perfect blueprint which everybody consensually will then do, and they will remain in a hundred years the happiest societies”—or large authoritarian ones that refuse to have conversations at all. China, America’s primary AI rival, has repeatedly demonstrated a capacity to impose rapid, society-wide change (the one-child policy, the forced relocation of more than 1 million people for the Three Gorges Dam) without consent or delay.

“If democratic governments drift into this period, which may require much more rapid change than they currently appear to be capable of delivering,” Clegg warned, “then democracy is not going to pass this test with flying colors.”

He then delivered, over Zoom, a fantastically British pep talk, combining Churchillian resolve with a faintly patronizing nod to America’s centuries-long streak of pulling four-leaf clovers out of its ass. “You are extraordinarily dynamic,” he began. “It’s remarkable the number of times people have written off America.”

If politics is to be part of the solution, Gary Peters will not be around to participate; he’s retiring next year. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Congress’s most articulate Republican advocate (really) for safeguarding the workforce from AI, has already resigned. Gina Raimondo is being considered as a potential presidential contender for 2028, and she’s a centrist with the chops to balance the reasons for speeding forward on AI with the need to do so warily. But the issue is unlikely to wait that long. “We’re going into a world that seems to be getting more unstable with each and every day,” Peters said. “And that uncertainty creates anxiety, and anxiety leads to sometimes dramatic shifts in how people act and how they vote.”

Which brings us to Bernie Sanders, who has been wrestling with an AI-shaped future since it was still theoretical. “Are AI and robotics inherently evil or terrible? No,” Sanders told me in his familiar staccato. “We are already seeing positive developments in terms of health care, the manufacturing of drugs, diagnoses of diseases, etc. But here is the simple question: Who is going to benefit from this transformation?”

At the Davenport, Iowa, stop on his 2025 Fighting Oligarchy tour, audience members booed when he mentioned AI. And Sanders, the ultimate vibes politician, can feel decades of anger—over trade, inequality, affordability, systematic unfairness, government fealty to corporations—coalescing around AI.

In October, he issued a 95 theses–style report on AI and employment. It included all of the dire CEO and consulting-firm quotes about the looming job apocalypse and proposed a shorter workweek; worker protections; profit sharing; and an unspecified “robot tax on large corporations,” whose revenue would be used “to benefit workers harmed by AI.” It’s a furious document, as though Sanders typed it with his fists.

At least one populist politician thinks Sanders didn’t go far enough.

Steve Bannon’s D.C. townhouse is so close to the Supreme Court that you can read JUSTICE THE GUARDIAN OF LIBERTY from the top step. He greeted me in his signature look: camouflage cargo pants, a black shirt, also a brown shirt, also a black button-down shirt. He hadn’t shaved in days. It would not have surprised me if he suggested that we get hoagies, or form a militia.

From the July/August 2022 issue: Jennifer Senior on Steve Bannon, a lit bomb in the mouth of democracy

Bannon has, shall we say, some scoundrel-like tendencies. But he’s not an AI tourist. In the early 2000s, while still a film producer, he tried to buy the rights to Ray Kurzweil’s The Singularity Is Near, a sacred text of the AI movement that imagines the day when machines surpass human intelligence. Bannon thought it would make a good documentary. He hired an AI correspondent for his War Room podcast a few years ago, and he tracks every corporate-layoff announcement, searching for omens.

He’s concerned about rogue AI creating viruses and seizing weapons—fears that are shared more soberly by national-security officials, biosecurity researchers, and some notable AI scientists—but he believes the American worker is in such imminent danger that he’s prepared to toss away parts of his ideology. “I’m for the deconstruction of the administrative state, but I’m not an anarchist,” Bannon told me. “You do have to have a regulatory apparatus. If you don’t have a regulatory apparatus for this, then fucking take the whole thing down, right? Because this is what the thing was built for.”

What Bannon wants goes beyond regulation. It’s a callback to an old idea: that when the government deems a technology strategically vital, it should own part of it—much as it once did with railroads and, briefly, banks during the 2008 financial crisis. He pointed to what he called Donald Trump’s “brilliant” decision to have the federal government take a 9.9 percent stake in Intel in August. But the stake in AI would need to be much greater, he believes—something commensurate with the scale of federal support flowing to AI companies.

“I don’t know—50 percent as a starter,” Bannon said. “I realize the right’s going to go nuts.” But the government needs to put people with good judgment on these companies’ boards, he said. “And you have to drill down on this now, now, now.”

Instead, he warned, we have “the worst elements of our system—greed and avarice, coupled with people that just want to grasp raw power—all converging.”

I pointed out that the person overseeing this convergence is the same man Bannon helped get elected, and recently suggested should stick around for a third term.

“President Trump’s a great business guy,” Bannon said. But he’s getting “selective information” from Elon Musk, David Sacks, and others who Bannon thinks hopped aboard the Trump bandwagon only to maximize their profit and control of AI. “If you noticed, these guys are not jumping around when I say ‘Trump ’28.’ I don’t get an ‘attaboy.’ ” He said that “they’ve used Trump,” and that he sees a major schism coming within the Republican Party.

Bannon’s politics don’t naturally lend themselves to cross-party coalition building, but AI has scrambled even his sense of the boundaries. He and Glenn Beck signed a letter demanding a ban on the development of superintelligent AI, out of fear that systems smarter than humans cannot be reliably contained; they were joined by eminent academics and former Obama-administration officials—“lefties that would rather spit on the floor than say Steve Bannon is with them on anything.” And he’s been sketching out a theory of the coalition needed to confront what’s coming. “These ethicists and moral philosophers—you have to combine that together with, quite frankly, some street fighters.”

Horseshoe issues—where the far right and far left touch—are rare in American politics. They tend to surface when something highly technical (the gold standard in 1896, or the subprime crisis of 2008) alchemizes into something emotional (William Jennings Bryan’s “cross of gold,” the Tea Party). That’s populism. And the threat of pitchforks has occasionally made American capitalism more humane: The eight-hour workday, weekends, and the minimum wage all emerged from the space between reform and revolution.

No one understands or exploits that shaggy zone quite like Bannon. His anger about AI can sound reasonable in one breath and menacing in the next. We were discussing some of the men who run the most powerful AI labs when he said, “Let’s just be blunt”: “We’re in a situation where people on the spectrum that are not, quite frankly, total adults—you can see by their behavior that they’re not—are making decisions for the species. Not for the country. For the species. Once we hit this inflection point, there’s no coming back. That’s why it’s got to be stopped, and we may have to take extreme measures.”

The trouble with pitchforks is that once you encourage everyone to grab them, there’s no end to the damage that might be done. And unlike in earlier eras, we’re now a society defined by two objects: phones that let everyone see exactly how much better other people have it, and guns should they decide to do something about it.

America would be better off if its elites could act responsibly without being terrified. If CEOs remembered that citizens are a kind of shareholder, too. If economists tried to model the future before it arrives in their rearview mirror. If politicians chose their constituents’ jobs over their own. None of this requires revolution. It requires everyone to do the jobs they already have, just better.

There’s an easy place for all of them to start—a bar so low, it amounts to a basic cognitive exam for the republic.

Erika McEntarfer was the commissioner of labor statistics until August, when Trump fired her after the release of a weak jobs report. McEntarfer has seen no evidence of political interference at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but “independence is not the only threat facing economic data,” she told me. “Inadequate funding and staffing are also a danger.”

Most of the economic papers trying to figure out the impact of AI on labor demand use the BLS’s Current Population Survey. “It’s the best available source,” McEntarfer said. “But the sample is pretty small. It’s only 60,000 households and hasn’t increased for 20 years. Response rates have declined.” An obvious first step toward figuring out what’s going on in our economy would be to expand the survey’s sample size and add a supplement on AI usage at work. That would involve some extra economists and a few million dollars—a tiny investment. But the BLS budget has been shrinking for decades.

The United States created the BLS because it believed the first duty of a democracy was to know what was happening to its people. If we’ve misplaced that belief—if we can’t bring ourselves to measure reality; if we can’t be bothered to count—then good luck with the machines.

Apple and Google charge 30% on app purchases and in app purchases. It is discourage on developers, especially small Indie developers. It also violates our sovereignty over our devices by forcing us to use their rent seeking stores.

It also provides a great deal of infrastructure that used to be required of individual publishers.  App stores provide a service to both developers and customers, they are not merely &quot;rent seeking&quot;.

Also, no one &quot;sovereignty&quot; is &quot;violated&quot;, no one takes you seriously with dumb comments like that.  Cell phones are not required to offer apps at all.  Don&#39;t like smart phone terms?  Don&#39;t use a smart phone.

On this front, I&#39;d like both these companies to introduce something in the Settings of their OSs.  Namely, in the Accounts section, if one chooses not to have a Google or an iCloud account, to have a section where one can enter the URL of an alternate storage site.  It may be either something like DropBox or Carbonite or anything else, or if one happens to have a home NAS, one can even enter that URL - let&#39;s call it storage.foo.bar.

Hear me out, I&#39;m not entirely crazy. I&#39;d rather see the &quot;better&quot; apps than be swamped with tons of AI generated crap apps when searching for an app.

One thing I like about Apple&#39;s store - them requiring vendors to make their services IPv6 accessible, if they want to be available on their store.  I for one certainly laud that.  iOS, Android and in future, even Windows promises to be IPv6-mostly, allowing for IPv4 hosts and services to be accessible via xLAT-464, reducing the dependence on IPv4 backbones

&quot;The large IT companies are now in a consolidation phase accelerated by AI, as evidenced by continuous layoffs for the past three years. The average recession length is less than a year, this is structual change, not inventory adjustment. I&#39;m curious if the Republicans will figure this out before the economy forces their hand.&quot;

adjusting the workweek is the optimum long-term fix.

adjusting the workweek just means people are even less employed, shut the hell up

This is the change: comparing 45 years ago to now.

Labor received 58% of gross domestic income in 1980; by the third quarter of 2025, that figure had fallen to 51.4%. Corporate profits&#39; share rose from 7% to 11.7% over the same period.

In summary, labor received 6.6% less of the gross income, while corporate profits increased by 4.7%. So, 3/4 of the decrease in money paid to labor was moved to corporate profits.

Not terribly unexpected; the labor force dropped because of increased amounts of automation of prod

So many people are paper multi-millionaires now.  I wonder if all this &#39;wealth&#39; will be worth anything when we all go to spend it.

Yes, that&#39;s my concern. Ordinary people have their retirement plans largely in stocks. There will be a way to raid that.

The ultra wealthy seem to leverage many more kinds of asset - art, property, IP, companies they privately own etc.

The whole reason other people don&#39;t have money is those people do not intend to spend it, ever. Their entire project is to sit on money that they intentionally make increasingly useless until everyone else is starved to death.

It&#39;s even simpler. The entire point of capital hiring labor is that labor can produce more of value than they are paid. And over the years, capitalists have gotten an increasing discount. Although I would like to see this calculates with the total compensation, including employer&#39;s portion of healthcare. Probably won&#39;t move the number much though.

yes, we&#39;re watching an historical cycle play out so answers already exist.

&quot;Production equals consumption in an ideal economy. Both are bound by finite time. If production increases, consumption must increase, too. Ergo, time spent on production must fall, which is what happened during the last two depressionary eras. 1873-1897 and 1930-1940. I&#39;m fairly sure that AI is the last straw which breaks the forty-hour workweek&quot;

It bear repeating as long as people remain in denial.

The gig economy exists because of immigration, and more so because illegal immigration.

We need to fix the wage gap! You can tinker all you like with labor laws and regulations but ultimately supply and demand win.

If want to continue to have an America where upward mobility is possible, and we have a robust middle class work needs to pay.  That simply will not happen when you have damn near unlimited supply of below market rate labor streaming over the boarder, while also collecting subsidies for housing and

I don&#39;t think that facts bear out your hypothesis.  But you did manage to find a minority group to hate.  You fell for the propaganda of the Rich.

The economic impacts of ICE operations in MPLS and other target locations also proving it.  Places are closing up because they don&#39;t have workers, they don&#39;t have workers because they illegals won&#39;t turn up for shifts. They don&#39;t have legal residents for those positions because they don&#39;t pay enough.  Legal residents are then pushed strait into the arms of the mega corps where they are also underpaid but at least they can show their employed and collect welfare that way.

Facts bear out that immigrants bump our GDP, and contribute more than they take.

If you are concerned about housing prices, and want a real fix, look at how the very wealthy own large percentages of housing, and keep jacking up the rent on working people.

So you&#39;ve also fallen for the propaganda of the Trump administration.

The vast majority of the people being pulled off the streets to make Miller&#39;s quotas have legal status.

ICE has been very indiscriminate about who they detain, and also have been doing things like taking people who are legally in the US, changing their status, and deporting them.

If a place can&#39;t find workers willing to work for a wage that would make the business profitable, that business should not exist.  &quot;Illegals&quot; are bound to the same reality as everyone else: they need to eat, and they need money to buy food, and they need jobs to get money.  If you think this does not apply to them, and they are somehow getting a better deal than you are from the government, you should just do what they do and don&#39;t provide any documentation to the government about your citizenship when you

It&#39;s a tactic that owners of capital have been using for a very long time going all the way back to the slave plantation owners.

The vast majority of people in the American south could not afford slaves (let alone a plantation!). In order to cover for the fact that a tiny minority (maybe 1% of the population) controlled 99% of the wealth, they institute a system where whites were considered superior so that the working class could be convinced they weren&#39;t being screwed and would participate in the continuation of free labor for the plantation owners. After the civil war, they used Jim Crow to perpetuate the same system, albeit with slave wages rather than literal slavery from the designated underclass.

Once the Civil Rights era came about, it became no longer tenable to use African Americans as the designated underclass to keep the working class in line. It&#39;s no accident that immigration became a hot button political issue right around the time the civil rights era ebbed. Immigrants from Latin American became a convenient replacement. It was more socially acceptable to ostracize outsiders who spoke a different language and because of immigration laws, you could legally discriminate against them the way people used to discriminate against African Americans. The ginned-up outrage over &quot;crime&quot; and &quot;sending rapists&quot; mirrors how society used to talk about African Americans before that ceased to be acceptable.

The group that is the designated underclass has changed, but the result is the same: owners of capital get cheap labor. The underclass does the worst least-paid jobs with no real protections while the working class is distracted from the fact they only getting the crumbs from the capital owners. They are trained to blame those under them in the social order rather than the ones who have created the system. Note: having &quot;illegal&quot; immigrants is a feature, not a bug in this system. Undocumented immigrants still work, but only off the books. This means they will work for sub-minimum wage and the true employer can officially disclaim ever employing them (by hiring via a contractor).  You also don&#39;t have to pay them social security or Medicare benefits down the line, but they often do pay into these systems.

The myth of trickle-down economics [theguardian.com] has long been debunked. But the idea that the rising tide of GDP will raise all boats is still peddled by many politicians and parts of the mainstream media,

below market rate labor The market rate is by definition the rate the market pays.   The problem is you expect people already living here to be paid above market rate to do things that are economically not worth doing in the first place.

IMO the workers used to have a voice, policy would be created in their favor. Now big money is all the politicians hear, if there was better policy preventing money from going to the top of the economic food chain and better serving workers, we wouldn&#39;t be where we are today.

It used to be workers had some leverage because they were essential to keeping the gears of the economy turning. Now, it&#39;s only the machines, databases, and AI that matter. The small amount of labor required to keep businesses functioning means workers are quickly becoming an irrelevant component of the economy. Good luck with that next wage negotiation.

Inflation is stubbornly high in the USA, the ridiculous tariffs are hugely damaging, housing costs have soared, it&#39;s hard to find a decent job, and consumer confidence has soured. The federal government is malicious and untethered.

Nonetheless, if you&#39;ve had money invested in the stock market over the past couple of years you&#39;ve made out like a bandit. My portfolio is up 8% just since the beginning of the year and its all just index funds. VYMI (international value category) is up 40% since this time last year, I should have been all in.

It seems completely uncoupled to the underlying economy, defying gravity. But that&#39;s where the obscenely wealthy keep much of their money, and if you have some surplus income you get to come along for the ride. If you don&#39;t, like so many people today, all you can do is watch from the sidelines.

For the life of me, unless one is extremely rich I cannot imagine why anyone, especially a family with kids would want to live in NYC.

If you&#39;re rich and young ok maybe it&#39;s a blast to live and party there, but for real life?  Nah.

Also sounds like complete bullshit from some one with a political agenda. I know enough people who live in NYC and own guns to know that it is.

Typical annual salary, according to MIT&#39;s Living Wage Calculator for the NYC Metro, is $84,860.

Poverty wage is $7.52/hr (no kids) and minimum wage is $15.50 which, according to the calculator, should cover 1 adult with 3 kids.

Every once in a while you see a story about a &#39;poor&#39; man making $200k+ and not saving anything.

There are two main reasons for their fiscal incompetence (plus a bonus one):

1)  They look at their neighbors - the guy to the right has a boat, the guy across the street has a ski house, and the guy to the left has a beach house.  They buy one of each.  Or they pick one and pay twice as much for it.

2) They do something similar with kids.  Often they will buy a great house in a good neighborhood/suburb &#39;for the kids&#39; and then send them to private school.  The entire point of the house in the right location is that it has a good SCHOOL.  If you are sending your kids to private school you should be living in a much cheaper house.   Just because you have kids does not mean you should spend all your money on them.

Bonus reason:  Total and complete fiscal stupidity buying worthless crap.  Prime example is Time Shares.  [ Even if one makes sense now, ten years later your financial situation will change.  Either it will be too expensive or too cheap - and you will not use it. Even point systems are just later regrets]

Some SaaS* companies borrowed money on crazy terms, which are highly vulnerable to &quot;blips&quot; in the market. A downturn, perhaps like that seen in 2007, or in Covid could cause a number of those companies to fail because there&#39;s not yet enough value created (in other words: money made in a war chest) by them to withstand it.

(* I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s not just SaaS - I&#39;m sure every man and his dog with an AI or Crypto business has been trying to do the same thing)

SaaS is uniquely challenged though.  AI is going to make developing software cheaper, if it has not already. Most of the SaaS industry is just CRUD apps with a ton of lipstick slathered on.  That is the kind of stuff that AI is really good at building an full stack architect who can understand, read, correct, validate AI outputs and do good prompts, build hooks etc probably can extend and support without the help of the junior programmers in the very near future. Those same companies largely don&#39;t host anyt

I agree there are lots of chancers, which by the looks of things are all financed really badly. However, SaaS isn&#39;t inherently the problem. If you had a shaky product before AI, then it&#39;s true AI makes it more shaky, but a solid product and solid financials work no matter what.

I have no idea about this company, but Doist (who run todoist.com) somehow makes money out of a to-do app (and have been at it for years and years). It&#39;s the thing just about every software tutorial tells you how to build - and yet so

Reminds me of the economist I was listening to on the radio in 2006 who claimed we were in a new economic era where people would simply use the never ending increase in their home equity to finance their entire lives.  Then 2007 arrived. That didn&#39;t end well.

I dunno if it new crops of the gullible coming online, or short memories of huge numbers of people, but we simply refuse to learn from our failures, just repeat them.

It&#39;s clearly both things. Everyone thinks they&#39;re a fucking genius.

It&#39;s clearly both things. Everyone thinks they&#39;re a fucking genius.I agree with that. 

But how is it that we keep repeating the same things that anyone with a memory knows is doomed to failure? I&#39;m certainly not the sharpest pencil in the box, but I pay attention and do have a good memory.  Maybe greed destroys memory, and the noobs just haven&#39;t developed the experience based cynicism yet.

This is a conservative, attributable list of Deutsche Bank costs tied directly to risk, controls, compliance, and governance failures over roughly the last 25 years.

These are not trading losses from bad bets, but money burned because risk assessment and control failed.

1999–2004, dot-com and analyst conflict scandals, settlements and compliance costs about 1.4 billion USD.

2008–2017, US mortgage crisis and RMBS mis-selling, DOJ settlement 7.2 billion USD.

... understood FOSS from day one and wouldn&#39;t touch anything proprietary for anything mission-critical with a ten-foot pole ever since. All the setups I&#39;ve built in the last 25 years won&#39;t even miss a beat when the entire SaaS landscape finally turns into the nuclear wasteland it was always destined to be.

I will enjoy the fireworks though, thank you for those. Getting the popcorn ready as we speak.

Most of the time real problems are caused because people combine multiple questionable issues.

The housing crisis in 2008 was often caused by the Liar Loan.  This was when a bank lied to the customer about how interest rate changes could affect their payments while also letting the customer lie to them about how much money they made.   If either one of them told the truth, the problems would have been much less.  But because both the banks and the customers used questionable methods, the problems compounded

Just a reminder that this is a correlation study. It does not mean that ingesting caffeine will reduce your chance of dementia in the same way that the reduction of pirates has not caused climate change.

It could simply be that people who can afford to spend money on niceties like coffee can afford food and avoid homelessness. Homelessness is highly correlated with death and dementia but that doesn&#39;t mean the house itself is preventing dementia.

So an interesting follow up study would be if Starbucks coffee is more beneficial than drip at home coffee.

So an interesting follow up study would be if Starbucks coffee is more beneficial than drip at home coffee.I&#39;d have to think that&#39;d be the other way around. Drinking ash and charcoal drippings can&#39;t be better than drinking brewed coffee in any manner. Even the lowly drip makers.

What if it&#39;s Starbucks coffee brewed in a home drip?

But independent experts said the study adjusted for many other factors, including health conditions, medication, diet, education, socioeconomic status, family history of dementia, body mass index, smoking and mental illness.

Lucky you, sounds like tea is dirt cheap. I spend $40 on a kg of coffee and it lasts me 3 weeks.

Of course correlation doesn&#39;t automatically equal causation.

But it suggests it, and makes it a reasonable thing to investigate.

But it suggests it, and makes it a reasonable thing to investigate.Correct. If people injecting or swallowing cyanide die, we can probably decide that the cyanide has something to do with that. 

But for the Correlation does not equal causation crowd, you can inject or consume all the cyanide you want, at least until it is definitively proven through the most rigorous scientific experiments, even then, not until multiple replications of the experiments, and  have definite biological mechanisms proven to show that is with no doubt the cyanide and not something else - which

The last paragraph explicitly says they considered that stuff.

That doesn&#39;t mean they did it right, but that objection was addressed in the summary, and we also already all know that.

The study EXPLICITLY accounted for socioeconomic status. So unless you are going to claim homeless people make a bunch of money, I doubt that homelessness is a factor.

> It could simply be that people who can afford to spend money on niceties like coffee can afford food and avoid homelessness

I get your point, but worth pointing out that the study was able to extract details like &quot;Drinking decaff isn&#39;t enough&quot; which tells me this particular potential cause probably isn&#39;t likely.

(Doctor) ”Well, your cholesterol levels are elevated, but new studies show I can safely recommend a cup of coffee for you daily.”

(Sally Starbucks) * whips out trusty 64oz Coffee Chugger Cup * ”OhMyGAWD Holy shit balls YES!  This is aweso..”

(Doctor) ”That means six ounces, stupid.  And you wonder why we’re petitioning to put instructions on bottled water.”

There&#39;s only ~120cc of coffee in my latte.

A cup of coffee is 8 oz. Coffee and tea snobs having their heads so far up their ass they can lick their own duodenum doesn&#39;t change that.

Coffee isn&#39;t going to hurt you, and can be beneficial.  So long as you&#39;re not drinking it several times a day, every day, for the entirety of your adult life.

Same for alcohol.  It does actually have some benefits.  But in small doses.  Not all day, every day, to excess.

Same for... almost literally anything.  Salt.  Sugar.  Fat.  All the stuff that&#39;s &quot;bad&quot; according to cheap headline-grabbing press.  You need it all in some amount.  Just not to excess.

Same, even, for things like vitamins.  No vitamins = you&#39;re dead.  Enough vitamins = you&#39;re fine.  More vitamins = you&#39;re going to see no benefit and/or have problems (Vit D can be overdosed on, for example).

Everything in moderation.  Eat red meat.  It&#39;s fine.  Just don&#39;t eat it every single day for every meal for decades on end.

And then you realise - that&#39;s why you get different answers from these studies, based on who&#39;s running them, who&#39;s reporting them, what they&#39;re testing, and who they are trying to target with the messaging.

Caffeine has benefits.Drinking caffeine to excess outweighs those benefits with downsides.The beneficial effect is rather small.The counter-effect is rather large.Your body consumes more than just caffeine alone.

Which explains ALL those results you gave, without having any untruths in there.  Now replace &quot;caffeine&quot; with pretty much anything - all those things I listed above.  Even drinking too much water will kill you (and it&#39;s not as much as you might think).

Everything in moderation, and then you won&#39;t have a problem.

Same for things like cigarettes, even.  If you only have a few, it&#39;s not going to kill you.  But if you&#39;re smoking 20 a day for decades on end?  Well, hello lung cancer.  It&#39;s why the most dangerous drugs are often the ADDICTIVE ones.  Caffeine included.  People have died from drinking too many caffeine-based energy drinks in too short a period of time.

But cigarettes are highly addictive. Now excuse me, I need more coffee.

Same for alcohol.Actually, that&#39;s mostly just wine, and it isn&#39;t the alcohol providing any of the supposed health benefits, but the other compounds in the fermented grape juice.

Actually, that&#39;s mostly just wine, and it isn&#39;t the alcohol providing any of the supposed health benefits, but the other compounds in the fermented grape juice.

They keep doing studies that show that there&#39;s a small health benefit from red wine.

In between them, studies keep coming out that show zero health benefit from any kind of alcoholic beverage, and in fact, some detriment.

But none of them show much effect in any direction for lower levels of consumption, isn&#39;t that the useful takeaway?

Everything in moderation.You can&#39;t just whip out that phrase and wave it around to solve all your problems.  What is the moderate amount of water?  What is the moderate amount of alcohol (fyi, the negatives outweigh the benefits at all doses)?  Moderate amount of salt?  Etc...  Everything has a different moderate amount and those amounts all dynamically change based on other factors.Saying to just keep to moderate amounts is a bullshit argument if you don&#39;t specify what those amounts are.  It&#39;s the opposite of good advice.  It mean

Everything in moderation. Eat red meat. It&#39;s fine. Just don&#39;t eat it every single day for every meal for decades on end.It is a nice rule of thumb but like most rules of thumb there are many, many exceptions. Such as crack. Or lead. Or gunshot wounds.  The other trick is to figure out what &quot;moderation&quot; means. That&#39;s the big challenge in nutrition work as the data collection is often problematic and the analyses are often even more problematic.

Gunshot wounds have been proven to sometimes have a significant protective benefit to health. It all depends on who the gunshot wounds are on.

Same for alcohol.  It does actually have some benefits.  But in small doses.  Not all day, every day, to excess.Yeah, no, that&#39;s wrong. Even small doses are bad. What you are thinking of is probably wine which has some good properties - but you&#39;d really have to remove the alcohol from it to be a net positive.

Unless you&#39;re hitting stupidly large amounts of Vitamin D it&#39;s really difficult to overdose on. Vitamins A and B3 are much, much easier to OD on. Now, if you don&#39;t get enough K2, larger amounts of Vitamin D can lead to a dysregulation of calcium in your body, but that that is not the same as vitamin overdose.

And they all claim 1) &quot;this is very strong evidence of the benefits of caffeine&quot;, followed by 2) &quot;but don&#39;t forget, this study is simply correlational&quot;; and then 3) &quot;but it is a very large sample&quot;, followed by 4) &quot;but don&#39;t forget... it&#39;s correlational&quot;. Pick a lane, please.There is a 99% chance that almost all funding for water-is-wet studies would instantly evaporate in the face of common fucking sense approvals.Trying to make longevity claims studying the “impact” of coffee vs. everything else that matters, is still marinating in fucking-pointless sauce.  Plenty would be out of a job without sustaining the delusion of “studies”.  That’s why.  Yet another scam on the taxpayer.

I drink two cups of caffeinated coffee every morning. My working assumption, based on this post, is that this will have saved me from my lost decade of hedonistic alcohol and drug abuse. Maybe I&#39;ll up it to three cups.

The study seems to center around the benefits of consuming caffeine via coffee.  So the obvious question is..was the measured benefit provided by the coffee bean, or just pure caffeine?  Relevant question, since I’m pretty sure the kids are vaping caffeine now.  Or will soon.

Bean sucking addicts can’t quite relate to others not liking the taste of coffee, but rest assured there are plenty who would like to understand the benefits of longevity without having to pretend bitter mud water tastes goo

Bean sucking addicts can’t quite relate to others not liking the taste of coffeeBut it&#39;s actually quite tasty if you add..(Rest assured the study didn&#39;t include all the sweeteners, toppings, and sprinkles killing people prematurely, so they mean black coffee.)Damn, never mind.

Yeah, and this bit is a red flag suggesting the study doesn&#39;t actually prove what it appears to prove, ie this may be a coincidence.

The thing is... tea contains far less caffeine than coffee. 8oz of brewed coffee contains 96mg of caffeine vs 48mg in the same amount of black tea (https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372)

So basically there&#39;s no correlation at all with caffeine in this case, if you have to drink 288mg of caffeine via coffee to get

Then you get sleep deprivation, maybe another risk factor in dementia. Torturers use sleep deprivation.

If you&#39;re lucky, messing with your sleep is the least of your worries.  Too much can also can cause a gastrointestinal upset (a heartburn flare-up and/or a case of the shits).  That&#39;s always fun.

Mormons, who drink no coffee should have more dementia cases than &#39;normal&#39; people.:-)

This is why most nerds I know are slamming Monster or NOS all day, I guess.Two lady friends at work and myself were so addicted to coffee, that we ended up having to withdraw from it after having panic attacks. It isn&#39;t permanent - you can start drinking it again after detox, but if you haven&#39;t had a caffeine fueled panic attack, you don&#39;t want one. You 100 percent believe you are going to die in seconds, but don&#39;t know why.

Caffeine, in the form of coffee or tea, brings more than just caffeine to the table.

1) There&#39;s a vascular conditioning effect as it causes constriction and later relaxation of blood vessels in the brain - this could plausibly help maintain proper blood flow and prevent slow hypoperfusion from killing brain cells.

2) There are anti-inflammatory effects from the beverages, and chronic inflammation is another effect of dementia.

3) The drinks are frequently a cause of social interaction, and increased social act

A lot of people don&#39;t stay properly hydrated, so this has to help.I believe all of those. &quot;Coffee dates&quot;, be it for people getting to know each other for possible romantic reasons, or just friends and coworkers chatting are great. 

And the last one (hydration) is more important than many people think. I do my 4 cups in the morning, plus drink a lot of water. Yeah, I pee a lot, but I&#39;m personally convinced that the kidneys need exercised, and that not having it be too &quot;strong&quot; is better than else wise.

One is that if you are in that coffee/tea-bracket, you likely do not have to cut back on it. If it is causation, you definitely should not. If it is something else correlated with dementia and coffee (e.g. lifestyle), you also do not have to. Yes, this comes with some uncertainty, but not that much.

The last time I drank two cups of coffee in a day, I had to wake up three times at night to pee.  My bladder just can&#39;t handle that much caffeine anymore.  Guess I better embrace my destined dementia demise.

I&#39;ve seen coffee studies come out for many decades, and they tend to arrive in the pattern of good, bad, good, bad, good, bad, good, bad, etc.

I average it out: coffee is generally harmless, as long as you don&#39;t overdo it.  If you want coffee, enjoy a cup of joe, otherwise don&#39;t. Don&#39;t overthink it.

Coffee and tea, in reasonable doses, are only as unhealthy as the shit people add to them

Dietary intake was collected every 2 to 4 years using validated food frequency questionnaires.In other words, the input data was very poor.  Please accuracy tell me everything you ate in the last 4 years, including the amounts of things such as the amount of salt and pepper you added to each meal and the amount of creamer you added or didn&#39;t add to your various cups of coffee across that timeframe.If they don&#39;t follow this study with another one directly looking at dosing people with just caffeine, then the study is just statistical propaganda.

I can&#39;t prove there are no unicorns on Pluto, that&#39;s not the way it works. Donny&#39;s team filed about 60 election fraud lawsuits, and lost 59 (snagged one legal technicality), half of them under GOP judges. MAGAs are bigly LOSERS in Court, where catchy but wrong lies don&#39;t work.

Nearly all those cases were dismissed without allowing any real fact finding to proceed. You are right they were dismissed on technicalities, standing issues, courts considering the issues moot because the elections were already certified.

What the entire thing proved is the democrats are actually pretty good at cheating and have spent decades carefully engineering the law and election procedures to make accountability nearly impossible.

Pick your top single best case, let&#39;s focus on one and deep-dive it!

Nah, its ruining chess too. Sites like chess.com its getting harder and harder to find a decent game where your playing a similar ranked human and not getting your shit kicked in by some cheater using stockfish.

There is a very important reason why in history, fraud was aggressively hunted down and destroyed.  There comes a time when people will just stop trusting the system.  Social media goes back to more decentralized items, perhaps just direct messaging or servers like Discord, or IRC channels.  People stop using auction sites, and go back to word of mouth, or trusted supply lines with buyer guarantees.  When finding a deal online becomes a gamble, we may even see a swing back to physical purchases, where a successor of Sears that may be a bit more expensive, but has a solid warranty, with some type of assurance that everything bought in the store will be useful and not junk.

If banks start becoming untrustworthy, people will take their cash and use their mattresses as ATMs.  Same thing will happen with mail order, or other scamming vectors.  For example, fewer and fewer people sell stuff on auction sites because someone will take the item, replace it with a lesser one, and then say they were cheated.  Even if the sending of the package was filmed and signed, this rampant fraud can easily make it unprofitable for someone to work with auction sites.  Maybe it might be good to use those old malls and start having flea markets again.

There is sufficient information in that data for a platform like Facebook, or YouTube to at least red flag accounts and get some humans to look at it. If that&#39;s too much effort for a platform, then make it easier for users to report scams. Even a toggle flag close to the ad which allows people to say &quot;I think this may be a scam&quot; instead of making them fill in a frigging form.

Except platforms earn a significant part of their revenue from scams [reuters.com] (for FB, over 10%). So the incentive to curb scamming is not there...

If the 10% of the revenue generated on my platform from fraud started to pose any real risk to the 90% of the revenue generated by the legitimate users of my platform I think i&#39;d be plenty motivated to deal with the fraudsters.

facebook and others will clean up the platforms the moment people stop tolerating the abuse.  The open question is will people stop tolerating all the abuse?

I&#39;m just going to give some pure speculation here, but I believe that the people who get scammed are not the same as the people who don&#39;t tolerate scamming, and therefore it is easy for social media&#39;s algorithms to only show scams to people who are receptive to it - and those people are, probably, happy to be abused (or if unhappy, they won&#39;t blame it on the system that plasters their feeds with them, but on the scammers themselves).

If this is real, then the 90% normal revenue is not at risk from the 10% sc

That this real problem isn&#39;t it, the platforms are not platforms they are co-conspirators. Few people blame the phone company if someone calls granny and pretends to be from her local bank branch, nobody blames the county library for putting up a public bulletin board where someone offers house cleaning and also helps themselves to the contents of your wife&#39;s jewelry box.

The past month has seen a barrage of election subversion stories that, taken individually, were alarming, but viewed together reveal a deeply disturbing new playbook emanating from the Trump administration ahead of the midterms. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick talked with election law gladiator Marc Elias, chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket. Their discussion, edited and condensed for clarity here, highlights a very clear pattern when it comes to Trump and voting: a project that seeks to normalize violence and to test drive the shattering of how elections are typically run. The work of the coming nine months? Keep a close eye on the encroaching lawlessness, don’t normalize election subversion, and organize now to protect your friends and neighbors.

Dahlia Lithwick: When Steve Bannon pledged last week that ICE is going to “surround the polls”—that the federal government is going to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to patrol polling stations during the midterms—is he trolling, or something we should be taking literally and seriously?

Marc Elias: I don’t think he’s trolling us, I think he’s quite serious. I think Donald Trump wants to maintain optionality here. Trump has put federal paramilitary forces in a number of American cities. Everyone’s focused on Minneapolis, but let’s be clear, it’s not only Minneapolis. Part of it is because he obviously has an anti-immigrant agenda he wants to pursue, but he also wants to normalize the idea of seeing people with flash-bang grenades and tear gas breaking windows and dragging people out of cars, and telling U.S. citizens that they’re being put in databases, and grabbing U.S. citizens and throwing them in the back of vans. Trump wants to normalize all of that because that has a number of side benefits, none so great as potentially using those same forces and same tactics around the midterm elections—not to go after noncitizens, and not even specifically focused on being right around polling places, but just more generally making it more intimidating to vote, making it more inconvenient to get to polling locations, and in its most extreme form, yes, surrounding polling locations and intimidating people or preventing voting altogether.

So I guess the follow-up is just my lawyerly question, which is: Of course it’s not lawful to deploy federal troops or armed federal law enforcement to polling places. The Brennan Center is very clear—it’s a crime for anyone in the military to interfere with elections. So doesn’t this discussion begin and end with the fact that you just can’t?

It doesn’t, for two reasons. First of all, we began the administration with people thinking, Oh my God, what if he puts the military at the polls? And I think Donald Trump has figured out that he’s better off with paramilitary forces than the actual U.S. military. The military may be too disciplined and too principled to do what he wants here, so he’s found other federal law enforcement personnel and agencies willing to do his dirty work. We’ve seen that progression between L.A.—where we saw the National Guard deployed—and now Minneapolis, where we’ve seen ICE and Border Patrol.

More fundamentally, though, what you have is a president who himself enjoys absolute immunity and will wield the pardon power, and that makes saying something is “illegal” a lot less of a credible threat. When you also have a Department of Justice that would never prevent them from doing those things, and in fact would go to court to enable those things … it doesn’t take law off the table, and I never want people to think that the courts are not able to address some of these things, because I think, in fact, the courts have proven the most capable of being checks on Donald Trump. I can promise you lawyers like me will be in court, and we will fight against this, and we may very well win, but it doesn’t mean that he won’t try or that he won’t actually get cooperation from his own administration to do these things.

Also last week, President Trump said the time has come to “nationalize elections.” Can you talk us through what lies beneath that threat? Is there some tangible plan he’s referencing, or is this just another one of his I want what I want and I want it now, and I want these 15 Democratic jurisdictions to be monitored by me.

I think a couple of things here are important. The first is that when he says he wants to “nationalize” the elections, I fear some people think that he’s talking about something like uniform standards across the country, some terrible but nevertheless uniform application of voting standards that would apply in Alabama equally as they would  apply in, say, New York.

But if you look at the broader quote, he’s making false claims about people coming to the country illegally to vote, and then he says, “It’s amazing that the Republicans aren’t tougher on it. The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting.’ The voting in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” So I want to be clear, he’s not talking about nationalizing election administration. He is talking about Republicans taking over the voting, and then identifying that there would be specific jurisdictions in which they would take over that voting. We can assume that those 15 would grow to be beyond 15, and that it would be places with large concentrations of Democratic votes. He’s talking about a partisan takeover, not a federal-versus-state takeover.

The second thing is, I think that the big lie that he is selling in 2026 is his own power regarding these elections. What he’s really doing in this statement is he’s suggesting that the president has powers over elections that he doesn’t have. What we’re seeing is a progression and an escalation. I want everyone to go back in their heads and remember that 2020 didn’t start with a violent insurrection of the nation’s Capitol, it actually started with Donald Trump before the election, well before the election, saying that we can’t have all these mail-in ballots, right? He was railing against mail-in ballots, and then there was litigation before the election about mail-in voting, and in-person voting, and all kinds of stuff, and many in the traditional legacy media treated that as if it was the normal jockeying before elections, and people like me and you were saying, “No! This is actually not normal, this is actually quite extraordinary!”

Then Donald Trump loses the election, and he files not one lawsuit, but he and his allies file 64 lawsuits—which, again, completely not normal! If you go back, maybe in the totality of Bush v. Gore, with all of the subsidiary little issues, maybe there were a dozen cases? But that was one state involving a very, very close margin, decided by the Supreme Court. In 2020, this was a scattershot approach with a lot of bullshit legal theories. And when that didn’t work, he escalated. This is the pivot point that people sometimes look past. On Dec. 19, 2020, after the Electoral College met, the state of Texas filed a petition directly in the U.S. Supreme Court. You know how unusual that is? Texas didn’t go to the trial courts, it just went straight to the U.S. Supreme Court and said, We need you to throw out the election results in four states. This is unheard of. Mike Johnson, who is now the speaker of the House but was at that point a back-bencher, organized 126 Republican members of Congress to sign onto that brief as an amicus. That became a major pivot point, because it was as much a political organizing as it was a legal organizing, and it winds up building up to House Republicans trying to refuse to certify the election Jan. 6, and then the violence and the insurrection we saw on Jan. 6.

That was the progression in 2020. As we look today, we’re seeing the beginnings of the same progression: Donald Trump, first attacking voting, his Department of Justice bringing litigation, which they are losing. Now you see the seizing of ballots in Georgia, and you start to see the rhetoric from Steve Bannon about surrounding the polls. This is the progression that Trump goes through, and I think everyone needs to be really worried.

You just mentioned the FBI search of a warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia, last week, which followed persistent demands from the president, claiming without evidence that fraud cost him Georgia. They used the opportunity to seize almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documents, all in the presence of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, who was on the scene for that raid. Can you explain why it’s a big deal, having the DNI present for an FBI raid in Georgia?

Yes, and there’s another fact that has been way too much overlooked: The prosecutor who sought this search warrant is in Missouri; this was not out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Georgia. From reporting, it appears this U.S. attorney out of a district in Missouri has jurisdiction not only over the 2020 Fulton County matter (to the extent that it is a matter), but also some kind of nationwide jurisdiction over all election “things.”

When you take in his involvement and you take in Gabbard’s involvement, I think you need to recast this as not simply election nihilism about 2020, and not only as a fight about nostalgia—which would still be terrible, unprecedented, and dangerous—but that would be one thing. I think this raid is about proof of concept for the future. People are talking about seizing ballots and surrounding polling places and stealing elections as if somehow these things are easily done. These are conceptual frameworks that people in the administration have to get comfortable with; these are moral frameworks they have to get comfortable with. They have to contend with the Constitution and the law and judges and all that, but they also have to contend with just the sheer logistics of it all: How do we actually do this thing where there are ballots in the possession of a county official? And how are we going to get them, and how are we going to then count them in a way that is going to cast doubt on the outcome, or cast doubt on the outcome through other propaganda and disinformation campaigns? This Georgia raid is just as much about all that as it is about 2020.

Donald Trump and his administration actually managed to pull something off here. They actually did seize ballots, they actually got their hands on them. People can say “Oh, they had the wrong warrant and they had to go back,” but at the end of the day, Tulsi Gabbard was on a truck full of documents seized from an office, and those are now in the possession of the FBI and presumably a grand jury by this prosecutor from Missouri. That should be terrifying. In terms of alarm bells, this is off the charts. They faced a challenge in 2020 and were humiliated in how to subvert the outcome of an election, and Donald Trump told the New York Times that he wished he had seized the ballots in 2020. They have now shown they have a proof of concept, that they know logistically how to do this—including getting a federal magistrate judge to sign a warrant. That is not a small matter, that is a safeguard put in place to prevent the abuse of grand juries, the abuse of subpoenas, and the abuse of arrest warrants. They got through that process, and that is a learning exercise that they will use going forward to 2026, and it is the thing that I probably worry the most about.

Pete Hegseth, perhaps the most thuggish, toadying, all-around underqualified secretary of defense in the job’s nearly 80-year history, has now shown himself to be the most institutionally destructive as well.

His announcement on Friday, that he was cutting the department’s ties to Harvard University—and possibly to other centers of higher learning too—reflects not only a smug anti-intellectualism, which is out of sync with a high-tech modern military, but also a total misunderstanding of how and why its ties to academia first came about.

“For too long,” Hegseth said in a video, “this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class. Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard—heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks. … We train warriors, not wokesters. Harvard, good riddance.”

From start to finish, this speech is pure rubbish.

The need to broaden the education of America’s warriors was first perceived by Gen. George Marshall, the U.S. Army’s chief of staff during World War II (hardly an emblem of woke). Marshall relied heavily on the chief of his Strategy and Policy Group, Brig. Gen. George Lincoln. (I delved into his papers at the West Point Archives for Chapter 1 of my 2013 book The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War.)

In the last year of the war—at age 37 the Army’s youngest general officer—Lincoln met with Marshall daily, coordinated every major military campaign, and helped draft the treaties at Yalta and Potsdam, which shaped the political map of postwar Europe. He then assisted Marshall’s replacement, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, in creating the Department of Defense.

The special thing about Lincoln was, after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1929, he won a Rhodes scholarship and spent the next three years at Oxford, studying philosophy, politics, and economics—then returned to West Point to teach before getting assigned to high-level staff jobs after WWII broke out.

While working with Marshall at the various Allied planning conferences, Lincoln noticed that much of the crucial work was done by a handful of fellow military officers, almost all of whom had also been Rhodes scholars. He did a little research and found that West Point had produced 13 Rhodes scholars in its history. Of the six still alive, four were holding senior policy posts, helping set the terms of military strategy and postwar peace treaties.

As the war ended, the United States was emerging as a global power with global responsibilities. It would need leaders well versed in politics, diplomacy, economics, and strategy. But few such people existed in or out of the military. Certainly West Point, Lincoln’s alma mater, wasn’t training such people. At the time, all its cadets took the same courses, which focused mainly on engineering. There was a course on bridge building, but no courses on military history.

In May 1945, less than two weeks after the end of the war, Lincoln wrote a letter to one of his mentors back at West Point. “I am beginning to think that what we need is a type of staff officer with at least three heads—one political, one economic, and one military.” In another letter, he proposed “baptizing practically all officers” with a “sprinkling” of education in politics, history, and economics, while taking “certain selected” officers and “dunking” them in those waters much more deeply.

The Army, he continued, “can no longer afford to depend on the fortuitous assembly of Rhodes Scholars. … There must be an integrated system of high-level training if Army policy and national policy are properly to be served, a system which begins here at West Point.”

Lincoln could easily have gone on to have a storied career, rising through the Army’s officer corps. Instead, he returned to West Point to create a new department of social sciences, which would mold this new system. Since regulations required that department heads be colonels, not generals, Lincoln even took a demotion in his rank and was never again promoted.

He started his new job on Sept. 1, 1947. He and Col. Herman Beukema, his onetime mentor and now the new department’s co-founder, created courses in history, government, foreign affairs, geography, national-security economics, and international relations. Lincoln also wrote the nation’s first college-level textbook on international politics, a reference that was assigned not only at West Point but at several civilian colleges across the country.

Over time, cadets concentrating in social sciences formed an elite enclave, which became an object of resentment and ridicule among some more hidebound officers. As late as 1991, when Gen. “Stormin’ Norman” Schwarzkopf returned from his command of Operation Desert Storm to deliver a rousing victory speech at West Point, he reminisced about his own days as a cadet and poked fun at the crazy ideas advanced by “a couple of left-wing pinko Social Science instructors.”

Schwarzkopf was mining a well-known stereotype. (Even at this late date, some of the cadets laughed at and applauded his remark.) He was only half joking, however. Some of his own staff officers had been products of “Sosh,” the academy’s nickname for the social sciences department. But Schwarzkopf’s jab (minus the humor) is the view that Hegseth now holds of the entire enterprise: seeing war as nothing more than killing. In this view, all other dimensions of warfare—the idea that soldiers should understand the enemy they’re fighting, interpret their tactics in a strategic context, and stay within the confines of international law—are not merely secondary but counterproductive, contrary to a “warrior spirit,” woke.

Lincoln had another purpose in creating the new department. “I am certain,” he wrote in one letter, “that we must make strenuous efforts … to improve the so-called Army mind.” This would mean, above all, “impressing the student with the fact that the basic requirement is to learn to think—sometimes a very painful process.”

Perhaps more than anything else, this is what Hegseth sees, and fears, in the officers who have earned degrees or fellowships at places like Harvard. This spirit of inquiry, curiosity, and criticism is what he defines as “woke.”

Early on in the development of Sosh, Lincoln put in place a rule allowing cadets who did especially well in his courses to go study at a civilian graduate school, with West Point paying their tuition. In exchange, these cadets, after earning their master’s or doctoral degrees, would come back to teach in the Sosh department for at least three years. Once they fulfilled that obligation, Lincoln would use his still-considerable connections in Washington to get them choice assignments in the Pentagon, the State Department, the White House, a foreign embassy, or a prestigious command post.

Lincoln died in 1975, but the Sosh tradition lived on. Today almost all general officers in the U.S. Army (and also in the Air Force, which was a branch of the Army until 1947, when it became an independent service) hold graduate degrees—and most of them, at least the generals I know, are as proud of their degrees as they are of their ranks.

For instance, Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the more successful phases of the war in Iraq, went to West Point, then earned a Ph.D. at Princeton University. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who was a lethal tank commander and a counterinsurgency strategist in Iraq (as well as, briefly, national security adviser during Donald Trump’s first term as president), followed a similar path, getting his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina.

Maybe Hegseth sees those officers as epitomes of woke. But what about the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, appointed and lauded by Trump and his entire team, including Hegseth? His page on the JCS website states that Caine “has completed a range of national security and leadership courses, including Harvard Kennedy School’s course for Senior Executives in National and International Security.”

Someone should ask Caine, the next time he appears at a press conference or a congressional hearing, whether his spirit and skill as a warrior and a citizen were helped or hindered by his Ivy League exposure. Maybe Hegseth should have asked the question—and maybe he should think and read up even a little bit about a vast range of topics before opening his mouth.

As I followed a patrol of federal agents around New York City’s Chinatown during their fumbling attempted raid in mid-October last year, I noticed something curious. I was following a small group with the immediately recognizable style of Stephen Miller’s paramilitaristic vanguard: baggy street clothes, masked faces, weapons, and ballistic vests without specific insignia, just the catchall “POLICE” or “Federal Agent.” As we turned one corner, we walked past two other agents dressed much the same, except that one wore a vest that did have agency identification, and it wasn’t Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection; it read “IRS-CI,” for the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation division.

This is not typically what IRS-CI does. The comparatively small federal law enforcement agency, like the majority of its counterparts, is specialized around one area of enforcement, in this case tasked with investigating criminal violations of the tax code—complex investigations requiring particularized skills, which is why the IRS’ own job portal encourages “expertise in accounting.” It is not part of the Department of Homeland Security or even the Department of Justice, residing under the IRS in the Treasury Department.

Yet here was an IRS-CI agent on a foot patrol during a much larger operation that seemed primarily geared toward detaining random men whom agents deemed likely to be African, and she wasn’t an anomaly. As a well-placed source confirmed to me contemporaneously, the operation had hastily brought in dozens of agents from ICE, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and the IRS, potentially among other agencies. This approach itself is not now abnormal; per figures obtained and published by the Cato Institute last September, an eye-watering 28,390 federal law enforcement personnel as of August had been detailed to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, the component that handles immigration arrests and detention.

About 17,500 of these came from either ICE’s criminal-focused division, Homeland Security Investigations, or CBP, but that leaves over 10,000 coming from entities that are not focused on immigration enforcement at all. The IRS provided 1,771, which out of a total special agent population of about 2,100, means about 84 percent of its agent workforce was detailed to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. The DEA provided 3,417, which would be some 70 percent of its special agent workforce. Thousands more came from the FBI; Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives; and even the State Department’s Diplomatic Security service.

This reality has been covered mostly from the standpoint of it taking agents away from crucial other tasks, ranging from child exploitation to financial crimes to drug trafficking (the latter of which notably forms the pretext for a lot of the Trump administration’s domestic enforcement push). But it also has some concrete implications for accountability; not only are agents often neither named nor identified, their agencies themselves are unclear.

Some observers noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi simply referred to “federal agents” in her X post and subsequent comments on the arrest of several people including journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort last week. In a video Fort posted to Facebook, an agent wearing a DEA vest can be seen peering through her window; it’s unclear which agency the others belonged to.

We are no longer talking about individual law enforcement agencies, but rather a giant, singular blob. The burgeoning momentum in what has been a stultified Democratic congressional minority’s effort to rein in some of ICE’s actions—partly compelled by public horror at the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis—will have to contend with the fact of this blob. Lawmakers have been pushing for the DHS inspector general to probe the agency’s use of force, among other things, but will this inquiry encompass abuses potentially committed by other agencies’ personnel? Who’s to say which agency is even involved in any given operation?

Democrats are also now negotiating over (relatively small-bore) constraints like mandating body cameras and limiting masks as they work to hold up DHS funding. They should consider that language too narrowly tailored to ICE and CBP is potentially going to miss DEA agents, for example, detailed to the exact same job. The funding freeze itself—which might have limited overall impact in light of the multibillion-dollar orgy of funding already bestowed on ICE in last year’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill—won’t touch the operations of, say, the Department of Justice, which houses the ATF, Marshals, and Bureau of Prisons, all of which have seen agents deployed with ICE.

This amorphous and ever-shifting group of agents drawn from across the federal government looks increasingly like a catchall national police force operating at the direction of the White House itself, used for diffuse political goals like immigration enforcement, speech crackdowns, and occupying politically oppositional cities. While different federal agencies have long collaborated on joint investigations, this appears to be much more like absorption than collaboration. The underlying agencies still exist, of course, but their agent workforces are substantially or even mostly no longer part of them, instead existing as part of this national police blob.

This also shifts the question of capacity. ICE has been going on a messy hiring push to try to significantly beef up its numbers, though the results may take a while to fully manifest. Yet this means that, without hiring a single additional recruit, ICE ERO has just about tripled its workforce as its mission keeps shifting to include its general immigration functions plus additional White House priorities. It has been suggested by Steve Bannon and others that Trump would deploy members of this law enforcement blob during November’s midterms to monitor polling places and potentially intimidate voters. While the administration’s pseudo-sieges of cities have the limiting factor of ICE’s and CBP’s headcount, these are pools of already trained and equipped federal agents that they can draw from other entities to expand this footprint.

They probably already have; though a DOJ attorney told a federal judge that the 3,000-strong surge of agents to the Twin Cities included 2,000 ICE personnel, we don’t really know if this includes agents detailed to ICE from other agencies. The administration does not publicly disclose how many agents from which agencies have been reassigned to ICE ERO, nor where they’re deployed or what they’re doing. In the context of agents prowling around cities, arresting people seemingly at random and occasionally killing protesters, the specific seal on any given agent’s badge might seem inconsequential, but if state authorities and lawmakers want to get serious about oversight and accountability for these authoritarian operations, they will need to understand the scope, nature, and composition of this federal force.

Trump has called for elections to be “nationalized,” something neither the president, nor the federal government, has the authority to do. But as he’s already sent the FBI to raid Fulton County, Georgia’s election offices with director of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and with the midterms on their way, it’s time to ask how much damage a vindictive president could do.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration continues its AI push, working to defuse public opposition to datacenter energy and water consumption - while dangling a promise to exempt hyperscalers from chip tariffs to help them stock their facilities with GPUs and accelerators.

To address public concerns, Washington wants tech giants to commit that their expanding datacenter estates across the US won&#39;t spike energy bills or drain local water supplies.

According to Politico, a proposed voluntary pact between President Trump, the datacenter industry and megacorps like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta and OpenAI, would establish principles around energy, water use and local community relations.

The move aligns with recent developments: last month, Trump declared tech companies must fund datacenter power increases rather than passing costs to consumers, securing Microsoft&#39;s compliance. The US Energy Secretary also pressured grid operator PJM Interconnection to hold an emergency auction addressing surging AI datacenter demand.

This appears aimed at containing growing public opposition to server farms popping up all over the US. Research org Data Center Watch found 20 projects were blocked or delayed by local opposition during Q2 2025 alone.

Other reports indicate hyperscalers may be spared from President Trump&#39;s chip import tariffs to avoid impeding their buildouts. In January, the White House said it was imposing 25 percent tariffs on &quot;certain advanced computing chips,&quot; including Nvidia&#39;s H200 and AMD&#39;s MI325X.

According to the Financial Times, these tariff carve-outs may be contingent on chip companies - especially TSMC - committing to relocating more production stateside.

This furthers Washington&#39;s effort to relocate 40-50 percent of TSMC&#39;s manufacturing to US soil, a &quot;massive reshoring&quot; that Taiwan&#39;s vice-premier this week called &quot;impossible.&quot;

TSMC has committed $165 billion to Arizona fabs that will produce some of its 2nm chips, though whether this satisfies Trump remains unclear.

If TSMC meets conditions for hyperscalers tariff exemptions, the US would exempt the largest buyers of products it just tariffed. Reg readers can no doubt spot the irony.

Last month TSMC posted Q4 2025 revenue of $33.7 billion, up more than 25 percent year-on-year. Full-year revenue for the world&#39;s largest chip contract manufacturer came in at $122.5 billion, up 36 percent compared to 2024. ®

            <h2>Microsoft dials up the nagging in Windows, calls it security</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/10/microsoft_windows_security/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is introducing a raft of Windows security features that users and administrators alike might assume are already part of the operating system.

Dubbed &quot;Windows Baseline Security Mode&quot; and &quot;User Transparency and Consent,&quot; the updates are intended to deal with suspect behavior behind the scenes while also prompting the user when an app tries to use a sensitive resource, such as the device&#39;s camera or microphone, or wanders into a user&#39;s sensitive files.

Starting with the Baseline Security Mode, the plan is for Windows to operate with runtime integrity safeguards enabled by default. This means only properly signed apps, services, and drivers. However, users and administrators can still override the safeguards for that one weird legacy app, and app developers can check if the protections are active and if any exceptions have been granted.

For User Transparency and Consent, it looks like there could be a lot more nagging in store. The current User Account Control (UAC) prompt often triggers little more than an eye roll and a swift click. But Microsoft&#39;s new approach will be more granular, asking for explicit consent when apps access sensitive resources or try to install other software.

&quot;Just like on your smartphone,&quot; said Microsoft, although hopefully without all the restrictions that come with a walled garden of vendors like Apple has.

So users are set to face more prompts, although Microsoft stated: &quot;These prompts are designed to be clear and actionable, and you&#39;ll always have the ability to review and change your choices later.&quot;

Those same users might wonder why Microsoft&#39;s operating system does not already have such restrictions in place, but their arrival is laudable nonetheless, even if it is one more thing for administrators to either explain to users or deactivate ahead of the inevitable flood of support tickets.

Alex Ionescu, Chief Technology Innovation Officer at CrowdStrike, said: &quot;CrowdStrike is looking forward to being an early partner in the development of a new, more secure and resilient runtime model for Windows applications, which helps raise the bar for user security and privacy.

&quot;When applications and agentic workloads are well-behaved and respect user consent settings with proper security boundaries, security software can better protect users from attackers with reduced performance overhead.&quot;

CrowdStrike, lest we forget, was the outfit responsible for an update that bricked Windows devices worldwide in 2024. The incident was at least partly responsible for Microsoft having a serious rethink about Windows security and what third-party components should be allowed to do.

Microsoft has been talking about beefing up Windows security for years. Its Secure Future Initiative (SFI) predated the CrowdStrike incident, but didn&#39;t prevent a piece of malformed code from taking down millions of Windows instances.

In this case, user concerns about AI agents are also at play. Microsoft said: &quot;Apps and AI agents will also be expected to meet higher transparency standards, giving both users and IT administrators better visibility into their behaviors.&quot;

Microsoft did not give a timeline for the updates, only the direction of travel. The company said the changes would &quot;roll out through a phased approach.&quot; ®

            <h2>Oracle Java licensing worries are percolating through the userbase</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Concerns over changes to Oracle&#39;s Java licensing strategy are hitting more than nine out of ten users as businesses struggle to adapt to the regime, according to research.

A study from Dimensional Research shows that 92 percent of the 2,000 respondents reported being concerned about Oracle Java pricing, up from 82 percent in the same survey last year. Those stating they were very concerned about the changes leapt from 19 percent in 2025 to 29 percent this year.

In 2023, Oracle changed its Java SE subscription model, shifting from a per-user or per-processor basis to per-employee. Critics called the move &quot;predatory&quot; as organizations that were using little Java but had a large number of employees could be hit hard by the cost increase.

Later that year, research from Gartner showed that costs could be between two and five times greater under the new licensing model for using the same software.

Anxiety over the new charging model is a major driver pushing Java users to look for alternatives. Eighty-one percent of users have migrated, are migrating, or plan to migrate all or some of their Oracle Java to an open source alternative, according to the survey of global tech pros.

A number of alternatives to Oracle exist for running OpenJDK applications in production, including Bellsoft Liberica, IBM Semeru, and Azul Platform Core. Concern over the licensing change continues to spike because awareness is still filtering through the user community, said Gil Tene, CTO and co-founder of Java support and technology provider Azul Systems, which commissioned the research.

&quot;For most of them, the way they find out is a conversation with an Oracle salesperson, and that conversation starts at some place in the organization, but then it takes a while for that to make it through the organization, to the people actually looking at financial implications and the budget.&quot;

Tene said the users were also waking up to the fact that a strategy to gradually move off Oracle Java does not solve the licensing problem.

&quot;The shift that happened about a little under three years ago is that they went from volume-based to employee-based pricing. It&#39;s enough for one employee in the company to use one copy of Java from Oracle, for the company to be on the hook for paying per employee, for the entire employee base,&quot; he claimed.

A separate study from Dimensional Research published last year found that 73 percent of Oracle Java users had been audited in the last three years.

Another pressure on Java costs has been the shift to the cloud. The latest Dimensional Research data shows 97 percent of participants have taken actions to reduce their public cloud costs, including using a high-performance Java platform (41 percent). However, 74 percent of organizations say they still have more than 20 percent unused compute capacity in their public cloud environments.

The Register has asked Oracle to comment. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Singapore spent almost a year flushing a suspected China-linked espionage crew out of its telecom networks in what officials describe as the country&#39;s largest cyber defense operation to date.

The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore said advanced persistent threat UNC3886 dug itself into the networks of all four major telecom providers, sparking an 11-month digital eviction effort involving more than 100 personnel from across government, military, intelligence, and industry. Branded &quot;Operation Cyber Guardian,&quot; the cleanup saw the state and telco engineers teaming up to flush the intruders out while keeping the nation&#39;s phone and data pipes flowing.

&quot;Over the past months, our investigations have indicated that UNC3886 had launched a deliberate, targeted, and well-planned campaign against Singapore&#39;s telecommunications sector,&quot; the CSA said.

Officials stopped short of formally pointing the finger at Beijing, but UNC3886 has long been associated with Chinese state-aligned cyber espionage. The group tends to skip flashy break-ins on user machines and instead sneaks into the dull but revealing parts of network infrastructure, where traffic flows quietly and almost nobody is paying attention.

According to Singapore&#39;s account, the attackers slipped past perimeter defenses using a previously unknown flaw, then dug in using custom rootkits that let them stay hidden deep inside telecom systems. Officials didn&#39;t say what bugs had been exploited, but UNC3886 was previously observed exploiting zero-day flaws in FortiGate firewalls, VMware ESXi, and VMware vCenter Server endpoints.

Investigators believe the operation focused on siphoning off technical network information that could support long-term intelligence collection, rather than stealing customer records or causing outages that might draw attention.

The tactics will sound familiar to anyone who has followed recent telecom-focused espionage campaigns. The operation bears a strong resemblance to the China-backed Salt Typhoon espionage campaign uncovered in 2024, which also went after telecom providers across several countries using similar infrastructure-level tricks to quietly watch data and communications traffic.

That kind of access is why telecom breaches tend to ring louder alarm bells than the average hack. Operators sit at the intersection of government communications, enterprise data, and consumer traffic, making them attractive targets for states looking to map networks, monitor flows, or set the stage for future intelligence operations.

Singapore described Operation Cyber Guardian as its &quot;largest coordinated cyber incident response effort undertaken to date.&quot; Cleaning up involved identifying compromised devices, sealing off attacker access paths, patching vulnerabilities, and ramping up monitoring to ensure the intruders didn&#39;t simply circle back.

Singapore warned that telecom networks will remain prime targets and urged operators to assume sophisticated actors are already probing their defenses. ®

            <div id="article-text">Scarcely a day goes by without an outage at a cloud service. Forget five nines – the way things are going, one nine is looking like an ambitious goal.

GitHub has had a rough month so far. On February 9, Actions, pull requests, notifications, and Copilot all experienced issues. The Microsoft tentacle admitted it was having problems with &quot;some GitHub services&quot; at 1554 UTC before it confessed to notification delays of &quot;around 50 minutes&quot;.

It took until 1929 UTC for the company to confirm that things were back to normal, although the delay was down to &quot;approximately 30 minutes&quot; by 1757 UTC.

One of its flagship technologies, Copilot, also suffered. From 1629 UTC on February 9 to 0957 UTC on February 10, GitHub reported problems in Copilot policy propagation for some users. The code shack said: &quot;This may prevent newly enabled models from appearing when users try to access them.&quot;

And so it goes on. GitHub changed its status page a while ago, making it harder to visualize the availability of its services. Yes, the details are front and center, but getting a sense of how things have gone over the last 90 days, particularly overall uptime, is trickier.

The &quot;missing&quot; status page exists in reconstructed form via the public status feed, though this is an unofficial source so requires caution. It reveals that GitHub&#39;s stability has been poor: uptime dropped below 90 percent at one point in 2025.

The code shack isn&#39;t alone in experiencing service instability. While five nines (99.999 percent uptime) represents the gold standard, some vendors struggle to maintain even 90 percent — a concern for customers relying on these platforms.

GitHub&#39;s Service Level Agreement for Enterprise Cloud customers specifies 99.9 percent uptime, although the company does not guarantee this for all users.

The travails of GitHub customers highlight the need to plan for downtime as well as uptime. ®

            <h2>Apple, Google agree to loosen grip on UK app stores</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/10/apple_google_uk_app_stores/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple and Google have pledged to change how their app stores operate in the UK following scrutiny from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is trying to curb their control over the app distribution pipelines feeding UK phones.

The CMA said on Tuesday it has secured commitments from both companies to make app store approvals, rankings, and developer treatment less opaque, while forcing Apple to open up parts of iOS to rival services. The regulator is consulting on the proposals ahead of potential implementation later this year, marking one of the first concrete tests of Britain&#39;s new digital markets enforcement powers.

The CMA&#39;s move follows its decision last year to designate Apple and Google as holding &quot;strategic market status,&quot; a formal nod to the fact that most UK phones run iOS or Android, and there&#39;s no practical way for app makers to reach users without going through one of the two.

Under the commitments, both companies agreed to use fair and objective criteria when reviewing and ranking apps, and to avoid exploiting developer data gathered during app approval processes to advantage their own services. Regulators have long argued that the app store approval pipeline can function as a choke point, particularly when platform owners are competing directly with third-party developers.

Apple is facing the more substantial demands. The iPhone maker has agreed to create clearer pathways for developers to request access to system-level features inside iOS and iPadOS, a move the CMA believes could enable stronger competition in areas such as payments, digital identity, and translation tools. The watchdog says it will track metrics, including review timelines, appeal rates, and the handling of interoperability requests to ensure the commitments translate into real changes.

Google, for its part, is trying to frame the outcome as consistent with Android&#39;s existing &quot;open&quot; positioning while warning regulators against accidentally kneecapping the ecosystem it claims supports a significant slice of the UK digital economy.

In a blog post, Google leaned hard on Android&#39;s &quot;openness,&quot; pointing out it already supports multiple app stores, alternative browsers, and different payment setups, and arguing that gives developers and users more room to maneuver than some rival platforms.

The company pointed to the scale of Android&#39;s economic footprint, saying the platform has generated roughly £9.9 billion in revenue for UK developers and supports more than 450,000 domestic jobs.

&quot;Our proposed voluntary commitments will continue to provide transparency on our app review, ranking and data usage policies and practices to ensure developers understand the many choices available to them on Google Play,&quot; the tech giant said.

That response marks a noticeably softer stance than Google adopted when the CMA first slapped the company with strategic market status, which it previously blasted as disproportionate and unjustified.

Apple has stayed characteristically tight-lipped, offering no response to The Register&#39;s questions.

For the CMA, the commitments are being presented as proof that the UK&#39;s Digital Markets regime can deliver quicker, targeted interventions without the years-long legal slugfests that have traditionally defined antitrust enforcement against Silicon Valley. ®

Google is simplifying the process for taking nonconsensual explicit images out of results, too.

Google is expanding its tools for removing your sensitive information and nonconsensual images from its search results. The company announced on Tuesday that you can now use its “results about you” tool to remove your driver’s license, passport, and Social Security number from search, in addition to your phone number and address.

Once you add your information to Google’s “results about you” tool, Google will show search results containing your data, while giving you the option to request removal. Google says it protects the information entered into the tool with “advanced encryption.” You can sign up to receive notifications when it detects new search results containing your personal data, though the company notes the tool doesn’t remove your information “from the web entirely.” Google is bringing this update to the US in the coming days, with plans to expand it to other regions.

Google is building on efforts to help stop the spread of nonconsensual explicit images in its results, too. You can now ask that Google remove an image by selecting the three dots at the top of a picture, choosing “remove results,” and clicking on the option that says, “It shows a sexual image of me.” Google’s updated tool also lets you ask the company to remove multiple images at once, as well as opt-into protections that will “proactively filter out” similar explicit results in the future. This feature is rolling out to “most countries” in the coming days.

Preorders for the Razer Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition start on February 10th, and are limited to only 1,337 units.

Nostalgia’s getting expensive. When Razer announced last December it would be relaunching the world’s first gaming mouse with a few modern upgrades, it didn’t reveal how much the Razer Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition would cost or when it would be released. The company will officially open preorders for the mouse on February 10th at 8AM PT for those in the US. In Europe, preorders will start on February 11th at 8AM CET, while in Asia it will be February 11th at 8AM SGT. The production run is still being limited to just 1,337 units in total, but with a matching $1,337 price tag, they might not fly off shelves.

The original version of the mouse, called the Kärna Razer Boomslang, launched before gaming-specific peripherals were even a thing. It distinguished itself from other mice on the market at the time with an upgraded encoding wheel that offered more accurate mouse tracking, giving gamers a potential competitive advantage.

The 20th Anniversary Edition of the Razer Boomslang replaces those mechanical components with a 45,000 DPI optical sensor. The original mouse’s symmetrical ambidextrous design has been carried forward, but the new Boomslang is now wireless with an 8,000Hz polling rate and comes with a Razer Mouse Dock Pro wireless charging stand. You’ll also find 9-zone customizable RGB lighting on the underside of the new Boomslang that can be synced to over 300 games; a feature the Razer brand has become known for.

A quarter century ago the Kärna Razer Boomslang was priced at $69.99 to $99.99, according to Eurogamer. The new version’s $1,337 price far outpaces inflation, but Razer is sweetening the pot by including an LED lit display frame featuring a deconstructed look at the Razer Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition’s internal components.

Russia’s communications regulator is continuing to crack down on apps like Telegram and WhatsApp while rolling out a state-backed alternative, Max.﻿

Telegram users in Russia may begin noticing service disruptions on Tuesday after Russia’s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, reportedly moved to slow down and restrict access to the app, as reported by Russian news outlet RBC.

Roskomnadzor said in a statement to RBC, translated using machine translation, that it “will continue to introduce successive restrictions” on Telegram, claiming the app is not taking adequate steps to prevent fraud and criminal activity. Reuters quotes Telegram users in Moscow who confirmed that they’ve been experiencing issues with the app, including a woman named Anna, who said, “It’s very bad because all my friends and family use Telegram. I don’t know how I’m going to communicate with them because I don’t want to move to other platforms.”

In August, Roskomnadzor began “partially” blocking calls in Telegram and WhatsApp, claiming both are used for extortion and “terrorist activities.” Around the same time, Russia also ordered phone and tablet manufacturers to pre-install its state-backed Max messaging app on new devices sold in the region.

Telegram’s Russian-born founder and CEO, Pavel Durov, has not publicly commented on the issues, but his most recent tweet on February 8th took aim at leaders of several European nations. “Officials with the lowest approval ratings in the world (Macron, Starmer, Merz, Sanchez) are the loudest champions of social media bans for teens and ‘misinformation’ crackdowns,” wrote Durov, who was arrested in France in 2024 over the platform’s lack of moderation.

﻿Superconducting cables could make for more compact data centers.

Microsoft wants to design more efficient data centers using materials that allow electricity to flow with zero resistance. If these new materials, called high-temperature superconductors, can make it to market, Microsoft thinks it could be a game changer for how data centers and the energy infrastructure they connect to are built.

Tech companies are facing backlash over how much power generative AI demands, delays connecting to power grids that lack the infrastructure to meet those demands, and the impact construction of new data centers has on local residents. High-temperature superconductors (HTS) could potentially shrink the amount of space needed for a data center and the transmission lines feeding it power.

“Microsoft is exploring how this technology could make electrical grids stronger and reduce the impact data centers have on nearby communities,” Microsoft GM of Global Infrastructure Marketing Alistair Speirs wrote in a blog published today.

“The future data center will be superconducting”

Today’s centers — and most of our energy infrastructure — rely on old-school copper wires, which conduct electricity pretty efficiently. HTS cables, however, can move an electrical current with zero resistance, slashing the amount of energy lost in the process. It also allows for cables that are lighter and more compact. You’ll already find HTS in MRI machines, and more recently used in short stretches for power lines in dense metropolitan areas including Paris and Chicago.

So far, though, their use has been limited in part because HTS cables have been more complicated and expensive to use in energy systems than copper cables. To reach zero resistance, the HTS would need to be cooled to very low temperatures — likely using liquid nitrogen. And the HTS “tape” that forms the basis of superconducting cables is typically made with rare-earth barium copper oxide material. While a superconducting cable only requires a small amount of rare-earth material, the supply chain for the rare earth element is still largely concentrated in China. A bigger challenge, experts tell The Verge, will be increasing the manufacturing capacity for this tape enough for it to be affordable.

That’s starting to change as a result of the power demands of generative AI. In recent years, tech companies have fueled research into the development of a nuclear fusion power plant, long considered the holy grail of clean energy. Much of the HTS tape manufactured today goes toward fusion research, and growth in that department has managed to lower costs for the material.

“That actually helped the supply chain and manufacturer variety, and even some of the costing of HTS … for us to, like, oh, ‘Well, let’s think about that. Now things have changed a little bit,’” says Husam Alissa, director of systems technology at Microsoft.

Microsoft is primarily interested in using HTS in two ways, Alissa tells The Verge. Inside a data center, smaller cables would allow for more flexibility in how the electrical rooms and racks of hardware are laid out. With funding from Microsoft, Massachusetts-based superconducting company VEIR demonstrated last year that HTS cables at a data center could deliver the same amount of power with about a 10x reduction in cable dimension and weight compared to conventional alternatives.

“The future data center will be superconducting … High power, more efficient, more compact,” says Ziad Melhem, professor in practice in the physics department at Lancaster University who sits on the editorial board for the Superconductivity Global Alliance. (Melhem disclosed that he previously worked at Oxford Instruments, which supplied Microsoft with components for its quantum computer system.)

Outside of the data center, Microsoft is open to working with energy companies to support the buildout of long-distance power lines using HTS. Expanding transmission lines has been one of the biggest bottlenecks when it comes to updating the power grid, connecting data centers, and building out more power supply. The process of getting approvals to build such large infrastructure across multiple jurisdictions can be long and arduous.

With power lines made from HTS, the amount of space needed for those power lines could shrink significantly. While overhead transmission lines might spread out over an area around 70 meters in width, superconducting cables might only need 2 meters of clearance, according to the Microsoft blog. The smaller area ostensibly shaves down the time and cost needed for construction.

“This is an obvious evolution of the use of this technology,” says Dennis Whyte, a professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT. Whyte has not worked directly with Microsoft, but co-leads an effort to build a fusion machine called SPARC that’s a collaboration between MIT and a company called Commonwealth Fusion Systems that’s received funding from Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

The additional interest in HTS for data centers could also allow fusion companies get more of the material for less money, helping propel advances in nuclear fusion technology as well. Microsoft has separately inked a deal with another company developing a fusion power plant in Washington state. “It’s come full circle,” Whyte says.

            <div id="article-text">﻿According to recently released documents, the convicted sex offender had a vast network of people working to whitewash his digital presence.

In between hobnobbing with royalty and world leaders and abusing children and young women, Jeffrey Epstein appears to have been googling himself regularly. Across several batches of documents related to the convicted sex offender made public, we see Epstein shoot off emails to associates, complaining that his digital footprint includes factual information about his crimes.

mike „ can you olcan up my wiki page (April 18th, 2011)

Any way to clean up my wiki page (September 17th, 2013)

Epstein regularly directed his gripes at Al Seckel, a fixer type who appears over and over in Epstein files and promises to bury news articles and other content that mentions his abuse. But Seckel didn’t do it alone. Over thousands of documents, it’s clear that many people — SEO consultants, contacts in the sciences, and even unrelated acquaintances — helped to obscure Epstein’s past whenever someone searched for him online. Even after Epstein had pleaded guilty to procuring a child for prostitution, making him a registered sex offender, his network was happy to do him favors and reputation management firms took him on as a client. Reputation management services aren’t necessarily a tool to cover up crimes — it’s a standard public relations practice — but in Epstein’s case, the agencies would have known about his abuse, given that that’s what they were being hired to try to minimize.

In October 2010, Seckel laid out an overview of the group’s plan of attack to defend Epstein’s reputation online. The situation, as Seckel described it, was that a search surfaced “over 75+ pages of derogatory material,” and that someone would be “very hard pressed to find any ‘positive’ references.” To “balance the only one-sided negative opinion that has been spread over a wide birth on the Internet,” Seckel said, the team would need to flood the zone with content they can control, specifically pointing to spinning up websites with original content related to Epstein’s connections to science and charities. Seckel would be the unpaid “team leader” along with other unpaid consultants. A person named Michael Keesling would be paid $25,000 to purchase and host web domains, contract a “Phillipine Crew” that would spread flattering links around the web, and other tasks. An unidentified group of “hackers” would be paid $2,500. A “Stephanie Horenstein (Fred Horenstein)” would be paid $2,500 to leave positive comments on Epstein-related news articles. The Verge’s messages sent to a Michael Keesling working in SEO out of West Hollywood went unanswered.

During this time frame, Epstein and his team discussed editing his Wikipedia page to remove mentions of him being a sex offender and pedophile, replacing his mugshot with other pictures, and pushing down news articles they didn’t like. Among the recently released files are several wire transfers to Keesling, totaling $22,500. Elsewhere, Keesling also mentioned receiving “over [$20,000] in cash” from Seckel without a receipt.

By 2013, Epstein was in the market for another “good reverse [SEO] person,” as he wrote in an email, and was recommended someone named Tyler Shears. Within a few weeks, Shears was laying out a 30-day plan — quoting $125 per hour — and starting with tactics like beefing up content around a different Jeffrey Epstein “in order to help remove some of the negative results for our Epstein.” By February 2014, Epstein’s accountant noted that Shears had billed over $50,000 and that Epstein was “unsure of what has changed” since he hired Shears. A person with the same name and company did not respond to The Verge’s request for comment.

Epstein also shopped around for reputation management firms and according to emails was turned down multiple times. In 2010, Seckel forwarded to Epstein an exchange he had with a company called Infuse Creative.

“We have no problem helping someone who is innocent of accusations or a true victim of circumstance, but if there is truth to these allegations and the conviction, I’m afraid we’d have to pass,” Gregory Markel, founder of the firm, wrote to Seckel. “Do you personally know how much of these allegations are true?”

Elsewhere, an associate whose name is redacted in files told Epstein that Reputation.com couldn’t represent him “because of [his] background” but that another firm, Integrity Defenders, would (files also include a paid invoice for $2,449 from Integrity Defenders).

“Please ask him or anyone else not to click on any of the negative links EVER again as that can keep them lingering on the first page,” an account manager at the firm wrote in an email. The website for Integrity Defenders is inactive and The Verge was unable to contact the company.

When it came to attempting to conceal Epstein’s crimes online, many people — paid and unpaid, knowingly or unthinkingly — assisted in the whitewashing. In 2010, after Seckel and his team spun up websites focused on Epstein’s ties to science and his philanthropy in an effort to drown out media coverage, the fixer started emailing acquaintances, asking for a favor. The request was simple: Would they link to Epstein’s sites on their own websites? Seckel asked scientists associated with UCLA, multiple physicists, and others in the scientific community. The idea, at least from an SEO perspective, is that getting valuable links from trustworthy sources like academic institutions would signal to Google that Epstein’s new sites should be surfaced to anyone searching for him. Part of how Google decides which pages to rank highly in search results is by looking at whether other sites link to a page; Epstein’s camp appears to have been trying to push down negative search results by securing valuable links from outside entities.

One of the acquaintances who agreed to add links back to Epstein’s sites is Mark Tramo, an adjunct professor in the department of neurology at UCLA who told SFGate that he had “not heard anything [about] statutory rape or minors being involved, I never saw him with young girls, never visited the island, never flew in his planes.” But in 2010, Tramo was eager to acquiesce to Seckel’s request for links.

“What splendid ideas!” he responded, before going on to describe the “support” (including anonymously) Epstein had provided for his work.

“Links all over the world and at major institutions going up,” Seckel wrote in another thread to Epstein. Even after Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a girl under 18 for prostitution, the industry he snaked his way into was happy to keep up the ruse.

The OM-3 Astro has an upgraded filter letting its sensor capture more infrared light for vivid nebulae photos.

Just over a year after OM System launched its vintage-styled OM-3 Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera, the company has announced a new version with a handful of upgrades catering to astrophotography. The new OM-3 Astro will be available starting in March 2026 for $2,499.99, which is $500 more expensive than the standard model. Both can be used to photograph the night sky, but the Astro introduces hardware improvements to enhance the colors of red nebulae – a popular subject for astrophotographers.

The most notable upgrade to the OM-3 Astro is a new infrared cut filter positioned in front of the camera’s 20.37-megapixel stacked back-illuminated sensor featuring “optical characteristics optimally tuned to achieve approximately 100% transmission of Hα wavelengths.” Nearly every digital camera uses an IR filter to reduce infrared light and improve color accuracy, but the one in the OM-3 Astro specifically lets deep-red Hydrogen-alpha light get through, which is what gives red nebulae their distinct colors and shapes.

One of the OM-3’s best features when it launched last year was a dedicated control dial for quickly accessing simulated film look profiles, and the ability to create your own easily accessible custom profiles. The OM-3 Astro comes with three of those profiles pre-programmed for astrophotography. Color1 is optimized for enhancing images of red nebulae, Color2 is optimized for night sky photography that combines stars and landscapes, and Color3 is designed for handheld star photography, according to PetaPixel.

The Astro variant of the OM-3 also carries forward other features found on the standard model that are useful for capturing stars and celestial objects. Its Starry Sky AF locks onto stars using autofocus. It’s not as fast as standard autofocus, but will save you having to zoom in on the sky and make focus adjustments manually. There’s also a Night Vision mode for the OM-3’s LCD preview screen. It will enhance everything on the display with exaggerated contrast so you can properly frame a shot or make focus adjustments in the middle of the night. The mode will also reduce the intensity of the display to help preserve your night vision so you can operate the camera without needing to reach for a flashlight.

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

We observed! Launched on January 28, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. It’s been designed as a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), could come together and do whatever they wanted.But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot.Four timely new books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

“There is no Plan B, because that assumes you will fail. We’re going to do the start-up thing until we die.”

—William Alexander, an ambitious 21-year old AI worker, explains his and his cohort’s attitudes towards trying to make it big in the highly-competitive industry to the New York Times.

The open-source AI boom is built on Big Tech’s handouts. How long will it last?In May 2023 a leaked memo reported to have been written by Luke Sernau, a senior engineer at Google, said out loud what many in Silicon Valley must have been whispering for weeks: an open-source free-for-all is threatening Big Tech’s grip on AI.

In many ways, that’s a good thing. AI won&#39;t thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">For years, our newsroom has explored AI’s limitations and potential dangers, as well as its growing energy needs. And our reporters have looked closely at how generative tools are being used for tasks such as coding and running scientific experiments.

But how is AI actually being used in fields like health care, climate tech, education, and finance? How are small businesses using it? And what should you keep in mind if you use AI tools at work? These questions guided the creation of Making AI Work, a new AI mini-course newsletter.

Sign up for Making AI Work to see weekly case studies exploring tools and tips for AI implementation. The limited-run newsletter will deliver practical, industry-specific guidance on how generative AI is being used and deployed across sectors and what professionals need to know to apply it in their everyday work. The goal is to help working professionals more clearly see how AI is actually being used today, and what that looks like in practice—including new challenges it presents.

You can sign up at any time and you’ll receive seven editions, delivered once per week, until you complete the series.

Each newsletter begins with a case study, examining a specific use case of AI in a given industry. Then we’ll take a deeper look at the AI tool being used, with more context about how other companies or sectors are employing that same tool or system. Finally, we’ll end with action-oriented tips to help you apply the tool.

Here’s a closer look at what we’ll cover:

            <h2>Moltbook was peak AI theater</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Austrian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include cloud computing that allows agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turns out that the post Karpathy shared was later reported to be fake—placed by a human to advertise an app. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a Swedish AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

And yet, even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook post telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet abusive comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on. “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

Correction: Kovant is based in Sweden, not Germany. The article has been updated.

Update: The article has also been edited to clarify the source of the claims about the Moltbook post that Karpathy shared on X.

An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth

An experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies after they’ve had  treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, and since then at least three others have been born.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/allonic-is-rebuilding-robotics-from-the-inside-out">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Budapest-based robotics company Allonic has raised $7.2 million in a pre-seed round, marking what investors are calling the largest pre-seed funding round in Hungarian startup history.

The raise was led by Visionaries Club with participation from Day One Capital, Prototype, SDAC Ventures, TinyVC, and more than a dozen angels from organisations including OpenAI and Hugging Face.

Allonic’s $7.2m pre-seed matters because it breaks a quiet rule in Europe: that truly hard hardware problems are supposed to wait until later rounds, or later continents. This is early money going into the physical layer of robotics, not the AI wrapper around it, and it’s happening in Budapest, not Silicon Valley or Munich.

This may also send a signal that European investors are starting to back ambition at the source, where things are messy, slow, and expensive to build.

It also shows that Central and Eastern Europe is no longer just a talent pool for outsourced engineering, but a place where original industrial ideas can take shape and attract serious capital.

If this pattern holds, Europe doesn’t just produce smarter robots; it produces the means to actually build them.

Yet, Allonic is building a fundamentally different way to produce robot bodies, addressing a problem that many robotics founders say has been overlooked as AI and autonomy grab headlines.

Today’s robots are typically assembled from scores of individual mechanical parts, bearings, screws, cables, and rigid linkages, a process that is slow, expensive, and hard to scale. Instead, Allonic uses what it calls a 3D Tissue Braiding process, which automatically weaves together fibres, elastics, and embedded wiring over an endoskeleton in a single continuous operation.

Allonic has already completed an initial pilot in electronics manufacturing, and says it is in talks with companies across industrial automation and humanoid robotics. With the fresh capital, the team plans to grow engineering and commercial capabilities and accelerate further pilot deployments.

Investors may see the round as a sign that robotics investment is maturing beyond software and autonomy into the foundational parts of the stack.

In that sense, we can say that Allonic isn’t just a funding story; it’s a small stress test for Europe’s ability to back its own industrial future. If this kind of capital continues to flow into foundational hardware, not just software layers, Europe can move from exporting ideas to shaping the tools that industries run on.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based energy software company Tem has closed a $75 million Series B round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with additional funding from AlbionVC, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Schroders Capital, Voyager Ventures, Allianz, and others.

The round reportedly values the company at more than $300 million and will fund its expansion into the United States and Australia.

Tem builds an AI-native energy platform designed to automate the pricing, matching, and execution of electricity transactions, a market that has long relied on manual processes and legacy infrastructure.

Its core system uses machine learning to forecast supply and demand, match buyers with suppliers, and reduce the layers of intermediaries that typically add cost and complexity.

According to Tem, more than 2,600 businesses in the UK are already on its platform, with customers reporting energy cost savings of up to 30 per cent compared with traditional procurement approaches.

The startup also handled roughly two terawatt-hours of electricity transactions in 2025, a volume it says demonstrates growing demand for automated energy market infrastructure.

Tem’s approach is often described as bringing modern software-first tools to a sector still dominated by brokers, manual trading desks, and outdated systems. By replacing fragmented legacy workflows with a unified AI-driven engine, the company aims to make energy markets more efficient while giving businesses clearer price signals and lower transaction fees.

With the new funding, Tem plans to accelerate its global footprint, beginning with key energy markets such as Texas in the United States and select regions in Australia, where grid modernisation and renewable integration are creating fresh demand for flexible energy trading tools.

            <div id="article-text">Earned media has always been hailed as the holy grail of PR due to its unparalleled ability to build trust. Most recent surveys state that 40%–60% of the population still trusts organic content the most, depending on the country.

However, I see significant business risks in relying on organic PR only, especially now that various AI systems are on the rise. Robots don’t distinguish between earned and paid content when using it to generate answers. And that’s a wake-up call for us all to revise our PR strategies.

The primary advantage of earned media, which is the journalist’s independence, is also its greatest strategic liability. When a business relies strictly on organic coverage, it hands over total control over its narrative to a third party. That’s not always positive.

Imagine you wanted to highlight certain product features in an article, but the journalist highlighted less important ones because they fit their story better. You got an article? Yes. Does it align with your marketing objectives? Not really.

The outcome is often unpredictable, as it is filtered through the subjective lens of a journalist. That lens may be in your favour, and it may not be.

The disappointing part is that you still pay for the negative outcome. Even though earned PR is considered free, it’s not. You pay with the time and effort you invest into reaching out to the right journalists, building relationships, and sending infinite pitches.

If you’re lucky, your story will be published within weeks; if not, it could take months. Not every business can afford such a luxury.

In the current technological landscape, speed has become a competitive necessity. AI systems need to receive consistent, repetitive signals about a brand from the media in order to use them in their answers.

If your product gets mentioned in an organic article once a quarter, you may have already lost the battle. That’s not enough for AI to recommend your product.

In my opinion, these factors make earned-only strategies highly unreliable. PR should become more than that.

Being a proponent of the PESO model, developed by Gini Dietrich, I believe that in a perfect PR strategy, all four pillars – Paid, Earned, Shared, and Owned – should complement each other. However, when it comes to appearing in AI answers, I’d start with the “O”. Your own website provides the foundational data points about your brand and products for AI systems.

At the same time, I disagree with the assumption that websites should be somehow specially optimised for search engines or AI systems by adding robots.txt or even llm.txt files. There hasn’t even been any real evidence that these strategies work.

What I see in practice is different: if your website speaks clearly enough that a human visitor immediately understands what you sell or what services you offer, an AI system will likewise understand it. If the content is well-structured and easy for a person to digest, it is already optimized for robots.

While owned media establishes the narrative, earned media validates that narrative through third-party authority. However, just like in real life, you must first ensure that your own house is in order before seeking external validation.

Once your owned media is established with clear, digestible content, it’s time for paid media to step in. There is often a snobbish attitude within the industry, suggesting that if a placement is paid, it is somehow of low quality. However, this isn’t exactly true.

Obviously, when you pay for a placement, you have full control over its narrative and the context in which it will appear. You can highlight the more important aspects of your product and disregard the less important ones. But you still have to follow the media’s guidelines.

The higher the media’s authority, the stricter its quality standards for sponsored content are, as you have to deliver genuine value to the audience. An industry insight, a fresh opinion, a new approach to a situation, something besides your product that will make content interesting.

As I mentioned before, as AI answers are becoming more popular, the second critical benefit that paid media offers is speed. It allows PR teams to transform their PR strategy from a “wait and see” game into predictable media planning.

This is especially critical in terms of geographical expansion. Cultural differences and the time-intensive nature of building organic relationships can create significant barriers to entry, while paid media acts as a shortcut to AI answers.

Such predictability, combined with the possibility of integrating UTM links into your content in certain media outlets, makes PR a data-driven communication channel. Even without custom links, certain media provide reports on the content performance, which is vital for the overall communication strategy.

Due to all these often overlooked factors, I consider paid media to be a strategic amplifier for the narrative established through owned and earned media. If your goal is to appear in AI-generated answers, speed is the most critical factor.

As AI systems rely on repetitive signals across various trusted sources, you have to spread your word in as many relevant outlets as possible. This ensures that AI systems will index your brand faster than the brands of competitors relying solely on organic outreach.

It doesn’t mean, however, that paid strategies will replace organic efforts. They rather serve as a predictable support system. When executed well, it moves beyond the stigma of “buying coverage” and becomes a calculated investment with a measurable ROI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Union has formally inaugurated NanoIC, a semiconductor pilot line backed by a €700 million investment under the European Chips Act.

The facility aims to accelerate the development of advanced chip technologies and strengthen Europe’s position in the global semiconductor landscape.

Situated at the research hub imec in Leuven, NanoIC is designed as an open pilot line where companies, research institutes, and startups can prototype and test cutting-edge components before commercial deployment.

Unlike traditional closed fabs, the facility offers access to beyond-2-nanometre system-on-chip (SoC) technologies, early-stage process design kits, and advanced toolsets that bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application.

Officials from the European Commission, imec leadership, and industry partners marked the launch at an event in Leuven, highlighting the pilot line as a key milestone in Europe’s semiconductor sovereignty strategy.

The investment forms part of a broader €2.5 billion Chips Act programme supported by national governments and private partners, including ASML, underscoring a shared effort to make the continent more competitive in next-generation electronics.

NanoIC’s capabilities target innovations across critical markets such as artificial intelligence, 6G communications, autonomous systems, and health technologies, where advanced chip performance and efficiency are crucial.

By lowering barriers to access for SMEs and research organisations, the initiative seeks to diversify Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem and catalyse new product development without the massive upfront costs of commercial fabs.

The pilot line is one of the first tangible outcomes of the Chips Act’s “Chips for Europe” initiative, which also includes other pilot lines focusing on packaging, wide bandgap materials, and photonic integrated circuits.

These efforts reflect growing pressure on the EU to reduce reliance on Asian and U.S. supply chains and to foster a more resilient semiconductor industry at home.

Industry observers say that by opening facilities like NanoIC to a broad set of stakeholders, Europe can speed up the transition from research breakthroughs to commercially viable technologies, addressing long-standing gaps in chip production capabilities and cultivating talent across the continent.

            <div id="article-text">Everyone knows Super Bowl commercials are expensive, bombastic, and designed to be talked about. What we didn’texpect was an AI startup using the biggest ad stage of the year to throw shade at a rival’s advertising strategy.

That’s exactly what Anthropic has done. The company bought Super Bowl airtime to broadcast a simple message: “Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude.” Its ads depict a chatbot spitting product pitches mid-conversation, ending with a clear contrast to its own ad-free promise.

Even ads these days aren’t what they used to be.

On paper, it’s witty positioning. In practice, it’s a symbolic escalation of the AI narrative war, from technical features and safety debate to brand virtue signaling.

Here’s the setup: OpenAI, facing towering infrastructure costs and financial pressure, has signalled a shift toward ads in ChatGPT’s free and lower-cost tiers, saying they’ll be clearly labelled and won’t influence the assistant’s output.

Anthropic has seized on this to frame itself as the principled alternative, a chatbot that will remain ad-free. I will save these ads in case we need to for the future.

Ads in any product that’s expensive to operate are a practical monetization strategy, not a nightmare scenario. OpenAI’s plan doesn’t involve bots randomly pitching breakfast cereal mid-answer. That exaggerated depiction belongs in satire, not an accurate product comparison.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman responded by calling Anthropic’s portrayal “clearly dishonest,” noting that the company won’t implement ads in the intrusive way the ads suggest.

That exchange tells you everything you need to know about how this story has been framed.

This clash highlights a broader trend: ethical stances are being used as marketing weapons. Instead of discussing the trade-offs that come with running large AI models, including cost, access, and user choice, the conversation has been reduced to a simple morality play: “Ads are bad; we are good.”

That’s not a serious engagement with the business realities, it’s advertising dressed up as principle.

Whether conversational AI should have ads isn’t a clear ethical line like privacy or data misuse. It’s a product design choice with real implications.

Free users get wider access, maybe subsidized by ads. Paying customers can avoid them. People who care deeply about ad-free experiences pay a premium. Those indifferent to ads choose products that suit them.

What makes this episode interesting, and a bit absurd, is that both Anthropic and OpenAI are unprofitable and competing for narrative territory as much as market share. Spending Super Bowl-level money to argue over why your chatbot won’t show ads feels less like product differentiation and more like a branding battle staged for investors and tech pundits.

This isn’t just about two companies squabbling over who’s less commercial. It’s symptomatic of a broader issue in AI discourse: nuance gets swallowed by cliffnotes. Instead of explaining the real trade-offs to users, cost structures, pricing tiers, and data policies, we get satirical commercials aired to millions, turning complex decisions into sound bites.

That’s a sign of how the AI narrative is evolving: not through clear debate about trade-offs and user impact, but through curated messages designed to elicit applause. If we want a responsible monetization conversation in AI, it needs to happen outside of game-day spots and brand posturing.

Honestly, I miss the days when we were critiquing mistakes in commercials, when advertising was genuinely creative because it came from real insights we all recognized, when the jokes were original. After all, they weren’t pulled from an AI’s memory. That’s just me.

The only real things at the Super Bowl this year are Bad Bunny and Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.
