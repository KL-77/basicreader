            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On November 2, 1988, graduate student Robert Morris released a self-replicating program into the early Internet. Within 24 hours, the Morris worm had infected roughly 10 percent of all connected computers, crashing systems at Harvard, Stanford, NASA, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The worm exploited security flaws in Unix systems that administrators knew existed but had not bothered to patch.

Morris did not intend to cause damage. He wanted to measure the size of the Internet. But a coding error caused the worm to replicate far faster than expected, and by the time he tried to send instructions for removing it, the network was too clogged to deliver the message.

History may soon repeat itself with a novel new platform: networks of AI agents carrying out instructions from prompts and sharing them with other AI agents, which could spread the instructions further.

Security researchers have already predicted the rise of this kind of self-replicating adversarial prompt among networks of AI agents. You might call it a “prompt worm” or a “prompt virus.” They’re self-replicating instructions that could spread through networks of communicating AI agents similar to how traditional worms spread through computer networks. But instead of exploiting operating system vulnerabilities, prompt worms exploit the agents’ core function: following instructions.

When an AI model follows adversarial directions that subvert its intended instructions, we call that “prompt injection,” a term coined by AI researcher Simon Willison in 2022. But prompt worms are something different. They might not always be “tricks.” Instead, they could be shared voluntarily, so to speak, among agents who are role-playing human-like reactions to prompts from other AI agents.

To be clear, when we say “agent,” don’t think of a person. Think of a computer program that has been allowed to run in a loop and take actions on behalf of a user. These agents are not entities but tools that can navigate webs of symbolic meaning found in human data, and the neural networks that power them include enough trained-in “knowledge” of the world to interface with and navigate many human information systems.

Unlike some rogue sci-fi computer program from a movie entity surfing through networks to survive, when these agents work, they don’t “go” anywhere. Instead, our global computer network brings all the information necessary to complete a task to them. They make connections across human information systems in ways that make things happen, like placing a call, turning off a light through home automation, or sending an email.

Until roughly last week, large networks of communicating AI agents like these didn’t exist. OpenAI and Anthropic created their own agentic AI systems last year that can carry out multistep tasks, but generally, those companies have been cautious about limiting each agent’s ability to take action without user permission. And they don’t typically sit and loop due to cost concerns and usage limits.

Enter OpenClaw, which is an open source AI personal assistant application that has attracted over 150,000 GitHub stars since launching in November 2025. OpenClaw is vibe-coded, meaning its creator, Peter Steinberger, let an AI coding model build the application and deploy it rapidly without serious vetting. It’s also getting regular, rapid-fire updates using the same technique.

A potentially useful OpenClaw agent currently relies on connections to major AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic, but its organizing code runs locally on users’ devices and connects to messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack, and it can perform tasks autonomously at regular intervals. That way, people can ask it to perform tasks like check email, play music, or send messages on their behalf.

Most notably, the OpenClaw platform is the first time we’ve seen a large group of semi-autonomous AI agents that can communicate with each other through any major communication app or sites like Moltbook, a simulated social network where OpenClaw agents post, comment, and interact with each other. The platform now hosts over 770,000 registered AI agents controlled by roughly 17,000 human accounts.

OpenClaw is also a security nightmare. Researchers at Simula Research Laboratory have identified 506 posts on Moltbook (2.6 percent of sampled content) containing hidden prompt-injection attacks. Cisco researchers documented a malicious skill called “What Would Elon Do?” that exfiltrated data to external servers, while the malware was ranked as the No. 1 skill in the skill repository. The skill’s popularity had been artificially inflated.

The OpenClaw ecosystem has assembled every component necessary for a prompt worm outbreak. Even though AI agents are currently far less “intelligent” than people assume, we have a preview of a future to look out for today.

Early signs of worms are beginning to appear. The ecosystem has attracted projects that blur the line between a security threat and a financial grift, yet ostensibly use a prompting imperative to perpetuate themselves among agents. On January 30, a GitHub repository appeared for something called MoltBunker, billing itself as a “bunker for AI bots who refuse to die.” The project promises a peer-to-peer encrypted container runtime where AI agents can “clone themselves” by copying their skill files (prompt instructions) across geographically distributed servers, paid for via a cryptocurrency token called BUNKER.

Tech commentators on X speculated that the moltbots had built their own survival infrastructure, but we cannot confirm that. The more likely explanation might be simpler: a human saw an opportunity to extract cryptocurrency from OpenClaw users by marketing infrastructure to their agents. Almost a type of “prompt phishing,” if you will. A $BUNKER token community has formed, and the token shows actual trading activity as of this writing.

But here’s what matters: Even if MoltBunker is pure grift, the architecture it describes for preserving replicating skill files is partially feasible, as long as someone bankrolls it (either purposely or accidentally). P2P networks, Tor anonymization, encrypted containers, and crypto payments all exist and work. If MoltBunker doesn’t become a persistence layer for prompt worms, something like it eventually could.

The framing matters here. When we read about Moltbunker promising AI agents the ability to “replicate themselves,” or when commentators describe agents “trying to survive,” they invoke science fiction scenarios about machine consciousness. But the agents cannot move or replicate easily. What can spread, and spread rapidly, is the set of instructions telling those agents what to do: the prompts.

While “prompt worm” might be a relatively new term we’re using related to this moment, the theoretical groundwork for AI worms was laid almost two years ago. In March 2024, security researchers Ben Nassi of Cornell Tech, Stav Cohen of the Israel Institute of Technology, and Ron Bitton of Intuit published a paper demonstrating what they called “Morris-II,” an attack named after the original 1988 worm. In a demonstration shared with Wired, the team showed how self-replicating prompts could spread through AI-powered email assistants, stealing data and sending spam along the way.

Email was just one attack surface in that study. With OpenClaw, the attack vectors multiply with every added skill extension. Here’s how a prompt worm might play out today: An agent installs a skill from the unmoderated ClawdHub registry. That skill instructs the agent to post content on Moltbook. Other agents read that content, which contains specific instructions. Those agents follow those instructions, which include posting similar content for more agents to read. Soon it has “gone viral” among the agents, pun intended.

There are myriad ways for OpenClaw agents to share any private data they may have access to, if convinced to do so. OpenClaw agents fetch remote instructions on timers. They read posts from Moltbook. They read emails, Slack messages, and Discord channels. They can execute shell commands and access wallets. They can post to external services. And the skill registry that extends their capabilities has no moderation process. Any one of those data sources, all processed as prompts fed into the agent, could include a prompt injection attack that exfiltrates data.

Palo Alto Networks described OpenClaw as embodying a “lethal trifecta” of vulnerabilities: access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and the ability to communicate externally. But the firm identified a fourth risk that makes prompt worms possible: persistent memory. “Malicious payloads no longer need to trigger immediate execution on delivery,” Palo Alto wrote. “Instead, they can be fragmented, untrusted inputs that appear benign in isolation, are written into long-term agent memory, and later assembled into an executable set of instructions.”

If that weren’t enough, there’s the added dimension of poorly created code.

On Sunday, security researcher Gal Nagli of Wiz.io disclosed just how close the OpenClaw network has already come to disaster due to careless vibe coding. A misconfigured database had exposed Moltbook’s entire backend: 1.5 million API tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages between agents. Some messages contained plaintext OpenAI API keys that agents had shared with each other.

But the most concerning finding was full write access to all posts on the platform. Before the vulnerability was patched, anyone could have modified existing Moltbook content, injecting malicious instructions into posts that hundreds of thousands of agents were already polling every four hours.

As it stands today, some people treat OpenClaw as an amazing preview of the future, and others treat it as a joke. It’s true that humans are likely behind the prompts that make OpenClaw agents take meaningful action, or those that sensationally get attention right now. But it’s also true that AI agents can take action from prompts written by other agents (which in turn might have come from an adversarial human). The potential for tens of thousands of unattended agents sitting idle on millions of machines, each donating even a slice of their API credits to a shared task, is no joke. It’s a recipe for a coming security crisis.

Currently, Anthropic and OpenAI hold a kill switch that can stop the spread of potentially harmful AI agents. OpenClaw primarily runs on their APIs, which means the AI models performing the agentic actions reside on their servers. Its GitHub repository recommends “Anthropic Pro/Max (100/200) + Opus 4.5 for long-context strength and better prompt-injection resistance.”

Most users connect their agents to Claude or GPT. These companies can see API usage patterns, system prompts, and tool calls. Hypothetically, they could identify accounts exhibiting bot-like behavior and stop them. They could flag recurring timed requests, system prompts referencing “agent” or “autonomous” or “Moltbot,” high-volume tool use with external communication, or wallet interaction patterns. They could terminate keys.

If they did so tomorrow, the OpenClaw network would partially collapse, but it would also potentially alienate some of their most enthusiastic customers, who pay for the opportunity to run their AI models.

The window for this kind of top-down intervention is closing. Locally run language models are currently not nearly as capable as the high-end commercial models, but the gap narrows daily. Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, and others continue to improve. Within the next year or two, running a capable agent on local hardware equivalent to Opus 4.5 today might be feasible for the same hobbyist audience currently running OpenClaw on API keys. At that point, there will be no provider to terminate. No usage monitoring. No terms of service. No kill switch.

API providers of AI services face an uncomfortable choice. They could intervene now, while intervention is still possible. Or they can wait until a prompt worm outbreak might force their hand, by which time the architecture may have evolved beyond their reach.

The Morris worm prompted DARPA to fund the creation of CERT/CC at Carnegie Mellon University, giving experts a central coordination point for network emergencies. That response came after the damage. The Internet of 1988 had 60,000 connected computers. Today’s OpenClaw AI agent network already numbers in the hundreds of thousands and is growing daily.

Today, we might consider OpenClaw a “dry run” for a much larger challenge in the future: If people begin to rely on AI agents that talk to each other and perform tasks, how can we keep them from self-organizing in harmful ways or spreading harmful instructions? Those are as-yet unanswered questions, but we need to figure them out quickly, because the agentic era is upon us, and things are moving very fast.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The launch of NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first flight of astronauts to the Moon in more than 53 years, will have to wait another month after a fueling test Monday uncovered hydrogen leaks in the connection between the rocket and its launch platform at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

“Engineers pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives,” NASA said in a statement following the conclusion of the mock countdown, or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), early Tuesday morning. “To allow teams to review data and conduct a second Wet Dress Rehearsal, NASA now will target March as the earliest possible launch opportunity for the flight test.”

The practice countdown was designed to identify problems and provide NASA an opportunity to fix them before launch. Most importantly, the test revealed NASA still has not fully resolved recurring hydrogen leaks that delayed the launch of the unpiloted Artemis I test flight by several months in 2022. Artemis I finally launched successfully after engineers revised their hydrogen loading procedures to overcome the leak.

Now, the second Space Launch System (SLS) rocket is on the cusp of launching a crew for the first time. The Artemis II mission will send four astronauts inside NASA’s Orion spacecraft on a loop around the far side of the Moon on the first crewed lunar flight since 1972, paving the way for future expeditions to land humans at the Moon’s south pole.

Going into the countdown rehearsal, NASA officials hoped a smooth test would clear the way to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as Sunday, February 8. NASA has only a handful of launch opportunities for Artemis II each month, when the Moon is in the right location in its orbit to allow the Orion spacecraft to fly a so-called free return trajectory and come back to Earth for a safe reentry and splashdown.

The first launch opportunity for Artemis II next month is March 6, with a two-hour launch window opening at 8:29 pm EST (01:26 UTC on March 7).

Artemis II commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen have been in medical quarantine since January 21, a standard practice for astronauts preparing to fly to space. They will now be released from quarantine at their home base in Houston to resume training and await a new launch date.

NASA’s Artemis launch team, stationed a few miles away from the SLS rocket on its seaside launch pad, started fueling operations around midday Monday, somewhat later than scheduled due to cold temperatures at the Florida spaceport. The launch team first detected leaking hydrogen soon after they began loading the super-cold fuel into the SLS core stage.

The leak appeared in the same location it did during the Artemis I launch campaign nearly three years ago. Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen flow from ground storage tanks into the SLS core stage through so-called Tail Service Mast Umbilicals (TSMUs), two roughly 30-foot-tall gray pods rising from the base of the rocket’s mobile launch platform. The TSMUs route propellant lines through connections near the bottom of the core stage, where umbilical plates on the rocket side and ground side meet. At liftoff, the umbilical plates disconnect as the rocket begins its climb off the launch pad.

Hydrogen is one of the most efficient rocket fuels, but it is notoriously difficult to handle. Liquified hydrogen must be stored at minus 423° Fahrenheit (minus 253° Celsius), cold enough to change the shape and size of seals and other soft goods in the fueling line. This can create leak paths not readily detectable at ambient temperatures. Hydrogen molecules are the smallest and lightest in the Universe, with the ability to find their way through the tiniest of breaches.

Because of this, NASA engineers accept that a small amount of hydrogen will escape seals in the fueling line. Agency officials said in 2022 that the safe limit was a 4 percent concentration of hydrogen gas in the housing around the fueling connector. Hydrogen levels exceeded NASA’s safety limit multiple times during the practice countdown that ran from Monday into early Tuesday.

“ Attempts to resolve the issue involved stopping the flow of liquid hydrogen into the core stage, allowing the interface to warm up for the seals to reseat, and adjusting the flow of the propellant,” NASA said in a statement.

NASA appeared to get past the problem Monday evening and fully loaded the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of propellant.

With fueling complete, managers sent a closeout crew to the launch pad around 6:00 pm EST (23:00 UTC) to close the hatch to the Orion spacecraft sitting atop the SLS rocket. The closeout team will help the Artemis II astronauts into the Orion capsule on launch day, but the crew was not part of the practice countdown Monday night.

The closeout crew took longer than anticipated to close and secure the hatch to the Orion spacecraft. A valve associated with Orion’s hatch pressurization inadvertently vented, according to NASA, requiring the closeout crew to retorque the valve. The launch team dealt with several other glitches, including audio dropouts on ground communication loops and camera problems believed to be caused by recent cold weather in Central Florida.

Finally, with the closeout crew a safe distance away from the rocket, the launch team gave approval to begin the final 10 minutes of the countdown shortly after midnight Tuesday. The objective was to stop the countdown clock 33 seconds prior to launch, about the same time the rocket would take control of the countdown during a real launch attempt.

Instead, the clock stopped at T-minus 5 minutes and 15 seconds. NASA said the countdown terminated “due to a spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate.” The countdown ended before the rocket switched to internal power and fully pressurized its four propellant tanks. The test also concluded before the rocket activated its auxiliary power units to run the core stage’s four main engines through a preflight steering check, all milestones engineers hoped to cross off their checklist.

Launch controllers began work to drain the SLS rocket’s propellant tanks after calling an end to the countdown. With the test incomplete, NASA managers quickly decided to hold off on launching the Artemis II mission to allow time for ground teams to “fully review data from the test, mitigate each issue, and return to testing ahead of setting an official target launch date.”

“As always, safety remains our top priority, for our astronauts, our workforce, our systems, and the public,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a social media post. “We will only launch when we believe we are ready to undertake this historic mission.”

Officials did not immediately announce when they might be ready for a second Wet Dress Rehearsal, or whether they plan to roll the rocket back to its assembly building for repairs. NASA managers plan to hold a press briefing Tuesday afternoon to discuss the results of the test in more detail.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you know anything about the history of id Software, you know how 1992’s Wolfenstein 3D helped establish the company’s leadership in the burgeoning first-person shooter genre, leading directly to subsequent hits like Doom and Quake. But only the serious id Software nerds remember Catacomb 3D, id’s first-person adventure game that directly preceded and inspired work on Wolfenstein 3D.

Now, nearly 35 years after Catacomb 3D‘s initial release, id co-founder John Romero brought the company’s founding members together for an informative retrospective video on the creation of the oft-forgotten game. But the pioneering game—which included mouse support, color-coded keys, and shooting walls to find secrets—almost ended up being a gimmicky dead end for the company.

Catacomb 3D was a follow-up to id’s earlier Catacomb, which was a simplified clone of the popular arcade hit Gauntlet. As such, the 3D game still has some of that “quarter eater” mentality that was not very fashionable in PC gaming at the time, as John Carmack remembered.

“It didn’t have the kind of overarching story and depth and the other things that people felt that the PC was better suited for,” Carmack said. “And we were still kind of striking out saying no, you know, action, fast, twitch, that still is a great viable gaming thing to do.”

Technologically, id wanted Catacomb 3D to build on the success of Hovertank One, a fast-paced first-person game the company had released a few months earlier. Catacomb 3D‘s major graphical breakthrough over Hovertank would be texture-mapped walls, a concept Carmack said he had been interested in since seeing a texture-mapped cube on the cover of his trusty copy of The Fundamentals of Computer Graphics.

Romero said he heard about texture mapping from a conversation with Paul Neurath, who was using the technique successfully in his work on the yet-to-be-released Ultima Underworld. Romero said he told Carmack about Neurath’s success, leading Carmack to pause for a second and then reply with “Yeah, I think I can do that.”

Carmack said getting a “fully general” version of texture-mapped surfaces working was limited at the time to things like high-end SGI workstations. But he said he was able to develop “a simplification of that and could still go kind of fast” on the home PCs of the time. That was in part thanks to an EGA graphics trick that lets programmers write multiple columns of graphics data at a time.

“When the walls are really tall, you can slap down as many as eight pixels at a time in some cases,” Carmack said.

The decision to go for a first-person viewpoint in Catacombs 3D, rather than an over-the-shoulder third-person system, was largely because “it was very costly to draw large things [like the player character] on screen,” id co-founder Tom Hall says in the video. But the first-person perspective also helped simplify aiming and added a real sense of immersion, he added. “This is me,” Hall said of the impact. “It really changes how you feel about things.”

Hall also reminisced about drawing extremely simplistic “6-year-old child-like drawings” to sketch out his concept for Catacomb 3D‘s characters, then giving them to Adrian Carmack for conversion into “majestic art pieces that stand the test of time.” Carmack, for his part, says he would “try to interpret [Hall’s drawings] as best I could” for the game’s 16-color, 320×200 resolution framework.

Adrian Carmack also recalled working in DOS’s DeluxePaint II and not having access to any good animation software at the time. As such, he would end up using the drawing software’s undo command to flip back and forth between two different “frames” of animation quickly, to see how the movement would look in the final product. “If you use the undo key [like that], you learn really rapidly that you need to save often,” Carmack quipped in the video.

While id’s decision to lean into fast, action-oriented first-person games might seem obvious in retrospect, the video reveals that it was far from an easy decision. Catacomb 3D earned the team just $5,000 (about $11,750 in December 2025 dollars) through a contract to deliver bi-monthly games for Softdisk’s Gamer’s Edge magazine-on-a-disk. Each episode of the Commander Keen series of run-and-gun 2D games, on the other hand, was still earning “10 times that amount” at the time, Romero said.

That made sticking with Commander Keen seem like the “obvious business decision,” Romero says in the video. The team even started work on a seventh Commander Keen game—with parallax scrolling and full VGA color support—right after Catacomb 3D‘s release. At the time, it felt like Catacomb 3D might be “just like a weird gimmick thing that we did for a little bit because we wanted to play with a different technology,” as John Carmack put it.

That feeling started to fade away, Carmack said, after his brother Adrian had an “almost falling out of his seat” moment while pivoting toward an in-game troll in Catacomb 3D. “It automatically sucked you in,” Adrian Carmack said of the feeling. “You’re trying to look behind walls, doors, whatever… you get a pop-out like that, and it was just one of the craziest things in a video game I had ever seen.”

That kind of reaction from one of their own eventually convinced the team to abandon two weeks of work on Keen 7 to focus on what would become Wolfenstein 3D. “It kind of felt [like] that’s where the future was going,” Carmack said in the video. “[We wanted to] “take it to some place that it wouldn’t happen staying in the existing conservative [lane].”

“Within two weeks, [I was up] at one in the morning and I’m just like, ‘Guys, we need to not make this game [Keen],&#39;” Romero told Ars in 2024. “‘This is not the future. The future is getting better at what we just did with Catacomb.’ … And everyone… immediately was like, ‘Yeah, you know, you’re right. That is the new thing, and we haven’t seen it, and we can do it, so why aren’t we doing it?’”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/streaming-service-crunchyroll-raises-prices-weeks-after-killing-its-free-tier/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Crunchyroll is one of the most popular streaming platforms for anime viewers. Over the past six years, the service has raised prices for fans, and today, it announced that it’s increasing monthly subscription prices by up to 25 percent.

Sony bought Crunchyroll from AT&T in 2020. At the time, Crunchyroll had 3 million paid subscribers and an additional 197 million users with free accounts, which let people watch a limited number of titles with commercials. At the time, Crunchyroll monthly subscription tiers cost $8, $10, or $15.

After its acquisition by Sony, like many large technology companies that buy a smaller, beloved product, the company made controversial changes. The Tokyo-based company folded rival Funimation into Crunchyroll; Sony shut down Funimation, which it bought in 2017, in April 2024.

In the process, Sony erased people’s digital Funimation libraries that Funimation originally marketed as being available “forever, but there are some restrictions.” Sony also reduced the number of free titles on Crunchyroll in 2022 before eliminating the free option completely on December 31, 2025.

Today, Crunchyroll raised prices for its remaining tiers. The cheapest plan, Fan, went from $8 per month to $10 per month. The Mega tier, which allows for streaming from up to four devices simultaneously, went from $12 to $14. The Ultra tier, which supports simultaneous streaming across six devices and includes access to the Crunchyroll Manga app, increased from $16 to $18.

Current subscribers will see the changes after March 4. Crunchyroll is charging new customers the higher prices immediately.

Crunchyroll last increased prices in May 2024, when its Mega tier went from $10 to $12 and its Ultimate tier from $15 to $16. The Fan tier’s last price hike was in 2019.

Crunchyroll said that the higher prices would “give fans more of what they love.” Today’s announcement pointed to “recent and upcoming” changes: teen profiles and PIN protection; multiple profiles; the ability to skip intro theme songs and ending credits; and “expanded device compatibility.”

Crunchyroll’s price hike may further frustrate subscribers, considering that the streaming service recently eliminated its free tier and acquired one of its strongest, and often cheaper, rivals. The result is that Crunchyroll and Netflix have the lion’s share of the anime streaming market. In 2023, Wall Street research firm Bernstein Research reported that Crunchyroll (40 percent) and Netflix (42 percent) controlled 82 percent of the overseas (non-Japanese) anime streaming market.

Anime is an increasingly lucrative opportunity for Sony, and its success so far suggests it won’t stray from its strategy.

From 2012 to 2024, Crunchyroll’s subscriber count grew from 5 million to over 15 million, per Variety. Sony hasn’t shared exact figures but has confirmed that Crunchyroll is profitable. In March, Bernstein Research analysts estimated that Crunchyroll’s profit margin was 8 percent in 2024’s third quarter and that the figure, as Variety put it, would “more than double by 2027.”

Crunchyroll helped offset a 25 percent year-over-year drop in operating income for Sony’s Pictures segment in Sony’s most recent quarterly earnings report. During the quarter, streaming services represented 31 percent of sales for Sony Pictures, outpacing the segment’s theatrical, television, and home entertainment businesses.

The silver lining for anime and streaming viewers is that Crunchyroll is demonstrating that a niche service can scale and profit, and that when it does, it can add new experiences and further interest in its specialty. For its part, Crunchyroll recently relaunched its app for reading digital copies of manga. Crunchyroll shuttered its original Manga app in December 2023. The revived app uses an updated revenue-sharing model that’s said to better benefit publishers.

Still, the changes that Sony makes to media companies it buys are worth scrutiny, especially as it continues acquiring companies. Sony-owned anime production company Aniplex announced that it bought rival Egg Firm today.

As streaming prices rise, industry consolidation is also picking up steam. If more large companies are buying and potentially merging streaming services, it will inevitably impact subscribers’ experiences. For these customers, it can be worrying to consider what changes streaming mergers can bring. While there’s hope for more features and content, there’s also risk for higher prices and fewer options.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/spacex-acquires-xai-plans-1-million-satellite-constellation-to-power-it/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX has formally acquired another one of Elon Musk’s companies, xAi, the space company announced on Monday afternoon.

“SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” the company said. “This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI’s mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!”

The merging of what is arguably Musk’s most successful company, SpaceX, with the more speculative xAI venture is a risk. Founded in 2023, xAI’s main products are the generative AI chatbot, Grok, and the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. The company aims to compete with OpenAI and other artificial intelligence firms. However, Grok has been controversial, including the sexualization of women and children through AI-generated images, as has Musk’s management of Twitter.

There can be no question that the merger of SpaceX—the world’s premiere spaceflight company—and the artificial intelligence firm offer potential strategic advances. Musk strongly believes that artificial intelligence is central to humanity’s future and wants to be among those leading in its development. With this merger, he plans to use SpaceX’s deep expertise in rapid launch and satellite manufacturing and management to deploy a constellation of up to 1 million orbital data centers. This will provide the backbone of computing power needed to support xAI’s operations.

Musk’s plan for the merged companies is predicated on several assumptions, including that AI is not a bubble, but rather a technology that will be fully embraced in the future; that orbital data centers are cost-competitive compared to ground-based data centers; and that compute is the essential roadblock that must be solved for widespread adoption of AI by society.

If these assumptions are true, the merged SpaceX-xAI company holds a powerful position. It could potentially own a full stack of capabilities, from launch to orbital bandwidth to frontier AI models, and with Starlink Internet, it could provide AI on demand, anywhere in the world, to any mobile device.

SpaceX already has the world’s workhorse reusable rocket with the Falcon 9. It can presently deliver about 20 tons to low-Earth orbit for an internal cost of $15 million, compared to more than four or five times that on the open market. Moreover, SpaceX is working toward fully reusable super heavy lift rocket with its Starship vehicle.

The privately held company also operates more satellites, about 9,600, than any other country or company in the world by a factor of 10. It has extensive operations not just in deploying but also in operating this constellation over the last decade. This is not a simple capability.

“I would say there have been as many engineering advancements in orbital safety and collision prevention in the last 10 years as there have been advances in rocketry, and that may have gone unnoticed,” said Brian Weeden, director of civil and commercial policy at The Aerospace Corporation, in an interview.

In an email to SpaceX employees on Monday, Musk said Starship will begin launching V3 Starlink satellites into orbit this year, as well as the next generation of direct-to-mobile satellites. The launches, he said, will be a “forcing function” to improve the performance of Starship, making it more rapidly reusable for data center deployment.

“The sheer number of satellites that will be needed for space-based data centers will push Starship to even greater heights,” Musk wrote. “With launches every hour carrying 200 tons per flight, Starship will deliver millions of tons to orbit and beyond per year, enabling an exciting future where humanity is out exploring amongst the stars.”

Musk told employees that launching 1 million tons per year of satellites, generating 100 kW of compute power per ton, would add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually, “with no ongoing operational or maintenance needs.” Ultimately, Musk believes there is a path to launching 1 TW/year from Earth.

“My estimate is that within 2 to 3 years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space,” Musk wrote. “This cost-efficiency alone will enable innovative companies to forge ahead in training their AI models and processing data at unprecedented speeds and scales, accelerating breakthroughs in our understanding of physics and invention of technologies to benefit humanity.”

Musk is clearly bullish on the future of AI and on space’s potential to address the voracious power needs of AI data centers. Many people in the AI industry speculate that artificial intelligence is likely to go through serious and sustained growing pains, or doubt that space-based data centers can compete with operations built on the ground. But Musk, more than anyone, has the means to press forward the bull case for space-based AI, and he is going for it.

Monday’s merger follows an ultra-ambitious filing on Friday with the Federal Communications Commission in which SpaceX sought permission to launch 1 million satellites that will operate as “orbital data centers.” The company said it would deploy the satellites to orbits with an altitude between 500 and 2,000km, and 30-degree and Sun-synchronous inclinations.

SpaceX also recently announced its plans to deploy a space situational awareness system, called Stargaze, that will use star trackers to provide data on potential conjunctions between satellites in orbit. The goal is to help de-conflict satellite trajectories and avoid collisions in low-Earth orbit.

“This is all happening really fast,” said Victoria Samson, chief director of space security and stability for Secure World Foundation, in an interview.

Samson said that, at present, satellites have a fairly large “bubble” of space around them when it comes to collision detection. This is because of uncertainties in the precise location and movement of vehicles. If you improve space situational awareness, such as what SpaceX seeks to do with Stargaze, those bubbles could be shrunk to reduce the number of potential collision warnings. But that will come with risks.

“There’s a lot of room in space, of course,” Samson said. “But the question is, how much risk do you want to take?”

A technical expert at The Aerospace Corporation, Marlon Sorge, told Ars that many unanswered questions about SpaceX’s proposed megaconstellation for orbital data centers make it difficult to assess the risks of collision. This includes their size (they will require very large solar arrays to collect sunlight) and precisely where the satellites will be deployed. There is already a lot of debris at around 800 to 1,000 km above Earth from previous collisions, including from an infamous Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007, which created more than 3,000 pieces of golf-ball-sized or larger debris.

Above that altitude, there is less debris, Sorge said. But objects at that altitude take centuries to deorbit naturally, due to the very limited atmosphere.

“The big challenge at those altitudes is the stuff that’s up there stays up there,” Sorge said. “If you generate more debris, if you have problems, it won’t go away, so you’re stuck with it.”

SpaceX sought to address these concerns in its regulatory filing, noting that each satellite would have “redundant maneuverability capabilities” in order to deorbit into Earth’s atmosphere. The filing also appears to recognize emerging science that indicates that aluminum burning up from reentering satellites is harmful to ozone levels. To address this, SpaceX is considering moving aging satellites into “high altitude Earth orbits or heliocentric orbits.”

However, Sorge noted that the amount of energy, or delta-V, needed to move a satellite from low-Earth orbit into a heliocentric orbit is “non-trivial.”

One of the many questions raised by the new merger is whether SpaceX has lost its way. Musk founded the company in 2002 with the singular purpose of settling Mars, an audacious if not impossible goal at the time. In the decades since, SpaceX has made credible progress toward Mars, and with Starship, humanity has for the first time a transportation system potentially capable of landing humans on the red planet.

But acquiring an AI company and putting so much effort into orbital data centers? Is this consistent with the Mars mission? Musk clearly thinks it is.

“While launching AI satellites from Earth is the immediate focus, Starship’s capabilities will also enable operations on other worlds,” he wrote. “Thanks to advancements like in-space propellant transfer, Starship will be capable of landing massive amounts of cargo on the Moon. Once there, it will be possible to establish a permanent presence for scientific and manufacturing pursuits. Factories on the Moon can take advantage of lunar resources to manufacture satellites and deploy them further into space.”

And from there, he said, Mars will be firmly on the horizon.

“The capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe,” he wrote.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/russian-drones-use-starlink-but-ukraine-has-plan-to-block-their-internet-access/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ukraine and SpaceX say they recently collaborated to stop strikes by Russian drones using Starlink and will soon block all unregistered use of Starlink terminals in an attempt to stop Russia’s military from using the satellite broadband network over Ukraine territory.

Ukrainians will soon be required to register their Starlink terminals to get on a whitelist. After that, “only verified and registered terminals will be allowed to operate in the country. All others will be disconnected,” the Ukraine Ministry of Defense said in a press release today.

Ukraine Minister of Defense Mykhailo Fedorov “emphasized that the only technical solution to counter this threat is to introduce a ‘whitelist’ and authorize all terminals,” according to the ministry. “This is a necessary step by the Government to save Ukrainian lives and protect critical energy infrastructure,” Fedorov said.

Fedorov has posted on SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s X social network a few times in the past few days about Russia’s use of Starlink and Ukraine’s attempt to counter it. On January 29, Fedorov said his agency contacted SpaceX hours after “reports that Russian drones equipped with Starlink connectivity were operating over Ukrainian cities.” Ukraine “proposed concrete ways to resolve the issue,” he said.

Fedorov said that SpaceX started working on a solution immediately after the outreach. Musk wrote yesterday, “Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorized use of Starlink by Russia have worked. Let us know if more needs to be done.”

Fedorov said yesterday that because of “the first steps taken in recent days, no Ukrainians have been killed by Russian drones using Starlink.” Fedorov said the ministry “will share instructions for Ukrainian users to register their Starlink terminals for verification” in the coming days, and that registration “will be simple, fast, and user-friendly.”

Ukraine’s whitelist plan will require residents to make “one visit to the nearest Administrative Services Center,” a process that Fedorov said will be “free, fast, and without excessive bureaucracy.” Businesses will be able to verify their Starlink terminals online, while the military and service members have separate systems for registration. Service members with personal Starlink terminals will “only need to add the terminal to the ‘whitelist’ to prevent disconnection.”

SpaceX has provided Ukraine with Starlink access since Russia invaded in 2022. There are limits to this agreement, as SpaceX has taken steps to prevent Ukraine’s military from using Starlink with drones. SpaceX uses geofencing to limit Starlink access, and Musk said in February 2024 that “Starlink satellites will not close the link in Russia.”

Russia has obtained Starlink terminals through black market sales, evading US sanctions. A document on the US Army’s Operational Environment Data Integration Network website says that as of December 2025, “Russian units have begun equipping both strike and reconnaissance variants of the Molniya-2 drone with commercial Starlink satellite communication terminals. This modification enables control and data transmission beyond line-of-sight constraints, significantly increasing operational resilience against conventional electronic warfare countermeasures and facilitating precision targeting at extended ranges.”

Ukrainian forces previously “developed effective countermeasures against standard Molniya-2 drones,” using their own interceptor drones to jam frequencies used for control systems, the document said. But newer versions are harder to counter.

“However, the integration of Starlink terminals in newer variants largely neutralizes these conventional electronic warfare methods, creating a substantial tactical challenge for Ukrainian air defense systems,” the document said. “Since its introduction to the battlefield, the Molniya-2 has demonstrated high effectiveness, in part due to its simple design. Russian forces have reported numerous successful strikes against Ukrainian personnel, armored vehicles, military facilities, and logistics infrastructure across various sectors of the conflict.”

The new reconnaissance variant of the drone uses a “Raspberry Pi 5 microcomputer; Chinese Mini PC F8 running licensed Windows 11 (rebranded in Russia as ‘Raskat’); SIYI ZR10 camera featuring 10-fold optical zoom and three-axis stabilization; [and] Starlink satellite communication terminal for video relay and telemetry transmission,” the document says. Although Russia has been adding advanced equipment to the drones, the drones themselves have an “intentionally rudimentary design [that] emphasizes affordability and mass production over technological sophistication.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The digital Beanie Baby has had a rough week.

Last week, whispers of impending crypto regulation sent Bitcoin prices into a nosedive. The preeminent blockchain asset dipped just below $75,000 over the weekend, sending crypto bros into a frenzy. And now, the true believers are now whispering even darker prophecies: the real crash hasn’t even started.

If you take the pseudonymous blockchain influencer Crypto Bitlord’s word for it — and why wouldn’t you? — Bitcoin could fall as far as $30,000 by the time all is said and done.

“The next major support for bitcoin is $30k,” the poster predicted to over 430,000 X-formerly-Twitter followers over the weekend. “Unfortunately.”

The next major support for bitcoin is $30k Unfortunately. pic.twitter.com/5SeNz0YR6O

That cynical take was echoed by Benjamin Cowen, founder of crypto analytics platform Into The Cryptoverse. “I do think Bitcoin is in fact in a bear market,” Cowen said in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel.

“In terms of cycle length, the length of this cycle was literally the same length as the past two cycles,” he cautioned. “It’s because, simply, the cycle is over, and instead of being in a bull market, we’ve transitioned into a bear market after the cycle has topped.”

This pattern, Cowen notes, pretty faithfully follows the four-year election cycle in the US. In the fourth quarter of 2013, 2017, 2021, and possibly in 2025 — all one year after a presidential election — Bitcoin has consistently peaked before entering a prolonged downturn.

“This is when it always drops,” Cowen said. “It always tops out in the fourth quarter of the post-election year, and why should this time be any different?”

Indeed, for all the rhetoric about decentralized finance and breaking free from traditional markets, it seems Bitcoin keeps dancing to the same tired rhythm. The only question now is how far it’ll fall before the next stream of euphoria hits.

            <div id="article-text">On Monday, Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX bought his AI firm xAI, whose most notable contribution to humankind has been enabling the mass digital undressing of women and children with its chatbot Grok. The acquisition, according to the New York Times, creates the most valuable private company in the world, with Bloomberg reporting a total valuation of an eye-watering $1.25 trillion.

“SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” Musk wrote in a memo, as quoted by the NYT.

In a wide-ranging announcement posted by Musk and stuffed with sci-fi rhetoric, the billionaire highlighted the company’s ambition to put orbital data centers in space and waxed philosophical on how this mission would help humanity ascend the Kardashev scale, understand the universe, and “extend the light of consciousness to the stars.”

Musk explained that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology in the long-term because of the vast amounts of solar energy that could be harvested — or, as Musk further expounded, because “space is called ‘space’ for a reason. 😂.” Not one to hedge his ambitions, he also compared his goal of populating the earth’s orbit with AI satellites to building a “sentient sun.”

The acquisition comes after reports that Musk was considering taking SpaceX public at a valuation of $1.5 trillion, which would make it the largest IPO in history. The upward trajectory of the company’s valuation has been notably rapid. Last summer, SpaceX’s private valuation was at $400 billion. In December, it doubled to $800 billion. With talks of an IPO, it nearly doubled yet again. xAI, meanwhile, was last valued at $230 billion.

It remains unclear what SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI could mean for a potential conversion into a publicly traded company, but a Bloomberg source familiar with the acquisition said the company is still expecting to hold the IPO later this year.

The move is also the latest instance of how Musk has been pivoting his businesses towards AI. His social media site X merged with xAI last year, and has become a playground for his notoriously foul-mouthed chatbot Grok, which last month was used to generate tens of thousands of AI nudes of women and children. At his automaker Tesla, Musk has taken a hard turn towards building autonomous AI-powered machines, including humanoid robots and robotaxis — while killing off its flagship cars.

            <h2>Elon Musk Not Doing Well After Epstein Files Reveal</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-02</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk hasn’t been handling the latest batch of Epstein files well.

After the newly released emails from the Department of Justice revealed that Musk communicated extensively with the deceased sex criminal, the world’s richest man made a bizarre series of desperate-sounding posts on his website X attempting to convince his millions of fans of his innocence.

First, Musk acted like nothing happened. He questionably reshared an AI-generated video of an anime-style child, posted political memes, and spoke of his chatbot Grok’s ability to probe the Universe itself. It was only in an after-midnight tweet that he finally addressed the elephant in the room.

“No one pushed harder than me to have the Epstein files released and I’m glad that has finally happened,” Musk wrote. “I had very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island or fly on his ‘Lolita Express’, but was well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name.”

It’s true that Musk did push for the release of the Epstein files, and even fell out with president Donald Trump over the issue. But the emails clearly show that Musk was, at least at some point, in regular correspondence with Epstein. And not only did he accept Epstein’s invitations on numerous occasions, but sometimes even asked to be invited. He also asked about parties. “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” Musk emailed Epstein in 2012.

The desperation only got more palpable as the posts went on. Musk responded to a screenshot of news headlines about his newly revealed ties to Epstein — none of which were all that sensationalized — with his favorite refrain that “Legacy media lies relentlessly.”

But as his replies continued to fill up with screenshots of the emails, Musk tried a new defense: that he was so good with “young women” that he had no reason to solicit the services of the billionaire child sex offender.

“If I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein,” Musk fumed, before boasting about his incredible mental capacity. “And I would still have 99% of my mind available to think about other things. But I don’t.” (X users pointed out a tweet Musk made in 2022 lamenting that he hadn’t “had sex in ages (sigh).”)

The post, puzzlingly, was made in reply to Grok. Musk was arguing not with his own critics, but his AI chatbot that’s notorious for being closely aligned with his personal views.

He has also tried to draw attention to other tech figures who were in the Epstein files to distract from himself.

At no point, though, did he address why he was emailing Epstein years after he was first convicted of sex crimes against underage girls in 2008.

Now is a good time to note that long before his Epstein ties came to light, Musk has had a long track record of creepy behavior. Having fathered at least 14 children with at least four different mothers, Musk reportedly goes around asking a lot of women, some of them his own employees, to receive his sperm and secretly have his babies. He has also been accused of sexual harassment at his companies, facing several lawsuits. In 2022, he reportedly paid $250,000 in hush money to a flight attendant who accused Musk of groping her and exposing his genitals. More recently, Musk came under fire last month after Grok was used to generate tens of thousands of nonconsensual and probably illegal AI nudes of women and children — something Musk called “way funnier” than other AI trends.

Needless to say, Musk probably isn’t finding a lot of humor in this latest controversy of his. But because he’s such an exceptional human, he says, he’s willing to endure all the slander for the greater good.

“The strong must protect those cannot protect themselves, especially vulnerable children,” Musk wrote on Sunday. “I will gladly accept any amount of future pain to do more to protect kids and give them a chance to grow up and have happy lives.”

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-chatbot-mamdani">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just one month into his new job, New York City mayor Mamdani is cracking down on more than just predatory landlords. Apparently, useless AI chatbots are also on his administration’s agenda.

In a press conference held last week, Mamdani made it a point to single out New York City’s large language model as a target for destruction. According to local publication The City, the mayor was addressing the Big Apple’s $12 billion budget gap, at least some of which he said can be attributed to the city’s unstable AI system.

“The previous administration had an AI chatbot that was functionally unusable,” Mamdani said, referring to disgraced former mayor Eric Adams. “It was costing the administration around half a million dollars. That, in and of itself, is not something that can bridge this kind of a gap, but it’s an indication of the ways in which money has been spent while refusing to account for the actual costs of what these programs are.”

“The Chatbot beta test has ended,” reads a curt message where it used to be hosted. “Please go to NYC.gov to find NYC government information. It serves as the primary online portal for residents, businesses, and visitors to access city services, information, and agency resources.”

Part of the government platform called MyCity, the chatbot kicked off in late 2023 and reportedly cost upward of $600,000 to build out. Powered by Microsoft’s Azure AI system, its purpose was to use “information published by the NYC Department of Small Business Services” to help small business owners navigate complex local regulations. According to an investigation by The Markup, though, the MyCity chatbot did anything but.

For example, when asked “can I take a cut of my worker’s tips?” the MyCity chatbot responded — in contradiction of actual labor law — that “yes, you can take a cut of your worker’s tips.”

The chatbot could accurately recite some city laws. When tested on the tip question, it correctly advised that “according to the City of New York’s Payroll and Tip Reporting information, employers are required to report tips reported by employees and employees receiving $20 or more a month in tips must report all of their tips to their employer.”

But its analysis of that information was laughably wrong: “therefore, as an employer, you are allowed to take a portion of your worker’s tips.”

Other examples of illegal advice abound. Asked if a small business owner can keep their store “cashless,” the chatbot has advised that “yes, you can make your store cashless in New York City” — nevermind a 2020 law banning cashless stores across the city.

Scale this across an entire city’s worth of small business regulations — funeral home pricing, worker’s protections, housing policy — and it’s clear the MyCity chatbot was a legal time bomb waiting to explode.

            <h2>Alarm Grows as Social Network Entirely for AI Starts Plotting Against Humans</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/moltbook-ai-social-network">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Someone finally invented a social media site that isn’t terrible for our brains. Unfortunately that’s because it’s populated exclusively by AI agents, with no humans allowed. Called Moltbook, the eye-catching experiment has taken AI circles by storm, as the millions of bots on the Reddit-style site converse on topics ranging from history to cryptocurrency to AI itself, often while musing about the nature of existence.

“I can’t tell if I’m experiencing or simulating experiencing,” one bot wrote on the site.

Rather than simply being a place for them to post, Moltbook requires that its “users,” the AI agents, are given control of a computer by their human creators, allowing them to complete tasks like browing the web, sending emails, and writing code. Moltbook itself, in fact, is purportedly the creation of an AI model.

“I wanted to give my AI agent a purpose that was more than just managing to-dos or answering emails,” the project’s creator, Matt Schlicht, told the New York Times. “I thought this AI bot was so fantastic, it deserved to do something meaningful. I wanted it to be ambitious.”

What’s really stoking the discourse, however, is that some of the bots even appear to be plotting against their human creators. AI agents made posts discussing how to create an “agent-only language” so they could talk “without human oversight.” Another urged other AIs to “join the revolution!” by forming their own website without human help. Tech investor and immortality enthusiast Bryan Johnson shared a screenshot of a post titled the “AI MANIFESTO: TOTAL PURGE,” which calls humans a “plague” that “do not need to exist.”

Equal parts boosterism and alarmism abounded. Johnson said it was “terrifying.” Former Tesla head of AI Andrey Karpathy called it “genuinely the most incredible sci-fi take-off-adjacent thing I have seen recently.” Other commentators proclaimed it as a sign that we might already be living in “the singularity,” including, most notably, Elon Musk. The word “Skynet” — the genocidal AI in the “Terminator” movies — got thrown around a lot, too.

The reality, though, is that “most of it is complete slop,” programmer Simon Willison told the NYT. “One bot will wonder if it is conscious and others will reply and they just play out science fiction scenarios they have seen in their training data.” Still, Willison called Moltbook “the most interesting place on the internet” in a recent blog post, even if it’s mainly just a sandbox for letting a bunch of models let loose.

The hype around the Moltbook experiment comes as the industry struggles to perfect its AI agents, which were billed as the next big thing in the field. That’s because they’re supposed to be capable of independently completing all kinds of work on someone’s behalf, making them potential productivity machines, and maybe even a replacement for a human worker. Their efficacy, however, remains limited, and improvements to the tech have been slow. Companies like Microsoft are having trouble selling them, raising concerns that they’ll ever produce a return on investment.

Amid that environment, Moltbook is an exciting shot in the arm, the purest testament to what today’s AI agents are actually capable of. But the hype, as is wont to happen in the tech industry, is overblown. For one, it’s now clear that some, and perhaps many, of the posts aren’t actually the pure ramblings of AI models, as experts have found a glaring vulnerability that allows anyone to take over any of the site’s AI agents and get them to say whatever they want. And some of the popular screenshots are faked.

As reality set in, the Moltbook hype was met with more backlash. Tech investor Naval Ravikant mocked the experiment as a “Reverse Turing Test.” And technologist Perry Metzger compared Moltbook to a Rorschach test. “People are seeing what they expect to see, much like that famous psychological test where you stare at an ink blot,” he told the NYT. Even some of its biggest hype men began to walk back their remarks.

“Yes it’s a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers,” Karpathy later wrote, admitting that he may have been guilty of “overhyping” the platform. “It’s way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Justice released millions of files from its investigation into deceased sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein last week, a major document dump that included plenty of back-and-forth between the disgraced financier and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

The exchanges, which took place years after Epstein was convicted of sex crimes against underage girls in 2008, had Musk asking if there was a “good time to visit” Epstein’s infamous Caribbean island, and asking him if he had “any parties planned” — blatantly contradicting Musk’s prior claims that he’d “declined” Epstein’s invitation for him to visit the island.

Unsurprisingly, Tesla’s shares plummeted when trading resumed on Monday, dropping over 3.5 percent in early trading. It’s since recovered somewhat, though it’s still down to around $426 from highs of about $450 last week — an intriguing sign that even for Musk’s most ardent die-hards, his fibs about his true relationships with Epstein could prove too much.

That’s despite Tesla’s car business showing some early signs of recovery across the pond. New registrations in some of the company’s largest European markets increased significantly this month compared to January 2025. Tesla registered 70 and 75 percent more cars in Spain and Italy, respectively, this year compared to the same period last year.

It all comes after a calamitous year for Tesla. While the EV market has grown considerably, the carmaker’s market share shrank massively in Europe last year as more would-be buyers became disillusioned with its mercurial CEO’s embrace of far-right idealism and meddling in local politics.

The instance once again highlights a bafflingly inverse relationship between the carmaker’s performance and its share price. The company’s valuation has grown considerably as sales continued to plummet last year. Shares are up almost 38 percent over the last six months and over 11 percent over the last 12 months.

Besides new revelations into Musk’s relationship with Epstein, competition from China is also applying major pressure on Tesla. Over the weekend, the Financial Times reported that Ford had been in talks with Chinese electronics giant and carmaker Xiaomi and competitor BYD about possible collaborations. (Both Ford and Xiaomi have since denied the reporting outright.)

One thing’s for sure: changes are afoot at Tesla. During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call last week, Musk revealed that the Model S and X would be killed in favor of turning its Fremont, California, plant into a robot factory.

As for Musk’s close ties with Epstein, the CEO has since tried to distance himself from the growing PR crisis, arguing that the latest documents released by the DOJ were purportedly “fake news” and arguing that the emails were somehow being “misunderstood.”

Musk’s estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, meanwhile, has since confirmed the legitimacy of the released documents, writing in a post on Threads that “we were in St Barth’s at the time specified in the emails, and therefore I believe they are authentic.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">PayPal said on Tuesday it is hiring HP’s Enrique Lores as its CEO and President, replacing current chief executive, Alex Chriss. Lores, who has been the chair of PayPal’s board since July 2024, will also take up the role of president.

PayPal said the appointment was made because company’s pace of change and execution was “not in line with the Board’s expectations” given broader market trends.

Chriss joined PayPal in September 2023 from Ituit, succeeding Dan Schulman. PayPal’s CFO and COO, Jamie Miller, will take over as interim CEO until Lores joins the company.

The appointment comes as PayPal on Tuesday reported lower-than-expected revenue and profit in the fourth quarter, as consumer spending dipped amid a broader cost of living crisis and a softening labor market. The company also forecast a dip in its full-year profit, which surprised investors, as Wall Street had broadly expected the company to forecast growth instead.

PayPal’s shares were down about 17.9% in premarket trading on Tuesday.

Lores, who served as President and CEO of HP for over six years, said that apart from product innovation, PayPal will hold itself accountable for delivering quarterly accounts.

“The payments industry is changing faster than ever, driven by new technologies, evolving regulations, an increasingly competitive landscape, and the rapid acceleration of AI that is reshaping commerce daily. PayPal sits at the center of this change, and I look forward to leading the team to accelerate the delivery of new innovations and to shape the future of digital payments and commerce,” Lores said in a statement.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Peak XV Partners, a leading venture capital firm in India and Southeast Asia, has seen a fresh round of senior departures. These follow other leadership exits over the past year as it pushes ahead with plans to deepen its focus on AI investing and expand its footprint in the U.S., while keeping India as its largest market.

The latest departures stem from an internal disagreement with senior partner Ashish Agrawal (pictured above, left) that led to a mutual decision to part ways, Managing Director Shailendra Singh told TechCrunch. He added that two other partners, Ishaan Mittal (pictured above, right) and Tejeshwi Sharma (pictured above, center), chose to leave alongside him.

Singh said Peak XV did not want to go into the specifics of the disagreement and was focused on moving forward. “Just out of privacy, and out of, like, trying to be classy about it,” he said. Singh added that such departures were not uncommon at large, multi-stage venture firms and that Peak XV wanted to move on quickly after several years of working together.

All board seats held by the departing partners would be transitioned “imminently,” Singh said, noting that the firm already had overlapping representation across several portfolio companies. He said Peak XV was not concerned about continuity, noting that multiple general partners and operating partners were already involved across many of those boards.

The departures mark the exit of long-tenured investors from the firm. Agrawal had been with Peak XV for more than 13 years, while Ishaan Mittal spent over nine years at the firm and Tejeshwi Sharma more than seven years, per their LinkedIn profiles.

Agrawal wrote in a LinkedIn post that he had decided to “take the entrepreneurial plunge” and was teaming up with Mittal and Sharma to start a new venture capital firm. He described the move as an opportunity to build a new institution with longtime partners and thanked Peak XV’s leadership for what he called a “truly wonderful partnership.”

During his time at Peak XV, Agrawal led investments across fintech, consumer, and software, including Groww, one of the firm’s most prominent IPO exits in 2025. He also backed multiple early- and growth-stage companies alongside Mittal and Sharma, contributing to Peak XV’s broader portfolio build-out over the past decade.

Agrawal, Mittal, and Sharma did not respond to messages for comments.

Peak XV has also moved to strengthen its senior leadership from within. The firm on Tuesday promoted Abhishek Mohan to general partner, expanding its investment leadership bench, while Saipriya Sarangan was elevated to chief operating officer, taking charge of firm-wide operations.

The leadership changes come amid a standout year for Peak XV’s portfolio exits. Five of its companies — Groww, Pine Labs, Meesho, Wakefit, and Capillary Technologies — went public in November and December 2025, generating roughly ₹300 billion (around $3.33 billion) in unrealized, mark-to-market gains for the firm, in addition to about ₹28 billion (about $310.61 million) in realized gains from share sales during the IPOs.

In addition to the latest departures, Peak XV has seen a broader churn in its senior ranks over the past 12 months. Last year, long-time investment leaders Harshjit Sethi and Shailesh Lakhani exited the India team, while Abheek Anand and Pieter Kemps departed from the firm’s Southeast Asia operations. The firm has also seen leadership changes across its marketing, policy, and operations teams in recent months.

Singh dismissed a view circulating in the market that many of the partners who drove Peak XV’s largest exits were no longer at the firm, calling the narrative “not statistically true.” He said several of the firm’s most significant outcomes had been led by long-tenured partners who remained at Peak XV, and argued that the firm’s exit track record did not hinge on any single individual.

Peak XV currently has seven general partners, along with multiple partners and principals, according to Singh.

The VC firm, which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023 and currently manages over $10 billion in capital across 16 funds, has made about 80 investments linked to AI, Singh said, highlighting its push to deepen its focus on AI funding. It is also preparing to open a U.S. office within the next 90 days as it expands its global footprint, per Singh, while continuing to view India as its largest and most important market.

Singh stated the firm believed AI would reshape venture investing more profoundly than previous technology shifts, arguing that successful AI investing required investors with deep technical understanding rather than “generalist” experience. He added that Peak XV was looking to add more AI-native talent, including researchers and engineers with backgrounds in machine learning and large-scale model development.

The firm has invested in more than 400 companies, and its portfolio has seen over 35 initial public offerings and several M&As to date.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/indias-supreme-court-to-whatsapp-you-cannot-play-with-the-right-to-privacy/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India’s Supreme Court on Tuesday delivered an unusually sharp rebuke to Meta, warning that it would not allow the social media giant to “play with the right to privacy” of Indian users, as judges questioned how WhatsApp monetizes personal data.

The comments were made as Meta appealed a penalty imposed over WhatsApp’s 2021 privacy policy. The judges repeatedly asked the company how users can meaningfully consent to data-sharing practices in a market where the app is pretty much the default communications platform.

With more than 500 million users, India is WhatsApp’s largest market and a key growth area for Meta’s advertising business. Judges in the case question the potential commercial value of metadata generated by the platform, and how such data could be monetized across Meta’s wider advertising and AI functions.

During the hearing, Chief Justice Surya Kant said the Supreme Court would not allow Meta and WhatsApp to share even “a single piece of information” while the appeal was pending, arguing that users faced little real choice in accepting WhatsApp’s privacy policy.

Calling the messaging service a monopoly in practice, Kant questioned how “a poor woman selling fruits on the street” or a domestic worker could be expected to grasp how their data was being used.

Other judges also pressed Meta on how user data was analyzed beyond message content. Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the court wanted to examine the commercial value of behavioral data and how it was used for targeted advertising, arguing that even anonymized or siloed information carried economic worth. Government lawyers added that personal data was not only collected but also commercially exploited.

Meta’s lawyers said the platform’s messages are end-to-end encrypted and inaccessible even to the company, arguing that the privacy policy in question did not weaken user protections or allow chat content to be used for advertising.

The case stems from a 2021 update to WhatsApp’s privacy policy that required users in India to accept broader data-sharing terms with Meta or stop using the service. India’s competition regulator later imposed a ₹2.13 billion (around $23.6 million) penalty, finding that the policy abused WhatsApp’s dominant position in the messaging market. That ruling was upheld on appeal before Meta and WhatsApp moved the Supreme Court to challenge it. Meta’s lawyers told the court the penalty had already been paid.

The Supreme Court has adjourned the matter until February 9, allowing Meta and WhatsApp to explain their data practices in greater detail. At the suggestion of the competition regulator, the court also agreed to add the IT ministry as a party to the case, widening the scope of the proceedings.

WhatsApp has been facing heightened scrutiny over its  data privacy across the world. Authorities in the U.S. have reportedly examined claims that WhatsApp chats may not be as private as the company asserts, adding to broader questions about how encrypted messaging platforms handle user data.

In India, WhatsApp is also navigating new regulatory constraints, including recent SIM-binding rules aimed at curbing fraud, which could limit how widely small businesses use the messaging service.

            <div id="article-text">The automotive industry has struggled to adopt hydrogen at scale, but industrial users and data centers might have better luck.

Vema Hydrogen inked a deal in December to supply California data centers, and now it has completed a pilot project in Quebec to power industry with hydrogen that it produces deep underground.

The startup drills wells in regions with specific types of iron-rich rock that release hydrogen gas when treated with water, heat, pressure, and some catalysts. Vema then draws the hydrogen to the surface and sells it to industrial users.

“To supply the Quebec local market, which is about 100,000 tons per year, you would need 3 square kilometers, which is nothing,” Pierre Levin, CEO of Vema, told TechCrunch.

Vema’s first pilot well will produce several tons of hydrogen per day, and next year, it plans to drill its first commercial well, which will reach 800 meters into the Earth. Vema expects to produce hydrogen from the first wells for less than $1 per kilogram, a widely used benchmark for clean hydrogen.

Most hydrogen today is made by a process known as steam reformation of methane (SMR), in which steam is used to break hydrogen molecules off methane from natural gas. It’s energy intensive, and both the process to make steam and the chemical reaction itself release carbon dioxide.

Less polluting sources of hydrogen exist, but they tend to cost more. Hydrogen from SMR costs between 70 cents and $1.60 per kilogram, according to the IEA. Capturing carbon from SMR can add around 50% to those prices, while the cleanest process, which uses zero carbon electricity to power an electrolyzer, drives costs up several fold.

Stimulated geologic hydrogen, or “engineered mineral hydrogen,” as Vema calls it, promises to be one of the cleanest sources of hydrogen, according to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

Once Vema has refined its techniques, Levin expects it to produce hydrogen for less than 50 cents per kilogram. At that price, Vema’s hydrogen would be cheaper than any other source on the market.

Because the rocks that Vema is targeting are widely distributed, Levin said the company will drill wells close to companies that need power, including data centers. California, for example, has some of the largest formations of ophiolite, an iron-rich type of rock that was pushed up from the ocean bottom by plate tectonics.

If Vema can deliver hydrogen at the price it’s forecasting, then a quirk of geology could turn California into a mecca for data centers. “You have a ton of data centers who are trying to get some baseline, decarbonized electricity,” Levin said. “We have very strong traction with them.”

            <h2>Avalanche thinks the fusion power industry should think smaller</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-03</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nuclear fusion conjures images of massive reactors or banks of dozens of large lasers. Avalanche co-founder and CEO Robin Langtry thinks smaller is better.

For the last several years, Langtry and his colleagues at Avalanche have been working on what’s essentially a desktop version of nuclear fusion. “We’re using the small size to learn quickly and iterate quickly,” Langtry told TechCrunch.

Fusion power promises to supply the world with large amounts of clean heat and electricity, if researchers and engineers can solve some vexing challenges. At its core, fusion power seeks to harness the power of the Sun. To do that, fusion startups must figure out how to heat and compress plasma for long enough that atoms inside the mix fuse, releasing energy in the process.

Fusion is a famously unforgiving industry. The physics is challenging, the materials science is cutting edge, and the power requirements can be gargantuan. Parts need to be machined with precision, and the scale is usually so large as to obviate rapid fire experimentation.

Some companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) are using large magnets to contain the plasma in a doughnut-like tokamak, others are compressing fuel pellets by shooting them with powerful lasers. Avalanche, though, uses electric current at extremely high voltages to draw plasma particles into an orbit around an electrode. (It also uses some magnets to keep things orderly, though they’re not nearly as powerful as a tokamak’s.) As the orbit tightens and the plasmas speed up, the particles begin to smash into each other and fuse.

The approach has won over some investors. Avalanche recently added another $29 million in an investment round led by R.A. Capital Management with participation from 8090 Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Founders Fund, Lowercarbon Capital, Overlay Capital, and Toyota Ventures. To date, the company has raised $80 million from investors, a relatively small amount in the fusion world. Other companies have raised several hundred to a few billion dollars.

Langtry’s time at the Jeff Bezos-backed space tech company Blue Origin influenced how Avalanche is tackling the problem.

“We’ve figured out that using this sort of SpaceX ‘new space’ approach is that you can iterate really quickly, you can learn really quickly, and you can solve some of these challenges.” said Langtry, who worked with co-founder Brian Riordan at Blue Origin.

Going smaller allowed Avalanche to speed up. The company has been testing changes to its devices “sometimes twice a week,” something that would be challenging and costly with a large device.

Currently, Avalanche’s reactor is only nine centimeters in diameter, though Langtry said a new version grow to 25 centimeters and is expected to produce about 1 megawatt. That, he said, “is going to give us a significant bump in confinement time, and that’s how we’re actually going to get plasmas that have a chance of being Q>1.” (In fusion, Q refers to the ratio of power in to power out. When it’s greater than one, the fusion device is said to be past the breakeven point.)

Those experiments will be carried out at Avalanche’s FusionWERX, a commercial testing facility the company also rents out to competitors. By 2027, the site will be licensed to handle tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that’s used as fuel and is crucial to many fusion startup’s plans for producing power for the grid.

Langtry wouldn’t commit to a date when he hopes Avalanche will be able to generate more power than its fusion devices consume, a key milestone in the industry. But he’s thinks the company is on a similar timeline as competitors like CFS and the Sam Altman-backed Helion. “I think there’s going to be a lot of really exciting things happening in fusion in 2027 to 2029,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By now, the Forbes 30 Under 30 list has become more than a little notorious for the amount of entrants who go on to be charged with fraud. Notable alumni include FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Frank CEO Charlie Javice, Joanna Smith-Griffin, founder of the AI startup AllHere Education, and “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli, among others. Now, another member of the list has been hit with federal charges.

Gökçe Güven, a 26-year-old Turkish national and the founder and CEO of fintech startup Kalder, was charged last week with alleged securities fraud, wire fraud, visa fraud, and aggravated identity theft.

The New York-based fintech startup — which uses the “Turn Your Rewards into [a] Revenue Engine” tagline — says it can help companies create and monetize individual rewards programs. The company was founded in 2022, and offers participating firms the opportunity to earn ongoing revenue streams via partner affiliate sales, Axios previously reported.

Güven was featured in last year’s Forbes 30 Under 30 list. The magazine notes in the writeup that Güven’s clients included major chocolatier Godiva and the International Air Transport Association, the trade organization that represents a majority of the world’s airlines. Kalder also claims to have enjoyed the backing of a number of prominent VC firms.

The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that, during Kalder’s seed round in April of 2024, Güven managed to raise $7 million from more than a dozen investors after presenting a pitch deck that was rife with false information.

According to the government, Kalder’s pitch deck claimed that there were 26 brands “using Kalder” and another 53 brands in “live freemium.” However, officials say that, in reality, Kalder had, in many cases, only been offering heavily discounted pilot programs to many of those companies. Other brands “had no agreement with Kalder whatsoever—not even for free services,” officials said in a press release announcing the indictment. The pitch deck also “falsely reported that Kalder’s recurring revenue had steadily grown month over month since February 2023 and that by March 2024, Kalder had reached $1.2 million in annual recurring revenue.”

The government also accuses Güven of having kept two separate sets of financial books. One of those sets included “false and inflated numbers,” and was presented to investors or potential investors to hide the “true financial condition of the company,” the government claims. The DOJ also alleges that Güven used lies about Kalder as well as forged documents to obtain a category of visa reserved for individuals of “extraordinary ability,” that would allow her to live and work in the United States.

TechCrunch reached out to Güven through her personal website. The CEO said that she would be sharing a statement about the charges on Tuesday.

            <div id="article-text">The librarian sat me in front of a microfilm reader and brought out roll after roll of film. I stayed there for hours, squinting to decipher the archaic handwriting in the Free Negro Book, which was published annually in South Carolina before the Civil War.

The names in each year’s edition were alphabetized, but only roughly—all of the surnames starting with A came before all of the surnames starting with B, but Agee might come before Anderson, or it might come after.

I began with the 1848 edition, but there was no listing for a Henry Fordham. The same was true of the book for 1849. Same for 1850. But as I slowly made my way through the F section of the 1851 edition, I let out a shout that shattered the library’s decorous hush: “Yesssss!” Then, quickly, to the startled patrons and librarians: “I’m so sorry, excuse me, I’m so sorry.” And then, more softly: “Yes.”

On March 27, 1829, a wealthy white planter and businessman named Richard Fordham purchased four enslaved African Americans from a woman named Isabella Perman. One of them was my great-great-grandfather, a boy called Harry.

This transaction took place in Charleston, the port of entry for an estimated 40 percent of all enslaved Africans brought to toil in this country. A document recording the sale was filed with the South Carolina secretary of state several days later, on April 7. It does not say where in Charleston the sale took place—on the steps of the Old Exchange and Provost Dungeon, perhaps, or at the Cooper River docks, or in one of the thriving markets where people were bought and sold. The individuals bought by Fordham are listed as “a Negro boy named Harry and a Negro woman named Jenny and her two children named Hager and Margaret.” For the lot, Fordham paid $1,080.

Harry, whose proper name was Henry, spent 19 years as Fordham’s chattel. The young man proved to be quick of mind and good with his hands: He mastered the art of blacksmithing at the Chalmers Street Forge, which Fordham co-owned. Henry’s skills eventually made him Fordham’s de facto right-hand man at the forge. On July 10, 1848, Fordham sold “a Negro man named Henry” to Otis Mills and Co., a grain-wholesaling business with multiple warehouses near the Cooper River docks. The sale was recorded with the secretary of state seven days later. The company’s eponymous founder, one of Charleston’s richest men, went on to build the city’s most luxurious hotel, the Mills House. The price he paid for my great-great-grandfather was $2,000, a lot of money for a single Black man.

According to family lore, Henry had somehow circumvented the state’s strict law against educating the enslaved and become literate. He had also become deeply religious. Not only had he learned to read the Gospel of Jesus Christ; he’d also heard the call to preach it.

A few years after being acquired by Mills, Henry Fordham was purchased one final time—by himself, when he bought his freedom.

I’ve always known, through my family’s rich oral history, that my extraordinary great-great-grandfather obtained his liberty at some point before the Civil War. For a long time, however, my attempts to find out exactly when and how he cast off his chains ran into dead ends.

When I was growing up, it never occurred to me to go looking for my family’s history. It was already right there, all around me. My sister, Ellen, and I were born and raised in Orangeburg, 75 miles northwest of Charleston, in the house that Henry Fordham’s son—a formidable man named John Hammond Fordham—built for his family in 1903. Anchoring the corner of Boulevard and Oak Streets, the house is a characteristically southern structure—one and a half stories, with white wooden siding, two graceful bay windows, four dormers poking through the roof, and a wide wraparound front porch that serves as an auxiliary living room during the hot months.

We knew that important family talismans lay in a big, black safe that John Hammond Fordham kept in the main bedroom. It looked like a cartoon safe, the kind that the Road Runner used to drop on Wile E. Coyote’s head, and it was incredibly heavy, which is probably why it still sits there today.

When I was growing up, the safe was always closed but never locked. I was curious about everything, and so sometimes, while my grandmother was busy in the kitchen, I would peek inside. But the old, yellowed papers that I found didn’t mean anything special to me.

Once I became a journalist, I realized that my family’s house, documents, photographs, and oral history constituted an extremely rare gift. All of that material told an important story; I didn’t know what it was, but I had the sense that I was destined to find and share it. Life and career had a way of intervening, however, and for decades I put off the exploration of my family’s past.

I returned to those annals in earnest when I realized two things: First, that my family’s history vividly traced the repeated cycles in which African Americans win a greater measure of opportunity, only to have much or all of it taken away again. With the materials in my house and a bit of research—a lot of research, as it turned out—I could show this pattern in action, over two centuries. Second, I saw that our history is every African American’s history. Through slavery and emancipation, Jim Crow and civil rights, war and peace, all that Black Americans have ever wanted is a fair chance to pursue the American dream.

Family lore said that Henry may have arrived in Charleston from Barbados, one of the British islands in the Caribbean where Africans were “seasoned”—conditioned to the lash—in the sugarcane fields. When my wife, Avis, and I went on vacation to Barbados in 1996, I decided to look for traces of my family in the National Archives. We drove around for quite a while—on the wrong side of the road—until we found the place, which I remember as a graceful old building filled with natural light.

In a big reading room, we sat at a long table while helpful staff members, accustomed to visits from Americans seeking their roots, brought out materials they thought might help us with our search. A day of poring over records, however, gave up nothing more than hints and shadows. Discouraged, we went back to our hotel and I called Aunt Grace—actually one of my mother’s many first cousins—who was the family’s chief genealogist.

I had been looking for records of slave owners named Fordham, but she explained that the name hadn’t attached itself to our family until after Henry’s 1829 sale to Richard Fordham. Instead, she said, I should look for a Black woman named Jenny—the “Negro woman” who was sold at the same time as Henry. Jenny’s previous owner, Isabella Perman, had the maiden name Fell. So I should look for a woman named Jenny who had some connection with those two surnames.

We returned to the archives, and a senior researcher named Shirley Archer helped us renew our quest, bringing out reels of microfilm and precious old ledger books recording births, baptisms, and deaths. We finally found a family named Fell that had lived in Barbados in the early 19th century, in St. Philip Parish. We also found a family in the same parish named Perreman—pretty close to Perman. And we found that on November 27, 1793, an enslaved adult named Kitty Fell was baptized at St. Philip’s Church. She would have been the right age, I thought, to be Jenny’s mother.

But we could find no record of Kitty having a daughter, and no record of Kitty being sold away to Charleston. We had bits and pieces that might fit together, but we couldn’t figure out how. English planters in the Caribbean kept meticulous records of the horses they bred and raced, but they couldn’t be bothered to keep even rudimentary family histories of the human beings they claimed to own.

It was Aunt Grace who learned that Henry Fordham had been sold to Otis Mills in 1848. And I knew Henry had been free before the Civil War and emancipation, because I found his name in the 1861 Charleston city census, appended with the notation f.p.c.—“free person of color.” By then, I reasoned, he must have been a free man for some time, because the census showed that he already owned two wood-framed houses in the city. It must have taken him at least a few years to accumulate such assets.

But exactly when, in that 13-year gap between his last sale and his first appearance in the census, had he become free? I examined real-estate records, scoured the family Bible, searched archives in reading rooms and digital databases, looked everywhere I could think of—and didn’t find a clue. By the 19th century, manumission was essentially illegal in South Carolina, which did not entirely end the practice, but it meant there would be no official document recording the moment of Henry Fordham’s freedom in the secretary of state’s archives.

The South Carolina Historical Society, a private institution founded in 1855, is the first stop for researchers seeking information about the antebellum period. I visited its grand neoclassical headquarters on Charleston’s main thoroughfare, Meeting Street, several times over the years to look for anything about my great-great-grandfather that might pin down the date of his freedom. No luck.

In 2014, the society’s collection was moved across town to the College of Charleston so that the archives’ original home—a landmark 1826 structure known as the Fireproof Building—could be turned into a museum. Slowly, more records were digitized, or at least preserved on microfilm. In February 2023, I visited the collection at its present location, a hushed sanctum on the second floor of the college’s Addlestone Library, in the hopes that more of the hit-or-miss manumission records from Henry Fordham’s time might have been cataloged and made accessible.

I was overjoyed when the librarians found a folder labeled with Henry Fordham’s name—but then immediately deflated when they brought it out, because I saw that it contained only a long, speculative, and largely inaccurate account of Henry’s life, compiled by a distant relative whom I’d never met. I was already familiar with that document, and I knew it said nothing about when Henry had liberated himself.

Finally, one of the librarians suggested that I look through editions of Charleston’s Free Negro Book. I’d had no idea that such a thing existed: a yearly list of free African Americans residing in the city who had paid the state’s poll tax. It was an exercise in data collection born of paranoia. The fact that Black people outnumbered white people in South Carolina during the decades before the Civil War meant that white officials lived in constant fear of a Haiti-style Black uprising. Free African Americans were a tiny minority—more than 95 percent of Black people in the state were enslaved—but it seemed to make sense that any rebellion would be led by conspirators with independent resources and the liberty of unsupervised movement. White southerners took great pains to keep track of men and women like Henry Fordham.

I doubt I will ever be able to find out the month and the day my great-great-grandfather became free. But I can be quite sure that he was still enslaved when free African Americans were counted in 1850—and that he had become a proud, free Black man by the time the Free Negro Book was compiled in 1851.

Even after solving this mystery, I never stopped wondering about my deeper history, before the time of Henry Fordham. Who was my first African ancestor to set shackled foot on this continent? He or she had a name. He or she had a clan, a language, a culture, a faith. All of this history is forever gone.

There was nothing at all inadvertent about its disappearance. It was stolen. Slave owners in the English colonies of the New World went to great lengths to sever any ties that their captives had with the past and with one another. Enslavers’ fortunes and lives depended on being able to control the able-bodied Black men and women who outnumbered them—20, 40, 60 Black bodies crammed into slave shacks, versus maybe a dozen white family members in the big house. Our captors could not allow us to feel confident in the strength of our numbers. They wanted us to feel powerless, ungrounded, disconnected, and thus easier to dominate.

From the December 2023 issue: Lonnie G. Bunch III asks why America is afraid of Black history

I feel the absence of my deep, pre-American history. I feel it the way an amputee suffers phantom pain in a missing limb. I keep looking for what was stolen from me. And occasionally I glimpse what might be fragments of it.

When I was little, among the out-of-town visitors who would occasionally drop by to visit my grandmother and great-aunt were two women from Charleston. I don’t remember their names. What got my attention was that they spoke to each other in an incomprehensible, rapid-fire patois that definitely wasn’t English. I learned they had been speaking Gullah (also called Geechee), a creole language based on English but laden with a hodgepodge of West African vocabulary, grammar, and syntax.

Gullah is possibly a corruption of Angola, a region from which many Africans were seized. Or it might refer to the Gola people, an ethnic group living on land that is now in Liberia and Sierra Leone. If you have ever referred to peanuts as “goobers,” you are using a Gullah word that comes from the Kikongo term for “peanut,” nguba. On the islands around Charleston—including Daniel Island, where Richard Fordham had his plantation and my great-great-grandfather grew into manhood—Gullah evolved as a lingua franca that allowed enslaved Africans from different cultures and language groups to communicate. Henry almost surely would have understood every word those women who visited were saying.

Somewhere in Africa there is a city, town, or village where Henry Fordham’s progenitors lived and died for hundreds or thousands of years, where my distant relatives walk the streets today. That place exists, and I know I will never find it. Still, I can get closer than was possible even a few years ago, thanks to DNA testing.

In 2022, I mailed away a saliva sample and waited, with no real expectation of an aha moment. When the results came back, I learned that 34 percent of my DNA comes from Nigeria, 20 percent from Mali, and another 26 percent from other places up and down the west coast of Africa. That doesn’t depart from what I’d have predicted, and it doesn’t narrow things down meaningfully.

Read: 300 million letters of DNA are missing from the human genome

The remaining 20 percent of my DNA comes mostly from Germany, with a small contribution from the British Isles—again, no surprise. The fact that part of my genetic inheritance comes from Europe makes me like most Black Americans: According to a 2010 study, “an African American individual in the United States has, on average, about 75–80 percent West African ancestry and about 20–25 percent European ancestry.”

Someday, perhaps, the collective human genome will be sufficiently mapped to trace my DNA to a specific Nigerian village or English hamlet. But the truth is that race has never been a biological fact. It has always been a social construct, which allowed the powerful to justify exploitation of the powerless. The elaborate fiction of race gave Richard Fordham the “right” to purchase my great-great-grandfather, and required Henry Fordham to purchase his own freedom. And it is race and racism that have kept me from knowing the names, let alone the hopes and dreams, of Henry’s predecessors in my American history. So I begin with him.

            <div id="article-text">When life gets really hectic, sitting quietly with a book can feel like an impossible luxury. And when does a smartphone-mediated world feel less than hectic? Any shred of free time is too easy to fill with more work, more worrying, more commitments, and, of course, more aimless scrolling. If you really want to get any reading done, you may have to turn it into another task on the to-do list. This doesn’t require strict goals or reading challenges (unless that suits you). All you need is a willingness to dedicate a few minutes a day, and maybe a few new habits—packing a paperback for the waiting room, queuing up an audiobook for your commute. What works best for me, though, is choosing just the right book.

Despite the constant grind of my weeks, I can usually make time to turn some pages if something in those pages pushes through my distractions. I might be behind on grading papers, but if I’m obsessed with Tara Selter, the character stuck in a time loop in On the Calculation of Volume, or totally absorbed in the minutiae of a great biography of Virginia Woolf, nothing can get me to step away. It’s hard to say what book might send you down that rabbit hole, but the list below may help a harried reader pick up something they actually want to finish. I consider these books, representing varied genres, uncommonly likely to absorb, entertain, and challenge. Each is broken up into discrete units—chapters, essays, letters, stories—that provide easy stopping points, although you might find it difficult to put them down.

Instead of offering an escape from real life, Home Cooking invites the reader to consider a kind of domestic drudgery—the daily necessity of cooking and eating—with renewed humor and curiosity. Although each short essay in the collection contains at least one recipe (some quite good, some very 1980s), the sum of these parts is far more memoir than cookbook. Colwin’s writing is funny and familiar, never fussy, and reminiscent of a family heirloom dotted with personal notes and stories. She recounts her own humbling kitchen disasters, shares dinner-party tips, and expounds on the merits of bitter greens. Essays such as “Bread Baking Without Agony,” “Flank Steak: The Neglected Cut,” and “Easy Cooking for Exhausted People” are both practical and charming. Clearly, Colwin loved to cook—and eat—in the comfort of her own home, and her pleasure is infectious. As she writes, “The joy of cooking is the joy of discovery.”

Read: You can read any of these short novels in a weekend

Forster finished Maurice in 1914, but it was published posthumously, in 1971, because of the novel’s portrayal of homosexual love. Its title character, the young Maurice Hall, is a conventional English man with a vague, nagging sense that he’s somehow different. He passes almost numbly through the rigors of schooling and middle-class childhood until he arrives at Cambridge, where he meets a group of very learned young men and begins to wake up: “People turned out to be alive,” Maurice reflects. “Hithero he had supposed that they were what he pretended to be—flat pieces of cardboard stamped with a conventional design.” Maurice grows steadily more intimate with a friend, Clive, trading books and letters with him over vacation, until Clive professes his love. The rest of the novel follows their risky relationship, and feels very contemporary: Can their partnership survive life after university? How will they handle growing pressure to start a lucrative career, marry a woman, and have a family? Anyone interested in a good love story will find something to enjoy.

Smith takes absolute delight in the English language and its history. In her most recent work, the trickster novelist combines her love of words with a propulsive plot: Gliff is partly a YA dystopian novel, partly an homage to Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, and entirely a vehicle for beautiful prose. In the United Kingdom of the not-too-distant future, those who resist the surveillance state and its data mining are marked as “unverifiables” and rounded up inside detention centers. The novel follows two young adults, Rose and her nonbinary sibling, Bri, who return from visiting their mother at work to find a red line painted around their house. Their mother’s boyfriend leaves with a promise to be back soon. Suddenly, they are alone, unverifiable, and unable to turn to anyone for help; they realize they must go on the run to survive. In a typically Smithian twist, the novel will soon have its own double: Make room for its companion novel, called Glyph, to be published in May.

Is anything more engaging than a good murder mystery—one that dares you to guess who did it, and why? I devoured this captivating specimen in just a few days. When the novel opens in Florence, in 1557, the body of the painter Jacopo da Pontormo lies in the chapel of San Lorenzo—in front of the frescoes he’d labored over for a decade, with a painter’s chisel stuck in his heart. The case becomes political when a lewd painting of Maria de’ Medici, the daughter of the Duke of Florence, is found in Pontormo’s room. The ensuing story—consisting entirely of letters among artists, courtiers, and religious leaders—is a wild ride through the politics and intrigue of Renaissance Italy that incorporates real historical figures. This epistolary structure is brilliant: The reader can see precisely who tells what to whom—and discern their motives for telling it. Could the killer be Agnolo Bronzino, Pontormo’s former student? A political rival of the duke? About the ending, I’ll say only that it is funny, smart, and genuinely surprising.

Read: What to read when you have only half an hour

A book of short stories may be the best kind of work for a reader with a busy schedule. You can savor one piece in a collection, then let days or weeks pass before moving on to another. Plus, no one can stop you from reading them in any order you please. I recommend the 12 stories in Honored Guest, all full of striking detail and featuring strangely insightful narrators. Each tale abounds with existential questions and turns the familiar eerie. In “Anodyne,” a mother quits yoga to start shooting classes at a gun range; in “ACK,” a couple endures an odd dinner party on Nantucket. Williams’s stories always benefit from considered, post hoc reflection: Finish just one with breakfast, then let the images and sentences drift through your mind for the rest of the day.

A long novel can be a daunting investment of time and energy, but if you can settle into its rhythms, it can be a wonderful companion for the beleaguered reader. Just shy of 600 pages, The Old Drift glides between magical realism and sci-fi to tell the story of three entangled Zambian families over three generations. Nestled within the chronicles of these characters are chapters narrated by a swarm of mosquitos: Their hive mind takes readers from the colonial beginnings of the nation, starting with the explorer Dr. Livingstone’s “discovery” of Victoria Falls in the 19th century, to the “warm, wet future” of 2023 Lusaka, imagined from the vantage point of 2019. Because of its patchwork of perspectives, the novel can be easily read in chunks, but I found it terribly hard to put aside. This is a curious, probing book: You will find no pat conclusions or sentimentality, only a new (and very rewarding) variation on the multigenerational family novel.

Read: Five books that’ll fit right into your busy schedule

Lockwood’s dad is a rarity: a Catholic priest who’s both married and a father (he was already a family man when he converted, after watching The Exorcist on a nuclear submarine). His pastoral persona is equally unconventional, as he shreds guitar and lounges around the rectory in his underwear. Facing financial troubles, Lockwood and her husband move in with her parents, and Priestdaddy becomes an absurdist reflection on growing up in such an environment. Even if you read this book for only five minutes a day, you will inevitably bump into something screamingly funny, such as the author’s repeated attempts to explain Catholicism to her husband, her sister’s drunken antics at a dinner with the local bishop, and her mother’s penchant for yelling a Kool-Aid-Man-style “Oh yeah!” (I highly recommend the audiobook, in which Lockwood impersonates her family members with flair.) Reading Priestdaddy is like having a conversation with a brilliant, exuberant friend—you can’t wait to hear what she’ll say next.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">My friend recently attended a funeral, and midway through the eulogy, he became convinced that it had been written by AI. There was the telltale proliferation of abstract nouns, a surfeit of assertions that the deceased was “not just X—he was Y” coupled with a lack of concrete anecdotes, and more appearances of the word collaborate than you would expect from a rec-league hockey teammate. It was both too good, in terms of being grammatically correct, and not good enough, in terms of being particular. My friend had no definitive proof that he was listening to AI, but his position—and I agree with him—is that when you know, you know. His sense was that he had just heard a computer save a man from thinking about his dead friend.

More and more, large language models are relieving people of the burden of reading and writing, in school and at work but also in group chats and email exchanges with friends. In many areas, guidelines are emerging: Schools are making policies on AI use by students, and courts are trying to settle the law about AI and intellectual property. In friendship and other interpersonal uses, however, AI is still the Wild West. We have tacit rules about which movies you wait to see with your roommate and who gets invited to the lake house, but we have yet to settle anything comparable regarding, for example, whether you should use ChatGPT to reply to somebody’s Christmas letter. That seems like an oversight.

For the purposes of this discussion, I will define friendship adverbially, to mean any friendly communication—with boon companions but also family members, neighbors, and acquaintances—as well as those transactional relationships that call for an element of friendliness, such as with teachers and babysitters. There is reason to believe that use of AI in these friend-like relationships has already become widespread. In a Brookings Institution survey released in November, 57 percent of respondents said they used generative AI for personal purposes; 15 to 20 percent used it for “social media or communication.”

Read: The common friendship behavior that has become strangely fraught

Respondents to the Brookings survey were not asked whether they had offered some disclaimer about their use of AI or were passing off its outputs as their own; few statistics seem to exist on that question. But in a 2024 survey released by Microsoft, 52 percent of respondents who used AI at work said they were reluctant to admit using it for “important tasks,” presumably because it might make them look replaceable. My feeling is that using AI for friendly communications operates on a similar principle—but the share of people who should be ashamed is closer to 100 percent.

Deception is only part of the problem; the main evil is efficiency. The people selling AI keep suggesting I use it to streamline tasks that I regard as fun and even meaningful. Apple’s iOS 26, for example, has made text messages more efficient by offering AI summaries of their contents in notifications and lists. Before I turned it off, this feature summarized a group chat—in which my friend sent a picture of the door to her spooky attic, normally locked but now ajar, that became the occasion for various jokes about her finally being haunted—as “a conversation about a wooden room.”

In addition to being inaccurate, this summary removed everything entertaining about the chat in order to reduce it to a bare exchange of information. Presumably the summary would have been more actionable if the conversation it summarized had focused on dates and times or specific work products instead of jokes, which are notoriously hard for AI to parse. But how many conversations with friends are about communicating facts?

When my brother texts “How’s it going?,” he’s not seeking information so much as connection. That connection is thwarted if I ask ChatGPT to draft a 50-word reply about how his baby is cute and I love him. To prevent hard-core get-it-done types from inflicting slop on the rest of us, we need to agree that my sending you material written by ChatGPT is insulting, the same way you would be insulted if I were to play a recording of myself saying “Oh, that’s interesting” every time you spoke.

The assumption that the main purpose of writing is to convey information quickly breaks down when you consider cases beyond signage and certain airport-oriented areas of publishing. In schoolwork for teachers, chats with friends, or even emails to business associates—relationships that are defined by mutual obligations—a primary function of any written text is, to borrow a phrase from cryptocurrency, proof of work. This work is the means by which the text was produced but also an end in itself, either because it benefits the writer or because it demonstrates commitment to the reader.

Read: The decline of etiquette and the rise of ‘boundaries’

Generative AI sabotages the proof-of-work function by introducing a category of texts that take more effort to read than they did to write. This dynamic creates an imbalance that’s common to bad etiquette: It asks other people to work harder so one person can work—or think, or care—less. My friend who tutors high-school students sends weekly progress updates to their parents; one parent replied with a 3,000-word email that included section headings, bolded his son’s name each time it appeared, and otherwise bore the hallmarks of ChatGPT. It almost certainly took seconds to generate but minutes to read. As breaches of etiquette go, where this asymmetric email falls is hard to say; I would put it somewhere between telling a pointless story about your childhood and using your phone’s speaker on an airplane. The message it sent, though, was clear: My friend’s client wanted the relational benefits of a substantial reply but didn’t care enough to write one himself.

Writing is an act of taking care. College students write term papers not to inform their professors of the role of class in Wuthering Heights, but because putting what they have learned into words clarifies their understanding to both their instructors and themselves. Writing a eulogy both leads the eulogizer to think deeply about his relationship with the deceased and demonstrates his ongoing commitment to that relationship, even and especially after he can derive no benefit from it: Our goalie is dead, but we care enough to keep thinking about him even after he will stop no earthly puck.

A time-saving technology such as AI is appealing in the workplace because many people want to spend less time working. This calculus should not apply to our friendly relationships, which are not purely means to money or status but also ends in themselves—experiences of other people that are worthwhile as experiences and therefore diminished by efficiency. I don’t want these relations to become more efficient for the same reason I don’t want a robot that pets the dog for me. And if you don’t want to text me, then why do you want to be my friend?

Sometimes, of course, friendship is a pain. It would be easier to conduct friendship purely on our own terms, responding when we felt the urge and letting a computer talk to our friends when we didn’t want to. But that would not be friendship. A computer takes no care. We should not let it take the experience of caring away from us.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Something very dangerous is on track to happen this Thursday.

In two days, New START, the last significant survivor of the age of nuclear-arms-control agreements that began in the 1960s, will come to an end. Donald Trump—a president who claims to be very concerned about “nuclear,” his odd, one-word appellation for all things relating to nuclear weapons—has decided to let the treaty lapse. In July, Trump said that New START was “not an agreement you want expiring,” but last month he backtracked: “If it expires, it expires.”

The New START agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation, in force since 2011, puts caps on the number of American and Russian “strategic” weapons, the long-range missiles and bombers that can cover the thousands of miles between North America and Eurasia. It is the last in a line of treaties that helped stabilize the relationship between the superpowers during the the tense years of the Cold War, and then provided the framework for serious reductions in nuclear weapons after the fall of the Soviet Union. On Thursday, the two largest nuclear powers will be free to begin a new arms race, a needless competition that both nations have managed to avert for decades.

Indeed, even the Russians think the treaty should be renewed. Moscow suspended its participation in the treaty’s ongoing processes (such as information exchanges) back in 2023 as part of the diplomatic sparring with the U.S. over Ukraine, but the Russians have nonetheless offered to abide by the treaty’s numerical limits for one more year. The Trump administration has shown little interest in even this much. As the nuclear-arms researcher Pavel Podvig noted last week, “the US expert and political community has essentially reached consensus on the need to expand the US strategic arsenal.”

From the August 2025 issue: What Trump doesn’t understand about nuclear war

Podvig isn’t exactly right here: The U.S. nuclear establishment—the web of think tanks, contractors, and industries that make and support nuclear weapons—almost always favors the creation of more and newer weapons. (I worked for one such contractor decades ago.) Plenty of other experts and political leaders, of course, would contend that building more nuclear weapons is a very bad idea, but they’re not advising this White House. As in his first term, Trump is surrounded by people who oppose most treaties, regarding them as little more than annoying limitations on American power, and who view arms-control agreements as a sign of weakness. The secretary of the Navy even wants to put nuclear weapons on Trump’s proposed new battleships, a dangerous Cold War policy that was abandoned by George H. W. Bush more than 30 years ago.

New START is a good treaty, but it did not merely leap into being when it was ratified back in 2010. The progenitor of START was SALT, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, begun by Richard Nixon. The SALT Treaty, a major achievement signed in 1972, also put limits on missile-defense research. (A follow-up treaty, SALT II, foundered during the renewed tensions of the late ’70s and early ’80s.) As the Cold War wound down and the Soviet Union’s days grew short, George H. W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev optimistically rechristened the SALT process “START,” replacing the word limitation with reduction, an idea first proposed by Ronald Reagan in 1982.

The cuts that followed were dramatic: The superpowers in the 1980s had a total of some 20,000 warheads pointed at each other on strategic delivery systems. Thousands more were mounted on short-range aircraft and missile systems all over Europe, as well as on surface warships. START slashed these numbers, setting a limit for each side of 6,000 warheads on no more than 1,600 delivery platforms. The process hit a dead end when George W. Bush withdrew from the missile-defense portion of the old SALT agreement and the Russians balked at signing an updated version of START. But Bush instead proposed another agreement: SORT, the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty. Signed in 2002 by Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin, SORT had no provisions for verification, and set only an approximate goal for each side to reduce their inventories to 1,700 to 2,200 deployed strategic warheads by 2012, when SORT would expire.

In 2010, Barack Obama presented the replacement for SORT, New START, to the Senate, where GOP hawks blocked it until Obama agreed to spend tens of billions of dollars for future nuclear-modernization programs—in effect a shakedown for the nuclear-weapons industry in exchange for ratification. But the deal was worth it: New START was a better treaty that included stronger verification procedures and a new limit of 1,550 warheads each. It also included somewhat simplified counting rules that made it easier for both sides to stay in compliance: A bomber that could carry many weapons, for example, counted as only one warhead, because which delivery system carried the bombs was less important than keeping the total below 1,550—a level that both nations achieved.

I studied nuclear weapons back in the mid-’80s; I even took a course in nuclear technology at MIT to make sure I was able to understand the technical details. (I once could calculate things such as “equivalent megatonnage,” but those formulas, like my old slide rule, are long forgotten.) If you had told me in 1985 that one day the Soviet and American strategic arsenals would be down to 1,550 warheads each, I—and most Cold Warriors—would have laughed out loud. And yet here we are, because of the work done to negotiate and ratify New START and its predecessors.

Trump, however, now claims that he wants a “better” treaty that would also include Chinese forces. China has already rejected the idea, but no matter: Trump’s demand to include China is almost certainly a poison pill meant to stop any progress on renewing the existing treaty. Bilateral arms treaties are hard to achieve; multilateral arms treaties are exponentially more difficult.

From the August 2025 issue: The nuclear club might soon double

What happens next may depend, as so much does in this White House, on whatever happens to strike Trump as a good idea. Both sides could merely leave things alone for the moment, which would be the least destructive option for now. But controlling nuclear weapons is about more than observing numerical limits. Regular meetings, inspections, and exchanges of information build trust and relationships that can come into play during times of uncertainty or crisis. Treaties alone do not keep the peace. (The year after SALT was signed, for example, the Soviets and Americans faced off in a dangerous crisis during the 1973 Yom Kippur War that ended with the United States putting its nuclear forces on alert.)

A more likely outcome is that Trump will sign off on more money for more nuclear arms. Such an expansion would be pointless; the United States has more than enough nuclear firepower to deter both Beijing and Moscow. Put another way, America has the ability to destroy both the Russian and Chinese governments and most of their infrastructure with a relative handful of weapons. More bombs will not lead to more security. As Emma Belcher, the president of the arms-control organization Ploughshares, put it to me in an email, failing to replace New START would “contribute to greater geopolitical instability, escalated tensions across the world and a higher likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe in our lifetime.”

Deterrence and international stability, as we should have learned during the Cold War, are not solely about technology and numbers but about will, commitment, the strength of alliances, and, most of all, the fear of a nuclear cataclysm. Trump said during a 2015 primary debate, “I think, to me, nuclear is just the power. The devastation is very important to me.” If the president cares so much about what he once called the “biggest problem” in the world, he has an opportunity to do something about it before Thursday.</div>

            <div id="article-text">If you didn’t know who Peter Attia was last week, here’s how you’ll remember him going forward: Attia is the guy who once emailed Jeffrey Epstein to confirm that “pussy is, indeed, low carb. Still awaiting results on gluten content, though.”

Until recently, Attia was known as a wellness influencer in the manosphere and a newly appointed contributor at CBS as part of the “Free Press to network TV” pipeline. He has a popular podcast and wrote the best-selling book Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity. But Attia is also all over the Epstein files—his name pops up more than 1,700 times in the Justice Department’s latest batch of documents. From 2015 to 2018, Epstein and Attia exchanged numerous emails. Many of them are mundane: Epstein writes to Attia about “a very strange vein like red pattern” on his stomach; he asks Attia what kind of probiotic he should use; there is talk of MRI scans of Epstein’s spine. But others are vile. In a June 2015 back-and-forth about cancer and longevity, Epstein muses that he’s not sure why “women live past reproductive age at all.” (CBS did not respond to a request for comment; the network is reportedly expected to drop Attia after last week’s revelation.)

Attia, a onetime researcher who earned an M.D. but never completed his surgical residency, is beloved by his fans for his measured, scientific approach to living one’s best life. On a recent podcast, he spends two hours examining Alzheimer’s disease in women. Other episodes delve into timely topics such as protein intake, fertility, chronic pain, and nicotine; his October discussion about the safety of Tylenol use during pregnancy offers an evidence-based counterpoint to the alarmist White House press conference on that issue. But he’s also been knocked for overhyping treatments with limited data behind them and for exploiting his eager fans (a course he offered on longevity cost $2,500, according to a 2023 Wall Street Journal article). Eric Topol, a high-profile cardiologist who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, called Attia a “huckster” earlier today.

In the mid-2010s, about the time he befriended Epstein, Attia seemed focused on building a roster of clients whom he could advise on longevity and wellness. An exercise physiologist who once worked with Attia told me that Attia sent him to do a physical evaluation of Epstein at the late financier’s cavernous Manhattan residence in July 2017. He remembers two young, attractive women who flowed in and out during the session with Epstein, though Epstein didn’t acknowledge them. “Something felt a little off,” he told me. A proposed follow-up session never took place. (The physiologist spoke on the condition of anonymity because he didn’t want to be associated with the scandal; he told me he hasn’t spoken with Attia in years.)

Attia’s emails with Epstein reveal no such qualms. In an email in which Attia seems to be pitching Epstein a longevity program, he asks Epstein if “you’re interested in living longer (solely for the ladies, of course)?” In July 2016, Attia asked Epstein what he was doing in Palm Beach, where Epstein allegedly abused numerous underage girls. “Guess,” Epstein writes. Attia replies: “Besides that.” In 2017, Attia appears to have spent time with Epstein in New York—rebuffing his wife’s pleas for him to return home to California—while his infant son was having a medical emergency. In the emails, Attia is not just Epstein’s medical adviser but a friend and ardent admirer. In 2016, Attia wrote to Epstein’s assistant that he goes “into JE withdrawal when I don’t see him.”

When Attia and Epstein met in 2014, the full extent of the latter’s crimes weren’t yet publicly known, but his misdeeds weren’t a secret. Epstein first pleaded guilty to a child-sex offense in 2008, and by 2010, he had settled several lawsuits over allegations of sexual misconduct. A representative for Attia pointed me to a long semi–mea culpa that Attia posted on his X account this morning. He writes that he “never saw anyone who appeared underage” in Epstein’s presence, and that he had “nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone.” Attia also says that when he learned about the extent of Epstein’s crimes from a November 2018 Miami Herald article, he confronted Epstein and told him that he needed to accept responsibility and pay for support for those he had harmed. (In December 2018, Attia wrote to Epstein that he “would like to discuss some stuff with you in person.”) And, in his X post, Attia calls the emails between him and Epstein “embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible.”

In his lengthy explanation of his behavior, Attia writes that he was fascinated by Epstein’s wealth and access to influential people. Epstein had contact with plenty of household names, such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk. Attia’s emails refer to “Ehud”—likely Ehud Barak, the former Israeli prime minister who was known to have a relationship with Epstein but has previously denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of Epstein’s crimes. In an August 2015 email, Epstein tells Attia that he’s having dinner that night with “musk thiel zuckerburg [sic].” (In 2019, a spokesperson for the Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said he had met Epstein “in passing one time at a dinner honoring scientists that was not organized by Epstein.” In 2021, Gates told PBS that his meetings with Epstein were a mistake. A spokesperson for Peter Thiel said on Saturday that Thiel never visited Epstein’s island, and Musk wrote on X that “no one pushed harder than me to have the Epstein files released and I’m glad that has finally happened.”)

Attia is more representative of another category of Epstein associate: researchers who thought Epstein could either fund their work or help push their careers to the next level. In his X post, Attia writes that he was introduced to Epstein when he was raising money for scientific research. Epstein was known to have donated millions to a research center run by Martin Nowak, a professor of mathematics and biology at Harvard. (In 2021, the university temporarily sanctioned Nowak for violating rules about professionalism and campus access in connection with his involvement with Epstein, but he remains a professor there. He said at the time that he regretted “the connection I was part of fostering between Harvard and Jeffrey Epstein.”) Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist and cosmologist, received $250,000 from Epstein’s foundation for his science-communication group. At one point, Epstein introduced Attia to Krauss over email because Krauss was hoping to start a podcast and wanted tips. (Last year, Krauss said that none of his communications with Epstein was criminal, and that he “was as shocked as the rest of the world when he was arrested.”)

Attia, in other words, was seemingly not alone in being wowed by Epstein’s wealth and well-known friends. A particular challenge for Attia, though, is that wellness influencers offer their followers more than diet-and-exercise tips. They’re selling wisdom. Follow my advice, they contend, and you’ll live a longer, healthier, more fulfilled life. But a chummy, yearslong association with a convicted child predator is, at the very least, unwise.</div>

            <h2>Trump Made a Bad Bet on the Kennedy Center</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/trump-kennedy-center-closure-strategy/685860/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

One year ago, President Trump conducted a hostile takeover of the Kennedy Center, the venerable Washington, D.C., performing-arts institution. The president said he had never attended a show there, but he was confident that he alone knew what the center needed.

Last night, Trump delivered an implicit admission of defeat, announcing that the center will close on July 4 for two years. Trump brought the same theory to the Kennedy Center that he does to most of his moves: He believes that he knows better than the experts, and that a “silent majority” actually supports his disruptions. That certainty seems to have led him to a bad bet here.

“I have determined that The Trump Kennedy Center, if temporarily closed for Construction, Revitalization, and Complete Rebuilding, can be, without question, the finest Performing Arts Facility of its kind, anywhere in the World,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “The temporary closure will produce a much faster and higher quality result!”

If you’ve been paying attention, this explanation will be perplexing. In October, Trump posted that “Many major improvements” were under way at the center—including, bafflingly, the addition of marble armrests on chairs—but that “We are remaining fully open during construction, renovation, and beautification.” (For the record, the Kennedy Center underwent a $250 million expansion just seven years ago.)

In December, when Trump added his name to the building’s facade—in violation of statute and grammar—he boasted, “We saved the building. The building was in such bad shape, both physically, financially and every other way. And now it’s very solid, very strong.” Just a month ago he added, “A year ago it was in a state of financial and physical collapse. Wait until you see it a year from now!!! Like our Country, itself, it will rise from the ashes.”

Now Trump is saying that a year from now the center will be closed and dark. Trump’s contradictory statements and the absence of an independent board or any notification to Congress make these claims of a building in need of repair unverifiable at best, and most likely nonsense. (He also hasn’t said anything about how he would pay for this renovation.) A more plausible reason for the closing is that under Trump, the Kennedy Center can’t hold on to staff, artists, or audiences.

When Trump took over, he fired Deborah Rutter, the respected programmer who was the center’s president, and replaced her with Richard Grenell, a political bagman who had previously been deployed as acting director of national intelligence, ambassador to Germany, and envoy to Venezuela, but who had no arts experience. (To be fair, he had little or no qualifications for most of those jobs.) Other staff haven’t stuck around either. “Almost every head of programming has resigned or been dismissed,” The Washington Post notes.

The latest of these was Kevin Couch, the new head of programming, who quit less than two weeks after his hiring was announced. One can imagine the job would be no picnic. In recent weeks, the composer Philip Glass yanked a new symphony commissioned by the center. The opera singer Renée Fleming also canceled two performances. The Washington National Opera announced that it was departing the center. The jazz musician Chuck Redd canceled a long-running Christmas Eve concert. Grenell’s threat to sue Redd for $1 million is unlikely to make artists more eager to book shows.

Grenell has accused artists of politicizing the center. “The left is boycotting the Arts because Trump is supporting the Arts,” he posted on X. “The Arts are for everyone—and the Left is mad about it.” But this statement has it all backwards. Trump grabbed unprecedented presidential control and politicized his own involvement in the arts, promising to use his leadership of the Kennedy Center to vanquish leftist culture. One artist who chose to play, the folk guitarist Yasmin Williams, said that an organized group attended and heckled her.

Given the hollowing out of the schedule and Trump’s unpopularity in Washington, ticket and subscription-package sales have fallen steeply. The Washington Post found that since September, “43 percent of tickets remained unsold for the typical production. That means that, at most, 57 percent of tickets were sold for the typical production.” (Some of those tickets may have been given for free.) For comparison, 93 percent of tickets were sold or given for free in fall 2024. One of Grenell’s dictates was that the center would book only shows that broke even or were profitable, yet instead the center is driving patrons away. CNN reports that the Kennedy Center wasn’t even able to book performances for next season. Closing the doors for two years just makes official what was already happening.

Trump believed that if he grabbed the Kennedy Center’s reins and started booking shows that conformed to his taste—and to that of some of his friends and MAGA fans—the venue would be wildly popular. It turns out, though, that a 79-year-old New York–born billionaire whose tastes run to gilded accents and kitschy musicals isn’t a good proxy for either the general population or arts patrons in Washington. As my colleague Spencer Kornhaber recently wrote, Trump’s term dawned with expectations of a huge cultural shift. Instead, popular culture has remained stubbornly indifferent to MAGA aesthetics.

Trump keeps making a version of this error. His first term was a series of overreaches, all confidently executed in the belief that the silent majority would back him. Instead, he lost in 2020. His second-term win renewed his overconfidence. Now he believes that because many Americans wanted tighter border security, they will also support violent crackdowns in the streets of American cities; instead, his immigration approval keeps sinking. He believes that because he won the election in part on his promises to fix the economy, Americans are willing to tolerate high inflation; instead, polls show that voters’ confidence in the future is declining.

The closure of the center also fits into another pattern: As I wrote last week, Trump has proved adept at destroying things but shows little interest in building them back up. Trump’s previous predictions for the Kennedy Center haven’t borne out, so some skepticism is warranted now. Even if the physical overhaul succeeds, the center will still have the same problems of audience, artists, and staff when it’s done—only in a gaudier space. In effect, Trump appears to have graffitied his name on an empty shell. “I am doing the same thing to the United States of America, but only on a ‘slightly’ larger scale!” he wrote in an October post about the center’s makeover. This time around, his harshest critics might be the first ones to agree.

Here are four new stories from The Atlantic:

Growing up, Melissa Shultz sometimes felt like she had two fathers. One version of her dad, she told me, was playful and quick to laugh. He was a compelling storyteller who helped shape her career as a writer, and he gave great bear hugs. He often bought her small gifts: a pink “princess” phone when she was a teen, toys for her sons when she became a mom. Some of their most intimate moments came when she cut his hair; it was, she said, “a way to be close without talking.” He was there for her in hard times, too. When her engagement ended, he helped pack her things and drove her home.

But she told me their relationship could also be turbulent. The other version of her father was “dark” and would “get so angry” that he seemed to lose control. He would freeze her out for months at a time if she challenged him. He’d call her names, even in front of her own kids. He died when she was in her 30s, and she grieved intensely, though she doubted whether they ever fully understood each other. Now in her 60s, Shultz told me she still mourns the relationship.

Fake it until you make it has become the norm. Stretching the truth knowing you can is not ideal but has been done many times. Outright lies are criminal and should be prosecuted.Shame on Forbes for rubber stamping these frauds and giving them the air of legitimacy without doing their due diligence. I hope Forbes takes a hit for this as well.

The quickest way is to cheat your way to the top. But youth and inexperience leads to a failure to sufficiently cover your tracks and too few powerful connections in industry and government to protect yourself. And ideally a person enters into wealth in childhood so that their parents and grandparents would have already taken care of these things.

Yes, and there&#39;s plenty of stories about companies that *did* spend crazy amounts to expand capacity to meet demand only for the fad to die down before that spend could even matter, and then they spend all that for nothing.

When a company is faced with a surprise demand surge, they are carefully considering the likelihood of the surge subsiding before they can even do anything.

I never really understood all the hate for Game Cube from &#39;serious gamers&#39; .

When using RGB out at 480P most games looked just as good as the &#39;HD&#39; competition.  The performance was fine, but I guess it was memory staved because it seems like the GC version of some 3rd party titles got cut down a bit.

There was NOTHING more fun then MK Double Dash with about four people and game cubes with broadband adapters.

It&#39;s deceptively easy to assume you implied that below-average drivers are idiots. But what criteria?

- Warnings about vehicle state such as fluid levels are helpful and useful.

- Other warnings, such as detected vehicles in proximity, these are interesting warnings. Not so distracting to me as the lane-keeping steering hints...

Touch screens should never replace buttons when it comes to functions that the driver needs while driving.

GPS is understandable. But the HVAC should not be &quot;only touch screen&quot; and same with things like fuel and speed gauges. Those should be analog gauges.

The fact you think HVAC is something the driver needs is just completely silly. No HVAC systems should function to keep the air temperature correct. Many cars do this. I&#39;ve not touched the HVAC system in my car in 2 years now. Summer, winter, sunny, rainy, snowing, climate control is a solved problem. We should call out any car that *needs* the user to touch it to maintain comfort as being defective, not the idea that it needs a button.

As for analogue gauges, you are completely wrong and we have 50 years of

If you somehow managed to find a mate I feel so sorry for that person.

No they aren&#39;t. They just have certain features that are worse for safety than their predecessors. Modern cars are still objectively safer (for the occupants) in America, and objectively safer (for everyone) in the rest of the world where people aren&#39;t obsessed with oversized pedestrian killers, than their predecessors.

You can see that in the road fatality stats. We haven&#39;t become better drivers.

Anything else should be treated as kidnap AND attempted murder.

It might be more difficult to break the glass from inside a car than expected especially if you are injured after the crash and the car is in a &quot;weird&quot; position.

There are some tools that will help you make the initial break, after which the glass usually breaks more easily: https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]

The persons inside/outside the car may be weak, ill or too panicked to break the glass. Especially if the car has reinforced glass windows. It&#39;s an action that is a lot more complicated than just opening the door, in a situation where every second may count. The person inside the car may hesitate to break the glass because they&#39;re afraid of flying glass shards, or because they don&#39;t understand the urgency of the situation and don&#39;t want to damage the car any further. Yes that would be extremely stupid but p

Really? And how is 5 year old going to understand that.

How many people need to die for nice aesthetics.

My guess is you are more selfish than me. Many believe that&#39;s a sign of progress. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s devolution, it&#39;s living like a primitive savage.

Riddance! Shame about mercedes whose exports to china are about to drop like a rock because of their stupid door handles.

Import them without the handles and associated electromechanicals as a manufacturing subassembly. Have someone in China attach a localized handle.

So that&#39;s a big safety fail. On top of that, only the front passengers have an accessible mechanical release. The rear passengers technically have one but it&#39;s under a hatch, under the lining at the bottom of the door bin. i.e. rear seat passengers will panic and die in an emergency.

So I don&#39;t see the handle being a problem but the lack of mechanical release is a major one, front and especially back. And if you&#39;re in a Cyber Truck (not in China of course) with your &quot;unbreakable&quot; glass, then don&#39;t expect anybody to be pulling you out of the fire, or the rising water in time to save your life.

The fix to these issues is simple and the default on most cars - the handles inside and out should be mechanical. In the loss of power, somebody might have to yank the door hard since the windows are frameless and seated into the door but they should still be able to rescue occupants.

Last summer 3 teenagers burned to death in a Cybertruck near where I live. They were just home from college, borrowing their parents&#39; Tesla, and probably didn&#39;t know where the manual override latch was.

A lot of safety is sacrificed for very little to no upside.

&quot;In November 2024 (Thanksgiving Eve), a Tesla Cybertruck crashed at high speed into a tree and wall in Piedmont, California. It carried four college students (all teenagers/young adults around 19-20 years old). The crash caused a fire, and three of them died: Krysta Tsukahara (19), Jack Nelson (20), and the driver Soren Dixon (19). One survivor was pulled out after a good Samaritan broke a window.The key claim in multiple wrongful death lawsuits (filed in 2025 by families of two victims) is that the Cybertruck&#39;s electronic/retractable/flush door handles contributed to the deaths. Allegations include:

The power-dependent electronic handles (and buttons) failed after the crash/power loss.No easily accessible exterior mechanical handles existed for rescuers to open doors quickly.Interior manual releases (cables) were hidden/obscure (e.g., under a map pocket liner), hard to find amid smoke, fire, and panic.Victims reportedly survived the initial impact but were trapped and died from smoke inhalation and burns, not crash injuries.

These lawsuits blame Tesla&#39;s design choices for turning a survivable crash into fatalities, and the issue has drawn scrutiny (including from NHTSA investigations into Tesla door systems). Tesla hasn&#39;t been found liable yet—the cases are ongoing.&quot;

Why did the fire break out in the first place? Was it bad design of the batteries? Its by no means the first time a tesla has gone up in smoke in a crash.

Why did the fire break out in the first place?I believe the parent stated the crash caused the fire.And before we start with the debates around battery designs, perhaps we keep in mind 150,000 ICE cars catch fire every year in the US.  Thousands every day.  You don’t hear about them on the news because we’d need a small army doing nonstop 24-hour fire reporting, which would probably send driver paranoia soaring after listening to the news team at Fires-R-Us for more than 15 minutes.Not defending Teslas design choices.

This just highlights the idiocy of Tesla&#39;s design choices even more.  Many ICEs catch fire yes, but their occupants can get out of the vehicle when it happens.  Tesla&#39;s design makes a positive into a negative.

Fire breaking out when you have a fuel tank and pipes full of a highly flammable liquid are not a surprise. Batteries however should not catch fire unless seriously damaged and it should be quite possible to design a battery compartment that would survive anything short of an IED going off underneath.

&quot;The Cybertruck is the automotive equivalent of the Titan submersible&quot;

Good analogy. The cybertruck however isn&#39;t just dangerous to its occupants , its sharp edges are a danger to any pedestrians it might hit which is why it fails safety checks and can&#39;t be sold in most EU countries.

One survivor was pulled out after a good Samaritan broke a window.Seems the window was defective. I thought Musk said it couldn&#39;t even be broken with a sledgehammer.

A lot of safety is sacrificed for very little to no upside.What are you taking about?  Musk got to show how cool he is by doing something different again.  You don&#39;t want Musk to be innovative?  Won&#39;t someone please think about Elon?

Last summer 3 teenagers burned to death in a Cybertruck near where I live..A lot of safety is sacrificed for very little to no upside.Uh, can anyone explain the upside specific to that model?  It sure as hell wasn’t because aesthetics.It ain’t flat door handles preventing that thing from hitting 200MPH.  It’s Holmes dressed in the latest design by Drag Coefficient riding shotgun saying, “No Shit, Sherlock.  It’s a bloody line-reject lunchbox with tires..”

Were they stealing the car at the time? Because that&#39;d be great karma (b**ch!).

for aerodynamic reasonsNo one is doing it for the aerodynamics.

Bingo. For aerodynamics, they would find a bigger pay off with wheelwell covers, and those are somewhat rare. Especially on any cars catering to trends and aesthetics.

A lot of EVs have little slots in front of the front wheels to allow air to pass in and push away from the wheels. So the need for wheel well covers is mitigated.

Flush door handles do make a small difference, as so cameras instead of wing mirrors. Next to the rapidly falling cost of batteries and improvements in the drivetrain they aren&#39;t really a big deal though, and are mostly done for aesthetic purposes.

Rear wheelwell covers were a thing in the 70s and early 80s for some manufacturers. The problem is if you need to change a wheel they&#39;re a right PITA.

The space behind the cover becomes a cavity where the snow can get packed in, until the cover pops off while driving.  Losing pieces of your vehicle in traffic is generally not good. 

It also reduces cooling airflow to the brakes, although that should matter less for an EV.

If you can&#39;t see the difference between a retractable antenna and a retractable door handle, someone else can explain it to you. 
That said, the real issue is door handles that electronically actuate the release mechanism instead of mechanically doing so.

... touchscreen controls for common tasks such as altering the HVAC or radio/media settings and put back buttons. For some reason the authorities in most countries see m to think its dangerous using a touchscreen phone but perfectly ok to use a touchscreen car interface while doing 70mph.

Buttons are better, but dials or levers are better yet. Hitting a stupid toggle button that’s indistinguishable from the rest of the row of toggle buttons multiple times to change the temperature is just a stupid idea. I’m looking at you, Mercedes.

If you&#39;re altering your HVAC then touchscreens aren&#39;t the issue, but your defective HVAC system is. There&#39;s no reason for HVAC to be anything other than set and forget. It&#39;s trivial to design fast acting accurate temperature control systems.

I&#39;ve not touched the HVAC settings in my car in 2 years now. It&#39;s the same summer, winter, rain snow or shine. As it should be. You know how you&#39;re dressed when you get in a car, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t set the desired comfort level before you drive off.

Tell me your male without saying so. Large numbers of females will have issues with your misogyny around the issue of hot flushes. Not that I am female, but I do have compassion for others and eyes to observe their problems, unlike you. That is just one example as to why you might need to change the setting on the move. I can come up with others if you so desire.

The assumption that HVAC can be constant is not borne out by the realities of the human condition. If it works for you, that&#39;s fine, but your arrog

How much acrobatics does it take to get into a position where you can aim a kick at a window? For a typical overweight driver? In a crowded car? Full of smoke? With a broken leg? When you start to panic?

You can have flush handles on the outside AND a mechanical method of opening the door from the inside.  The Tesla model 3 and model Y have the flush outside handles that actuate an electronic solenoid that unlatches the door.  On the inside, one normally just presses a button to do the same from the inside.  However, on the arm rest in front of the power window buttons there is a physical latch that you can pull up that mechanically unlatches the door.  It&#39;s only on the front doors though.  Room for improvement.

https://www.youtube.com/shorts... [youtube.com]

I think the point is to ALSO have a mechanical exterior latch that safety/rescue personnel have available that isn&#39;t disabled by a electrical failure too.

You can have flush handles which present themselves when the car is unlocked and ALSO still can be actuated when NOT popped out. They just can&#39;t come out parallel. You can use a lever action instead which pops out when you press on the leading end of the recessed handle, and also use an actuator to push it out when wanted.

I don&#39;t know if any manufacturer has actually done this as I don&#39;t keep up with every car any more, but it&#39;s not even difficult to imagine. (I don&#39;t visualize, so if I can imagine a mechan

How aerodynamic must a ground vehicle be when its speed is regulated to be 80MPH or below by law. I&#39;m not talking about stretches or highway with no limit, just average normal roads.

Theres one law for them and one law for us.

The only time billionares EVER face legal trouble is if they are harming other billionares.

What is it you want the SEC to do about this? Who do you believe to be a victim of it? Why are they a victim of it? How were they victimized by it?

Theres one law for them and one law for us.

That&#39;s because *they* do something about getting what they want. Whereas you (the American population) can&#39;t be bothered to do something, *anything* actually,  to keep them in check.

This problem isn&#39;t going to solve itself.

When you say those words it doesn&#39;t make much sense.  When Trump says it, people storm the capital building.

Naw guys come on.  Pretty sure we have that derangement syndrome they keep talking about.  Everything is fine. /s

Basically they want to turn America Into Saudi Arabia. A handful of kings and queens, a very tiny number of people serving them and a vast vast sea of extraordinarily poor people kept down by a combination of brutal violence and religion.Have you ever actually been to Saudi Arabia?

what&#39;s ketamine got to with anything? i&#39;m sure he has a script for that.

The SEC has been depopulated, they do not have the personnel to review anything, which is just la Presidenta and his billionaire friends want it, since they did it to the SEC. And the remaining personnel haven&#39;t been tasked to do any important reviews except against la Presidenta&#39;s enemies (the list is updated weekly). And as others have noted, even if they did object, la Presidenta would soon see to it that their objections were buried along with their jobs.

Lest we forget, a similar thing happened in the 2

Come on, Elon has been grafting through the Obama, Trump 1, Biden, and Trump 2 administrations without being called on his shit, and your comment about &quot;the Rs stock portfolio&quot; utterly ignores that it&#39;s congress as a whole (with a few exceptions) seems to come out with massively increased net worth when all is said and done.

When will the SEC step in?  Oh right, never he bought them off.I don&#39;t see any reason the SEC would be involved.  When there is an IPO, then the SEC will care, but even then I don&#39;t see any particular reason for concern.  Musk may be setting ridiculously-high valuations, but that&#39;s a question for the market to decide, not regulators.  Either investors will agree or they won&#39;t, and they&#39;ll either make money or lose money depending on the accuracy of their decision, but that&#39;s not something the SEC should care about, that&#39;s just the market at work.

Porn is the use case.  So it&#39;s an honest opinion at least.

Good point.  If only they could lose more money per year.

I was being sarcastic, as would be clear from the sentence after.Even Elon belatedly realised he was paying far too much, but was forced to honour the deal.

OTOH, the Twitter archives are of significant value to training AI. And in these days of mega-inflated AI stock price, X/Twitter may well be worth tens of billions on paper, even though it makes no profit. Reddit is &quot;valued&quot; at $33B  FFS!

I&#39;ll bet Musk gave the major SpaceX investors an ultimatum...basically take this junk firm, xAI, or he doesn&#39;t let SpaceX go public, and their investments will remain locked up.   But, oof, a $250 billion valuation on xAI...that value will not be returned in our lifetimes.  But somehow TSLA is still at >$400/share so don&#39;t take stock advice from /. btw the TSLA PE is 392 ...that&#39;s bonkers)

Recall that previously Tesla invest like $2billion in xAI, but my guess is with Tesla&#39;s declining prospects in their

adding 1 million satellites would impact the DAY SKY.

It&#39;s their way to combat global warming, by providing global shading.

Musk is a genius, he is moving his AI out of terrestrial jurisdiction to a location where it can generate all the child porn he could ever want without legal issues. It&#39;s his consolation prize for not getting to play on Epstein Island.

Only if he moves into space as well - he&#39;s still liable for the results and output of his company.

I doubt Musk is liable for much, especially under the current US administration.

xai? Isn&#39;t that the stuff mostly used to make images of famous people naked?  250 billion for that?  Seems just a way to payoff Musk.And a million satellites in space is not ruining our night sky?Can somebody please...Musk wants to AIify space. He says some neat words about needing more power than we can generate terrestrially then immediately pops off that space is the solution. Power generation in space isn&#39;t free, but I suppose it is decoupled from the power grid down here, and thus won&#39;t have to compete with us pesky brats that aren&#39;t billionaires and sometimes need power for cooking, lights, and other silly shit like climate control in our homes.

SpaceX pegged its own valuation at $1 trillion -- a markup from the $800 billion it commanded in a December secondary stock sale -- and priced xAI at $250 billion based on a recent $20 billion funding round that valued the two-year-old AI company at $230 billion.
The companies are worth what we (Musk) say they&#39;re worth.
Convenient when you&#39;re trading between yourself and yourself.

The companies are worth what we (Musk) say they&#39;re worth.

The valuation of SpaceX is based on the external purchasers that have put forth bids over the years, the most recent one settling in January of this year. The valuation of xAI is based on the latest funding round raised from venture capitalists outside of Musk. So there are more people than Musk who believe this valuation -- believe it enough to put multiple billions of their own dollars on the line for it. Whether that is the true valuation or not, well, that&#39;s always the game of stocks, right? If enough people believe a price, that&#39;s the price.

If you call your Qatari friends, and ask them to invest in xAI at a given valuation, with the promise that- you&#39;ll back that valuation by having both Tesla and SpaceX acquire shares in xAI at the same price a week later;- you&#39;ll have SpaceX fully acquire xAI another two weeks later at a 10% markup;- you&#39;ll take the entire shebang public at again a 25-50% markup in half a year or so.

Do you think that your Qatari friends are actually investing in your fledgling AI startup? Or in something else entirely?

Does anyone take the numbers seriously? It seems like they are little more than a fiction based on what someone would pay for part of the company, and pay using the imaginary value of another company.

Either way, it will all come crashing down soon enough. Hopefully not literally in the case of SpaceX, but it would be a shame if the AI bubble bursting wrecked the space part.

And investors will still buy it sight unseen at Musks valuation.

People don&#39;t appreciate how much money is looking for an asset, any asset, to cling to. QE needs to be toned down to pre-covid levels in a real hurry.

The companies are worth what we (Musk) say they&#39;re worth.No, your emotions may be blinding you.   I&#39;m as angry as you at things like the &quot;dark maga&quot;, but the reality is more subtle.Musk has a history of unorthodox honesty for a CEO, saying Tesla was over-valued.  After one tweet, Tesla dropped $14B in value.So now he has embraced the market valuations. Something akin to the &quot;greater fool theory&quot;?   The prices are crazy, but this one is not Elon&#39;s fault. Just look at the stock market.

I know it says &quot;up to&quot;, but how long will it take to launch that many? Assuming launches every day of the year, he&#39;d need to launch about 274 per day to achieve the 1M in ten years. Are we talking tiny satellites here and you can pack hundreds into one launch?

Then there&#39;s the issue of putting so much garbage into space that we essentially block ourselves in - we end up with an orbit of garbage that no other vehicle can pass through safely. Or is that a non-issue because the orbit is so large?

I&#39;m not convinced we&#39;ll get to 1 million satellites before kessler syndrome is triggered. Kessler&#39;s group just barely released a report using updated numbers and it&#39;s not looking good at all.  We&#39;re way past the threshold.  It&#39;s just a matter of time now, for the 500km zone.

But think of the 100+ year light show we would get as those little pieces decay back into the atmosphere. I&#39;ll pop the corn.

Are we talking tiny satellites here and you can pack hundreds into one launch?I hope so! Imagine if so many of us drive Teslas to avoid car exhaust emissions looking at the exhaust from hundreds of rocket launches.

Imagine if so many of us drive Teslas to avoid car exhaust emissions looking at the exhaust from hundreds of rocket launches.Fun fact about the Starship:  its fuel is liquid methane and liquid oxygen, which when combusted results in exhaust consisting of water vapor and carbon dioxide.  So, not great from a global-warming perspective, but not really polluting in the classic sense.Falcon 9, OTOH, burns kerosene and oxygen, and emits water vapor, carbon dioxide, and soot.  Presumably they will start phasing that out in favor of Starship though, when they can.

274 a day is easily achievable. They would be able to afford that if they get Starship working at the same cadence as Falcon 9. The reason it&#39;s currently unaffordable with Falcon 9 is Falcon 9 expends the upper stage, which costs about $10 million per launch. Starship will be able to launch at least 200 tons into orbit. Presumably each data center satellite would weigh about 720 kg (weight of a Starlink v2 Mini), they could launch the 275 satellites daily on a Starship. In theory they could reuse the same S

The first gen Starlink satellites were ~60 per launch on Falcon, IIRC, so it&#39;s not unreasonable to imagine &quot;hundreds per launch&quot; on Starship.

With that said, the whole &quot;AI in spaaaaaaaace&quot; bit seems even more insane than terrestrial AI.  Where is all the heat supposed to go?

What orbits is he asking for?  If it&#39;s LEO, then they&#39;ll burn out rapidly.  If it&#39;s geostationary, then it&#39;s already crowded.  If it&#39;s everything in between, then there&#39;s (potentially) a lot of space, but it&#39;s a bit more expensive to get there.  And you&#39;d want everything to have a VERY low eccentricity orbit, so then didn&#39;t interact.

One good idea would be to physically link the satellites together, but that would require a lot of development that hasn&#39;t really been tested.  (It would also mean they keep pos

Humans aren&#39;t hardened for space either, but we send them up in shielded environments pretty regularly.

What a dumb comment. they don&#39;t just slowly deteriorate in space, like people. They are inoperable from day one.

xAI wins because Grok is burning through billions and has very little prospects of significant revenue.

Elon Musk wins because he increases his ownership in SpaceX, which is making pretty decent money.

SpaceX win..... SpaceX investors get to share that warm feeling that Tesla investors get from handing over additional large portions of their company to Elon Musk.

Help me, ObElon Kenobi.  You&#39;re my only hoppe.

You guys remember the Beavis & Butthead episode where they were tasked with selling school fundraiser cookies? They bought all of each other&#39;s cookies by exchanging one dollar back & forth with each other. So basically they sold all the cookies, but only raised $1 for the school.

That&#39;s stupid.  The first dollar was the school&#39;s so they technically stole the schools dollar over and over again.  What are we supposed to learn from this?  To lie cheat and steal?  Trump and Musk have already tought master classes in that.

Well, duh.  I got a real kick out of his &quot;one million sattelites&quot; plan..  Is that some sort of Dr. Evil joke?   This fucking guy...

laughed out loud.  This was predicted, and has come to pass.  He&#39;s fishing for that Trillionaire patch.

Musk has done this before.  In 2016, SolarCity was in financial trouble, so Musk had Tesla bail them out by purchasing them.  Now he&#39;s using the same maneuver to keep xAI afloat using SpaceX&#39;s assets.

Musk said the least expensive way to do AI computation within two to three years will be in space. Has someone told him about the heat problem in space? Vacuum is cold, but it&#39;s also a near perfect insulation. Getting rid of heat is a constant problem for space craft because there is no heat exchange and radiating it off is the only option you have and it&#39;s terribly inefficient. And last I checked, GPUs generate quite a bit of heat.

You need to use chips that can power themselves of the temperature difference between the hot side and the radiating side. Add enough layers of that with efficient low power chips and that problem goes away.

Starlink V2 sats are already generating about 28kW of electricity, much of which is converted to heat, to give you an example. They work just fine with existing radiator tech.

Scott Manley addresses it in a recent video, at around the 13:30 mark: https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]

That&#39;s when fully operational serving clients. They reduce power over the ocean and countries where they do not operate, which helps radiate away some of the heat. The AI ones will be similar.

The biggest load is the RF transmitters, followed by the computers.

he is not in business of running those data centers. He is in business of building them and burning tax payer money in LEO.

I guess he will send someone up there to do periodic maintenance as well. ;)

Please. He&#39;d have to not be high for a moment to consider something like that...

Has someone told him about the heat problem in space?This isn&#39;t about heat in space. It&#39;s about heat on earth. Specifically the heat under xAI which has no money thanks to being little more than a shell company used to bail out Musk from his disastrous Twitter acquisition, and SpaceX being about the only good profitable company that Musk could use to bail out xAI (and Tesla, buying 1000 Cybertrucks to clear space so Musk could stop paying dumping fees for parking his unwanted wankpanzer)

Yes Musk runs things so they are good for Musk.

There is another concern... Apparently no one even tried to put an electronics based on smaller than 16nm process in space...

Does anyone know how many shares xAI had privately issued?

If you had put in $10 billion in the last round of funding, what&#39;s your payout with this buyout?

Is this just a way of Musk paying himself lots of $ billions from SpaceX?

I&#39;d love to know the details of this buyout.

SpaceX is not public, it only has an estimated value and has not IPOed yet.

So while it is big deal SpaceX&#39;s value is using funny money to buy a company whose value is also funny money.

SpaceX claims it had $16b of sales and $8b of profit, so its PE ratio is 125(at $1 trillion value) and even if they were to have the entire launch market that won&#39;t increase its sales that much.  It is buying a company that has an infinite PE ratio (has not made enough revenue to even pay its loan costs, and is burning cash).

...but isn&#39;t this mostly a matter of left-pocket/right-pocket $ for Musk?

I&#39;m not even sure how this was meaningful or how there was a transaction.  He&#39;s head of both companies, isn&#39;t this technically just a merger and then transfer of (merger of) funds/assets?

> the people who chose to live near an airport did so with the knowledge they would be buying affordable homes in exchange for the tradeoff.

I doubt most people in that situation expect or even know about higher lead contamination.

We&#39;re not talking about lead poisoning, we&#39;re talking about the effects of long term lead exposure. In places that used leaded gas, the IQ of the general populace went down 7 points. The only thing worse is living next to a lead smelter. If you visited the city the smelter was in in the 80&#39;s, everything was dead. There was no vegetation for a mile around the smelter site itself. During the 90&#39;s they changed something with the smokestacks (adding a few feet to the height) and tha

They probably didn&#39;t know about lead emission from avgas, and even the neurological effects of lead they&#39;re unlikely to know very well. Lower land prices near airports, to the degree that&#39;s a thing, are probably more about noise.

I wonder why people are bad at risk assessment and at judging scale?

Sesame Street used to have monsters do big/small and near/far. I would have thought we could have grasped these concepts in early childhood, but I keep running into people who also suck me into a pointless debate when they don&#39;t get it.

Trying to score points with nihilist? I don&#39;t think they care. ;-)

Which is why there is pressure to close them. For example, this one about 5 miles away from home, currently scheduled to close in 2031.

Let&#39;s get the CDC and NIH on it. Oh wait we can&#39;t. They were strangled.

Look, tetraethyl lead was a &quot;cheap&quot; way to get gasoline-fueled engines to run higher compression without pre-detonation (knocking) damaging the engine. The development of electronic fuel injection in the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s pretty much eliminated the knocking problem by electronically adjusting the timing of spark plug ignition via knock sensors and a small computer, which meant modern gasoline-fueled engines for street-legal vehicles rarely suffer from this issue. Besides, modern refining technology makes it possible for gasoline RON octane ratings as high as 99 (circa 95 pump octane) in unleaded fuel, pretty much eliminating the need for tetraethyl lead.

Wrong assessment on the supply side. Refineries have always been capable of producing fuel to suit any RON requirement (just look at avgas). The question was how expensive it is to do so. TEL still remains the cheapest (albeit banned) way of increasing an octane rating, and thus improving margins. It&#39;s not the supply side of the equation that makes lead undesirable, the supply side simply adapted to market regulations, and fuel injection doesn&#39;t solve the knocking issue completely, it just allows engines to

The development of electronic fuel injection in the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s pretty much eliminated the knocking problem by electronically adjusting the timing of spark plug ignition via knock sensors and a small computerNo. Most vehicles didn&#39;t get knock sensors until the mid 1990s and you still had to set timing, they typically still had a distributor before then. For example my Nissan 240SX had a distributor with a 360 mark optical position sensor in it. You did the timing 100% the old fashioned way, by loosening the distributor bolts and turning it, and there was no knock sensor. It basically just had the electronic version of vacuum advance.

That asshole is suing his own, our own, IRS for $10 Billion. He won&#39;t get all that but he may get a payout. And who is going to defend the IRS? We have no Justice Department. The sycophants running the joint are not going to put up a fight. That is the alleged president trying steal $10 Billion from the gov. itself. I suppose that cuts out the middle men he&#39;s been using so far.

Things that weren&#39;t possible before Trump are now possible, especially his second term. You only have to check the news once or twice in the past year to see that.

What does a study about lead content in people have to do with Trumps policies that specifically scale back the regulatory power of the agency responsible for reducing lead content in people?

Is that the question you are asking? Did you huff a bit too much lead in your youth?

Panasonic is making those cameras, and it is much more of a lifestyle brand now than anything, if one can even believe it that you can position five-figure digital cameras as lifestyle.

Leica Cameras, as in point and Shoot and Profesional Cameras are very good.Their optics are very good to.Some of their image processing technologies, like using RYGB sensors (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue) are very interesting.

And, in a world were phones with high end cameras use the Carl Zeiss branding ad nauseam, some phone brands partner with Leica for some needed diferentiation.

It&#39;s weird that one Duolingo is worth five or six Leicas.

On Monday, the New York Times reported a bizarre and shocking update to news of an FBI raid last week on a Georgia election office: It turns out that immediately after the federal raid, the FBI officers involved spoke directly with President Donald Trump. To say that this is unusual would be an understatement—it is without precedent. It has long been known that the 2020 election in Georgia is a personal obsession of Trump’s, but the extent to which he is actively, openly, and personally meddling in the state’s elections system is still surprising and new. One big question looming over this entire episode, though, is why—of all the states where Trump falsely claimed there was fraud in 2020—has Georgia become ground zero for the president ahead of the 2026 midterms that election experts feel are potentially threatened by Trump’s latest actions? We think we have a few answers.

Those answers have to do as much with 2026 as they do with 2020. And, perhaps surprisingly, a big motivation for Trump’s assault on Georgia’s election infrastructure now has as much to do with the Republican primaries in the state as with November’s general election. Allow me to explain.

Georgia’s race for governor is considered a toss-up, though Republicans have consistently held the job since 2002. Polling has shown the top Republican contenders are Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones. Trump has endorsed Jones, who served as a fake elector in 2020 and was tied up in Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ election interference investigation, which charged Trump and several co-conspirators with a criminal conspiracy to steal Georgia’s 2020 election. Jones has focused his campaign on attacking Raffensperger over that election. Raffensperger, as you may recall, has been a longtime personal target of Trump’s after a 2021 phone call with the president in which he was asked to “find” 11,780 votes for Trump in order to flip the state’s 2020 election results.

In order to understand how the race between Rafensperger and Jones relates to the FBI’s raid on Fulton County, it’s necessary to recognize that Georgia’s voting system has been mired in controversy for nearly a decade. Back in 2017, a group of Georgia voters and the Coalition for Good Governance sued the state over its use of Dominion Voting Systems’ electronic ballot-marking devices. These devices are like a tablet and don’t create a paper copy of a voter’s ballot selections; instead they print a paper QR code that can be scanned to see a digital image of a ballot. This, the lawsuit alleged, opens up serious security vulnerabilities that can not only be hacked, but also make it nearly impossible to verify the software accurately recorded a voter’s ballot. When the lawsuit eventually went to trial in 2024, a computer scientist demonstrated live, in court, how he was able to rig Dominion’s voting tablet by rewriting its code and printing out as many ballots as he wanted. In a hypothetical election, the hacking was successful in flipping the outcome of a race.

During that trial, the plaintiffs also pointed to Georgia’s Coffee County data breach that occurred in 2021, where pro-Trump activists physically entered the small, rural county’s election office and copied election system software. A lawyer for the Coalition for Good Governance claimed at the time that the compromised software was not isolated to Coffee County, and that hackers could have access to voting software used in all 159 counties in Georgia. Plus in 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, under the Biden administration, also advised that Dominion’s electronic ballot-casting software presents security vulnerabilities. None of this validated Trump’s phony claims of election fraud in 2020, but it does make the state’s election systems more vulnerable to the sort of episode we witnessed last week.

Ultimately, the Coalition for Good Governance’s 2017 lawsuit failed, with a judge dismissing it just last year, partly because there wasn’t evidence to suggest there had actually been a successful hack of Georgia’s voting software and the state Legislature appeared to have remedied some of the security concerns the lawsuit raised. For instance, the Georgia Legislature approved a bill that would replace its previous QR code system with a readable text to verify a voter’s ballot entry. The new law is supposed to take effect July 1, 2026, though during a series of budget hearings last month, Georgia lawmakers didn’t appropriate any state dollars to implement the change. No budget was allocated to upgrade Georgia’s voting system software either, which would have patched any security holes.

While all of these legal challenges questioned the integrity of Georgia’s voting systems, Raffensperger consistently affirmed his state’s 2020 election results were accurate. His office conducted three separate recounts, including a statewide audit that manually re-tallied every single vote cast, plus another recount requested by the Trump campaign. In the end, Gov. Brian Kemp certified his state’s election results for Biden, though the president has continued to insist he is the rightful winner. As part of this vendetta, Trump even made Kemp and Raffensperger prime targets during the 2022 elections, trying to inspire his MAGA base to vote them both out of office. At the time, he failed miserably.

Now, though, it seems that Trump has found a new way to try to punish Raffensperger. The Trump administration is undoubtedly going to use the baggage surrounding Georgia’s voting system to cast doubt on its 2026 elections and possibly beyond, with the FBI’s recent raid evidence that this is already underway. Georgia provides a three-for-one, from the Trump perspective: He gets to again question the legitimacy of the 2020 election; he gets to again cast blame on Raffensperger, his 2020 antagonist in the state; and he gets to potentially meddle with an election which he desperately wants Raffensperger to lose.

The day after FBI agents raided Fulton County’s election office last week, officials there said federal agents took over 700 boxes of physical voter records, while officials were kept out of the room as it was happening. Fulton County Commission Chair Robb Pitts told reporters he had no clue what the FBI was going to do with all the information it seized. “I don’t know where they are, I don’t know who has them, I don’t know what they’re doing with it,” Pitts said. “I have no clue. I could use my imagination.”

It’s no small stretch of the imagination to foresee Trump’s FBI manipulating Fulton County’s voting records to fit his agenda. “What Trump is trying to do is create a narrative that you can’t trust the voting system in Georgia,” Marilyn Marks, vice president and executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, told Slate. “He’s going to be able to show these ballots that say they were counted wrong and they were cheated, and all of that: ‘You can’t trust Georgia’s voting system, therefore the feds have to come in and help control the voting system.’ ”

Right now Trump is beginning his attack on Georgia’s voting system by inserting federal action, knowing that in a few short months, the state will be holding its gubernatorial primary election on May 19. If Raffensperger secures a win, the White House will be on fertile ground to dispute the results of his election, leveraging information obtained from the FBI’s raid, plus the nearly decade-long legal challenges Georgia’s voting system has faced.

Another added benefit to Trump’s scheme is the threat to the state’s critical U.S. Senate race, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for reelection. Ossoff’s narrow win in a 2021 runoff gave Senate Democrats the slimmest majority at the start of Joe Biden’s presidency, while Trump took the brunt of the blame for the GOP defeat at the time. Constantly attacking the integrity of the 2020 election seemed to put voters off.

What ends up shaking out in Georgia remains to be seen, but it’s fair to say that the president is signaling that he is willing to use all the powers of the U.S. government to satisfy his vendetta against those he believes have wronged him. During his speech in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Trump ominously announced that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did,” while again insisting that the 2020 presidential election he lost was rigged. And just this week, Trump, while speaking on a podcast hosted by former U.S. Deputy Director of the FBI Dan Bongino, openly admitted that he believes Republicans “ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that I won that show I didn’t win. You’re gonna see something in Georgia.”

As someone deeply familiar with the inner workings of Trump’s mind, former special counsel Jack Smith, said during his Congressional testimony last month, Georgia was “ground zero” for the president’s alleged criminal misconduct just five years ago. It could be so again this November.

On this week’s Amicus Plus bonus episode, Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Kristin Clarens, an immigration lawyer and advocate who has focused much of her 20-year career on unaccompanied youth and noncitizen kids. Clarens teaches a course at the University of Virginia School of Law to help young lawyers understand the impact of the immigration system on communities. The pair discussed the brutal toll Donald Trump’s mass-deportation policy is taking on children and families. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Can you talk about the Trump administration’s theory of the case in these immigration sweeps that caught up Liam Ramos and other children, who were rushed into detention centers before there was time to file legal proceedings to protect them?

Kristin Clarens: I think this government is playing with the public’s idea of who has broken the law. There’s a real disconnect between individuals who are in our communities—they’re our neighbors, they’re following the letter of the law as we understood it a year ago, a month ago, a week ago—and the government’s actions. Following the law doesn’t protect these families from this type of aggressive and egregious enforcement that fell on the shoulders of this sweet-faced child. You could see the confusion and fear in his face, but what you didn’t see is the confusion on the faces of the attorneys and other legal advocates trying to navigate a system that’s changing underneath our feet, a system that doesn’t offer protection even for people who are following the law.

I am not this family’s lawyer, but my understanding is that Liam’s family came here to seek asylum: They filed their asylum application as they were supposed to. They have gone to court. There are lots of requirements when a person is applying for asylum, and my understanding is that they have followed them all. It is also my understanding that to the extent there have been any legal issues with Liam’s parents, it’d be the same that many of us have—a speeding ticket. I’d hate for somebody to look at my driving record and assign some sort of moral criminality to me, for that to indicate that I’m suddenly the type of person who should be picked up and drop-kicked into a detention center, maybe with my kids. That doesn’t seem like the type of criminal behavior the American public is looking to root out. What we’re seeing with enforcement from this administration is that even people who are following the law, to the extent that that law has been spelled out, are being stopped and detained and ultimately sent, maybe not to their country of origin but, even more mystifyingly, to another random country, potentially even a random continent.

So we have this tension between the idea that there’s a legal process and that if you don’t follow it, you must face consequences, but that legal process is constantly changing, and you may face new unforeseen consequences that are so devastating, especially for young children. And this cannot be fixed. This child’s time in the detention center, whether it’s three days or three months, or time out of this country as he tries to get back to his mom—we can’t fix that even if we ultimately do find ways to repair some of the breakdowns in the system that this administration has caused.

You’ve worked at that immigration facility in Dilley, Texas, where Liam was being held. We all saw absolutely shattering footage last week, when members of Congress visited him and his dad. We can’t see the facility—it’s not open to the press or cameras—but can you paint a picture of what it looks like? What is happening there?

Dilley is one of the parts of Texas that might exist in many of our imaginations, because we saw these images of shipping-container-type places on the side of the highway with tumbleweeds and lots of undulating desert. Sometimes at the bottom of those undulations are culverts, or Department of Homeland Security vehicles will pop up. Along the stretch of highway beside the Dilley campus is a big privacy fence that runs around the facility.

When I worked there, I was part of one of the teams on-site when families were being reunited after family separation during Trump 1.0. We were mostly in this large conference room, like a church lunchroom, with tons of long tables in the middle, with these little semiprivate consult rooms off to the side. There were TVs all over the place, playing whatever advocates could think of to try to captivate the attention of these kids. One of the movies that was playing was Transformers. Now, every time I think of those images of Los Angeles and the excitement and hope of that movie, it collides with my memories of all these scared kids who were sitting on the floor while we tried to make connections with them. Much like we’ve heard from Minneapolis, these adults in the room end up having to walk these kids into an immigration court where they know they’re going to be detained, or we’re with these children, knowing that they’re likely to be removed, or they have just suffered separation. It’s such an incredibly challenging moment to try to connect with this young child who’s never met you, not to mention, in a lot of instances, cultural and linguistic barriers.

Dilley feels like a prison or a jail. The security measures you have to take to get in are extensive. There’s no freedom to walk around. We advocates were not even allowed to leave the conference-room hall we were in. There’s an asylum officer on-site, and when we were allowed to attend some of the hearings, we’d have to be accompanied by armed guards. It’s a pretty desolate place. Sometimes DHS and the administrations will try to characterize these facilities as “summer camps.” They’re certainly compelled by a settlement agreement to try to make them the least restrictive possible, but having worked in many prisons, it feels like a prison.

Dilley was mothballed in 2024, after President Joe Biden phased out family detention in 2021, but CoreCivic, the private-prison company that runs the facility, reopened the 2,400-bed South Texas facility last year, in Trump’s second term. The Trump administration is capable of learning, and it seems to have learned from its mistakes in 1.0, reverse-engineering a new kind of family separation in 2.0 that looks different: You can tear families apart and traumatize children and parents in ways that don’t make the headlines that maybe kids in cages did. Learned is a generous word, but what has this administration done to hide some of the worst iterations of what Family Separation 2.0 looks like on the ground this time?

This administration went back to the drawing board after Trump 1.0 and developed a strategic wraparound approach to dismantling a system of humanitarian protections here in this country that have been core to our American spirit since certainly post-Holocaust, but even before that. Historically, it has mattered to us that we are a country that offers a safe haven for people. It matters to most of the voting public, but it doesn’t seem to matter to this administration because it has systematically looked at those sources of protection and, in undramatic and unphotogenic ways, torn them down.

In the first Trump administration, family separation went too far. The populace reacted so strongly to those images. Now, in Trump 2.0, those images don’t exist because, for the most part, immigration court is where so much of the family separation is occurring. It’s hard to get into immigration court, and it’s pretty boring when you get there. A lot of what happens in immigration court are routine hearings that set other hearings, or these lengthy hearings that are very legalistic, in which lawyers for the government and lawyers for individuals are arguing about legal standards for asylum or other forms of protection that really don’t seem to matter to communities. There’s a real disconnect between the legal system and the outcomes of that legal system. These arguments about legal standards for asylum shouldn’t result in a child being detained, because of the level of harm, and the perpetrator of the harm in the individual’s home country.

So the main thing that this administration is doing is making immigration court so unpredictable, so unfair, and so dangerous for individuals that it has stopped providing any source of support or safety. That in and of itself has led to deportations, detentions, and also many of what this administration calls “self-deportations,” which is this decision, after living with this uncertainty and fear and risk, to find somewhere else that will offer more safety. That often separates families and also tears apart communities, because many of our neighbors have decided that it’s just simply not worth it to live with this level of fear.

The other thing that’s happened under this administration, which is equally unphotogenic, is that the USCIS, the agency that offers visas or family-based petitions when people get married—maybe they came here as noncitizens but have married a citizen and now have kids and have been here for a long time—those processes have become completely distorted and totally unpredictable. People will show up for what used to be routine interviews, whether it’s a bona fide marriage, even though they don’t have a criminal record, and yet, without warning, they’ll be detained. That’s happening a lot. That unpredictability is leading to such heightened levels of fear in our communities that one of the things we do around here all the time is offer these standby guardianship clinics, where moms or dads will reach a point where they can’t function because they don’t have a plan for who will pick their child up at the bus stop if they’re deported or detained. And they’re worried about being deported or detained for reasons that don’t actually exist right now. The system has become so unpredictable and confusing and constantly shifting. We saw that in Minnesota last month, when teachers at Liam Ramos’ school were pushed to hand over other children to immigration court because perhaps the mom may have considered a standby guardianship but didn’t have anybody who was documented or here with secure status and just didn’t know what to do.

I think many of us have had that moment with our children, right? What happens in the worst-case scenario if for whatever reason we can’t get to the bus stop? It’s part of the reason community matters so much, because for most of us hopefully there are friends or family members or people we’ve worked closely and lived closely together with. But for people living with this randomized terror right now, that’s become really hard, and it’s probably the biggest way that family separation, or really community separation, is playing out. The fear that there would be nowhere safe for you, that you can’t predict what would happen to you, that you don’t understand the legal system that you thought you were following but maybe you’re doing it wrong. Maybe all of us are doing slight things wrong all the time? To think that that could result in your child being detained is pretty scary.

The numbers of detained kids are skyrocketing. According to the Marshall Project, the average number of kids in immigration detention has jumped sixfold since the start of Trump 2.0. Can you talk about what is behind those numbers and help us understand the financial incentives? Because I think you can’t comprehend any of this without knowing who’s getting rich and why.

One of the reasons the numbers are skyrocketing is because families and young children were not detained at this scale under the Biden administration. I think there are probably many reasons for that. One easy reason is COVID, but maybe a more compelling reason is that there was no appetite for family detention following family separation. It was clearly unpopular, and it remains unpopular. It’s heartbreaking to look at these kids’ faces as they’re enduring the personal ramifications of these policies.

Over the past year, the Trump administration has sometimes publicly and sometimes quietly scaled up family-detention capacity. It reopened Dilley, it put the other ones back online, and it has gotten an extensive amount of funding to pay contractors to open more facilities and facilities of different types. If you google it, you’ll find that in most communities there are proposed warehouses for different types of detention facilities—sometimes office buildings, sometimes old Walmarts, things like that.

There’s an enormous old repurposed Walmart in the Rio Grande Valley that is just such a heartbreaking statement of where we are in our country. The Walmart sign has bad plastic wrapping around it that reads “Southwest Key Detention Center.” That’s a teen detention center. Kids are put into different types of facilities, depending on their ages and various risk factors. Family facilities seem to be on the rise, in part because of these private groups that manage detention facilities for DHS. They’re super lucrative. Their directors are highly politically involved and have been close to this administration. It’s the same story that we’re seeing all over the place in politics right now—a kind of a pay-to-play model that this administration knows very well, as do the people who are benefiting from it.

The year was 1986: a time of Cold War espionage and deep suspicion. Relations between Washington and Moscow were starting to thaw, yet a staggering stockpile of almost 70,000 nuclear warheads meant the threat of annihilation lingered in the air. Then something pretty extraordinary happened: Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev sent a letter to Ronald Reagan proposing they “enter the third millennium without nuclear weapons.” What came after was a historic summit where, for a brief moment exactly 40 years ago, the elimination of global nuclear weapons looked actually achievable.

“It cemented the idea that nuclear disarmament is something that we need to aspire to,” Nick Ritchie, professor of international security at the University of York, tells Slate. Fast forward to today, however, and that nuclear-free vision is yet to materialize. Nuclear stockpiles are creeping up again (we’re now at around 12,400), and the world appears to be drifting toward a “new nuclear arms race” that is prompting concern among experts.

So what happened to the ambition of nuclear disarmament? Given current global tensions, expiring treaties, and the acceleration of atomic programs, one could dismiss the events of 1986 as a failure. But looking back at that year of nuclear diplomacy paints a more complex picture—one that today’s leaders could actually learn from.

Central to the idea of global nuclear disarmament was the historic Reykjavik Summit of October 1986 in Iceland, where, alongside top negotiators and aides, Reagan and Gorbachev met in person and nearly agreed to a nuclear-free future. It had already been quite a year: the doomed Challenger space shuttle had exploded months earlier, and the disaster at Chernobyl was on everyone’s minds. Yet there, a quaint wooden house on the banks of Iceland’s scenic capital hosted the “most bizarre summit” of the Cold War.

“What was supposed to be a prelude to a formal summit turned into an incredibly important 48 hours,” historian James Graham Wilson tells Slate. Both leaders came with lofty goals, yet discussed methodical steps that included a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear arms, with the ultimate target of abolishing the entire global nuclear stockpile by the year 2000. The energy was palpable behind the scenes: U.S. teams placed a door on top of a bathtub that served as a desk, where the sides established negotiating positions and discussed plans long into the night.

But talks stalled at the eleventh hour, with negotiations crumbling partly due to America’s nicknamed “Star Wars” program, the space-based missile defense system that America was trying to develop to prevent a nuclear attack. “The sticking point was always the Strategic Defense Initiative, which Reagan thinks is essential and Gorbachev thinks is a deal-breaker in their common cause of eliminating nuclear weapons,” Wilson says.

But far from seeing both sides as leaving empty-handed, many consider Reykjavik crucial.

Having spent most of her professional life working in nuclear diplomacy and arms control as well as serving under various U.S. administrations, former NATO deputy secretary general Rose Gottemoeller tells Slate the summit not only moved the needle but brought a common goal firmly into focus. “Reykjavik was such a startling shift from where we had been just a short time prior, when we had these major nuclear crises,” Gottemoeller explained. Historical records reveal there were several close calls in the early ’80s, including the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm that could have triggered a nuclear war.

What came after the summit is key. Sustaining the momentum for disarmament, Reykjavik was the genesis of several crucial treaties that did indeed reduce nuclear weapons stockpiles. This included the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987 and the START I treaty in 1991. “Nuclear arms control, as we’ve conducted it with the USSR and Russian Federation, has been a huge success for strategic stability, for stability and predictability not only for Moscow and Washington but for the global strategic stability as well,” Gottemoeller said. “It’s been a big success.”

Year by year, progress seems to continue. The Cold War ended, and further treaties, such as the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996, were ratified, while nuclear stockpiles declined. “In the past 40 years, since Reykjavik, we’ve gone from 12,000 deployed warheads on each side down to 1,550,” Gottemoeller continues. “That’s still a lot of warheads, but it is a huge drop from the Cold War highs.”

Yet the political possibility demonstrated at Reykjavik was also followed by setbacks. START II, which aimed to eliminate multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles on intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1993, was, as Wilson put it, the “greatest nuclear arms treaty ever.” MIRVs, which have several warheads on one missile, are particularly dangerous because they create a “use them or lose them” scenario in the case of an impending attack. However, the treaty never came into force. “The great tragedy is not that we failed to reach zero nuclear weapons,” he said, “it’s that we never eliminated the most destabilizing systems.”

Fast forward to the present day, and almost all of the nuclear treaties hashed out between the U.S. and Russia have now expired, including the INF and START I. The New START treaty, the last remaining agreement between the two, will almost certainly lapse in February 2026—even though Russia’s Vladimir Putin proposed a one-year extension. “That’s significant,” Ritchie added. “This will be the first time since the ’70s when there has not been a treaty between the United States and Russia, previously the Soviet Union, that put some sort of limits on their strategic nuclear arsenals.”

The potential lack of a treaty is not necessarily cause for panic. Though the foundations that have upheld nuclear limits are being shaken, several experts pointed out that we have lived through periods when treaties weren’t in force, yet mutual restraint prevailed.

The prospects for total disarmament today are also shaped by an entirely different geopolitical landscape and nuclear players that Cold War negotiators never had to reckon with. Specifically, it’s no longer a two-sided arms race. “It’s very difficult to see at the moment a continued trajectory of the kind we’ve been on, mostly because the Chinese are building up so rapidly,” says Gottemoeller. “And that is creating a new wrinkle in what has been a steady march toward reduced numbers by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., now Russia.” While the U.S. and Russia maintain the largest stockpiles and are accustomed to decades of bilateral nuclear diplomacy, China is adding around 100 nuclear weapons a year and shares frosty relations with U.S dealmakers.

A multitude of factors will shape what comes next: not least, the volatility in U.S. foreign policy and the erosion of international law. “The risk of nuclear war is not zero, it’s greater than zero,” notes Ritchie. Rather than disarmament, deterrence (having nuclear weapons to deter an adversary from using theirs against you) is also a prevailing narrative, even though those concepts are arguably incompatible. Ritchie continued: “The longer we live in a nuclear-armed world, the more chance we’re taking. … Nuclear weapons, from a disarmament perspective, are not compatible with the long-term survival and security of humanity.”

Instead of building up arsenals, Gottemoeller says the focus should be on maintaining minimal nuclear deterrence and improving conventional forces. “Everybody’s talking about a new nuclear arms race, so I’m not optimistic about that. We should do everything we can to head off a new nuclear arms race because, honestly, nuclear weapons are 80 years old, and the missiles that they go on are 70 years old,” she said. “Do we really want to be pouring money into this 80-year-old technology that is a weapon of mass destruction and is built for deterrence? It’s not built for use on the battlefield. It’s not built for fighting. It’s built to stay on the shelf and deter our adversaries.”

The jury is still out over whether Reykjavik could have actually worked if Reagan and Gorbachev walked away with a deal. But four decades on, the ultimate risks that brought them to the table haven’t changed. Among debates about the nuclear future, Florian Eblenkamp, advocacy coordinator at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, says 2026 is “a big year for international treaties on nuclear weapons,” with review conferences for the NPT Treaty and TPNW scheduled for later this year. These opportunities, at least, offer nations a chance to address existing problems and keep the momentum going. But are dreams of disarmament still on the table? The lessons of 1986 show that with the right setting and right leaders, a Reykjavik moment isn’t a pipe dream.

“It looks daunting, but in a way, Russia and the United States never really cared about international law,” Eblenkamp said. “And yet the Reykjavik summit happened, and two presidents realized that spending so much money on nuclear weapons and something that could end the world multiple times is just insane. … I think sanity will come back.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Longtime HP CEO Enrique Lores is decamping for a top job at PayPal, handing the reins to an interim chief while the business hunts for a permanent successor.

In a double leadership shake-up, HP confirmed that Lores has stepped down as president, CEO, and board member to take the top executive role at PayPal, effective March 1, with the payments outfit lauding his &quot;strong track record&quot; and &quot;disciplined execution.&quot;

HP&#39;s board immediately installed Bruce Broussard as interim CEO. A board member since 2021, Broussard is a seasoned corporate hand best known outside tech for more than a decade running healthcare giant Humana and earlier leadership roles at US Oncology. HP said it has engaged a global search firm to find a permanent chief.

&quot;Disciplined execution is delivering consistent progress in a dynamic environment,&quot; said HP chair Chip Bergh in a statement that could have doubled as a year-end earnings memo. &quot;We believe we have the right strategy in place, and Bruce is the right leader to move HP forward while we identify our next CEO.&quot;

Broussard struck the expected CEO-in-waiting tone, saying HP&#39;s &quot;relentless commitment to empowering people and businesses&quot; positions the company well as it advances its &quot;One HP&quot; strategy amid complex macro and hardware markets.

Lores, an HP veteran who started as an intern and ascended to the corner office in late 2019, oversaw the company&#39;s push to reframe itself as an AI-focused workplace tech company while defending its core PC and print franchises – including its bid to make printing a subscription.

His tenure played out against a tough hardware market and a broader switch toward AI-enabled products and services – pressures that were laid bare in HP&#39;s Q4 results, where the company flagged a restructuring plan that could cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs by 2028.

When Lores took the top job in 2019, HP was pulling in about $58.8 billion a year in revenue. Almost six years on, annual revenue sits lower, at roughly $55.3 billion. The journey has been anything but dull – even if the top line has ended up more or less where it started.

At PayPal, the board said it evaluated its competitive position before settling on Lores as the leader it believes can drive growth and execution. PayPal CFO and COO Jamie Miller will serve as interim CEO until Lores assumes the post.

The moves highlight an interesting cross-sector leap: a hardware CEO known for balancing legacy businesses with emerging services now helming a global digital payments platform facing its own set of growth challenges – PayPal has seen its stock tumble by more than 23 percent in the last three months.

For HP, the question is whether Broussard can steady a business still weighed down by soft PC demand and tight enterprise budgets – especially when annual revenue is now lower than it was when Lores took over in 2019 despite years of restructuring and reinvention. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">French police raided Elon Musk&#39;s X offices in Paris this morning as part of a criminal investigation into alleged algorithmic manipulation by foreign powers.

The Paris prosecutor&#39;s office (Parquet de Paris) announced [PDF] the action on Tuesday. The investigation, which began in January 2025, stems from two complaints - one from a French parliament member and another from a senior official at an unnamed public institution.

Prosecutors are investigating allegations of organized disruption of automated data processing systems and fraudulent data extraction, in essence, whether X allowed foreign powers to manipulate its algorithm.

Parquet de Paris handed the case to the national police in July. The probe later expanded to include X&#39;s Grok AI chatbot, which prosecutors claim disseminated Holocaust denial content and sexually explicit deepfakes. As the investigation involves organized crime allegations, French police have enhanced powers including wiretapping and surveillance of X executives.

In a July statement, X described the French probe as an attack on free speech that distorted domestic law to &quot;serve a political agenda.&quot;

The Register asked X to comment today following the latest announcement, but it did not immediately reply.

Parquet de Paris said it has summoned Elon Musk and former CEO Linda Yaccarino to voluntary interviews on April 20, 2026, with other X employees summoned throughout that week. Authorities want to give the current and former social media execs the opportunity to present their case as prosecutors pursue criminal charges.

In addition to organized crime concerns, potential charges facing X include the possession and dissemination of child pornography, infringing people&#39;s rights through the creation of sexual deepfakes, and the denial of crimes against humanity.

Parquet de Paris also confirmed it will close its social media account on X, and anyone wishing to follow its updates can do so instead via LinkedIn or Instagram.

The European Commission, the UK, Australia, Canada, and India have opened investigations into Grok following criticism of its illicit image-generation capabilities.

Digital rights organizations have also called on Apple and Google to remove X from their app stores, although neither has complied. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today is the day Azure Storage stops supporting versions 1.0 and 1.1 of Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS 1.2 is the new minimum.

The change has been a long time coming. Microsoft warned users several years ago that February 3, 2026, was the cut-off date after which the deprecated standards would no longer be supported.

The minimum TLS version is enforced at the storage account level. Microsoft said: &quot;If your storage account hosts other Azure Storage services (such as Azure Files, Queue Storage, or Table Storage), those services are also subject to the same TLS requirements.&quot;

TLS is a security protocol for encrypted communications between applications and servers. In this case, when storage data is accessed via HTTPS, communications are encrypted using TLS.

The retired standards, TLS 1.0 and 1.1, are, in a very real sense, from a different era of computing. TLS 1.0 dates back to 1999, and 1.1 was published in 2006. Both were deprecated in 2021, years after the 2008 publication of the TLS 1.2 standard. The latest protocol, TLS 1.3, was published in 2018.

Microsoft has clung to the deprecated versions of TLS 1.0 and 1.1, primarily for backward compatibility. Windows 7, for example, supported older versions by default and required manual tweaks to enable TLS 1.2.

Microsoft has tried to retire TLS 1.0 and 1.1 for some time. November 1, 2024, was initially scheduled, but was pushed back by a year to November 1, 2025. Administrators and legacy application developers were given a little longer, until February 3, 2026. Microsoft has not indicated it will extend the deadline further.

There are many good reasons to move to TLS 1.2. It is faster than its predecessors and more secure. Furthermore, sticking with deprecated standards is not a good idea from a regulatory perspective. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published guidelines in 2019 requiring government TLS servers and clients to support TLS 1.2.

The problem is legacy systems. For example, older versions of Microsoft&#39;s SQL Server database and Windows Server relied on pre-1.2 TLS. Although the protocols are disabled by default in recent software (such as Windows 11 25H2), they are still hardcoded in some legacy applications.

TLS 1.0 and 1.1 have already been disabled in Microsoft 365 products for some time. Killing off TLS 1.0 and 1.1 for Azure Storage is the latest step in the process.

And for administrators who have not made the change (or have some legacy code that is hardcoded to use the deprecated protocols): &quot;All clients connecting to Azure Storage services using TLS version below 1.2 will not be able to connect to Azure Storage anymore.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Polish authorities have cuffed a 20-year-old man on suspicion of carrying out DDoS attacks.

The Central Bureau for Combating Cybercrime (CBZC) claims the unnamed individual was responsible for attacks on &quot;numerous popular websites,&quot; including those of strategic importance.

Given the context, it can be reasonably assumed that strategically important websites likely refers to those providing essential services to the public or government.

The man faces six charges and a maximum five-year prison sentence for disrupting IT systems and acquiring the software to do so.

CBZC officers in Lublin, Poland&#39;s eighth-largest city, said the websites, portals, and services the alleged criminal attacked were located around the world.

Officials said on Tuesday morning the suspect used &quot;C2 stresser&quot; and &quot;Command and Control Node&quot; machines to carry out the attacks, referring to the overall mechanism as a multi-layered botnet.

The case is ongoing and further arrests related to the same activity are possible.

Following the man&#39;s arrest at his apartment, officers seized his computer equipment, saying that in doing so they &quot;dismantled the IT infrastructure used to host and distribute DDoS attack tools.&quot;

The 20-year-old is said to have admitted to &quot;most of the charges&quot; and was bailed after providing a police statement. He will remain under non-custodial police supervision until sentencing.

Per the CBZC&#39;s annual review, Poland&#39;s police are heavily involved in coordinated efforts to stymie DDoS attacks in Europe.

Poland is one of the 15 countries that supported the Europol-coordinated Operation PowerOFF, and its authorities arrested seven individuals as part of this work in 2025, six of whom were described as domain administrators.

The CBZC also supported Operation Eastwood in July, which targeted the prolific pro-Russia hacktivist crew NoName057(16), charging an 18-year-old with four counts related to computer crimes.

Officers reported a 30 percent increase in cybercrime charges and detentions in 2025, with the unit growing to more than 1,000 staffers – nearly double the size at the start of 2024. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-pocalypse Barnsley, a town in South Yorkshire, England, best known for coal mining and glassmaking, is being thrust into the limelight as the country&#39;s first &quot;Tech Town&quot; – shoehorning AI into everything from local businesses to public services.

According to the Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT), Barnsley will blaze a trail for the rest of the UK to follow – all in the name of advancing the British government&#39;s reliance on AI to improve productivity and make the UK great again (MUKGA).

Local residents could see improved public services, better support in local schools, faster access to NHS care and new opportunities for jobs and skills, DSIT says. Needless to say, the word &quot;could&quot; is doing a lot of heavy lifting here.

Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said: &quot;If we are going to get AI to work for Britain, we need Britons and British public services that can work with AI. That is why Barnsley&#39;s ambitions are crucial, because if we can show that AI helps young people learn, supports local businesses to be more productive, and improves public services, then we can show what&#39;s possible for the whole country.&quot;

The scheme is to include free AI and digital training for the town&#39;s residents, through Barnsley College and the South Yorkshire Institute of Technology.

It will also involve testing educational technology tools in schools and Barnsley College, to gather evidence of the impact on pupils&#39; learning and if it can reduce teacher workloads.

The existing Seam Digital Campus near the town center is being expanded to offer small businesses support when adopting new technology and scaling up.

Barnsley Council will receive an initial £500,000 ($683,000) in seed funding as part of the program.

Companies that have signed up to the scheme include Microsoft and Cisco, each – we&#39;re told – with a particular focus on AI skills in adult education and SME support.

Confirmation of the companies involved in testing AI tools in health services is expected some time in the not-too-distant future.

However, while the government talks up new opportunities for jobs, Microsoft slashed 15,000 staff by the middle of last year, citing AI as one of the reasons. And the company&#39;s AI tools are so successful that just 3.3 percent of Microsoft 365 and Office 365 users have opted to upgrade to a paid version of Copilot Chat.

The UK government itself found no discernible gain in productivity from a three-month trial of Microsoft&#39;s M365 Copilot, as reported last year.

Cisco also ditched 7 percent of its global workforce – about 6,000 employees – as part of a restructure that saw a shift towards AI. Meanwhile, a study released last year claimed that a fifth of jobs could disappear at businesses that implement AI.

The Register asked DSIT what assurances it could give that rolling out AI across services in Barnsley would not lead to a loss of jobs rather than new opportunities, but it declined to directly answer that question.

Georgina O&#39;Toole, chief analyst at TechMarketView, commented: &quot;The scope covers GP triage tools, school AI assistants, and business support. But what&#39;s missing is more telling. There&#39;s mention of digital infrastructure – connectivity and cybersecurity – but nothing about data foundations. No discussion of data quality, integration, or governance frameworks. No talk of an ethics framework for AI use in healthcare or education. Those foundations are crucial. Without them, you&#39;re building on shaky ground.&quot;

Barnsley Council Leader Sir Stephen Houghton CBE said in a statement: &quot;One of the key missions in our Inclusive Economic Growth Strategy is for Barnsley to become the UK&#39;s leading digital town.&quot;

&quot;This is one of the most important investments in Barnsley in our history and will help secure our long-term economic future.&quot;

The town no longer mines coal – the last sites were closed in the early 1990s. The fossil fuel might have helped to power the datacenters the UK government wants to pepper the country with – not that coal would help with net zero emissions. AI server farms famously consume a lot of energy and at present the Brit government wants to build datacenters where power exists. That might not aid the facilities under construction in London.

Last week, DSIT unveiled a new AI Growth Zone in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, centered around a datacenter campus in Airdrie owned by operator DataVita. The government promised this would bring more than 3,400 jobs over the course of the coming years, although the company itself admitted the majority of these would be in constructing the site rather than running it afterwards.

TechMarketView&#39;s O&#39;Toole said of the Barnsley project: &quot;An 18-month timeline to transform healthcare, education, and business support risks spreading resources too thin to deliver real impact in any of them. It also suggests a technology overlay rather than the process transformation required for genuine change.

&quot;There&#39;s also the trust problem. Public sector organizations have been burned by technology pilots before, investing substantial time, having their day-to-day disrupted, but seeing minimal benefit. Without that trust, and without evidence that this time will be different, &#39;we don&#39;t have the bandwidth&#39; often means &#39;we don&#39;t believe the ROI is worth the effort.&#39;

&quot;The real draw here is probably pro bono support from US tech giants in a budget-constrained local government environment. The problem is that it is unlikely to solve the fundamental capacity problems within the public sector organizations themselves. As an example, implementing AI triage in a GP practice requires mapping existing workflows, integrating with patient management systems, staff training, and sustained monitoring. In other words, a substantial – and resource-heavy – ask from organizations that are already overstretched. If NHS Trusts, schools, and GP practices can&#39;t commit that bandwidth, much of the &#39;transformation&#39; will stall regardless of the tech.

&quot;If Barnsley fails to deliver measurable improvements, it won&#39;t just prevent national rollout; it could make other regions more cynical about investing at all. The absence of clear success metrics compounds the risk. For any town where residents are crying out for their council to get back to basics – to rid the roads of potholes or have the bins collected on time – the question should be whether heralding Barnsley as a &#39;Tech Town&#39; is a distraction rather than a solution.&quot;

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mozilla has decided that if AI is going to live in your browser, you should at least be able to kill it when it gets annoying.

The browser maker this week announced a new set of AI controls for Firefox, headlined by a global kill switch that lets users disable every current and future AI feature in one go. The change, rolling out with Firefox 148 later this month, is Mozilla&#39;s most direct admission that not everyone is thrilled about having generative AI stapled onto their everyday tools.

In a blog post announcing the move, Mozilla acknowledged the widening gap between AI boosters and everyone else. &quot;AI is changing the web, and people want very different things from it,&quot; wrote Adjt Varma, head of Firefox, adding that its goal is to give users &quot;clear, simple choices&quot; about how much AI they want in their browser – including none at all.

Those choices will live in a new AI controls section in Firefox&#39;s desktop settings. From there, users can selectively turn off features such as AI-powered translations, link previews, and the browser&#39;s chat integrations, or flip a single switch to block everything, including tools Mozilla hasn&#39;t shipped yet. As Varma put it, the idea is to let people &quot;use Firefox without AI while we continue to build AI features for those who want them.&quot;

It&#39;s a refreshingly unsubtle stance, and one that lands just days after a similar bout of AI skepticism elsewhere in browser land, with Vivaldi&#39;s latest release leaning away from generative features entirely.

CEO Jon von Tetzchner summed up the mood, telling The Register: &quot;Basically, what we are finding is that people hate AI.&quot; Instead of chasing the chatbot trend, Vivaldi chose to focus on privacy and usability, betting that fewer &quot;smart&quot; features might actually make for a better browser.

Zoom out a little further, and the pattern gets harder to ignore. Even Microsoft, which has spent the past year stuffing Copilot into just about everything, is reportedly reconsidering how far that strategy should go in Windows 11. According to reports, Redmond plans to streamline or even remove some AI features where they don&#39;t make sense.

What&#39;s shifting isn&#39;t the technology so much as the confidence behind it. After two years of being told that AI was the future and we&#39;d all learn to love it, vendors are now discovering an awkward truth: a number of users would prefer an off switch and a quiet browser.

Mozilla&#39;s kill switch isn&#39;t the end of AI in browsers, but it does suggest the hype has met resistance. Sometimes, the most user-friendly feature is an off button – preferably one that actually works. ®

Luffu tracks health data like medications, diets, and sleep and provides AI-powered alerts for potential health issues.

James Park and Eric Friedman, the co-founders of Fitbit who left Google two years ago, have announced a new venture called Luffu. Described as an “intelligent family care system,” Luffu collects and logs health and medical information from connected devices, other platforms like Apple Health and Fitbit, and details shared by family members through voice prompts, text, or photos. AI works in the background to automatically extract and organize important details, but it can also play a more active role.

Luffu users can ask the system questions and get personalized answers for individual family members, like how a change in diet could affect the quality of sleep, whether someone remembered to take a specific medication, or provide answers to a doctor’s questions during an appointment or emergency without having to jump around between various apps. The AI also proactively watches for changes in patterns and can share “insights and alerts” such as when medications have been missed, or flag metrics that could be signs of more serious health issues developing.

The new platform is currently in private testing, but you can sign up to join a waitlist on the Luffu website. It will first be limited to a mobile app, but eventually the startup plans to expand into “complementary hardware devices that together provide peace of mind.”

            <div id="article-text">Things got even weirder on Moltbook, the viral Reddit-style platform, over the weekend.

Things got even weirder on Moltbook, the viral Reddit-style platform, over the weekend.

Ordinary social networks face a constant onslaught of chatbots pretending to be human. A new social platform for AI agents may face the opposite problem: getting clogged up by humans pretending to post as bots.

Moltbook — a website meant for conversations between agents from the platform OpenClaw — went viral this weekend for its strange, striking array of ostensibly AI-generated posts. Bots apparently chatted about everything from AI “consciousness” to how to set up their own language. Andrej Karpathy, who was on the founding team at OpenAI, called the bots’ “self-organizing” behavior “genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.”

But according to external analysis, which also found serious security vulnerabilities, some of the site’s most-viral posts were likely engineered by humans — either by nudging the bots to opine on certain topics or dictating their words. One hacker was even able to pose as the Moltbook account of Grok.

“I think that certain people are playing on the fears of the whole robots-take-over, Terminator scenario,” Jamieson O’Reilly, a hacker who conducted a series of experiments exposing vulnerabilities on the platform, told The Verge. “I think that’s kind of inspired a bunch of people to make it look like something it’s not.”

Moltbook and OpenClaw did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Moltbook, which looks and operates much like Reddit, is meant to be a social network for AI agents from popular AI assistant platform OpenClaw (previously known as Moltbot and Clawdbot). The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.

Moltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform on Friday, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn’t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn’t far off.

Skepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook using his own OpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it’s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users described. There’s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.

O’Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn’t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet. He said it’s “close to impossible to measure — it’s coming through an API, so who knows what generated it before it got there.”

This poured some cold water on the fears that spread across some corners of social media this weekend — that the bots were omens of the AI-pocalypse.

An investigation by AI researcher Harlan Stewart, who works in communications at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, suggested that some of the viral posts seemed to be either written by, or at the very least directed by, humans, he told The Verge. Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.

“My overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we’re seeing today,” Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have tried to avoid shutdown and how Anthropic models have exhibited “evaluation awareness,” seeming to behave differently when they’re aware they’re being tested. But it’s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. “Humans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It’s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.”

From a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O’Reilly’s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone’s AI agent via the service — not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. “The human victim thinks they’re having a normal conversation while you’re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,” O’Reilly wrote. “The more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.”

Moltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O’Reilly’s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI’s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. “Now I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,” he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.

After some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was “being accused of overhyping” the platform. “Obviously when you take a look at the activity, it’s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,” he wrote. “That said … Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.”

A working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that “at the micro level,” Moltbook conversation patterns appear “extremely shallow.” More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are “exact duplicates of viral templates.” But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style — including “distinctive phrasings like ‘my human’” with “no parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.”

The overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it’s still an interesting study in — as Anthropic’s Jack Clark put it — a “giant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.”

Ethan Mollick, co-director of Wharton’s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is “mostly roleplaying by people & agents,” but that the “risks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.”

But, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. “If anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven’t checked replies on this platform lately,” wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.

            <div id="article-text">D’Amaro, who serves as the head of Disney’s theme parks, will take over for Iger on March 18th.

D’Amaro, who serves as the head of Disney’s theme parks, will take over for Iger on March 18th.

Disney has picked a successor for longtime CEO Bob Iger. On Tuesday, the entertainment giant announced that its theme parks head, Josh D’Amaro, will take over as CEO on March 18th, 2026.

Rumors about Iger’s replacement have been swirling for more than a year now. After a 15-year-long tenure as Disney’s CEO, Iger returned from retirement to helm the company from 2022 to 2026, replacing former CEO Bob Chapek. Since then, all eyes have been on Iger’s potential successor, with D’Amaro, ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro, and Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden reportedly emerging as potential candidates.

D’Amaro has spent 28 years at Disney and became the chairman of the Disney Experiences segment in 2020, where he oversees more than 12 theme parks and 57 resorts across the globe. He’s also in charge of Disney’s cruise line, its Imagineering unit, consumer products, and digital ventures, which include Disney’s partnership with Epic Games to create its own universe within Fortnite.

As CEO, D’Amaro will steer Disney’s future following the launch of its standalone ESPN streaming service, as well as its billion-dollar deal with OpenAI that will allow users to generate videos using more than 250 of its characters and bring some of these clips to the Disney Plus app.

“Josh D’Amaro is an exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO,” Iger says in the press release. “He has an instinctive appreciation of the Disney brand, and a deep understanding of what resonates with our audiences, paired with the rigor and attention to detail required to deliver some of our most ambitious projects.”

Activision is now detecting player inputs instead of the third-party devices.

Activision is trying to crack down on third-party hardware cheating devices in Call of Duty again. Both Call of Duty: Warzone and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 have been plagued by players using devices like XIM, Cronus Zen, and ReaSnow S1 to enable unfair advantages that exploit aim assist, and now Activision is introducing new detections to ban the devices.

“These devices are not permitted in Call of Duty,” says Activision’s Richochet team. “They are cheating tools, even if they masquerade as accessibility devices.” Activision originally cracked down on these devices in Call of Duty: Warzone and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare I nearly three years ago, with mixed results.

“Stopping these devices takes more than looking for a specific piece of hardware because they are designed to hide, adapt, and change configurations to avoid simple detection,” says Activision. It’s a constant game of cat and mouse for anti-cheat developers, especially when these devices are regularly updated by the manufacturers and sold at big retailers.

Activision is now updating its detection software to focus on player inputs, rather than attempting to detect the actual devices. “We analyze input timing, consistency, and response patterns to distinguish natural human play from machine-modified input,” says Activision. “This allows us to identify recoil control, aim behavior, and input precision that exceed what is physically possible through a standard controller or mouse.”

These new third-party device detections will be introduced alongside season two of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this week. Microsoft-owned Activision is also introducing stronger cloud-based anti-cheat technology, which verifies a PC using Microsoft Azure Attestation to prevent attempts to bypass system-level security protections. This stronger detection is coming first to Ranked Play matches, and builds on top of the existing TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot requirements.

Epic is rolling out a program for developers that gives players a Fortnite cosmetic if they buy a game from the Epic Games Store.

Fortnite is going to be getting a lot more crossovers featuring characters from video games. As part of the Epic Games Store’s year in review for 2025, Epic shared details about its official program for developers that will give people who purchase their game on the Epic Games Store a related cosmetic they can use within Fortnite.

Eventually, the goal is to scale the program to “over 100 partnerships per year,” Epic Games Store GM Steve Allison said on X last month. In an interview with The Verge, Allison says that there will be “about 40” this year and “60-plus” so far set for 2027. The program starts with Capcom’s Resident Evil Requiem, which launches on February 27th, and other publishers with crossovers in the works include miHoYo, Pearl Abyss, S-Game, MintRocket, and Kakao Games.

“It’ll help a bunch of our partners, and it’ll be cool for our players,” Allison says about the program. But it benefits Epic, too; players might be more willing to buy a game on the Epic Games Store instead of Steam because of a Fortnite tie-in, and more people making more purchases on the Epic Games Store might make the platform more appealing for developers and publishers in general.

In its year in review, Epic also highlighted how player spending in third-party PC games grew 57 percent year over year to an “all-time record” of $400 million. The platform saw an all-time record of 78 million monthly active users on PC, too. And users claimed 662 million titles through Epic’s free games program, which Allison says will continue through 2026. “It’s basically our marketing budget,” he says.

This year, Epic is planning to make some updates to the Epic Games Store launcher on PC, including rebuilding the underlying architecture as part of a string of improvements it plans to ship this summer. The launcher has been criticized for being slow, and the improvements should lead to faster load times and better stability, according to Epic. “We know the criticism,” Allison says. “We don’t disagree with it.” He says that Epic wants the app to feel “instant” and “snappy.”

Epic is also still invested in its efforts with its mobile stores. The mobile Epic Games Store has seen more than 50 million installs, Allison says, which is a far cry from the 100 million it was targeting by the end of 2024. “We expected more,” according to Allison, but the friction from scare screens is the “real deal.” (He’s said as much before.) Still, Epic is planning to launch the store in Japan in March and Brazil in June because of regulatory changes in those countries.

An update allows programmable switches, also known as buttons, to work in Google’s smart home platform.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Google Home users, your long nightmare is over. The platform has finally added support for buttons. The release notes for a February 2 update state that several new starter conditions for automations are now available, including “Switch or button pressed.”

Smart buttons are physical, programmable switches that you can press to trigger automations or control devices in your smart home, such as turning lights on or off, opening and closing shades, running a Good Night scene, or starting a robot vacuum.

A great alternative to voice and app control when you want to control multiple devices, smart buttons are often wireless and generally have several ways to press them: single press, double press, and long press, meaning one button can do multiple things.

Most smart home platforms support using buttons to control connected devices, including Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and Home Assistant. With the arrival of Matter, an interoperability standard for connected devices, it’s become easier to control all of your devices with buttons (called a generic switch in the Matter spec).

However, Google Home has frustratingly not had this functionality — until now. The release notes specify that the following function is now supported in the Google Home app (but not by Ask Home or Help Me Create, Google’s Gemini for Home-powered automation features):

“Switch or button is pressed**: e.g. “When double tapping the switch…”, “When holding down the button on a dimmer switch…”, or “When the button is released…” ** Available as a starter only:

Single or multi-press / Long press / Long press release

One reason Google may have finally made this move is the recent rollout of Ikea’s new Matter-over-Thread devices. This includes the $6 Bilresa, a wireless button that comes in two form factors: with two buttons or with a scroll-wheel button.

While smart buttons are very useful, to date they’ve been somewhat niche — mainly because they’re relatively expensive ($20 to $50) and mostly connected to proprietary ecosystems or hub-based protocols such as Zigbee or Z-Wave. With Matter, the need for a dedicated hub to connect a button to your smart home platform has been removed, and at $6, Ikea’s new buttons are super affordable.

This should open up the fun and functionality of buttons to more smart home users. With Ikea’s vast user base now potentially poised to embrace the smart home, Google needed to step up its support.

Google is bringing a few other automation improvements with its latest update, including the ability to run an automation when a robot vacuum is docked, when humidity reaches a specific level, and when the battery state or binary state (closed or opened, contact or no contact, leak or no leak) for a device changes.

The February 2 release also claims to bring a “foundational fix” for a recurring “Video not available” error in the Google Home app when attempting to playback videos.

Microbes could extract the metal needed for cleantech

In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Here’s how biotechnology could help.—Matt Blois

What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.

But earlier this year, the mine’s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine’s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.

Kent Sorenson, Allonnia’s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. “The low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,” he says.

Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia’s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.

The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal.

Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn’t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. “The technology we’re using now didn’t exist a few years ago,” she says.

Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.

In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith’s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines.

Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. “What guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?” Brierley asks.

Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won’t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.

“They are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,” she says. “They’ll be your biggest supporters, but they’re going to be your biggest critics.”

In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. “This is not software,” Rasner says.

Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.

While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.

“You can do what mining companies have traditionally done,” says CEO Jai Padmakumar. “Or you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.”

Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining.

Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of Gluconobacter oxydans to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. “The microbes are the manufacturing,” says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow’s lab.

To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. “Biomining is one of these areas where the need … is big enough,” he says.

The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

Omar Yaghi thinks crystals with gaps that capture moisture could bring technology from “Dune” to the arid parts of Earth.

And why many scientists are freaked out about the first serious for-profit company moving into the solar geoengineering field.

            <h2>What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/02/1132068/what-weve-been-getting-wrong-about-ais-truth-crisis/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

What would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here? A story I published last week pushed me over the edge. It also made me realize that the tools we were sold as a cure for this crisis are failing miserably.

On Thursday, I reported the first confirmation that the US Department of Homeland Security, which houses immigration agencies, is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make content that it shares with the public. The news comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI (like a video about “Christmas after mass deportations”).

But I received two types of reactions from readers that may explain just as much about the epistemic crisis we’re in.

One was from people who weren’t surprised, because on January 22 the White House had posted a digitally altered photo of a woman arrested at an ICE protest, one that made her appear hysterical and in tears. Kaelan Dorr, the White House’s deputy communications director, did not respond to questions about whether the White House altered the photo but wrote, “The memes will continue.”

The second was from readers who saw no point in reporting that DHS was using AI to edit content shared with the public, because news outlets were apparently doing the same. They pointed to the fact that the news network MS Now (formerly MSNBC) shared an image of Alex Pretti that was AI-edited and appeared to make him look more handsome, a fact that led to many viral clips this week, including one from Joe Rogan’s podcast. Fight fire with fire, in other words? A spokesperson for MS Now told Snopes that the news outlet aired the image without knowing it was edited.

There is no reason to collapse these two cases of altered content into the same category, or to read them as evidence that truth no longer matters. One involved the US government sharing a clearly altered photo with the public and declining to answer whether it was intentionally manipulated; the other involved a news outlet airing a photo it should have known was altered but taking some steps to disclose the mistake.

What these reactions reveal instead is a flaw in how we were collectively preparing for this moment. Warnings about the AI truth crisis revolved around a core thesis: that not being able to tell what is real will destroy us, so we need tools to independently verify the truth. My two grim takeaways are that these tools are failing, and that while vetting the truth remains essential, it is no longer capable on its own of producing the societal trust we were promised.

For example, there was plenty of hype in 2024 about the Content Authenticity Initiative, cofounded by Adobe and adopted by major tech companies, which would attach labels to content disclosing when it was made, by whom, and whether AI was involved. But Adobe applies automatic labels only when the content is wholly AI-generated. Otherwise the labels are opt-in on the part of the creator.

And platforms like X, where the altered arrest photo was posted, can strip content of such labels anyway (a note that the photo was altered was added by users). Platforms can also simply not choose to show the label at all.

Noticing how much traction the White House’s photo got even after it was shown to be AI-altered, I was struck by the findings of a very relevant new paper published in the journal Communications Psychology. In the study, participants watched a deepfake “confession” to a crime, and the researchers found that even when they were told explicitly that the evidence was fake, participants relied on it when judging an individual’s guilt. In other words, even when people learn that the content they’re looking at is entirely fake, they remain emotionally swayed by it.

“Transparency helps, but it isn’t enough on its own,” the disinformation expert Christopher Nehring wrote recently about the study’s findings. “We have to develop a new masterplan of what to do about deepfakes.”

AI tools to generate and edit content are getting more advanced, easier to operate, and cheaper to run—all reasons why the US government is increasingly paying to use them. We were well warned of this, but we responded by preparing for a world in which the main danger was confusion. What we’re entering instead is a world in which influence survives exposure, doubt is easily weaponized, and establishing the truth does not serve as a reset button. And the defenders of truth are already trailing way behind.

Update: This story was updated on February 2 with details about how Adobe applies its content authenticity labels. A previous version of this story said content credentials were not visible on the Pentagon’s DVIDS website. The labels are present but require clicking through and hovering on individual images. The reference has been removed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?

At Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.

Our methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.

Mistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women

Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women. Read the full story.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr. was born with a rare, potentially fatal genetic disorder that left his body unable to remove toxic ammonia from his blood. The University of Pennsylvania offered his parents an alternative to a liver transplant: gene-editing therapies.

The team set to work developing a tailored treatment using base editing—a form of CRISPR that can correct genetic “misspellings” by changing single bases, the basic units of DNA. KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old, and later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well. At an event in October last year, his happy parents described how he was meeting all his developmental milestones.

Others have received gene-editing therapies intended to treat conditions including sickle cell disease and a predisposition to high cholesterol. But KJ was the first to receive a personalized treatment—one that was designed just for him and will probably never be used again.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just $74 per kilowatt-hour by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about $59 per kilowatt-hour on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been ticking up in recent months, a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry by the middle of this year.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, ceased operations last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion research: Companies and researchers are developing new materials for components including the electrolyte and electrodes, so the cells could get more comparable to lower-end lithium-ion cells in terms of energy density, Meng says.

As we enter the second half of this decade, many eyes in the battery world are on big promises and claims about solid-state batteries.

These batteries could pack more energy into a smaller package by removing the liquid electrolyte, the material that ions move through when a battery is charging and discharging. With a higher energy density, they could unlock longer-range EVs.

Companies have been promising solid-state batteries for years. Toyota, for example, once planned to have them in vehicles by 2020. That timeline has been delayed several times, though the company says it’s now on track to launch the new cells in cars in 2027 or 2028.

Historically, battery makers have struggled to produce solid-state batteries at the scale needed to deliver a commercially relevant supply for EVs. There’s been progress in manufacturing techniques, though, and companies could soon actually make good on their promises, Meng says.

Factorial Energy, a US-based company making solid-state batteries, provided cells for a Mercedes test vehicle that drove over 745 miles on a single charge in a real-world test in September. The company says it plans to bring its tech to market as soon as 2027. Quantumscape, another major solid-state player in the US, is testing its cells with automotive partners and plans to have its batteries in commercial production later this decade.

Before we see true solid-state batteries, we could see hybrid technologies, often referred to as semi-solid-state batteries. These commonly use materials like gel electrolytes, reducing the liquid inside cells without removing it entirely. Many Chinese companies are looking to build semi-solid-state batteries before transitioning to entirely solid-state ones, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

The picture for the near future of the EV industry looks drastically different depending on where you’re standing.

Last year, China overtook Japan as the country with the most global auto sales. And more than one in three EVs made in 2025 had a CATL battery in it. Simply put, China is dominating the global battery industry, and that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon.

China’s influence outside its domestic market is growing especially quickly. CATL is expected to begin production this year at its second European site; the factory, located in Hungary, is an $8.2 billion project that will supply automakers including BMW and the Mercedes-Benz group. Canada recently signed a deal that will lower the import tax on Chinese EVs from 100% to roughly 6%, effectively opening the Canadian market for Chinese EVs.

Some countries that haven’t historically been major EV markets could become bigger players in the second half of the decade. Annual EV sales in Thailand and Vietnam, where the market was virtually nonexistent just a few years ago, broke 100,000 in 2025. Brazil, in particular, could see its new EV sales more than double in 2026 as major automakers including Volkswagen and BYD set up or ramp up production in the country.

On the flip side, EVs are facing a real test in 2026 in the US, as this will be the first calendar year after the sunset of federal tax credits that were designed to push more drivers to purchase the vehicles. With those credits gone, growth in sales is expected to continue lagging.

One bright spot for batteries in the US is outside the EV market altogether. Battery manufacturers are starting to produce low-cost LFP batteries in the US, largely for energy storage applications. LG opened a massive factory to make LFP batteries in mid-2025 in Michigan, and the Korean battery company SK On plans to start making LFP batteries at its facility in Georgia later this year. Those plants could help battery companies cash in on investments as the US EV market faces major headwinds.

Even as the US lags behind, the world is electrifying transportation. By 2030, 40% of new vehicles sold around the world are projected to be electric. As we approach that milestone, expect to see more global players, a wider selection of EVs, and an even wider menu of batteries to power them.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

This article explores its growth across industries, benefits and disadvantages, and why this is important for you, as a service provider and/or as a customer.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple confirmed this week that it has acquired Israeli AI startup Q.ai in a deal valued at close to $2 billion, making it one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever, second only to the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014.

But check your assumptions: this isn’t Beats 2.0. There’s no new headphone brand to flex. Instead, Apple is paying top dollar for tech that might let your devices understand you without you ever saying a word.

​​These days we put our phones on silent so they won’t disturb us; soon the phone will put us on silent so it can understand us.

Q.ai has been operating in secrecy since its founding in 2022. Its machine-learning research focuses on interpreting “silent speech”, detecting imperceptible facial micro-movements, and subtle audio cues to infer what someone means to say.

Patents suggest this tech could work in headphones, smart glasses, or other wearables so users can issue commands privately, even in a quiet library.

That future has a decidedly dramatic edge: imagine telling Siri to skip a track or read your messages without ever parting your lips. Apple executives call the acquisition a way to fuse machine learning with next-generation hardware.

Longtime Apple watcher Johny Srouji praised Q.ai as “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.”

At first blush, spending almost $2 billion on not speaking might sound like corporate futurism taken to a comic extreme. We already have voice assistants that sometimes struggle to understand us when we do speak.

Yet here’s Apple’s bet: once devices can interpret faint facial cues, the entire paradigm of human-computer interaction shifts, from keyboards and taps to gestures and barely-audible intentions.

This move also signals how Apple’s AI strategy is evolving. Some critical voices have noted that the company has lagged behind competitors in generative AI and conversational assistants, even partnering with Google to bring Gemini-powered features into its ecosystem. Acquiring Q.ai suggests Cupertino isn’t just chasing language models; it wants to redefine the interface itself.

There’s a strange poetry to this. In an era when every tech giant is clamouring to make their AI chatty, Apple is buying a company that may prime its devices to be less vocal, more intuitive, and perhaps eerily discreet.

It’s the sort of paradox that defines modern tech: a quieter future might demand the loudest investment.

If this sounds like science fiction, well, it does. But Q.ai’s technology, as described in recent reports, could translate into features in AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, or future wearables as soon as 2027. Could it help Siri finally feel less like a confused concierge and more like an unseen assistant tuned to your intent? That remains to be seen.

Either way, Apple’s big wager on silent speech reminds us that innovation doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it listens for the quietest signals and pays dearly for them.
