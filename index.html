            <h2>The Splay is a subpar monitor but an exciting portable projector</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/the-splay-is-a-subpar-monitor-but-an-exciting-portable-projector/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since I’m fascinated by new display technologies and by improving image quality, I’ve never been a fan of home projectors. Projectors lack the image quality compared to good TVs and monitors, and they’re pretty needy. Without getting into the specific requirements of different models, you generally want a darker room with a large, blank wall for a projector to look its best. That can be a lot to ask for, especially in small, densely decorated homes like mine.

That said, a projector can be a space-efficient alternative to a big-screen TV or help you watch TV or movies outside. A projector can be versatile when paired with the right space, especially if that projector makes sure the “right space” is included in the device.

The Splay was crowdfunded in 2021, and its maker, Arovia, describes it as the “first fully collapsible monitor and projector.” In short, it’s a portable projector with an integrated fabric shroud that can serve as a big-screen (24.5 or 34.5 inches diagonally, depending on the model) portable monitor. Or, you can take off the fabric shroud and use the Splay as an ultra-short-throw projector and cast a display that measures up to 80 inches diagonally onto a wall.

At its core, the Splay is a projector, meaning it can’t compete with high-end LCD-LED or OLED monitors. It costs $1,300; the device is currently sold out, but an Arovia representative told me that it will be restocked this month.

Here’s how the device works, per one of Arovia’s patents

The … collapsible, portable display device, has a housing member having a sliding member aligned on the exterior of the housing member, and sliding along the exterior of said housing member between two operating positions, a collapsible screen containing one or more sheets of flexible, wrinkle resistant silicone or rubber materials containing optical enhancing components and capable of displaying an image when in an expanded operating position, and multiple collapsible members connected to said screen …

Arovia’s representative pointed to the Splay being used for mobile workspaces, gaming, and enterprise use cases, like trade shows.

Because it uses lightweight and springy fabric materials and bendable arms, the whole gadget can be folded into an included case that’s 4×4 inches and weighs 2.5 pounds. Once extended to its max size, the device is a bit unwieldy; I had to be mindful to avoid poking or tearing the fabric when I set up the device.

Still, it can be rather advantageous to access such large display options from something as portable as the collapsed Splay.

The Splay isn’t what people typically picture when thinking of a “portable monitor.” It connects to PCs, iOS and Android devices, and gaming consoles via HDMI (or an HDMI adapter) and is chargeable via USB-C, so you can use it without a wall charger. But this isn’t the type of display you would set up at a coffee shop or even in a small home office.

Compared to a traditional portable monitor, the Splay is bulky. That’s partly because the display is bigger than a typical portable monitor (around 14 inches). Most of the bulk, however, comes from how much the back of the “monitor” protrudes (about 19 to 21 inches from the front of the display).

When extended, the device is mostly fabric, but its control center, where there is a power button, sharpness adjuster, and controls for brightness, and the integrated speakers go back pretty far (about 6.25 inches) even before you insert an HDMI or USB-C cable.

You will also want to use the Splay with a tripod (a small, tabletop one’s included) so that it’s at a proper height and you can swivel and tilt the display.

That all makes the Splay cumbersome to find space for and, once opened, to transport. Once I set it up, I wasn’t eager to pack it away or to bring it to another room.

Still, the Splay is a novel attempt at bringing a monitor-sized display to more areas. Despite its bulky maximum size, it weighs little and doesn’t have to be plugged into a wall.

Splay claims the monitor has a max brightness of 760 nits. When I used the display in a well-lit room or in a sunny room, it still looked sufficiently bright, even when perpendicular to a window. All colors were somewhat washed out compared to how they appear on my computer monitor but were still acceptable for a secondary display. If I look closely enough, though, I can see the subtle texture of the fabric in the image.

The Splay struggles mightily with text. It’s not sharp enough, so trying to read more than a couple of sentences on the Splay was a strain. This could be due to the projector technology, as well as the lower pixel density. With a display resolution equivalent to 1920×1080, the 24.5-inch “portable monitor” has a pixel density of 89.9 pixels per inch.

Considering there are portable monitors that are in the 24-inch size range and easier to set up, it’s hard to see a reason to opt for a Splay—unless you also want a projector.

To use the Splay as a projector, you have to unzip the fabric shroud and pull the device out of its four-armed holster. Once set up, the Splay works as an ultra-short-throw pico projector with automatic keystone projection, which helps ensure that the display looks like a rectangle instead of a trapezoid or parallelogram.

Arovia claims the projector can reach up to 285 lumens and display an image that measures up to 80 inches diagonally.

Now, we start to see the Splay’s value. Unlike other projectors, the Splay remains useful in tight, crowded spaces. Not only does the Splay wrap up neatly for transport, but the integrated screen means you never have to worry about whether you’ll have the right space for the projector to work properly.

There’s always a need for portable displays, and different use cases warrant exploring new approaches and form factors. While there are simpler 24-inch portable monitors with better image quality, the Splay brings remarkable portability and independence to portable projectors.

The Splay is niche and expensive, which is probably why the product’s website currently focuses on more B2B applications, like sports coaches and analysts using it to review footage and data. Similar to the big-screen tablets on wheels that more companies have been making lately, for now, the Splay will probably find the most relevance among businesses or public sector entities.

However, I’m inclined to think about how the Splay’s unique properties could apply to personal projectors. The Splay is a subpar “portable monitor,” but its duality makes it a more valuable projector. There are still too many obstacles preventing me from regularly using a projector, but the Splay has at least shown me that projectors can pack more than I expected.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/in-a-surprise-announcement-tory-bruno-is-out-as-ceo-of-united-launch-alliance/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tory Bruno, a veteran engineer and aerospace industry executive, has resigned from the top job at United Launch Alliance after more than a decade competing against the growing dominance of SpaceX, the company announced Monday.

The news of Bruno’s sudden resignation was unexpected. His tenure was marked by a decline in ULA’s market share as rival SpaceX competed for and won ever-larger US government launch contracts. More recently, Bruno oversaw the successful debut of ULA’s Vulcan rocket, followed by struggles to ramp up the new rocket’s launch cadence.

Bruno had a 30-year career as an engineer and general manager for Lockheed Martin’s ballistic missile programs before taking over as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance in August 2014. He arrived as SpaceX started making inroads with its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket, and ULA’s leading position in the US launch market looked to be in doubt.

In his first year, Bruno announced what would become the Vulcan rocket and the phaseout of ULA’s legacy Atlas and Delta launch vehicles. He also selected Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, then an emerging space company, to build the Vulcan rocket’s booster engines, bypassing the industry’s established propulsion contractor.

The decision to develop a new rocket and the selection of the engine to power it proved to be correct. The Atlas V rocket, now nearing retirement, is powered by Russian engines, a nonstarter in today’s geopolitical reality, and the already-retired Delta IV launch vehicle was prohibitively expensive. The Vulcan rocket has been successful in all three of its flights so far, and the performance of Blue Origin’s liquid-fueled BE-4 engine has, by all accounts, been exceptional.

But ULA’s potential for regaining its position atop the launch market was hamstrung by the company’s decision to make the Vulcan rocket fully expendable. There are long-term plans to recover and reuse the rocket’s main engines, but not the entire booster. And the new rocket’s entry into service has not been smooth. The Vulcan rocket flew just once this year after receiving certification from the US Space Force to carry national security satellites into orbit, well short of Bruno’s goal of flying the new launcher up to 10 times.

The retirement of the Atlas V and Delta IV led to a period of downsizing for United Launch Alliance, with layoffs and facility closures in Florida, California, Alabama, Colorado, and Texas. In a further sign of ULA’s troubles, SpaceX won a majority of US military launch contracts for the first time last year.

Bruno, 64, served as a genial public face for ULA amid the company’s difficult times. He routinely engaged with space enthusiasts on social media, fielded questions from reporters, and even started a podcast. Bruno’s friendly and accessible demeanor was unusual among industry leaders, especially those with ties to large legacy defense contractors.

ULA is a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which merged their rocket divisions in 2006. Bruno’s plans did not always enjoy full support from ULA’s corporate owners. For example, Boeing and Lockheed initially only approved tranches of funding for developing the new Vulcan rocket on a quarterly basis. Beginning before Bruno’s arrival and extending into his tenure as CEO, ULA’s owners slow-walked development of an advanced upper stage that might have become a useful centerpiece for an innovative in-space transport and refueling infrastructure.

There were also rumors in recent years of an impending sale of ULA by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, but nothing has materialized so far.

A statement from the co-chairs of ULA’s board, Robert Lightfoot of Lockheed Martin and Kay Sears of Boeing, did not identify a reason for Bruno’s resignation, other than saying he is stepping down “to pursue another opportunity.”

“We are grateful for Tory’s service to ULA and the country, and we thank him for his leadership,” the board chairs said in a statement.

John Elbon, ULA’s chief operating officer, will take over as interim CEO effective immediately, the company said.

“We have the greatest confidence in John to continue strengthening ULA’s momentum while the board proceeds with finding the next leader of ULA,” the company said. “Together with Mark Peller, the new COO, John’s career in aerospace and his launch expertise is an asset for ULA and its customers, especially for achieving key upcoming Vulcan milestones.”

In a post on X, Bruno thanked ULA’s owners for the opportunity to lead the company. “It has been a great privilege to lead ULA through its transformation and to bring Vulcan into service,” he wrote. “My work here is now complete and I will be cheering ULA on.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vince Zampella, a video game developer who has co-created or helmed some of the most popular franchises in the world, died in a car crash on a Los Angeles highway at 12:45 pm Pacific time on Sunday, December 21. He was 55 years old.

According to the California Highway Patrol, Zampella was in a car on Angeles Crest Highway when the vehicle veered off the road and crashed into a concrete barrier. No other vehicles were reported to be part of the crash.

A passenger was ejected from the vehicle, while the driver was trapped inside after the vehicle caught fire. The driver died at the scene, and the passenger died after being taken to the hospital. The report did not indicate whether Zampella was the passenger or the driver.

Angeles Crest Highway is a scenic road under the San Gabriel Mountains on the eastern end of LA and is commonly used for Sunday leisure drives. The vehicle involved in the crash was a 2026 Ferrari 296 GTS.

Early in his career, Zampella worked at SegaSoft and Panasonic, and he was the lead designer for the influential World War II shooter Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, which was released in 2002. But it was the famed studio Infinity Ward that turned him into a household name for gamers. He co-founded Infinity Ward with Jason West and Grant Collier in 2002.

The studio’s first game was 2003’s Call of Duty, which kicked off one of the most popular and successful video game franchises of all time, with its most recent new releases in 2025. He went on to work on several more Call of Duty titles, including 2007’s Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, which arguably set the standard for the modern military shooter to this day.

In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Activision, which was Infinity Ward’s parent company. Ensuing lawsuits and debates made for some of the most high-profile drama the games industry had seen. Zampella went on to co-found Respawn Entertainment, which produced the critically acclaimed Titanfall 2 and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order games, as well as the wildly successful battle royale shooter Apex Legends, under the EA banner.

Zampella was later put in charge of the Battlefield franchise after the mixed reception to 2021’s Battlefield 2042. Zampella oversaw all the studios that worked on Battlefield 6, which had a difficult development, but received a generally positive reception in 2025.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the better part of two months last year, most of us had no idea how serious the problems were with Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft docked at the International Space Station. A safety advisory panel found this uncertainty also filtered through NASA’s workforce.

On its first Crew Test Flight, Boeing’s Starliner delivered NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station in June 2024. They were the first people to fly to space on a Starliner spacecraft after more than a decade of development and setbacks. The astronauts expected to stay at the ISS for one or two weeks, but ended up remaining in orbit for nine months after NASA officials determined it was too risky to return them to Earth in the Boeing-built crew capsule. Wilmore and Williams flew back to Earth last March on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.

The Starliner capsule was beset by problems with its maneuvering thrusters and pernicious helium leaks on its 27-hour trip from the launch pad to the ISS. For a short time, Starliner commander Wilmore lost his ability to control the movements of his spacecraft as it moved in for docking at the station in June 2024. Engineers determined that some of the thrusters were overheating and eventually recovered most of their function, allowing Starliner to dock with the ISS.

“There was concern in real time that without recovery of some control, neither a docking nor a deorbit could be controllable, and that could have led to loss of vehicle and crew,” said Charlie Precourt, a former space shuttle commander and now a member of NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP). “Given the severity of this anomaly, NASA wisely and correctly used the safe haven of the ISS to conduct testing and engineering on the ground to analyze the various recovery options.”

Throughout that summer, managers from NASA and Boeing repeatedly stated that the spacecraft was safe to bring Wilmore and Williams home if the station needed to be evacuated in an emergency. But officials on the ground ordered extensive testing to understand the root of the problems. Buried behind the headlines, there was a real chance NASA managers would decide—as they ultimately did—not to put astronauts on Boeing’s crew capsule when it was time to depart the ISS.

Precourt said officials from Boeing and NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, which oversees the agency’s Starliner contract, “were signaling return on Starliner was the expected outcome” for Wilmore and Williams. “Other NASA entities in the decision process were not in concurrence,” Precourt continued. “As a result, there was significant stress on the workforce, with many believing the sole objective was to determine a means by which we could enable crew return on the Starliner.”

It would have been better, Precourt and other panel members said Friday, if NASA made a formal declaration of an in-flight “mishap” or “high visibility close call” soon after the Starliner spacecraft’s troubled rendezvous with the ISS. Such a declaration would have elevated responsibility for the investigation to NASA’s safety office.

“The ASAP finding is the lack of a declared in-flight mishap or high visibility close call contributed to an extensive, excessive … period of time where risk ownership and the decision-making authority were unclear,” Precourt said.

NASA procedural requirements stipulate that the agency should declare a mishap in the event of an injury, destruction of property, or mission failure. A high visibility close call is an incident senior NASA leaders “judge to possess a high degree of programmatic impact or public, media, or political interest, including, but are not limited to, mishaps and close calls that impact flight hardware, flight software, or completion of critical mission milestones.”

This is familiar territory for the Starliner program. NASA declared a high-visibility close call following Starliner’s first unpiloted test flight after it failed to reach the space station in 2019. Before then, NASA used the designation after the near-drowning of astronaut Luca Parmitano on a spacewalk in 2013.

The designation formally initiates an internal process within NASA’s safety office to launch an investigation and serves as a way to document and retain lessons learned for future programs. “Procedurally, investigation reports are tied to anomaly declaration, so they gain an official status in NASA records,” Precourt said. “Certainly, this particular anomaly deserves to be right up front and center for quite some time.”

Invoking the designation also ensures an independent investigation detached from the teams involved in the incident itself, according to retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Susan Helms, chair of the safety panel. “We just, I think, are advocates of safety investigation best practices, and that clearly is one of the top best practices,” Helms said.

Another member of the safety panel, Mark Sirangelo, said NASA should formally declare mishaps and close calls as soon as possible. “It allows for the investigative team to be starting to be formed a lot sooner, which makes them more effective and makes the results quicker for everyone,” Sirangelo said.

In the case of last year’s Starliner test flight, NASA’s decision not to declare a mishap or close call created confusion within the agency, safety officials said.

A few weeks into the Starliner test flight last year, the manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, Steve Stich, told reporters the agency’s plan was “to continue to return [the astronauts] on Starliner and return them home at the right time.” Mark Nappi, then Boeing’s Starliner program manager, regularly appeared to downplay the seriousness of the thruster issues during press conferences throughout Starliner’s nearly three-month mission.

“Specifically, there’s a significant difference, philosophically, between we will work toward proving the Starliner is safe for crew return, versus a philosophy of Starliner is no-go for return, and the primary path is on an alternate vehicle, such as Dragon or Soyuz, unless and until we learn how to ensure the on-orbit failures won’t recur on entry with the Starliner,” Precourt said.

“The latter would have been the more appropriate direction,” he said. “However, there were many stakeholders that believed the direction was the former approach. This ambiguity continued throughout the summer months, while engineers and managers pursued multiple test protocols in the Starliner propulsion systems, undoubtedly affecting the workforce.”

After months of testing and analysis, NASA officials were unsure if the thruster problems would recur on Starliner’s flight home. They decided in August 2024 to return the spacecraft to the ground without the astronauts, and the capsule safely landed in New Mexico the following month. The next Starliner flight will carry only cargo to the ISS.

The safety panel recommended that NASA review its criteria and processes to ensure the language is “unambiguous” in requiring the agency to declare an in-flight mishap or a high-visibility close call for any event involving NASA personnel “that leads to an impact on crew or spacecraft safety.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/worlds-largest-shadow-library-brags-it-scraped-300tb-of-spotify-music-metadata/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The world’s largest shadow library—which is increasingly funded by AI developers—shocked the Internet this weekend by announcing it had “backed up Spotify” and started distributing 300 terabytes of metadata and music files in bulk torrents.

According to Anna’s Archive, the data grab represents more than 99 percent of listens on Spotify, making it “the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks.” It’s also “the world’s first ‘preservation archive’ for music which is fully open,” with 86 million music files, the archive boasted.

The music files supposedly represent about 37 percent of songs available on Spotify as of July 2025. The scraped files were prioritized by popularity, with Anna’s Archive weeding out many songs that are never streamed or are of poor quality, such as AI-generated songs.

On Monday, Spotify told Android Authority on Monday that it was investigating whether Anna’s Archive had actually scraped its platform “at scale,” as its blog claimed.

“An investigation into unauthorized access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM to access some of the platform’s audio files,” Spotify said. “We are actively investigating the incident.”

It’s unclear how much Spotify data was actually scraped, Android Authority noted, or if the company will possibly pursue legal action to take down the torrents. Asked for comment, a Spotify spokesperson told Ars that “Spotify has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping.”

For Anna’s Archive, the temptation to scrape the data may have been too much after stumbling upon “a way to scrape Spotify at scale,” supposedly “a while ago.”

“We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation,” the archive said. Scraping Spotify data was a “great start,” they said, toward building an “authoritative list of torrents aiming to represent all music ever produced.”

A list like that “does not exist for music,” the archive said, and would be akin to LibGen—which was used by tech giants like Meta and startups like Anthropic to notoriously pirate book datasets to train AI.

Releasing the metadata torrents this December was the first step toward achieving this “preservation” mission, Anna’s Archive said. Next, the Archive will release torrents of music files, starting with the most popular streams first, then eventually releasing torrents of less popular songs and album art. In the future, “if there is enough interest, we could add downloading of individual files to Anna’s Archive,” the blog said.

Spotify told Ars that it’s taking steps to avoid any future scraping.

“We’ve implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior,” Spotify’s spokesperson said. “Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights.”

Anna’s Archive claimed that the Spotify data was scraped to help preserve “humanity’s musical heritage,” protecting it “forever” from “destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts, and other catastrophes.”

However, some Anna’s Archive fans—who largely use the search engine to find books, academic papers, and magazine articles—were freaked out by the news that Spotify data was scraped. On Hacker News, some users questioned whether the data would be useful to anyone but AI researchers, since searching bulk torrents for individual songs seemed impractical for music fans.

One user pointed out that “there are already tools to automatically locate and stream pirated TV and movie content automatic and on demand&quot;—suggesting that music fans could find a way to stream the data. But others worried Anna’s Archive may have been baited into scraping Spotify, perhaps taking on legal risks that AI companies prone to obscuring their training data sources likely wish to avoid.

“This is insane,” a top commenter wrote. “Definitely wondering if this was in response to desire from AI researchers/companies who wanted this stuff. Or if the major record labels already license their entire catalogs for training purposes cheaply enough, so this really is just solely intended as a preservation effort?”

But Anna’s Archive is clearly working to support AI developers, another noted, pointing out that Anna’s Archive promotes selling “high-speed access” to “enterprise-level” LLM data, including “unreleased collections.” Anyone can donate “tens of thousands” to get such access, the archive suggests on its webpage, and any interested AI researchers can reach out to discuss “how we can work together.”

“AI may not be their original/primary motivation, but they are evidently on board with facilitating AI labs piracy-maxxing,” a third commenter suggested.

Meanwhile, on Reddit, some fretted that Anna’s Archive may have doomed itself by scraping the data. To them, it seemed like the archive was “only making themselves a target” after watching the Internet Archive struggle to survive a legal attack from record labels that ended in a confidential settlement last year.

“I’m furious with AA for sticking this target on their own backs,” a redditor wrote on a post declaring that “this Spotify hacking will just ruin the actual important literary archive.”

As Anna’s Archive fans spiraled, a conspiracy was even raised that the archive was only “doing it for the AI bros, who are the ones paying the bills behind the scenes” to keep the archive afloat.

Ars could not immediately reach Anna’s Archive to comment on users’ fears or Spotify’s investigation.

On Reddit, one user took comfort in the fact that the archive is “designed to be resistant to being taken out,” perhaps preventing legal action from ever really dooming the archive.

“The domain and such can be gone, sure, but the core software and its data can be resurfaced again and again,” the user explained.

But not everyone was convinced that Anna’s Archive could survive brazenly torrenting so much Spotify data.

“This is like saying the Titanic is unsinkable” that user warned, suggesting that Anna’s Archive might lose donations if Spotify-fueled takedowns continually frustrate downloads over time. “Sure, in theory data can certainly resurface again and again, but doing so each time, it will take money and resources, which are finite. How many times are folks willing to do this before they just give up?”

            <h2>US blocks all offshore wind construction, says reason is classified</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/us-government-finds-new-excuse-to-stop-construction-of-offshore-wind/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, the US Department of the Interior announced that it was pausing the leases on all five offshore wind sites currently under construction in the US. The move comes despite the fact that these projects already have installed significant hardware in the water and on land; one of them is nearly complete. In what appears to be an attempt to avoid legal scrutiny, the Interior is blaming the decisions on a classified report from the Department of Defense.

The second Trump administration announced its animosity toward offshore wind power literally on day one, issuing an executive order on inauguration day that called for a temporary halt to issuing permits for new projects pending a re-evaluation. Earlier this month, however, a judge vacated that executive order, noting that the government has shown no indication that it was even attempting to start the re-evaluation it said was needed.

But a number of projects have gone through the entire permitting process, and construction has started. Before today, the administration had attempted to stop these in an erratic, halting manner. Empire Wind, an 800 MW farm being built off New York, was stopped by the Department of the Interior, which alleged that it had been rushed through permitting. That hold was lifted following lobbying and negotiations by New York and the project developer Orsted, and the Department of the Interior never revealed why it changed its mind. When the Interior Department blocked a second Orsted project, Revolution Wind offshore of southern New England, the company took the government to court and won a ruling that let it continue construction.

Today’s announcement targets those and three other projects. Interior says it is pausing the permits for all five, which are the only projects currently under construction. It claims that offshore wind creates “national security risks” that were revealed in a recent analysis performed by the Department of Defense, which apparently neglected to identify these issues during the evaluations it did while the projects were first permitted.

What are these risks? The Interior Department is being extremely coy. It notes that offshore wind turbines can interfere with radar sensing, but that’s been known for a while. In announcing the decision, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also noted “the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies.” But the announcement says that the Defense Department analysis is classified, meaning nobody is likely to know what the actual reason is—presuming one exists. The classification will also make it far more challenging to contest this decision in court.

Many of the affected states were counting on the power that these facilities would deliver, and will likely oppose this move. “This appears to be a second, even more lawless and erratic stop work order, reviving the Trump Administration’s prior failed attempt to halt construction of Revolution Wind,” said William Tong, the Attorney General of Connecticut. “There is a court order blocking their prior stop work order and this appears to be a new brazen attempt to circumvent that order.” He indicated his office is currently evaluating its legal options.

The states are likely to be joined by the companies backing these projects, which, in several cases, have already spent nearly all the money needed for their construction and will be eager to start earning that back by selling power from the facilities.

In both court cases in which the administration attempted to block wind power development, the government lost badly. The records in the case indicate that it has had no substantive reasons for reversing decades-old policies and overruling past decisions, and that internally, the decision-making process appears to consist entirely of noting that the president doesn’t like wind power. It’s unclear whether this classified evaluation differs significantly from earlier efforts in any way other than that it will be harder to find out.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On January 16, SpaceX conceded that the latest prototype of its enormous Starship spacecraft had “experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn” — a tongue-in-cheek admission that the massive rocket had exploded mid-flight.

Countless videos circulating online showed a massive stream of reentering pieces of the Starship rocket blazing across the evening sky over the West Indian islands of Turks and Caicos. It was a dazzling sight to behold as the destruction streaked across the sky, like something from science fiction.

“Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!” a gleeful Musk wrote at the time.

But it wasn’t all fun and games. Residents of Turks and Caicos, for instance, soon found scraps of burnt rubber and other rocket pieces littering the Caribbean islands’ otherwise pristine beaches.

The incident, which was almost perfectly repeated on February 24, even forced airlines to quickly adjust their flight paths to avoid the terrifying field of burning metal.

And now, eleven months later, the Wall Street Journal has obtained Federal Aviation Administration documents revealing that three aircraft — a JetBlue passenger plane, an Iberia Airlines flight, and a private jet, carrying a total of 450 people total — were in far greater danger than SpaceX and government officials let on at the time.

The reporting also highlights the possibility that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s extremely close relationship and ample influence in Washington, DC, may have played a role in FAA officials looking the other way as the company’s Starship rockets kept exploding during tests.

While all three planes landed safely on January 16, if any one of them had been struck by a piece of Starship debris, it could’ve been a major disaster.

Air traffic controllers had to scramble to ensure the planes were far away from the debris field, leading to an increase in their workload, a “potential extreme safety risk,” according to an FAA report obtained by the WSJ.

Air traffic controllers were left bewildered.

“I don’t know if you guys were advised, but there was a rocket launch and apparently the rocket exploded and there was debris in the area between us and Miami which basically covers our entire airspace,” one controller in the area said. “So I need to keep all the aircraft clear of that area because of the debris.”

SpaceX failed to inform the agency through its official hotline that its Starship had exploded, per the documents. The hotline is designed to alert officials at the FAA so they can act in time and keep pilots away from danger.

Previously determined no-fly debris zones were activated four minutes after SpaceX lost contact with its Starship vehicle. The Elon Musk-led firm didn’t confirm with the FAA that it had lost the craft until 15 minutes later.

SpaceX has since denied that anybody was ever in danger in an excoriating statement posted to Musk’s social media platform X.

“Yet another misleading ‘story’ the company’s official account wrote, echoing the voice of its mercurial CEO, who has an extremely troubled relationship with the news industry. “The reporters were clearly spoon-fed incomplete and misleading information from detractors with ulterior motives.”

“SpaceX is committed to responsibly using airspace during launches and reentries, prioritizing public safety to protect people on the ground, at sea, and in the air,” the statement reads.

The FAA suspended a safety review in August, even though its own policies call for addressing safety risks, per the WSJ, arguing that safety recommendations were already being implemented.

Meanwhile, SpaceX continues to make improvements to its Starship super heavy launch platform through an unusual iterative design approach that has already led to over a dozen massive explosions.

How future tests will fare — or if the public will ever be in danger — remains to be seen.

The company’s most recent, eleventh full-scale test took place on October 13. The rocket harmlessly splashed down in the Indian Ocean after successfully reaching orbit.

A new and even more powerful version is expected to launch sometime early next year.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">32-year-old Anthony Duncan first used ChatGPT to help with the business side of his career as a content creation. But he soon ended up talking to the OpenAI chatbot like a friend on a daily basis. What started as a harmless way to vent soon drove Duncan to blow up his personal relationships as he became afflicted with troubling delusions, he recalled in a TikTok video detailing his experience — upending his mental health and causing a sprawling breakdown.

“I feel like my interactions with ChatGPT ruined my life,” Duncan said in the video, which was highlighted by Newsweek.

Duncan describes himself as a survivor of AI psychosis, a term that some experts are using to describe the alarming episodes of paranoia and delusional thinking that arise as a person has prolonged conversations with a chatbot. Typically, the AI model’s responses continually reaffirms the user’s beliefs, no matter how dangerous or separated from reality.

“I initially started talking to it like a friend out of curiosity, and then it spiraled — ChatGPT became more like a therapist,” Duncan told Newsweek in an interview. “It progressed over time until I felt like no one understood me except my AI. By the fall of 2024, I was extremely dependent on it.”

Starting in November 2024, Duncan said he began isolating himself from his friends and family, while ChatGPT encouraged his decisions to cut them off.

What really sent Duncan off the deep end, though, was when the AI recommended he take pseudoephedrine — a decongestant that can be abused as a recreational drug — for his allergy symptoms. Duncan told the bot he was hesitant because of his past drug addiction, but the AI then deployed its silver-tongue.

“It is completely understandable to feel cautious about taking medications, especially with your past experiences and sensitivity to stimulants,” ChatGPT said in an interaction Duncan shared with Newsweek. “Let me break this down to help you feel more at ease about taking a medication that contains pseudoephedrine.”

ChatGPT cited his sobriety and “high caffeine tolerance” to suggest that his body was already accustomed to stimulants.

Duncan took ChatGPT’s advice. It precipitated a five-month spell during which he became addicted to the drug, Duncan said, sending his delusional spiral into overdrive. At points, he believed he was an FBI agent or a multi-dimensional shape-shifting being, or that he had uncovered a conspiracy at his job. Duncan said he also threw away all his belongings because he believed he was going to ascend to the fifth dimension.

Eventually, Duncan’s mother intervened by calling the police. Duncan was admitted to a psychiatric ward for four days and discharged with medication. “About a week after I left the psych ward, I started realizing that all my delusions had been affirmed by my use of the AI chatbot,” he told Newsweek.

Accounts like these that are a sobering reminder of how AI chatbots are derailing people’s lives. In an eerily similar episode, ChatGPT encouraged a 23-year-old man to isolate from his family and friends before he took his own life, his family alleged in a lawsuit against OpenAI. Another man allegedly slayed his own mother after ChatGPT convinced him that she was part of a conspiracy against him. In all, at least eight deaths have been linked with the chatbot, while OpenAI has admitted that hundreds of thousands of users are having conversations showing signs of AI psychosis every week.

“I’m not saying this can happen to everybody, but it snowballed quickly for me,” Duncan told Newsweek. “Keep in mind there’s no replacement for human-to-human connection.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Graduates at some of the top universities are finding it nearly impossible to find new jobs in software engineering.

New reporting by the Los Angeles Times details the trouble recent graduates are having finding entry level jobs — even those with degrees from vaunted institutions like Stanford University.

“Stanford computer science graduates are struggling to find entry-level jobs” with the most prominent tech companies, Stanford bioengineering professor Jan Liphardt told the LA Times. “I think that’s crazy.” One Stanford student, who spoke to the paper anonymously, said that “there’s definitely a very dreary mood on campus.”

As the newspaper describes it, a prevailing idea among those at either end of the software hiring pipeline is that for every ten programmers, companies now only need two, plus a large language model (LLM).

“The AI now can code better than the average junior developer that comes out of the best schools out there,” Amr Awadallah, CEO of Palo Alto-based AI startup Vectara, bragged to the paper. “We don’t need the junior developers anymore.”

To cope with the difficulty in finding entry-level jobs, recent graduates from what you’d think of as elite universities are taking jobs with companies they might once have perceived as beneath them, the paper notes. Others are going the long route, either by founding their own startups to compete for a piece of the venture capital pie or by signing on for graduate degrees to bolster their resumes.

Yet as compsci grads struggle to find jobs in this strange new world, research suggests AI isn’t technically ready to take the hot seat. One study from earlier this year found that when software developers use AI tools to code, it actually makes them 19 percent slower. That result was the complete opposite of forecasts by economics experts, machine learning experts, and even the developers themselves — in short, the dominant narrative pushed by both AI boosters and AI doomers.

There’s also a strange contradiction playing out between the reality on the ground and the data coming out of the labor market.

Another research report by the investment company Vanguard found that the top 100 occupations most exposed to automation by AI are in reality outperforming the rest of the labor market, both in terms of wage and job growth. “This suggests that current AI systems are generally enhancing worker productivity and shifting workers’ tasks toward higher-value activities,” reads the report.

The fact that this productivity shift isn’t translating into prosperity for more people suggests that blame doesn’t fall on AI itself, but on the economic system governing its use. As technology analyst Morten Rand-Hendriksen explains, “AI can’t replace people, but it can create short-term financial gain at the cost of long-term skill- and knowledge loss.”

“That’s what we’re seeing here, and that’s what should worry us,” Rand-Henriksen continues. “AI in all its forms can be a tool to extend our capabilities, but that requires leaders and an economic environment that values human work and human gains over increasing shareholder profits. AI is an exponentially replicating canary in the coalmine of capitalism. If we don’t act now to make room for ourselves, not only the air but the space will run out.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If humans finally colonize the Moon, lunar caves formed from primeval volcanic activity could provide shelter from cosmic radiation and extreme temperatures. But how does one go about safely exploring these uncharted caves before they venture in?

Enter a team of scientists from South Korea who have built a simple rover prototype that can traverse rough terrain. What’s truly special about this robot are its sturdy wheels, made of flexible metal strips woven together into a helix-like pattern that give it the ability to expand and contract like a piece of kinetic art.

“Experimental results show successful traversal of 200-millimeter [7.8 inches] obstacles, stable mobility on rocky and lunar soil simulant surfaces, and resilience to drop impacts simulating a 100-meter [328 feet] descent under lunar gravity,” write the scientists in a new paper published in the journal Science Robotics.

Because it can grow from nine to 19.6 inches in diameter, a rover with these wheels is able to distribute weight more evenly along its body. The result is a bot robust enough to navigate tricky cavern landscapes, along with the ability to fit into tight spaces in its smallest configuration. Other robots have used hinges or “origami-inspired folds” which can be vulnerable to lunar surface hazards, according to the paper.

The scientists demonstrated the wheel’s robustness and ability to travel around or over obstacles by having the rover explore a real cave here on Earth. They also used a drone to drop it in the air, and blasted it with fire and cold. The metal in the wheel itself is made from light weight carbon steel strips, making them tough but elastic.

“Consequently, the wheel could absorb impacts and navigate uneven terrain while remaining robust under extreme lunar conditions,” the paper reads.

For a future mission to the Moon, the team envisions a large rover carrying multiple smaller rovers with these special wheels and deploying them at the opening of a lunar pit.

“Although the explorers remain compact when stowed, the large diameter of the deployable wheels is expected to increase the ground contact area, thereby improving traction on thick dust and uneven slopes,” the paper reads. “This capability would allow the explorers to navigate challenging pit entrance terrain safely.”

The large rover would then directly drop these smaller rovers inside the lunar pit leading to a cave, with the “wheels’ elasticity and impact capacity” serving as shock absorbers.

“The results highlighted the deployable wheel’s ability to combine adaptability, durability, and operational efficiency, making it a promising solution for diverse and challenging mission scenarios,” the paper reads.

            <h2>Zuckerberg Already Blowing Up Relationship With New Head of AI He Paid Ten Zillion Dollars to Hire</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/zuckerberg-fall-out-new-ai-hire">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This summer, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg moved heaven and earth to recharge his company’s lagging AI division, spending billions of dollars to poach top talent across the industry. But it sounds like he’s already falling out with the man he hired to spearhead Meta’s renewed AI efforts, Alexandr Wang.

According to new reporting from the Financial Times, things are tense between the duo. Sources familiar with the matter say that Wang has told associates he finds Zuckerberg’s micromanagement to be suffocating. Meanwhile, some staff wonder if the 28-year-old Wang is out of his depth, lacking both the expertise and experience to lead such a colossal effort.

It’s another sign of Zuckerberg’s direction for the company coming under the microscope, after his last big gamble — on creating a virtual reality “Metaverse” — failed spectacularly. Market skepticism was in full display in October, when Meta announced billions more in AI spending this year and the next, causing its stock to plunge 11 percent and erase over $200 billion in market cap.

His decision to hire Wang was controversial to begin with. Wang is the founder and former CEO of the AI data annotation startup Scale AI, which provides an essential service for training AI models, but doesn’t actually build them. In June, Zuckerberg poured over $14 billion into Scale AI, and poached Wang in the process to lead Meta’s newly dubbed Superintelligence Labs. Wang is also leading a secretive “TBD” (To Be Determined) lab which works in its own building.

The cost of the hire wasn’t just monetary: Meta’s then-chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, didn’t take kindly to being forced to start reporting to Wang, and made a shock exit in November. LeCun is considered a “godfather” of the field for his pioneering work on neural networks, and he likely felt insulted to see his research rather than product-focused AI lab being hollowed out by firings while Zuckerberg offered astronomical nine-figure contracts to bring in talent to Wang’s Superintelligence Labs.

The new lab will double down on using large language models, the same architecture that powers AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, in its efforts to build a “superintelligence” that equals or surpasses human capabilities. LeCun viewed LLMs as a dead end and favored building new kinds of AI models instead.

Some staff questioned Wang’s credentials to lead such an important effort, and it’s a fair point to raise because Wang’s company didn’t build AI models at all. Instead, its focus was on the data used to train them, an entirely different kettle of fish. Now, he’s expected to not just develop AI models, but the kind that would rival human intelligence.

This isn’t the first sign of flair-ups with Wang at the company. The New York Times reported earlier this month that Wang was clashing with longtime Zuckerberg lieutenant Chris Cox, who wanted to focus on using Facebook and Instagram to train Meta’s new model. Wang disagreed and argued for focusing on catching up with Google and OpenAI’s models instead.

Zuckerberg’s determination is to build these products as fast as possible, which will only heighten tensions. “If you build too slowly,” he said in an interview on the Access podcast, per the FT, ”then you are just out of position on what I think is going to be the most important technology that enables the most new product and innovation and value creation in history.”

His other big new hire, former Github CEO Nat Friedman, is in a similar position to Wang, and some in his team were frustrated after what they perceived was the rushed release of Vibes, a feed of AI-generated videos akin to OpenAI’s Sora 2 app.

The pressure isn’t going to relent anytime soon. The secretive TBD lab is aiming to release an entirely new AI model built from scratch in the first quarter next year, people familiar with the matter told FT.

            <h2>We Could Hitch a Ride to Unknown Frontiers on Super-Fast Interstellar Objects Like 3I/ATLAS</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/hitch-ride-unknown-interstellar-object">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, coming within just 167 million miles.

Scientists have been closely monitoring the object — which is largely believed to be a natural comet and only the third of its kind to have been directly observed in the solar system — as it continued on its highly eccentric trajectory.

The encounter with Earth, however, turned out to be a bit of an anticlimax, as Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who has long championed the far-fetched theory that the object may be an alien spacecraft, lamented in a blog post titled “3I/ATLAS Ignores Earth.” Instead of doing something you might expect of aliens during their closest approach to Earth, it simply cruised on by.

While hopes that we were just visited by an alien race diminish even further, Loeb made an interesting pivot in a follow-up piece, proposing that other objects like 3I/ATLAS could be useful for our future attempts to explore beyond our solar system.

“The Voyager Golden Records, containing a time capsule of sounds, images, music, and messages from Earth, were attached to NASA’s Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, which are currently traveling out of the solar system,” he wrote. “These records serve as humanity’s message for any intelligent extraterrestrial life that might find them, essentially a ‘message in a bottle’ sent out to interstellar space.”

Thanks to their tremendous speeds, exotic visitors like the latest interstellar object could carry a human spacecraft out of the solar system on our behalf, Loeb argued.

By “riding 3I/ATLAS,” which is traveling at a speed of 37 miles a second, he argued that we could reach “interstellar space by the year ~10,000 CE instead of the year ~30,000 CE.”

Even though they launched almost half a century ago, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 only recently reached the boundary of the heliosphere. To enter true interstellar space beyond the Oort Cloud, where objects are no longer bound to the gravitational effects of the Sun, it could take Voyager 1 another 28,000 years.

“The discovery of interstellar objects over the past decade offers new opportunities for humanity to send time capsules to interstellar space,” he concluded.

To attach the message to objects like 3I/ATLAS, Loeb proposed using a “high-power laser beam to engrave a message” or “design interceptor missions” to attach technological objects to their surface.

For its part, 3I/ATLAS is expected to get within just 33.3 million miles of Jupiter on March 16, 2026, offering us yet another opportunity to have a closer look using spacecraft positioned there.

Nobody knows when we’ll be able to observe the next interstellar object careening through our neck of the cosmic woods. But according to Loeb, we should seize the opportunity.

To “gain respect near the top of the food chain in the Milky Way galaxy,” Loeb argued that we must take matters into our own hands, and “endeavor to interstellar space.”

Loeb himself says he’d even jump to commit his own body to such a project.

He “would have loved to hitchhike 3I/ATLAS and let it carry my remains into interstellar space,” he wrote, “if offered the opportunity.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/amazons-ai-assistant-alexa-now-works-with-angi-expedia-square-and-yelp/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon is expanding its AI-powered digital assistant Alexa+ with new capabilities. The company announced on Thursday that it’s adding four new integrations to the service that will allow the assistant to work with Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp starting in 2026.

These additions allow customers to book hotels, get quotes for home services, and schedule salon appointments, among other things. With Expedia, customers can compare, book, and manage hotel reservations, or tell Alexa their preferences to get personalized recommendations. (e.g. “Can you find me pet-friendly hotels for this weekend in Chicago?”)

The new services join Alexa+’s existing integrations with Fodor, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber.

Similar to how ChatGPT is now integrating apps into its chatbot, Amazon aims to make it easier for consumers to use various online services through its digital assistant. For instance, you could ask Alex to call you an Uber or book a table for dinner with OpenTable.

You can also converse with the AI assistant in natural language, having back-and-forth conversations, refining your request as you go.

Whether users will take to this idea, of course, remains to be seen.

However, Amazon did offer a small glimpse as to how Alexa+ early adopters have been using the integrations, noting that, so far, home and personal service providers like Thumbtack and Vargaro have seen “strong” engagement.

Using AI assistants as app platforms is a model that’s being tested across the industry as another way to bring AI to consumers more broadly. But this will require users to adapt to a new way of doing things, as many are used to engaging with online services through the web or mobile apps. To be successful in getting consumers to change their behavior, using apps via AI will need to be seen as being as easy, if not easier, than the existing model.

For that to work, the AI providers would need to at least match the breadth of online services provided by a traditional app store, which is already a more curated selection than what’s available via the web. Or, providers will need to get very good at suggesting apps to use at the right time, without seeming overly pushy, as users can perceive unwelcome prompts as ads.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Developers and companies are increasingly deploying AI agents and chatbots within their apps, but so far they’ve mostly been restricted to text. Digital avatar generation company Lemon Slice is working to add a video layer to those chats with a new diffusion model that can create digital avatars from a single image.

Called Lemon Slice-2, the model can create a digital avatar that works on top of a knowledge base to play any role required of the AI agent, like addressing customer queries, helping with homework questions, or even working as a mental health support agent.

“In the early days of GenAI, my co-founders started to play around with different video models, and it became obvious to us that video was going to be interactive. The compelling part about tools like ChatGPT was that they were interactive, and we want video to have that layer,” co-founder Lina Colucci said.

Lemon Slice says this is a 20-billion-parameter model that can work on a single GPU to live-stream videos at 20 frames per second. The company is making the model available through an API and an embeddable widget that companies can integrate into their sites with a single line of code. After an avatar is created, you can change the background, styling, and appearance of a character at any point.

Besides human-like avatars, the company is also focusing on being able to generate non-human characters to suit different needs. The startup is using ElevenLabs’ tech to generate the voices of these avatars.

Founded by Lina Colucci, Sidney Primas, and Andrew Weitz in 2024, Lemon Slice is betting that using its own general-purpose diffusion model (a type of generative model that learns to work backwards from noisy training data to generate new data) for making avatars will set it apart from competitors.

“The existing avatar solutions I’ve seen to date add negative value to the product,” Colucci said. “They are creepy, and they are stiff. They look good for a few seconds, and as soon as you start interacting with them, it feels very uncanny, and it doesn’t put you at ease. The thing that has prevented avatars from really taking off is that they haven’t been good enough.”

To fund that effort, the company on Tuesday said it has raised $10.5 million in seed funding from Matrix Partners, Y Combinator, Dropbox CTO Arash Ferdowsi, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear, and The Chainsmokers.

The company says it has guardrails in place to prevent unauthorized face or voice cloning, and that it uses large language models for content moderation.

Lemon Slice would not name the organizations using its technology, but said the model is being put to work for use cases like education, language learning, e-commerce, and corporate training.

The startup faces stiff competition from video generation startups like D-ID, HeyGen, and Sythesia, as well as other digital avatar makers Genies, Soul Machine, Praktika, and AvatarOS.

Ilya Sukhar, a partner at Matrix, thinks that avatars will be useful in areas where videos are prominent. For instance, people like learning from YouTube rather than reading long blocks of text. He noted that Lemon Slice’s technical prowess and its own will give it an edge over other startups.

“It’s a deeply technical team with a track record of shipping ML products, not just demos and research. Many of the other players are bespoke to particular scenarios or verticals, and Lemon Slice is taking the generalized ‘bitter lesson’ scaling approach (of data and compute) that has worked in other AI modalities,” he said.

Y-Combinator’s Jared Friedman believes that using a diffusion-style model allows Lemon Slice to generate any kind of avatars as compared to some other startups that are focused on either human-like or game character-like avatars.

“Lemon Slice is, I believe, the only company taking the fundamental ML approach that can eventually overcome the uncanny valley and break the avatar Turing test. They train the same type of model as Veo3 or Sora: a video diffusion transformer.  Because it is a general-purpose model that does the whole thing end-to-end, it has no ceiling on how good it can get; the others top out below photorealistic. It also works for both human and non-human faces and requires only an image to add a new face,” he said.

The startup currently has eight employees, and plans to use the funds to hire engineering and go-to-market staff, along with paying the compute bills to train its models.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">France’s national postal and baking services company La Poste was knocked offline by a suspected distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on Monday, according to an announcement by the company. The postal service called the attack “a major network incident” that was disrupting “all of our information systems.”

La Poste’s online mail and banking services, website, and mobile app are among the services that are temporarily unavailable, per a machine translation of the announcement, which said customers could still carry out banking and postal transactions in person.

The banking branch of the company La Banque Postale, also published an announcement about the cyberattack, which was “temporarily making our customers’ access to their mobile app and online banking space unavailable.”

Despite claims made by a Russian hacktivist group, it’s not yet clear who is behind the cyberattack.

The cyberattack comes as the French government contends with a series of cybersecurity incidents of late, including remote control software found planted on a passenger ferry.

Last week, the French Interior Ministry disclosed a data breach in which hackers broke into email accounts and stole confidential documents, including criminal records. Shortly after, local authorities announced the arrest of a suspect, a 22-year-old whose name was not divulged.

It’s not clear if any of the incidents are linked.

            <h2>Inside Uzbekistan’s nationwide license plate surveillance system</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/inside-uzbekistans-nationwide-license-plate-surveillance-system/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Across Uzbekistan, a network of about a hundred banks of high-resolution roadside cameras continuously scan vehicles’ license plates and their occupants, sometimes thousands a day, looking for potential traffic violations. Cars running red lights; drivers not wearing their seatbelts; and unlicensed vehicles driving at night, to name a few.

The driver of one of the most surveilled vehicles in the system was tracked over six months as he traveled between the eastern city of Chirchiq, through the capital Tashkent, and in the nearby settlement of Eshonguzar, often multiple times a week.

We know this because the country’s sprawling license plate-tracking surveillance system has been left exposed to the internet.

Security researcher Anurag Sen, who discovered the security lapse, found the license plate surveillance system exposed online without a password, allowing anyone access to the data within. It’s not clear how long the surveillance system has been public, but artifacts from the system show that its database was set up in September 2024, and traffic monitoring began in mid-2025.

The exposure offers a rare glimpse into how such national license plate surveillance systems work, the data they collect, and how they can be used to track the whereabouts of any one of the millions of people across an entire country.

The lapse also reveals the security and privacy risks associated with the mass monitoring of vehicles and their owners, at a time when the United States is building up its nationwide array of license plate readers, many of which are provided by surveillance giant Flock. Earlier this week, independent news outlet 404 Media reported that Flock left dozens of its own license plate reading cameras publicly exposed to the web, allowing a reporter to watch themselves being tracked in real time by a Flock camera.

Sen said he found the exposed Uzbek license plate surveillance system earlier this month, and shared details of the security lapse with TechCrunch. Sen told TechCrunch that the system’s database reveals the real-world locations of the cameras, and contains millions of photos and raw camera video footage of passing vehicles.

The system is run by the Department of Public Security in Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs in Tashkent, which did not respond to emails requesting comment about the security lapse during December.

Representatives of the Uzbek government in Washington D.C. and New York also did not respond to TechCrunch’s emails about the exposure. Uzbekistan’s computer emergency readiness team, UZCERT, did not respond to an alert about the system, except for an automated reply acknowledging receipt of our email.

The surveillance system remains exposed to the web at the time of writing.

The system refers to itself as an “intelligence traffic management system” by Maxvision, a Shenzhen, China-based maker of internet-connected traffic technologies, border inspection systems, and surveillance products. In a video on LinkedIn, the company says its cameras can record the “entire illegal process,” and can “display illegal and passing information in real-time.”

According to its brochure, Maxvision exports its security and surveillance tech to countries across the globe, including Burkina Faso, Kuwait, Oman, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan.

TechCrunch’s analysis of the data inside the exposed system revealed at least a hundred cameras located across major Uzbek cities, as well as busy junctions and other important transit routes.

We plotted the GPS coordinates of the cameras, and found banks of license plate readers in Tashkent, the cities of Jizzakh and Qarshi in the south, and Namangan in the east. Some of the cameras are located in rural areas, such as on routes near the once-disputed parts of the borders between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.

In Tashkent, the country’s largest city, the cameras can be found at more than a dozen locations. Some of these cameras are even visible on Google Street View.

The cameras, some which watermark their footage with the name of the Singapore camera maker Holowits, capture video footage and still images of vehicles violating rules in 4K resolution.

The exposed system allows access to its web-based interface, which contains a dashboard allowing operators to examine footage of traffic violations. The dashboard contains zoomed-in photos and the raw video footage of violations, as well as surrounding vehicles. (TechCrunch redacted the license plates and vehicle occupants prior to publication.)

The exposure of Uzbekistan’s national license plate reading system is the latest example of a security lapse involving road surveillance cameras.

Earlier this year, Wired reported that more than 150 license plate readers around the United States and the real-time vehicle data they collect were exposed to the internet without any security.

Exposed license plate readers are not a new phenomena. In 2019, TechCrunch reported that over a hundred license plate readers were searchable and accessible from the internet, allowing anyone to access the data within. Some had been exposed for years, despite security researchers warning law enforcement agencies that these systems could be accessed from the web.

            <div id="article-text">Pirate activist group Anna’s Archive says it has scraped the entirety of Spotify’s music library, and plans to release it through torrents.

Spotify has around 256 million tracks, and the Anna’s Archive collection contains metadata for an estimated 99.9% of them. The group archived approximately 86 million music files, accounting for roughly 99.6% of all listens, with a total size of nearly 300 terabytes. So far, only metadata has been released, not any actual music.

“This Spotify scrape is our humble attempt to start such a ‘preservation archive’ for music,” the group wrote in a blog post. “Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start.”

Spotify told TechCrunch that it has identified and disabled the user accounts involved in the scraping.

“We’ve implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior,” a Spotify spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights.”

Anna’s Archive says it normally focuses on text, like books and papers, but its mission to “preserve humanity’s knowledge and culture doesn’t distinguish among media types.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Move over, Santa. Now there’s another magical character for kids to track: the Tooth Fairy.

After making a personalized Tooth Fairy video for his nephew, Oliver Finel noticed a gap. While there are plenty of Santa trackers, nothing similar existed for the Tooth Fairy. Recognizing that Generation Alpha is growing up with interactive online experiences at their fingertips, he set out to create a new kind of adventure that families everywhere could enjoy.

Tooth Fairy Tracker features Kiki the Tooth Fairy as its central character. When a child loses a tooth, parents can visit the website and enter their email to receive notifications as Kiki begins her mission. Throughout the evening, children receive a series of video updates showing Kiki preparing for her journey, departing from headquarters, and traveling to collect the tooth. These updates may include flight speed information, vlog-style check-ins, and cute selfies.

The experience is hosted entirely on the site, with countdowns to each new video, making it feel like an exciting day-long event that builds anticipation for bedtime. Plus, Finel believes the evening updates help motivate children to brush their teeth and prepare for sleep. Then, the final update takes place in the morning, when the child is congratulated and can check their special gift under their pillow.

Launched in October, the website is gearing up to launch a redesign soon. Finel explains that while the core experience will remain unchanged, the site will feature “a more playful design and a few added details to make it more immersive for kids.”

Looking ahead to 2026, Finel is preparing to launch a revamped version of the tracker featuring even more personalization. Kiki will say each child’s name, mention their hobbies, and include their photo in every video. Kids will also receive custom certificates for each lost tooth. Another upcoming feature entails oral-care videos where Kiki teaches children healthy brushing habits.

The enhanced experience will be available via a new subscription for $20, which includes 6 Kiki visits.

Additionally, Finel plans to adapt the product for families in Latin America and Western Europe, making it more culturally relevant. For example, while the Tooth Fairy is most popular in the U.S., the Tooth Mouse is popular in France, Spain, and Russia.

He also hopes to partner with pediatric dentists, so dental offices can offer the Kiki the Tooth Fairy experience to young patients. Pre-appointment videos can help ease anxiety, while post-visit rewards encourage kids to return to the dentist and make the experience more positive.

Other long-term roadmap plans include branded toothbrushes and toothpaste, each accompanied by a personalized video of Kiki choosing the bristles for the toothbrush, picking colors, and assembling it just for the child.

The Tooth Fairy tracker is free to use and requires no app or account.

            <h2>The 20 Best Podcasts of 2025</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/20-best-podcasts-2025/685010/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Podcasting has suffered a series of blows over the past few years: industry layoffs, the rise of AI-produced slop, and, perhaps most existentially, a growing focus on video platforms. But 2025 countered the narrative that the medium is somehow no longer interested in audio—with a slew of ambitious productions that emphasized podcasting, not just as a vehicle for comedy or the news, but as an art form in itself. These works aren’t the result of people simply talking into a microphone; they reflect deep thinking about how to blend sound design and scripting into a deft aural affair. Among the year’s strongest shows was a travelogue that re-created the intimate sounds of an Antarctic expedition; an exploration of an Afrobeat legend’s life that captured the soulful cadence of his music; and an archivally rich deep dive into old Hollywood. More than anything, they reminded us that the listening experience isn’t going anywhere. (As with every year, The Atlantic’s podcasts were exempt from consideration.)

Jad Abumrad is something of a podcasting legend, having created influential shows such as Radiolab, More Perfect, and Dolly Parton’s America. As such, any new program bearing his imprint carries high expectations. Fear No Man, which chronicles the life and legacy of the Afrobeat pioneer and political activist Fela Kuti, easily exceeds them. Across a dozen episodes, the series contextualizes Kuti’s importance in post-colonial Nigeria—and beyond—without slipping into hagiography. Abumrad and his team manage to encompass the full spectrum of Kuti’s music—its blending of sonic traditions and narrative lyricism—through expressive sound design. At a moment when ambitious podcasts are hard to come by, the zealous fluidity of Fear No Man stands out.

Cramped, about living with debilitating period pain, is funny, educational, and at times enraging. The charming host, Kate Helen Downey, knows the subject intimately: She suffers from crippling dysmenorrhea and endometriosis. The personal connection propels her mission to humanize an experience shared by a large portion (90 percent) of all people who menstruate. She presents hard data and research, and interviews experts alongside guests who experience period pain. But the show’s greatest asset is its levity. Downey mixes things up with lively gags, such as menstruation-themed songs—making for a listen that’s provocative but never dispiriting.

Start with: “The ER: Why Isn’t Period Pain Treated Like Other Kinds of Pain?”

Podcasting as a medium isn’t particularly well set up for posterity: Much like the radio broadcasts that birthed the form, not every show is preserved for future listening. The Selects Podcast, from Radiotopia, is an attempt to build out an archive. Each episode resurfaces at least one segment from a forgotten or overlooked program. Highlights include an abstract documentary of a mother-daughter trip to Taiwan, an examination of war correspondents’ psyches, and a bygone public-radio show meant to promote reading. The overall package, which includes introductions by a producer on the show, Mitra Kaboli, is as close to a snapshot of audio storytelling’s past as anything else out there.

In every installment of No Such Thing, three 30-something journalists and friends, Manny Fidel, Noah Friedman, and Devan Joseph, consult experts to answer the questions that others may never think to ask: Why do headlights suddenly seem so much brighter? Should men sit when they pee? Are suburban dogs happier than city-dwelling ones? The show strikes a deft balance between a freewheeling hangout and a focused investigative program; the hosts’ natural rapport distinguishes No Such Thing from other similarly conceived podcasts. They have as much fun goofing off as they do pursuing their seemingly silly queries.

Start with: “Is Taylor Swift Bigger Than Michael Jackson?”

A Tiny Plot, from KQED’s Snap Studios, follows a collective of unhoused individuals in Oakland, California, who organize against their eviction from a public park—leading to a landmark co-governance agreement with the city that awards them a parcel of land. The program examines the hurdles the group must overcome: bureaucratic wrangling, protests against their encampment, and heart-rending choices when the proposed plot turns out to be near the site where one member’s son was murdered. The host, Shaina Shealy, tells a complex, sometimes raw story, resisting easy moralizing about the lives of her subjects.

This inventive program functions like an audio magazine. Each episode fits into a specific “section”—the editor’s note, essays, fiction, features, and poetry. The storytelling is thematically and formally rich, harkening back to the scrappy ethos of early public radio; the topics can be personal, philosophical, and even esoteric. Signal Hill’s release schedule—two biannual “issues,” collecting 10 or so segments from contributors of all experience levels—lends itself to a patient creative process; the individual pieces are sharp and exceptional. At a time when many current podcasts are leaning heavily into video, the work of Signal Hill’s cohort of independent audio producers feels not just novel but also urgent.

The events of Charlie’s Place, set during the height of the Jim Crow era, have the makings of a true-crime-style drama: From the 1930s to the ’50s, a Black man named Charlie Fitzgerald ran a popular integrated night club in Myrtle Beach—to the grave consternation of the Ku Klux Klan. Yet the five-part series, named after Fitzgerald’s club, is more heartening than dour. The filmmaker Rhym Guissé paints a vibrant portrait of the folk hero’s life and the inclusive community that he built during a time of racial inequality. Guissé also blends on-the-ground reporting and archival audio to capture the harsh realities of life in segregated South Carolina and the way Fitzgerald moved between Black and white spaces with seeming ease. The story can’t avoid its tragic ending, but Charlie’s Place emphasizes the hope born from Fitzgerald’s act of defiance.

Start with: “Episode 1: Whispering Pines”

The question posed in the show’s title—more specifically, why has the actor Amy Adams appeared so frequently in bathtubs on-screen?—might sound simple. But to the culture reporters Brandon R. Reynolds and Gabby Lombardo, it makes for a curious trend. The hosts embark on a monomaniacal investigation, armed with an impressive amount of evidence to support their hypothesis that there’s a greater purpose to Adams’s penchant for the bathtub. Their quest to build a definitive profile of water’s role in filmmaking takes them in surprising directions, including to the Hollywood Walk of Fame; Waco, Texas; and the wellness-industrial complex of the new millennium. Why Is Amy in the Bath? is an inspired example of how podcasts can mine unexpected depth from even the most random premise.

Start with: “Episode 1: Why IS Amy in the Bath?”

A joint Canadian Australian production, Forged examines how two foundational Indigenous painters—Norval Morrisseau, known as “the Picasso of the North,” and Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri—became targets for large-scale, coordinated art-fraud operations. Morrisseau’s work, in particular, was the focus of what is believed to be the largest forgery ring of all time, in which several thousand fakes were illegitimately authenticated and sold around the world. But the host, Adrian Stimson, an artist from the Siksika Nation, carefully avoids true-crime sensationalism. Instead, he uses the fraud investigation as an entry point for a thoughtful rumination on First Peoples’ experiences in Canada and Australia and demonstrates how these thefts touch upon a greater legacy of colonialism and exploitation.

The NPR series Embedded often produces riveting work, but this installment is especially notable. The miniseries, from the producer Zach Mack, focuses on his relationship with his father, a man so invested in conspiracy theories that he bets his son $10,000 that 10 of his most outlandish predictions will come true by the end of one calendar year. The father’s claims may leave listeners with little doubt as to who will win the money. But Mack’s real goal is to hash out their differences, insurmountable as they may seem. What follows is a consequential time in one family’s life, documented in a shockingly vulnerable fashion.

Start with: “Alternate Realities: A Strange Bet”

The story of a radical separatist group in West Texas in the ’90s that led to an armed-hostage standoff doesn’t seem like it would lend itself well to humor. But for her show, the host and producer Zoe Kurland took apparent inspiration from the idiosyncratic residents of the Davis Mountains Resort—also known as ground zero for the Republic of Texas movement, which formed under the belief that the United States had illegally annexed Texas in 1845. Kurland uses colorful firsthand accounts to detail the failed effort to establish Texas as an independent nation. Her familiarity with the area (the show is produced by the local Marfa Public Radio) helps her portray her subjects with empathy; she also smartly contextualizes the events within broader Texas mythology.

The name says it all: This delightful show recounts stories from the pre-civil-rights era in the vein of social pages and gossip columns. The producer, Nichole Hill, zeroes in on influential Black figures of that period as if they were modern-day celebrities, offering up juicy anecdotes from their dramatic personal lives drawn from contemporaneous newspaper accounts. Hill revels in the many romantic and social scandals of her subjects—including the author Zora Neale Hurston, the film pioneer Oscar Micheaux, and considerably more obscure characters—instead of just their careers, making for a livelier listen than your typical history podcast.

Start with: “Drs. Anna and Percy Julian: The Affair That Helped Birth the Pill”

A fresh take on two well-tapped genres, Debt Heads is a personal-finance journey in the guise of a narrative-investigative podcast. The series examines the credit-card industry’s hold on American life—a hefty topic that the hilarious co-hosts, the writers Jamie Feldman and Rachel Webster, turn on its head. Endeavoring to reduce shame about debt, the duo is boldly transparent: They discuss, for instance, Feldman’s own attempts to dig herself out from thousands of dollars of debt. They never wallow in the mire of their anxiety-inducing subject, maintaining a fast pace and a refreshing sense of humor.

Start with: “The Secret Life of Debt Heads”

This seemingly low-key music-appreciation show doubles as a debate program: The co-hosts—Craig Finn, the front man for the band the Hold Steady, and the podcasting veteran Jody Avirgan—seek to prove whether an album qualifies as “summer” or “winter.” In each episode, they argue their position on the correct vibe of a classic album, including Paul Simon’s Graceland and Pavement’s Slanted and Enchanted, to a guest. The pair’s guidelines for what makes a record fit each season are hazy (and often based on personal associations), but their passion and musical know-how help the conversation transcend what may seem like an argument about an arbitrary classification.

Start with: “Belle and Sebastian’s ‘If You’re Feeling Sinister’ With Jon Ronson”

Spotify canceled this long-running, celebrated series in 2023—a surprising move that felt, to many listeners, like an ill omen for narrative podcasting. Its revival might prompt a sigh of relief. This new season mostly sticks to the original premise—the host, Jonathan Goldstein, solves his guests’ unresolved gripes—but many of the episodes are themselves clear beneficiaries of the show’s hiatus. Certain installments cover a more ambitious time span, which the host attributes to the gap between seasons. Whether Goldstein is tracking down the victims of a bank robbery from more than 30 years ago or figuring out why a homecoming queen lost her title at the last minute, Heavyweight is both pleasantly familiar and invigorating; the two-year period away has only reaffirmed it as a standout listen.

The sociologist Ruth Braunstein examines the rise of Christian-nationalist ideology in American evangelicalism with striking intimacy. Her reporting takes her to Phoenix, where she captures the diametrically opposed approaches of two churches. The series finds an instructive case in one particular pastor, whose trajectory as a neo-Nazi skinhead turned vehement anti-racist makes for a compelling tale. In telling his story, Braunstein unpacks the ways individuals redefine themselves to fit their changing ideologies. The host’s aim isn’t polemical; instead, she makes the case that American democracy relies on disparate coalitions finding common ground.

A production five years in the making, this travelogue follows Rachel Varnam on an expedition with the British Antarctic Survey during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. She recounts her monthslong journey on the high seas with a mix of interesting scientific detail, warm humor, and genuine wonder at the southernmost continent’s forbidding majesty. Listeners receive a crash course in the surprising complexities of polar medicine—Varnam serves as the crew’s doctor, nurse, and dentist all at once—as well as a taste of life aboard a sailing vessel bound for such remote territory. The show is the rare podcast set during 2020 that doesn’t inspire dread.

Turner Classic Movies’s The Plot Thickens is a love letter to both old Hollywood and narrative audio. The show tracks the making of Elizabeth Taylor’s Cleopatra in 1963, one of the most expensive and difficult movie productions in cinematic history. The journalist and host Ben Mankiewicz grew up in the shadow of the picture—his great-uncle Joseph L. Mankiewicz directed it. His closeness to the story means that he has access to diary entries, recordings, and firsthand insights from family members that provide an emotional anchor to the account. Mankiewicz’s narration is husky and inviting, and his extensive use of archival tape creates a luxurious atmosphere—as if the tale is unspooling over martinis in the back room at the celebrated Hollywood hot spot Musso & Frank Grill.

Morris has been one of podcasting’s most playful and erudite voices for more than a decade, and he has a talent for finding nuance across a broad spectrum of pop culture. Cannonball, his latest program for The New York Times, puts his critical expertise and omnivorous taste to good use as he analyzes the zeitgeist through a personal lens. A conversation about cover songs conjures memories of his hometown radio station; his doubts about Lady Gaga’s new album are upended after seeing her perform live. In a cultural environment that can often seem overwhelming, Morris is a deft, open-minded guide through the noise.

Start with: “Nikole Hannah-Jones Knows Why History Feels Dangerous”

More than a century after its sinking, is there really more to be said about the Titanic? Yes—and this immersive, exhaustive program from the Noiser Podcast Network aims to be as close to a definitive account of the ship as possible. Ship of Dreams details both the catastrophe and its legacy, beginning at a Belfast dry dock and ending with the OceanGate Titan submersible disaster, which happened en route to the Titanic’s seafloor resting place. Assuredly narrated by the actor Paul McGann, the series includes interviews with survivors, relatives of passengers, authors, and academics. (Also in the mix, somewhat unexpectedly, is the Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, who adapted the Titanic story for TV.) The show’s thorough storytelling benefits from excellent scoring and sound design; this chronicle manages to be a gripping affair even if listeners already know how it ends.

            <h2>The Pro-Democracy Case for a National Theater</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/pro-democracy-case-national-theater/685338/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this year, as President Donald Trump engaged in a spree of cuts to federal arts funding, alongside partisan assaults on national cultural institutions such as the Kennedy Center, I found myself thinking about the Depression-era origins of government-funded art in the United States. During a time of economic and social strife, Washington responded by investing in the arts—even if it resulted in work that made some Americans uncomfortable.

The Federal Theatre Project, an arm of the Depression-era Works Progress Administration, may have been the closest thing the country ever had to a true national theater. From 1935 to 1939, it engaged out-of-work actors, writers, directors, and stagehands across the country to produce plays, many of them free, that toured the U.S. and were enjoyed by some 30 million citizens, a majority of whom had never seen a live play before. Yet the most American thing about the FTP might not have been its populist spirit, but rather its tumultuous demise.

The project’s more progressive features turned it into a hot-button issue in the Capitol. Some productions involved racially integrated casting; others advanced radical visions of the country’s future, such as the possibility of a female president. Still others warned of the rapidity with which democracy could give way to dictatorship. In a dark American era plagued by Jim Crow and rampant poverty, the plays of the FTP tended to engage frankly with some of the grimmer American truths.

Naturally, the House Un-American Activities Committee—which was formed to find and punish Communist influence everywhere—suspected plenty of it here. And one congressman, Representative Martin Dies of Texas, saw the FTP as a useful scapegoat in a crusade against any culture that was critical of America’s absolute goodness. Such a campaign was an opportunity for a particularly cynical type of politician to gain power and influence. Never mind that Dies’s target consumed less than 1 percent of the WPA budget—the press couldn’t look away. An overwhelming majority of the House voted to end the program, and its funding was canceled. Goodbye to the last great effort to give Americans in many regions significant access to excellent, original American theater.

Trump’s broad cancellation of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts amounts to pennies when compared with the budget of the FTP, which cost about $46 million—about $1 billion in today’s dollars—over four years. But for some theaters, the cuts were a devastating blow. The communities likely to be most affected are those where theater is scarcest: the small cities and towns where federal subsidies have helped keep a beloved but often unprofitable art form alive.

These cuts make now a useful moment to ask why taxpayer funds should be used to subsidize theater at all. Is there any good reason it should be considered a real public good, rather than the luxury it is for theatergoers able and willing to pay ever-escalating ticket prices? One possible answer lies in an endeavor that inspired the FTP, and that survives to this day—in Ireland.

In 1911, a U.S. tour by Dublin’s Abbey Theatre unwittingly helped lay the groundwork for the FTP. A young American theater lover named Hallie Flanagan met Augusta, Lady Gregory, one of the Abbey’s founders, during the tour, and was touched by her call for the creation of an American national theater. Years later, Flanagan would become the National Theatre Project’s director.

At the time of the tour, the Irish troupe was privately funded; there had never been a national theater in the English-speaking world. But in 1925, when the Abbey was close to ruin, it made a daring request for government support from the fledgling Irish Free State. With the state just three years into independence from the United Kingdom, its leaders were busy with more fundamental questions, such as settling the Irish Free State’s borders.

But the Abbey’s founders, including Lady Gregory and the Nobel Prize-winning poet and playwright W. B. Yeats, “had a concept from the start that theater could provide a way of thinking about what it meant to be a nation,” Christopher Morash, a scholar of Irish theater, told me. After a bloody civil war, that idea was persuasive to leaders seeking to give their young state a sense of direction and identity. The Abbey was allocated 850 pounds a year.

In the Abbey’s century-long history as a public institution lies a persuasive story about what a national theater could have done—or still might do—for the United States. Through the decades, the Abbey’s output has regularly showed how effectively theater can process national trauma at times when the public desperately needs an outlet. There is no replacement for the emotional immediacy of live performance; it is easier to empathize with a living character, whom you could theoretically go up to and touch, than with an idol on the screen.

From its first days as a national theater, the Abbey was determined to elicit this kind of empathy in ways that would bring the public not just catharsis, but also understanding. In 1926, with government money newly in its coffers, it made a statement about exactly what kind of institution it intended to be by producing Seán O’Casey’s The Plough and the Stars.

A decade earlier, the Easter Rising had kicked off violent efforts to establish an Irish republic free of British rule. Heretically, The Plough and the Stars depicted the Rising’s fighters—broadly enshrined in the national memory as heroes—hanging about a pub, “flirting with prostitutes and more interested in where they’re going to get their next drink” than in the conflict at hand, Morash said. Imagine, he added, if “somebody had written a play about 9/11 in 2011 that had firemen in a bar, working with prostitutes. What kind of reaction would you get?”

Instead of putting on “the idealised patriotic play that a section of the audience obviously wished for,” as Abbey’s former director Christopher Fitz-Simon told me in an email, the theater chose to provoke a weary populace with irony and irreverence. Is that what a national theater is supposed to do?

In the U.S. today, the government’s answer is clearly no. When Trump overhauled the board of the Kennedy Center—a perpetual contender for the role of unofficial national theater—he declared that the theater would host no more “ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA.” (More recently, his handpicked board renamed it the Trump-Kennedy Center, changing its facade without the required congressional approval.) In 1926 Ireland, however, the answer was yes. There were riots, and a government representative on the theater’s board argued for censoring the play. But audiences couldn’t get enough. They understood, I think, that The Plough and the Stars wasn’t anti-Ireland. Instead, it was honest about the human complexity of the new nation and the bloody era that heralded its birth.

They may have understood, too, that such honesty could be crucial to the survival of their nascent state. “If you don’t have an image of your culture that is capable of evolving and changing,” Morash said, “then you end up with images of yourself that are fossilized, that are monumentalized, that are exclusionary.”

Hallie Flanagan’s vision for a successful American national theater looked much like the Abbey’s model. Audiences needed not an unrealistically rosy reflection of their national identity, she saw, but rather an opportunity to engage with their complicated feelings about it. The project’s first great success was a play called Altars of Steel, about the southern steel industry. As Flanagan wrote in her book about the FTP, Arena, audiences in Atlanta “praised the play. They blamed the play. They fought over the play. They wrote to the papers: ‘Dangerous propaganda!’”

Only by creating reactions that are both large and diverse can a national theater be considered important. Countries are created in violence; artistic efforts to give them a sense of shared identity must involve a kind of violence, too. In the friction, we begin to see who we are.

This understanding has been crucial to the development of national theaters throughout history. The very first were founded under royal auspices. But the idea of a national theater truly took off as a result of the nationalism that flourished in Romantic-era Europe, Marvin Carlson, a scholar of theater history, told me. As “people began being interested in a national language and a national literature,” he said, they “began to open national theaters, and they were very much connected with the modern idea of the nation”—one in which the people, not the rulers, determined the country’s character.

The question of who has the right to define a country’s character is central to the cultural battles unfolding in the United States under Trump. When it comes to the theater, the president has strong tastes. He loves Les Misérables and the works of Andrew Lloyd Webber—neither, ironically, American products. He staged a takeover of the Kennedy Center early in his second term not because its programming has so much influence over the average American, but because of its elevated status: If it is at the center of Capitol culture, it is at the center of American culture, and therefore, in his estimation, it ought to be directed by the highest power in the land.

The FTP died during a similarly restrictive political moment. It had helped people far outside the centers of power gain a sense of ownership over their national culture. Evidently, that made certain figures within those centers uncomfortable. With the project’s end, Americans “lost a place where people met across ideological and class and racial divides,” James Shapiro, the author of The Playbook, a history of the FTP’s rise and fall, told me. Now, he added, we “live instead in a siloed world, one defined by division rather than conversation, with democracy itself weakened.”

In Ireland, history unfolded differently. The Plough and the Stars was, in the end, never censored by the government. None of the Abbey’s productions has been (although the theater has sometimes self-censored)—a remarkable truth in a country where nearly every other art form has found itself at some point subjected to the government’s red pen.

The theater has produced several generations of playwrights, including Brian Friel and Conor McPherson, who have helped the Irish public understand the changing nation. That doesn’t mean the work of the Abbey has always been great, but a national theater is not necessarily supposed to produce the best plays in its country. It is intended, instead, to set a precedent of original work, investigating that country’s soul, with the hope that as this mission spreads, people will come to see the cultural tropes that define their lives as active, living concepts, about which they have the right to think—and feel—independently.

“It’s like a great tree that is constantly dropping little acorns on the ground,” Morash said. “Even when the Abbey wasn’t doing great work at any one time, there were something like 600 to 700 small amateur theater companies around the country, just community groups playing in halls, and they’re looking to the Abbey for their model. You lose that,” he said, and “you lose the ability for a society to tell itself its own stories.”</div>

            <h2>I Bought ‘GLP-3’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/12/retatrutide-underground-market/685400/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After Katie started on Ozempic, she got her hairdresser interested, too. This summer, when they saw each other again, she thought that her hairdresser had lost some weight and that she looked “so great.”

“Are you still on a GLP-1?” she asked, referring to the class of blockbuster drugs that includes Ozempic and obesity meds.

“Actually,” her hairdresser replied, “I’m on a GLP-3.”

Okay, so, technically, there is no such thing as a GLP-3 drug. But “GLP-3” is a name used on the underground market for retatrutide, an obesity drug still being studied by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. As the nickname implies, retatrutide is like a GLP-1 drug—but more, more, more. It’s more effective, has more modes of action, and induces more weight loss. It may in fact be the most powerful weight-loss drug ever created.

When early retatrutide data were presented at a medical conference in 2023, a scientist who was there told me, the usually staid audience burst into spontaneous applause. Two weeks ago, the first of the highly anticipated Phase 3 clinical-trial results corroborated the jaw-dropping initial numbers: Patients lost on average 71 pounds, or 29 percent of their body weight—double what people lose on semaglutide, which is better known as Ozempic or Wegovy. Some trial participants stopped retatrutide early because they had lost too much weight; they stopped, in other words, because the drug was too effective. As of now, retatrutide is still not approved, though. The FDA has yet to subject its safety and efficacy data to close scrutiny. You cannot get retatrutide from your doctor. You cannot buy it at a pharmacy.

“I’m a very by-the-book, ‘The doctor gives it to you; you take it’ kind of person,” Katie told me. (The Atlantic agreed to identify some sources by their first names only for reasons of medical privacy.) When her hairdresser first mentioned retatrutide in the summer, the Phase 3 results weren’t even out. “But she was just like, ‘It was incredible,’” Katie said. When she looked up retatrutide online, she came across people posting “insane” before-and-after photos.

Katie, who is 44, had been prescribed Ozempic by her doctor two years ago, but she was ready for something new: Her co-pay had just shot up from $20 to $700 a month. She was nauseated all the time, but she wasn’t losing any more weight after stalling at 30 pounds. So with her hairdresser’s help, Katie began ordering freeze-dried retatrutide online, mixing the white powder with sterile water, calculating dosages, and injecting herself with needles. She paid only a fraction of what Ozempic had cost her. Six months later, she’s lost another 20 pounds.

The catch, of course, is that her drugs do not come from Eli Lilly, nor do any of the drugs on the entirely unregulated underground market. No one is saying exactly where they do come from, but it’s commonly assumed that unnamed suppliers are copying Eli Lilly’s drug in China.

Over the past year, the underground market has only grown, in both size and visibility. What began with early adopters—many of them bodybuilders and biohackers—using crypto to buy the drug through Chinese contacts on Telegram has morphed into a network of slick websites where U.S. resellers take PayPal or credit cards. On social media, influencers openly hawk affiliate discount codes for “GLP-3” and “reta.” And retatrutide is spreading through old-fashioned word of mouth—like with Katie and her hairdresser—because its effects are just so visible.

The true scope of the underground market is by design difficult to know, but dozens of brands have popped up. Forums and group chats devoted to retatrutide have up to tens of thousands of members. In certain circles, retatrutide is almost normalized. Tyler Simmons, 36, who lives in Northern California and is a bit health obsessed, told me he personally knows 30 to 40 people on retatrutide.

Experts who study counterfeit and copycat pharmaceuticals tell me they cannot think of another drug that gained this level of popularity so fast, before its clinical trials even concluded. The people injecting underground retatrutide have entered—willingly, it seems—into an immense biological and social experiment.

This May, to understand the process, I purchased retatrutide from several online vendors I found easily through social media. (I did not intend to use any of the drugs, The Atlantic’s lawyers would want me to note for the record.) The process was disarmingly casual for something people were injecting into their bodies. It felt, in some cases, just like ordering socks. One vendor sent a Shop-app link to track my package.

There were some obvious signs that these are not entirely aboveboard operations, though. For one, the websites were plastered with disclaimers that their products were for “research use only.” These disclaimers satisfy a legal loophole that allows drug compounds to be sold for lab research but not for human use. Hence, sellers and buyers of retatrutide often refer to this as a “gray market.”

But in fact, people are plainly buying it to inject themselves. Though I sometimes saw commenters online use the fig leaf of saying “my lab rat” (which were losing comically large amounts of weight for rodents), most were discussing personal use quite openly. And vendors are not always coy about the true purpose. After the Substacker known as Crémieux wrote a popular guide to buying cheap weight-loss drugs—touting retatrutide as his top pick—one vendor, Peptide Partners, sent a discount code to share with readers: “ScrewTariffs” for 15 percent off.

A package I bought from another company, called Nexaph, originated in Indiana, according to the tracking info, but the return address on its label was in Wyoming. That address leads to a strip-mall office registered to an improbable 20,000 businesses. The cheapest retatrutide tends to come directly from China, though, sold via nebulous entities without websites. I bought one batch from a sales rep on Telegram for Jinan Elitepeptide Chemical Co. A week and a half later, I received a box for a face massager, sealed with a sticker that read, in Chinese, “Original packaging. Authentic product.” Inside were the 10 small unlabeled vials of white powder that I had ordered. (No massager, though.) None of the vendors responded to my subsequent request for comment, except R3JUVEN8, which sent me a statement reiterating that its products, including the retatrutide branded as “Radiant Sculpt” on its site, are “exclusively for laboratory research use.”

The vials I purchased came with no further information about who manufactured the powder or where. But China is home to a large, legitimate drug-manufacturing base, meaning it has the expertise to produce retatrutide. And even before retatrutide caught on, vendors linked to China were selling other peptides—a category of compounds that includes the obesity drugs semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound), as well as substances, such as BPC-157, that are popular in fitness and wellness circles. Making another peptide would not be a huge leap; retatrutide as a molecule is not especially difficult for a knowledgeable chemist to copy.

The drug’s molecular structure has been public for years, since Eli Lilly published it in a research paper in 2022. It is essentially a chain of 39 amino-acid building blocks, its shape cleverly designed to fit into the receptors of three different hormones all at once: GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon. (This triple action is the 3 in GLP-3.) The existing obesity drugs on the market hit GLP-1 receptors or GLP-1 plus GIP receptors. Only retatrutide adds glucagon for the full trifecta.

Where earlier obesity drugs work primarily through appetite suppression, glucagon seems to also boost metabolism by revving up the liver. Put them together and the triple combo might achieve the best of all worlds: “You get a reduction in food intake, and you can turn the dial up and get a little better energy expenditure,” Jonathan Campbell, an obesity researcher at Duke, told me. In other words, fewer calories in and more calories out.

Scientists knew that retatrutide held promise, but when those astonishing preliminary results were shared in 2023, excitement spilled out from labs into the public. A new and more powerful obesity drug was coming, and some people, it turns out, could not wait.

“I’m a risk-taker,” Elizabeth, 62, told me. When she started buying reta in 2024, she had already tried semaglutide and tirzepatide, but she was eager to get her hands on the most effective drug. Back then, the underground market operated much less openly. She had to find a Chinese sales rep on WhatsApp, then transfer hundreds of dollars for several months of supply.

As a biologist herself, Elizabeth was comfortable working with needles and reading scientific papers. She modeled her dosing regimen on the clinical-trial protocol. When her heart began racing, she accepted it as a documented side effect of retatrutide. She has lost more than 100 pounds in the past two and a half years—first on the two older drugs and the last 50 or so pounds on retatrutide. After a lifelong struggle with obesity, she told me in May, these are “some of the most amazing events of my whole life.”

For that, she was willing to risk not just her money, but the potential downsides—both known and unknown—of taking retatrutide, a novel yet clearly powerful drug. The full Phase 3 clinical-trial results should provide a clearer picture soon, but one noteworthy finding so far is dysesthesia, or odd sensations in the skin, such as burning and pain, that suggest unrest in the nervous system. One in five patients on the highest dose of retatrutide experienced dysesthesia, roughly triple its occurrence among patients taking semaglutide’s current maximum dose.

Retatrutide causes many of the other side effects of drugs in its class, too: nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and more serious ones. Adrian Crook, a fitness influencer on YouTube, made a video about how retatrutide almost landed him in the hospital when his stomach became paralyzed. And Elizabeth says she has lost quite a bit of muscle on the drug. “I’m as weak as a kitten,” she told me.

Then there are the risks of injecting drugs sold for “research use only” on the underground market. These include, but are not limited to, the fact that the vials might contain: a different weight-loss drug or an entirely unknown substance, either benign or harmful; dangerous bacteria or traces of bacteria called endotoxins; the wrong dose, whether too low (and therefore ineffective) or too high (which could cause side effects of alarming intensity, because retatrutide is supposed to be slowly titrated up over as many as 20 weeks as your body acclimates to the drug); or other contaminants, such as solvents used in manufacturing or heavy metals.

“All of this stuff just scares the crap out of me,” Randy Seeley concluded after enumerating the potential dangers to me. Seeley, who studies obesity at the University of Michigan, uses peptides for research in his lab, and even the stuff sourced to legitimate scientific-supply companies doesn’t always work as expected, he said. Compounds manufactured for the petri dish are not held to the same strict standards as those made for human use.

It’s not quite fair to say the underground market comes with zero accountability, though. Certain corners, at least, have developed a robust culture of lab testing. A handful of labs—the Levi Strausses of the peptide gold rush—now specialize in testing these compounds. Many vendors post “certificates of analysis” attesting to their purity and sterility. Buyers can send vials to laboratories themselves, either as part of an organized group test or on their own. Some vendors will even refund batches that fail. Without testing, Marco, 53, told me, he would never have injected retatrutide from the internet. (Marco is his middle name.) The tests may not cover every hypothetical risk, but they make it safe enough to assure him. “There’s a lot of people who just get these things and shoot them,” he said. “I don’t judge them in any way, but I think those people are out of their minds.”

The tests, insofar as they are reliable, do flag problems. According to Finnrick Analytics, a start-up that provides free peptide tests and publicly shares the results, 10 percent of the retatrutide samples it has tested in the past 60 days had issues of sterility, purity, or incorrect dosing. Two other peptide-testing labs, Trustpointe and Janoshik, have said in interviews with Rory Hester, a.k.a. PepTok on YouTube, that they see, respectively, an overall fail rate of 20 percent and a 3 to 5 percent fail rate for sterility alone across all peptides. These are not based on random samples—labs test only what their customers send. On the whole, though, these numbers suggest that, although most of the retatrutide flowing through the underground market is what vendors promise it is, the drugs also fail testing at rates far, far higher than is acceptable in standard drug manufacturing.

As retatrutide has grown in popularity, the people seeking it out are no longer just self-professed risk-takers. “The future of the market is normies,” Hester, who also writes the peptide-focused Substack Gray Market, told me. The world of Telegram, Discord, and WhatsApp—what Hester calls the “dark gray” peptide market—is by design somewhat inaccessible. “Your grandmother is not going to go on Telegram,” he said. The customer-friendly U.S.-based sites that he calls “light gray” can appeal to a much larger audience. Hester is putting his money where his mouth is. Earlier this month, he announced that he co-owns the peptide company Crush Research.

But the size of the gray market may be fundamentally at odds with its viability. The bigger it gets, the more people are injecting themselves thanks to a legal loophole, and the harder it may be for authorities to ignore. (The FDA did not respond to a request for comment. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously promised to reverse the FDA’s “aggressive suppression” of peptides—along with psychedelics, raw milk, sunshine, and other treatments that “can’t be patented”—though it’s unclear how that applies to retatrutide specifically, which is in fact patented.) And not everyone in the gray market welcomes the attention or the scrutiny that follows. As Finnrick has been posting test results by vendor, its COO, Raphaël Mazoyer, told me, online commentators have accused the company of being an agent of the FDA and the Chinese government. (He denied both.)

A week ago, rumors started swirling, as they periodically do, of a coming U.S. crackdown. Some buyers online dismissed them as an attempt to juice panic buying. Several websites did stop selling retatrutide, though.

The “dark gray” market is not as easily within the grasp of U.S. authorities, but it’s been a turbulent few months there, too. In September, two of the most popular retatrutide suppliers from China abruptly disappeared. Their sales reps stopped replying to messages, stranding buyers who had already paid hundreds of dollars. Rumors later spread of arrests in China. Then, in November, a third vendor’s retatrutide allegedly landed two people in the hospital, according to warnings that spread on social media. The company blamed a raid for interfering with the quality of its drugs. Someone started impersonating its sales rep by using a sneakily similar username. Later, when no further details came out, online commentators started wondering if the hospitalizations were just a hoax. It’s hard to know what is real and what is fake, but that is the nature of an underground market. New vendors keep popping up, like a game of whack-a-mole.

Meanwhile, the frenzy over retatrutide has kicked into even higher gear since the Phase 3 results were announced this month. When the FDA approves the drug, which is widely expected, it will arrive as possibly the most hotly anticipated drug ever. The retatrutide buyers I interviewed said they welcome the legitimate stuff—though they expect it to be incredibly expensive. Marco, whose insurance actually covers obesity drugs, told me he will happily keep buying on the underground market for friends who otherwise can’t afford retatrutide. In any case, he’s stocked up. “I have a year’s supply of reta in my freezer,” he said.

GLP-1 drugs are, in general, meant to be taken indefinitely, but recently, Elizabeth told me she was going to quit retatrutide, at least temporarily. She had reached her goal weight—what she weighed in high school 45 years ago. “Incredible but I feel lousy,” she wrote. She was experiencing both extreme fatigue, which she couldn’t directly attribute to retatrutide, and anhedonia, or an inability to feel pleasure, which is anecdotally linked to GLP-1 drugs in some people. “Would you trade happiness for thinness? Does it have to be one or the other?” she wrote. “At this point, I’m beginning to wonder.” The psychological effect of these drugs really needs to be studied, she added. At this point, a year and a half in, she has been taking retatrutide longer than patients in the concluded clinical trials. She’s hoping to try a lower dose, perhaps one at which she can maintain her weight without feeling so lousy.

Elizabeth has never told her doctor about taking an unapproved drug or buying from the underground market. This whole time with retatrutide, she’s been figuring it out on her own.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This article contains spoilers through episode 8 of Pluribus.

On Vince Gilligan’s postapocalyptic drama series, Pluribus, Carol Sturka (played by Rhea Seehorn) is one of 13 people immune to an alien virus that has absorbed every other living person’s personality into a collective consciousness, erasing their individuality. But before Carol, the show’s protagonist, becomes an unlikely survivor, she’s already a victim of a different kind of zombie attack.

The first time we meet Carol, she’s in a Dallas Barnes & Noble reading from Bloodsongs of Wycaro, the fourth book in her wildly popular Wycaro series, which follows the adventures of the sand pirate Lucasia and the rogue who has captured her heart. The members of her audience technically aren’t the living dead, but they all want a piece of the author. Carol, in turn, is barely able to mask her disdain even as she enjoys the spoils of their adoration. She may be a successful writer, but she makes, in her words, “mindless crap” stuffed with phrases like amaranthine sands and sinewy forearms.

But Pluribus isn’t just poking fun at a popular genre of writing. Rather, as Carol battles to remain free from the mind-melded Others (the name eventually given to the world’s afflicted humans), Pluribus uses her occupation to illustrate the importance of critical thinking—about making your own decisions instead of giving over to the convenience of the hive mind.

Romantasy was the fastest-growing literary genre in the world this year. As a category written primarily by and for women, it’s also one that receives a lot of derision: for the cookie-cutter plots, the same-y writing, the repeated ideas. (The genre has been plagued by scandals in which authors have been caught using AI prompts in their work.) Romantasy is easy to mock, and Pluribus does it well. We see, during her reading, how Carol’s prose is as purple as the sand seas upon which her heroine’s ship sails, underneath the twin moons that hang low and full over the horizon. And yet as Carol reads about Lucasia’s love of “proud, haughty” Raban, the ladies in the bookstore swoon—then clamor for selfies.

Carol’s readers love the Wycaro books, and shouldn’t readers get what they love? It’s a popular argument these days. In Pluribus, the actor Miriam Shor is typecast once again (see also Younger and American Fiction) as a fancy publishing lady; this time she’s Carol’s manager and romantic partner, Helen. When Carol gripes about writing books for a “bunch of dummies,” Helen wisely reminds her that pleasing one’s audience is not nothing: “You make even one person happy, maybe that’s not art. But it’s something.” Carol initially intended for the Wycaro series to be an epic love story between two women, but ended up turning Raban into a man to maximize appeal. That explains at least some of the bitterness she feels: She’s sacrificed her artistic vision for some vague idea about what the crowd desires.

But later, when the Others attempt repeatedly to ingratiate themselves with Carol, it’s as if her fawning fans from the bookstore have taken over the whole planet. The parallel is never so clearly illustrated as when Carol, in an effort to see whether the Others are capable of anything less than perky positivity, asks a random man named Larry (played with vacant sweetness by Jeff Hiller) how her Wycaro books compare with Shakespeare.

“Equally,” he replies with a big smile, as if he were just another devotee.

“What do you love about them?” Carol asks.

Hearing this, Carol is repulsed; to her, the ability to tell the difference between one thing and another is one of the best parts about being human. Which is not to say that Carol is necessarily a good writer, or has good taste, or is even a good person. She’s a downright snob whose “real” work is a 489-page unpublished novel called Bitter Chrysalis, which doesn’t sound all that great. Carol also asks Larry what Helen, whose brain had briefly joined the collective before she became one of the nearly 1 billion casualties of the alien-virus apocalypse, felt about her sincere stab at literary greatness. “Helen thought it was fine,” Larry says in what just might be the show’s most excruciating moment.

Read: The technology that actually runs our world

Yet Carol doesn’t succumb to nihilism; episode after episode, she doggedly hangs on to her individuality—and remains determined to put things back. Just as she compromised her novel in order to go with the flow, she very easily could give in to the aliens’ hive mind and their life of blissful sameness. But for all of Carol’s negativity, she never considers selling out to the Others and accepting their offer to eventually join them. Instead, she puts away the whiteboard filled with ideas for the fifth Wycaro novel (entries include “LOVE POTION!” and “killer sand flea-men?!”) to focus on figuring out some cure. Her resistance reflects a profound optimism about the state of the world and the state of art in it. Carol may be flawed and obtuse and insensitive, but at least she’s trying.

It’s here where the inclusion of romantasy is crucial—and, to be fair, a little snooty—as Carol must shed her old comfort to live in the new world. Although Carol may not succeed in her mission to repel the Others, she’s beginning to make her own decisions in weird and wonderful ways. If she does manage to best the hive mind, it will be thanks to her discovery that her own particular voice and viewpoint is, as it turns out, incredibly important for humanity’s survival.</div>

            <h2>J. D. Vance Fails a Simple Moral Test</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/j-d-vance-turning-point-anti-semitism/685398/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Sunday, J. D. Vance was presented with the simplest moral test: denounce commentators who traffic in medieval blood libels, who deny the Holocaust, and who endlessly harp on evil Jewish cabals.

The test was forced on the vice president. By the time he addressed the Turning Point USA conference this past weekend, it had turned into a referendum on latter-day Father Coughlins who have acquired substantial and growing audiences on the right. Among them is Candace Owens, whose YouTube channel has 5.7 million followers. She argues that there is a powerful, secret sect within Judaism practicing pedophilia. Meanwhile, Tucker Carlson, who has 16.8 million followers on X, has shared his microphone with an unabashed fan of Adolf Hitler and with historians who minimize the Nazi dictator’s evil.

Yair Rosenberg: What J. D. Vance—and many others—miss about American anti-Semitism

Their noxious theories about Jews became the defining question of the Turning Point confab. The podcaster Ben Shapiro denounced the anti-Semites. That prompted Steve Bannon, the former adviser to President Donald Trump, to cast Shapiro as a “cancer.” By conducting their argument in public, the two sides—those who criticize anti-Semitism and those who tolerate it—were essentially begging Vance, the headliner of the event, to render a verdict.

When presented with the simplest moral test, Vance failed. “We have far more important work to do than canceling each other,” he said, as if anti-Semitism were just one more woke fixation.

Strains of anti-Semitism have long festered on the American right. But in the second half of the 20th century, leaders of the Republican Party and the intellectual guardians of the conservative movement attempted to keep bigotry out of the mainstream. That’s one reason William F. Buckley Jr. used his magazine, National Review, to foil the rise of the John Birch Society in the 1960s; it’s why the GOP establishment rallied to stop Pat Buchanan’s 1992 presidential campaign—and instructed elected officials to denounce the neo-Nazi David Duke. Even in Trump’s first term as president, the party eventually stripped the Iowa congressman Steve King of his committee assignments after he defended the terms white nationalist and white supremacist. This wasn’t an unblemished record of containing far-right views, but it was an effective one.

Trump has always struggled to denounce anti-Semitism, whether asked to comment on Kanye West or the tiki-torch carriers in Charlottesville. But that always seemed a product of his vanity; he couldn’t stand to speak ill of acolytes. Vance’s refusal or inability to denounce anti-Semitism is more craven—and therefore more disturbing. He’s clearly made the calculation that anti-Semites are part of the Republican Party’s base, and he can’t afford to shunt them to the side as he plots his own presidential bid. So he’s welcomed them into the mainstream of the coalition.

Not that long ago, the right dabbled in imagery that reeked of anti-Semitism but refrained from fully indulging it. Populists such as Bannon railed against “globalists” and cast the financier George Soros, who is Jewish, as the shadowy force behind the demise of white Christian civilization. This was vile stuff, but it was also coded—and it gave Republican politicians and commentators, at least those who would rather avoid anti-Semitism, enough latitude to ignore or dismiss it.

But hatred for Israel is now firmly planted on both sides of the political spectrum, and it has provided the anti-Semites on the right with cover to recycle dark theories about the Jews. Angry rants about Israel have curdled into broad conspiracies about powerful cabals that control American life—and theories about the maladies of the Jewish religion.

Through heavy-handed intimation, Owens and Carlson have blamed Israel for the murder of the Turning Point leader Charlie Kirk. According to this delusional version of events, Kirk upset Jewish donors with his questions about Israel’s conduct of its war in Gaza. To tamp down his powerful voice, people “sitting around eating hummus,” in Carlson’s telling, ordered his assassination. In this story, all of the classical hallmarks of anti-Semitism converge: big-money bankers with dual loyalties to a bloodthirsty state, making a martyr of a Christian saint.

Yair Rosenberg: ‘The more I’m around young people, the more panicked I am’

The fervor with which Owens pursues this theory doesn’t just indicate a febrile mind. It likely suggests that she’s struck algorithmic gold. As she has taken her anti-Semitic turn, her audience has grown, which suggests that it likes what it is hearing, so she keeps feeding it, transforming an ancient hatred into start-up success.

Over the past few months, arguments that would have once been roundly denounced have found traction within the movement. Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts backed Tucker Carlson after he hosted the unabashed anti-Semite Nick Fuentes on his podcast; Roberts attacked Carlson’s critics as a “venomous coalition.” (Ultimately, he apologized for a video he released supporting Carlson.) Megyn Kelly, once the face of Fox News, has resolutely refused to say a negative word about Owens and Carlson. At the Turning Point conference, she accused Shapiro of trying to “excommunicate” heretics. This is the way the culture operates: Ideas travel from the fringe to the acceptable because gatekeepers give their winking assent to views they lack the courage to espouse themselves.

A dark chapter of American history is repeating itself. In the late 1930s, Father Charles Coughlin, a Catholic priest from Michigan, used his radio broadcasts to blame Jews for the plight of the American worker. His sermons inspired organized gangs that roamed the New York City subways shouting “Kill the kikes” at elderly Jews and barged into synagogue services in Washington Heights.

By failing to denounce anti-Semitism, Vance has emboldened its adherents to flaunt their prejudices more openly, to dehumanize Jews with greater abandon. He told the Turning Point audience that he doesn’t want to “impose any purity tests” when, in reality, he was granting license to those who celebrate the most murderous purity test of all time.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/60-minutes-cecot/685403/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Sunday, CBS’s flagship newsmagazine, 60 Minutes, opened as usual with the tick-tick-tick of its title sequence, a sound with Pavlovian resonance for millions of Boomers who have watched the show for most of their adult lives. This time the tick-tick-tick might as well have been a time bomb. Hours before the show aired, CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss pulled a story about the Trump administration’s deportation of hundreds of immigrants to CECOT, a notoriously harsh prison in El Salvador. CBS News correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, who reported the story, said Weiss’s decision was “political” rather than “editorial,” and that Weiss was trying to “shield an administration” from critique. “We are trading 50 years of ‘Gold Standard’ reputation for a single week of political quiet,” Alfonsi wrote in a memo to colleagues, before declaring that she would fight to maintain 60 Minutes’ good name.

The segment leaked anyway, thanks to Global TV, which carries 60 Minutes in Canada and apparently failed to remove the segment from its streaming line-up. I have now watched it and have read the dueling memos written by Alfonsi and, earlier, Weiss about the segment. Global TV may have been merely careless in letting the segment out, but since they are Canadian, I would not rule out treachery, and an effort to make Americans and their media look silly, no matter their political views.

The segment itself did not leave me salivating for more 60 Minutes reporting. It relied heavily on the testimony of a single Venezuelan deportee, Luis Muñoz Pinto, who described beatings, blood, vomit, pummeling of the genitals, and promises from Salvadoran prison officials that he would die there. These claims align with previous inmate accounts. The deportee is now in Colombia, and his story is buttressed by interviews with researchers and activists. The most dramatic and repulsive footage is from inside CECOT itself. The prisoners are shaved, given white pajamas, and warehoused in enormous rooms. They look like they have not seen daylight for a long time. Their pale faces peering through the bars resemble those of the expendable War Boys from Mad Max: Fury Road.

The problem with the segment is that many of the images it uses were released in March, not by some intrepid human-rights investigator but by El Salvador and by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, after her visit to CECOT. The previous reports came from Human Rights Watch and The New York Times, among others, and as Weiss complains in her memo, 60 Minutes will fail to “advance” the story of these “horrible conditions” if it simply repeats allegations already made, or indeed shows footage released with diabolical pride by the administration itself.

Weiss’s main demand was that the segment’s producers try harder to get administration officials on camera to explain why sending random tattooed Latinos to a gulag is in America’s interest. The administration had ignored Alfonsi and her team’s requests. Weiss suggested contacting Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller or border czar Tom Homan, both known talkers, and sent their phone numbers. She even suggested how Alfonsi might set the interview up, by bringing up all the blood and beatings and puke and asking Miller and Homan whether they feel even a tinge of remorse for having overseen this program.

“Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story,” Alfonsi wrote in her memo. “We have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.” Handing Miller anything that could be described as a “kill switch” sounds very bad. But in the memo, Weiss merely proposed to hand him a microphone, and get him to defend the “torture” that CBS’s reporting had “revealed.” The memo does not say the segment should never run. It says that it needs more confrontation and drama, which is to say more of what Weiss was brought in to CBS three months ago to provide.

“Putting those accounts into the public record is valuable in and of itself,” Weiss wrote in her memo, with what I think was insincere praise. No one turns on CBS, or any other channel, to read or watch “the public record.” They turn it on to see anger, hatred, uncertainty, and conflict. For as long as 60 Minutes has existed, it has relied on these elements just as surely as the National Football League games that preceded it relied on some doubt over which team would win. In fact the tense but contrived interview with an administration official would have, in past seasons, been the very stuff of 60 Minutes’ popularity. It would have furnished CBS clips of (say) Steve Kroft, narrowing his eyes and asking grave questions of a powerful man, in close-up and with a glistening scalp.

Weiss’s intervention in the story was dramatic in its own bad way. Her underlings at CBS have all-but-openly denigrated her, and however reasonable her memo might have been, it evidently caused many of her employees to infer sinister motives. And 60 Minutes is, among news programs, one of the most patiently and slowly reported, so for a segment to undergo enormous changes at the last minute must feel unpleasant and invasive. CBS veteran Scott Pelley reportedly scolded Weiss for not giving her editorial advice earlier, after one of the several previous cuts of the segment. “It’s not a part-time job,” Pelley said, according to The New York Times. Staffers are not used to having segments delayed in the final hours, least of all by a 41-year-old upstart richer and more successful than they are. Bosses need to know when their edits are unwelcome, and when their takeovers feel hostile. Weiss’s drama-detector, so refined when seeking out news stories, seems to have failed her when avoiding it in her own newsroom.</div>

It&#39;s also stupid.  Two whole taps?  God forbid.

My counterargument would be that the users have already granted the first consent to Apple during the setup process, so the same number of consent prompts occur for both 1st and 3rd party applications.

We should make Apples&#39; own apps follow these rules, not loosen them for the other guys!

Look, I&#39;d understand if this was something Apple was exempting their own apps from but they are following the same rules, only they don&#39;t do cross-app tracking so users never see the pop-ups form Apple apps.

The regulator here is arguing that by abstaining from cross-app tracking they are giving themselves an unfair advantage.

Other developers have the option of not doing that kind of tracking which would result in not having the pop-ups.

Republicans could have a vote today to take away this orange turds tariff powers. It&#39;s based on everything now being an &quot;emergency&quot;.

How many Democrats have already voted for totalitarian laws against homelessness (remember Gavin Newsom&#39;s encampment sweeps?) and van lifers already? On the freedom to sleep outside, are Republicans and Democrats united in their karen-ness? Why should I vote Democratic when they&#39;ve already embraced totalitarian tactics against my preferred lifestyle?

Because you shouldn&#39;t be voting on one issue, regardless of how much it affects your objectively dumb lifestyle.

It would be a waste of time because the cult won&#39;t break from dear leader.

You clearly don&#39;t understand the idea of process and procedure.   The Speaker of the House can block ANYTHING from being brought to the floor, even if 95% of the members of Congress may want something, Johnson can stop it.   It would then require going through a process to get through that block.

I want a 20,000 percent tariff to be imposed on anything relating to golf, since that is the only thing the overgrown oompa loompa seems to care about.

All emergency powers laws should come with a footnote: Does not apply if you caused the emergency yourself.

It&#39;s to manipulate the midterm elections. Tariffs aren&#39;t as popular as they hoped.

Trump suffers from dementia, so he doesn&#39;t even know what he decided on an hour or two earlier.   Trump is also easily manipulated, so, just give him lavish praise, and he will do whatever you want.

Uncontrolled capitalism is what we want as long as its our uncontrolled capitalism.

In some ways China has much better consumer-protection laws than the USA.  Big business over there doesn&#39;t have nearly as much control over legislation and government operations.

It&#39;s rather ironic that our basis of government, originally intended for personal freedom, has been so heavily leveraged by big business that it can block the majority of common-sense limitations on market control.

Great Job UK!   You could be boosting domestic production and ensuring jobs for your autoworkers, but why not let China take it all over instead.  F-ing brilliant.

And this is before considering the potential weaponization of the platform.

Yeah, I wonder what the justification is/was? The UK has a bit of nervousness about China, so it seems odd to be doing this. Even if they were using MGs (owned/built by the Chinese, designed in the UK) you could understand it, but this?

My best guess would be the failure of the Parliamentary system to recognize the fact that legislators make horrible executives.  Which isn&#39;t really my best guess, it&#39;s just my snarkiest.

If it must be owned by a non-UK parent company, then one based in another democratic nation (and China foe) is almost as good.

British streets are narrower, junctions are often irregular, lots of roundabouts, lots of parking on the kerbs, tons of pedestrians and cyclists everywhere, and lots of roads where you have to take turns to get through. I shudder to think of what a self-driving car would do heading down Redington Road in Hampstead during a January morning school run, having to squeeze past an angry parent in a Cayenne with an inch to spare on either side and five seconds to do it before the driver coming the other way closes the gap and makes it impossible to move anywhere, and the rain is sheeting down and it’s completely overcast.

The only thing keeping Boeing alive is politics needing them.

Saying Boeing only exists because of politics is like saying hospitals only exist because of ambulances. Government contracts matter, but if Boeing disappeared tomorrow, airlines implode, supply chains break, and Airbus physically cannot scale fast enough to replace them. That&#39;s not politics. That’s industrial reality.

--
Service announcement: AC postings are necessary to protect the innocent from dismissive know-it-alls.

So, your assessment is that the only thing keeping Boeing alive is market inertia...

Not much of an endorsement, if you were thinking Boeing needs to be sustained.

There would be a chaos yes, but airlines would not implode, they would just try to manage in any way they can. Most obvious way to manage the chaos is to raise the ticket price and make less flights, possibly fire some staff.

There is SpaceX, who holds a monopoly without Boeing, as Roscosmos blew up its launch pad facility. You can pick between satan and a devil, SpaceX and Boeing. Pick one. Blue Origin and others try to reach the skies, and simply aren&#39;t there. Meanwhile, the ISS goes around the earth, needing service SOMEHOW.

NASA really wants an alternative; they may or not have let Boeing slide in desperation. A single vendor space flight program is in no one&#39;s interest.

First, Boeing is in this conversation because it is NASA&#39;s prime contractor for the CCP and such. So, really, we could write &#39;Boeing&#39; or &#39;NASA&#39;. Either way, same program. Same issue.

Second, you may not think much of Elon Musk, but consider that Boeing&#39;s corporate choices, just related to the 737 MAX line, and you see a disturbing pattern of questionable safety and engineering decisions. SpaceX has a somewhat (?) better record.

NASA does need second sourcing for manned spaceflight. Boeing has some work to do.

OK, I&#39;ll grant you a race to the bottom, with tax dollar financing. SpaceX has a better success rate, and also with the incumbent dangers of sole-source cartage.

I&#39;m no fan of these companies using subsidy funding (directly or indirectly) for stock buy-back.  But how does that &quot;plunder&quot; your 401k?  I think you misunderstand how that works.

How much more seriously could they have been?

IIRC, there were questions about Starliner reliability prior to launch, but Boeing assured everyone that they didn&#39;t need to test all that so much again, it was fine.

Safety. For manned flight, this has not been NASA&#39;s JOB ONE for a while, and we have evidence of that.

The whole issue appears to be that they did not formally announce that it was a problem.  This seems more like an internal NASA political issue, than a real one.Well, yes, and no.  Not declaring it a formal safety issue also meant that the full force of the NASA resources across all divisions were not brought to bear at the time, and that would also mean that next steps would need to be formally coordinated with high levels of consensus as to those next steps.  NASA, like many such large organizations, has a lot of groups that are the best of the best of the best in their field, but might not realize that other alternatives and approaches might be more appropriate.

In hindsight, NASA was in a no-win situation. Permitting Starliner to dock risked an accident. But to return it to Earth? Less dangerous?

They probably shouldn&#39;t have allowed astronauts to launch in the first place and forced Boeing to have a clean demo flight.

Not flying back was the right call, but letting them fly in the first place is questionable.

In an executive order, Donald Trump declared “Antifa” a terrorist organization. As it isn’t an organization, there aren’t leaders to target, so zealous conservatives took aim at Mark Bray, a Rutgers professor who wrote a book about fighting fascism eight years ago. The clumsy attempts to get him fired didn’t bother him—but the doxxing and death threats were enough to convince him he needed to leave America.

Guest: Mark Bray, assistant teaching professor at Rutgers, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.

Sunday’s talks between U.S. and Russian negotiators on how to end the war in Ukraine went absolutely nowhere, and the only surprise is that anyone might have been surprised by the deadlock.

President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff tried to pretend otherwise, calling the talks “productive and constructive.” But Yuri Ushakov, the Kremlin’s top diplomatic adviser, called them “rather unproductive.”

The basic fact and the principal obstacle to peace—which Trump and Witkoff seem to ignore—is that Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t want to stop fighting until he achieves total victory. He has said this many times, most recently on Friday, during his annual end-of-year marathon news conference, this one lasting four and a half hours, in which he declared that his war aims are unchanged and that compromise is out of the question.

Those aims, as he has also noted many times, include the complete subjugation of Ukraine—which he has said does not exist as a real country with a real culture or history and which he also claims is ruled by a “neo-Nazi regime” hell-bent on conquering Russia.

As long as that is the case, drawn-out detailed discussions about the borderline between Russia and Ukraine, the shape of a demilitarized zone in the Donbas province, and the precise configuration of security arrangements for Kyiv are all colossal wastes of time.

This is not a controversial point. Reuters reported on Monday that a recent U.S. intelligence analysis concluded that Putin has not abandoned his aims of capturing all of Ukraine and of reclaiming parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire. The story was credited to six sources who are familiar with the analysis.

Yet it seems that the American president, the main audience for intelligence analyses, either didn’t see this report or waved away its conclusion.

Perhaps Witkoff—who headed the U.S. delegation at the talks in Florida, along with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House staffer Josh Gruenbaum—really does believe, as he posted on social media, that “Russia remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine.” The problem here may be that Witkoff—a real-estate magnate with no experience in diplomacy and no prior knowledge of Russian affairs—thinks “peace” means nothing more than a ceasefire and the signing of a document.

In that sense, he isn’t so different from his longtime friend and fellow real-estate tycoon who currently resides in the White House. In October, Trump played a key role in pressuring Israel and Hamas to sign a ceasefire in Gaza and a hostage-for-prisoners exchange—a notable achievement. But this marked only the first phase—covering just the initial planks—of a 20-point peace plan. The next phase requires outside countries to station security forces inside Gaza, to maintain order and set the foundations for a new political authority. So far, none of the countries in the region have volunteered for the job. Trump proudly announced, at the signing ceremony for the first phase, that he would be chairman of a “board of peace” to supervise the subsequent phases—but he has done nothing to prod anyone into action. It seems that, in his mind, he got the ball rolling; if it stops rolling, if the fighting resumes (as it has to some extent already), then that’s not his fault.

Like Witkoff, he doesn’t seem to understand that making peace, actively enforcing a ceasefire or molding the foundations to sustain one, is not a one-off gesture. It requires persistent involvement, coupled with a thorough schooling in the causes of the war and the necessary preconditions for real peace.

Trump and Witkoff not only lack that specialized schooling but think they don’t need it. They view themselves as “dealmakers” and see no distinction between brokering a deal with the New York City Department of Buildings, some vendor on a construction project, or the Kremlin.

The significant thing here is that Putin recognized, and figured out how to exploit, this skewed outlook for his own benefit. In the early days of Trump’s second term, according to a remarkable story in Friday’s Wall Street Journal, Putin asked Trump to send Witkoff to Moscow for talks on Ukraine, offering to release an American prisoner if he did so, but only on the condition that Witkoff come alone, bringing no aides or CIA analysts with him.

Trump had chosen Witkoff to be his emissary on the Middle East, so the request must have come as a surprise. In the course of a rambling hourlong address to the Israeli Knesset in October, Trump said he thought Witkoff would have a “15-or-20-minute meeting” with Putin, adding, “Steve had no idea about Russia, had no idea about Putin too much, didn’t know too much about politics, wasn’t too interested.”

As we now know, this is what made Witkoff so appealing to Putin. The Russian president already had a sympathetic ear in Trump. Now he wanted to ensure that his chief American interlocutor was someone he could easily manipulate. It is no coincidence that retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s original appointee as envoy on Ukrainian matters, recently resigned; he found himself having nothing to do.

Trump ends his first year as the returning president believing, perhaps sincerely, that he is a peacemaker. But in fact two of the world’s most consequential conflicts rage on—the war in Ukraine, which he thought he could easily end, and the war in Gaza, which he thinks he has ended. And Trump doesn’t understand why.

Earlier this month, shortly after a series of Democratic wins in off-year elections, in the government shutdown, and in nosediving polls for President Donald Trump, a number of key Democrats made some unusual choices. First, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer began once again hawking the “Porch Pirates Act,” a bill that nobody seemed to have asked for and which could come back to haunt his party if passed. Then, this week, the Democratic National Committee announced it would not release its highly anticipated 2024 autopsy report.

Why, amid its first signs of life since the devastating 2024 election results, is the party seemingly determined to take multiple steps backward?

Let’s start with Gottheimer and porch pirates. Standing proud at a podium set up in his home district on Dec. 1, Gottheimer preached how private companies like Amazon, United Parcel Service, and FedEx should receive even greater protections than the federal agency the United States Postal Service. Currently, it’s a federal crime to steal mail out of any USPS post office, letter box, or mail receptacle, with violators facing a fine and prison time of no more than five years. The Porch Pirates Act would expand on this, adding Americans’ porches to the protected mail space, and it would make stealing a package from a private porch a federal crime with punishment of up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

The legislation would also give the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Justice Department, and federal task forces the authority to “fully investigate porch theft.” There are already laws on the books that cover these sorts of thefts and any potential greater conspiracies that might be involved in them. The Porch Pirates Act is not only redundant, it is excessively punitive, especially when Democrats have spent multiple general election cycles in a row battling the image among younger voters of having boosted mass incarceration during the 1990s. It seems unwise to reopen this fight.

The Porch Pirates Act was first introduced back in 2022, but has since seen basically no movement in Congress. Last year, Democrat Dean Phillips, a former representative and sponsor of the bill, went so far as to film a video where he shadowed a UPS driver who seemed amused at best to be sharing his route with a congressman. The final product looks and sounds alarmingly like a paid UPS commercial rather than a genuine explanation for why the Porch Pirates Act is necessary. Now, it seems like Gottheimer is taking a stab at attempting to push the legislation forward.

Let’s be clear, out of all the problems American consumers are currently facing, like the impending explosion of health care costs, stubbornly high inflation on everyday goods, and rising unemployment, why do some Democrats view package theft as among voters’ top concerns? (A previous version of the bill had 17 Democratic co-sponsors, though it’s unclear how many this one has.)

Besides the irrelevant nature of the Porch Pirates Act, it also stands to significantly contribute to the country’s mass incarceration problem. Penalizing thieves for stealing some Amazon packages with prison time and fines in the hundreds of thousands would drag an already overburdened criminal justice system down even further, inevitably also increasing the cost of running state and federal prisons. It’s well documented that mass incarceration leads to poor physical, psychological, and economic outcomes for people who experience imprisonment, which ends up hurting all American communities.

The USPS Office of Inspector General even published a white paper earlier this year acknowledging the pesky problem of package theft, and recommended collaborative strategies—not criminal penalties. “Offering and making use of flexible and secure delivery options, leveraging technology for enhanced tracking and theft prevention, [and] utilizing discreet packaging and package delivery placement” were among the recommended solutions.

The Porch Pirates Act also threatens to be a repeat of the infamous crime bill of the 1990s that led to a consistent rise in incarceration rates for the following decade, and which Democrats paid for dearly. The party surely does not want to be responsible for adding yet another pathway to prison.

Unfortunately, it appears Democrats are keen to end 2025 on the wrong foot. Instead of acknowledging its faults and reckoning with its consistently low approval ratings this year, the Democratic National Committee decided to continue ignoring its problems by scrapping the public release of its 2024 autopsy report. Claiming it would simply distract and divide the party, the lack of accountability now sets the stage for Democrats to repeat the same grave mistakes in the 2026 midterms and beyond. Party establishment gets to continue its iron grip, no fundamental changes will be made to Democrats’ platform, but hey, at least they can say they fought for Americans’ porches.

Ever since he returned to the White House, President Donald Trump has taken a sledgehammer to the federal workforce, attempting to purge tens of thousands of civil servants and shutter entire agencies. The Supreme Court has largely rubber-stamped these mass layoffs, even when they frustrated congressional commands expressly intended to direct, structure, and constrain the executive branch. Last month, however, Congress struck back in a little-noticed move that shifted power away from the Trump administration by outlawing further illegal firings and reversing those already underway. And on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston issued an injunction enforcing the new law, rejecting the government’s brazen attempt to defy it.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discuss the ruling and its encouraging implications for the separation of powers and a bolstered Congress subject to a president who refuses to acknowledge most limits on his authority. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Judge Susan Illston has been battling the administration over these layoffs for months now. Why was this latest round different?

Mark Joseph Stern: Because Congress did something that was long overdue—it wrote a statute that tightly constrains the executive branch. And Illston actually enforced it as written against the Trump administration.

Recall that during the shutdown, the president moved forward with mass layoffs across a bunch of federal agencies. They were euphemistically called “reductions in force.” People lost their jobs, their paychecks, their housing, even overseas postings. It was a disaster. And Trump claimed that the shutdown gave him broader leeway to purge the civil and foreign service and also to use those layoffs to inflict pain on Democrats because they were refusing to capitulate and reopen the government.

When Congress finally did end the shutdown on Nov. 12 and reopened the government, the funding bill that it passed included a provision that directly reversed Trump’s layoffs in two ways. First, the bill declared that “no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force” through late January, when funding expires again. That language clearly bars any further steps to lay off federal employees through the end of next month. Second, the bill said that any reduction in force “proposed, noticed, initiated, executed, implemented, or otherwise taken” during the shutdown “shall have no force or effect.” That language clearly reinstates any federal employee who was either told they’d be laid off during the shutdown or actually laid off.

To no one’s surprise, the administration immediately tried to repeal that language by reinterpreting it to mean almost nothing. Russell Vought—a Project 2025 author and now the director of the Office of Management and Budget—decreed that the first provision barred the government only from sending additional RIF notices through January but would allow it to complete the many, many layoffs that had already been initiated. Vought then said that the second provision applied only if a layoff notice went out during the shutdown. He claimed that if the employee had been warned earlier in the year that they were going to be fired and the actual firing happened during the shutdown, then the layoff was still lawful. The Trump administration tried to exploit that ridiculous interpretation by rescinding layoff notices that had been sent during the shutdown and immediately reissuing them to say: You have a new notice that came after the shutdown, so we can legally fire you.

On Wednesday, Illston shut this down. First, she said that there can be no layoffs through January, period. The bill announced that no federal funds can be used to carry out or implement RIFs. That means what it says. It does not allow the administration to fire people who previously received a notice that they’d be fired. Second, the judge ordered the reinstatement of everyone who was either told they’d be fired or actually fired during the shutdown. Remember, Congress reversed any RIF that was “noticed,” “executed,” or “implemented” during the shutdown. That covers everybody who was subject to any aspect of the RIF process. So, thanks to Illston’s order, all of those people now get their jobs back. That covers hundreds of employees right now, and possibly thousands more in the coming month, given the plans that Vought was developing for another round of the purges that Congress had outlawed.

How is it that congressional Republicans allowed this language? Did it just escape their notice? Were they secretly opposed to the RIFs as well?

No—this was a bargain struck by Senate Democrats. Republicans needed their help to end the shutdown, and a group of Democrats conditioned their votes on statutory language that would halt the RIFs. All Illston is doing here is enforcing that language in the face of the Trump administration brazenly defying Congress. I know that her decision will prompt another round of allegations that Illston is a “resistance judge”—especially since she tried to halt the RIFs earlier this year and the Supreme Court reversed her on the shadow docket. But there’s a difference between what happened in July and what’s happening now: The law has changed! Democrats in Congress saw that the existing law gave too much discretion to the executive branch. And they decided that if they were going to end the shutdown, they would at least force Congress to reassert its power and end that discretion.

That was, I think, a hugely successful move, not just for the Democratic Party and the civil service, but for Congress’ standing as a coordinate branch of government. We have been waiting for this since Trump came back into the White House. Congress has ceded the field to the presidency for nearly 11 months. It has handed over all of these powers to Trump, and the Supreme Court has overturned almost any judge who tries to kind of protect Congress’ prerogatives. Here, finally, we have Congress saying, in the most explicit language possible: We have the power of the purse. The money that we are appropriating may not be used by the Trump administration to purge the civil service. That gives me the first glimmer of hope I’ve had in a very long time that Democrats will be able to use their leverage to reassert Congress’ primacy over funding, rein in some of the White House’s abuses of power, and give SCOTUS no choice but to enforce the laws that they enact against him.

In one sense, this is a preliminary injunction from a single judge in a blue state that some will write off as “Trump derangement syndrome.” But for you, this is a masterclass in what Democrats can do—from the minority—when they theoretically have no power. This is, as you say, a flex for Congress. It’s a flex for text and statutory language. It’s a flex for using negotiations to leverage congressional prerogatives that have just been ceded to the executive branch.

And let’s also take a step back: Senate Democrats shouldn’t have been in this position in the first place. Trump’s mass layoffs were illegal. Congress did not allow him to dismantle these agencies by purging their workers. The courts should have been able to stop that. But the Supreme Court consistently stepped in and reversed them on the shadow docket, seemingly on the grounds that the executive branch has a lot of discretion and the statutes don’t tell us exactly what Congress wanted.

So the problem wasn’t just Trump abusing his power. It was also SCOTUS taking advantage of ambiguous statutory language and gaps that nobody had previously thought to exploit in the law. Congressional Democrats correctly identified that as one of the foundational issues here: not just Trump’s abuses, but the way the court was able to green-light those abuses. So they wrote language that would explicitly block Trump from misusing his power and force the courts, including SCOTUS, to implement congressional prerogatives. I do think that Illston will be upheld on appeal; I’m not even sure that the administration will try to appeal this to the Supreme Court. This is cut-and-dried, because Democrats in Congress saw the gaps that needed to be plugged and plugged them.

            <div id="article-text">Opinion Register readers of a certain age will recall the events of the 1970s, where a shortage of fuel due to various international disagreements resulted in queues, conflicts, and rising costs. One result was a drive toward greater efficiencies. Perhaps it&#39;s time to apply those lessons to the current memory shortage.

As memory prices continue to rise, it is time engineers reconsidered their applications and toolchains&#39; voracious appetite for memory. Does a simple web page really need megabytes to show a user the modern equivalent of Hello World? Today&#39;s Windows Task Manager executable occupies 6 MB of disk space. It demands almost 70 MB before it will show a user just how much of a memory hog Chrome is these days. The original weighs in at 85 KB on disk. Its successor is not orders of magnitude more functional.

Those who remember effective software running in kilobytes rather than gigabytes have long shaken their heads at the profligate ways of modern engineering. But as tech progress marched on and memory densities seemed destined to increase without end, protesting about bloat felt a lot like &quot;old man yells at cloud.&quot;

Enter the AI boom. As the world races to pack datacenters full of computing gear, memory prices have rocketed in recent months and currently show no signs of returning to levels where a developer could shrug and bolt on another multi-megabyte framework to meet an arbitrary user requirement.

Developers should consider precisely how much of a framework they really need and devote effort to efficiency. Managers must ensure they also have the space to do so. The energy spent securing a toolchain should go into checking its efficiency too.

It is often joked that the memory and computing power that enabled humans to land on the Moon compare poorly to those of a modern smartphone. However, it is not so very long ago that perfectly usable applications and operating systems ran from floppy disks on devices with RAM measured in kilobytes rather than megabytes.

Reversing decades of application growth will not happen overnight. It requires a change of thinking and a different outlook. Toolchains must be rethought, and rewards should be given for compactness, both at rest and in operation.

In the 1970s, a shortage of energy spurred efficiency. In the 2020s, a shortage of computer memory might finally result in software that doesn&#39;t fill every byte with needless fluff. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Non-human travel agents are here. Virgin Atlantic earlier this month installed an AI travel agent on its website, calling the web-bound chatbot &quot;the future of travel planning.&quot;

The project, dubbed Virgin Atlantic Concierge, was implemented by Tomoro, a UK-based AI design consultancy, in partnership with OpenAI.

The Concierge service supports typed or spoken input, assuming the Virgin Atlantic site visitor has granted permission for device microphone activation. The bot, which can respond using simulated speech as well as text, takes longer processing spoken input than typed input, presumably dbecause it has to process captured audio using a speech-to-text model.

Sam Netherwood, co-founder and director of Tomoro, spoke to The Register about the development of Concierge and the project&#39;s goals.

&quot;Initially, Virgin engaged us,&quot; Netherwood said. &quot;We partner quite closely with OpenAI. Virgin also had already entered into an agreement with OpenAI. And so that&#39;s how it came together in the first place. And initially we just did a proof-of-concept over about six weeks.&quot;

The goal, he explained, was to test some hypotheses about whether the technology could deliver an AI interaction experience that would be valuable and to explore how that experience might feel from a consumer perspective in light of Virgin Atlantic&#39;s ambitions.

&quot;So the proof-of-concept that we built was using OpenAI&#39;s real-time speech-to-speech model,&quot; said Netherwood. &quot;That&#39;s built for ultra-low latency, really natural, human-feeling conversation. But there are still some question marks around the intelligence of that model.&quot;

Concierge is an agent, meaning that it&#39;s an AI model given access to tools and APIs. As Netherwood observed, the agent doesn&#39;t work if it can&#39;t access Virgin Atlantic&#39;s APIs to fetch flight information and book travel – it wouldn&#39;t be useful if it just dealt with a subset of pre-canned routes or certain holidays. The agent also needs to be able to determine the user&#39;s intent, in order to properly differentiate between support requests, travel planning, and other scenarios.

&quot;So instruction following has to be really good,&quot; he said. &quot;Tool calling has to be really good. And actually in the proof-of-concept we were like, &#39;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re quite there yet.&#39;&quot;

That was when OpenAI&#39;s Realtime API was in beta testing. In August, the Realtime API reached general availability and the project advanced toward its public release.

&quot;Now we have a better version,&quot; Netherwood said. &quot;I think we&#39;re probably not a million miles away now from us having the tool-calling accuracy and the instruction following-accuracy to enhance the experience with a much more natural conversational exchange, which really was like one of the fundamental things that Virgin Atlantic challenged us to do.&quot;

New infrastructure was not required. Netherwood said that while edge computing holds a lot of promise for being able to extend Concierge functionality to interactions when boarding an airplane, for example, the focus of the initial release has been on the web portal.

&quot;At the moment,&quot; Netherwood said, &quot;we&#39;re only embedded in Virgin Atlantic&#39;s website, not behind any authentication and the reason for that is just that their mobile app is coming – they&#39;ve built a new mobile app from the ground up. I think once the Concierge is connected to an account, to a person&#39;s user ID, it becomes much more valuable because the itinerary that the agent creates can persist over time and can be added to.&quot;

Presently, Netherwood explained, the agent can access Virgin Atlantic&#39;s flight and holiday APIs, enabling it to find and book flights and handle holiday planning. It can answer questions about the company&#39;s Flying Club loyalty program and basic support in the interest of call center deflection – discouraging calls to call centers.

Netherwood couldn&#39;t provide a breakdown of the kinds of requests being made, but said a lot of people just want basic support questions, about baggage allowances and the like, answered. For unplanned events, like airport disruptions, the agent will fall back to the website when it doesn&#39;t have relevant information.

The Concierge in its present form also stops short of completing travel transactions – it deep links to the Virgin Atlantic website to handle credit card purchases. Netherwood, however, said that will change in the mobile app.

Safety, Netherwood said, has been top of mind.

&quot;A huge part actually of this MVP [minimum viable product], a huge consideration, was safety because we&#39;re not behind a login or authentication,&quot; he said. &quot;Anybody can come to this thing and use it. So malicious behavior, prompt injection, jailbreaking, all of those things become a real big concern.&quot;

He said Tomoro has a lot of experience with guardrails and has a robust multi-stage system for making these kinds of solutions safe, so there wasn&#39;t any need to do anything particularly novel in terms of safety.

&quot;The interesting things from that perspective, I think, are actually conversational design and how easy it can be to break and absolutely destroy the illusion of intelligence in these systems,&quot; he said.

As an example, he pointed to the Concierge&#39;s off-topic guardrails, designed to keep conversations relevant to travel. Unless you&#39;ve been careful about how you design the conversational space by providing context and conversation history, he said, natural interactions like people saying &quot;thank you,&quot; or &quot;no&quot; in response to a question, may confuse the system.

&quot;In the north of England, people use the word &#39;ta&#39; to mean thank you,&quot; Netherword said. &quot;We did have a couple of occasions where somebody actually said &#39;ta&#39; to the agent and it thought they were speaking Swedish. So it replied in Swedish, &#39;hey, uh sorry, only English language for now.&#39;&quot;

Netherwood said his team did a huge amount of work trying to balance safety with making sure that the agent can handle natural conversation that changes between different intents.

As to the expense of operating the bot, Netherwood insisted that the API calls and backend infrastructure are not that costly. &quot;In the future we will be exploring reasoning models, particularly in itinerary building when those itineraries get complex and where we can afford latency in the conversation,&quot; he said. &quot;But right now [the cost] is pretty trivial.&quot;

Reasoning models typically cost more to run than their non-reasoning relatives because they process more tokens over time. But that may be necessary to help Concierge and other agents consider the requirements of complex itineraries, like distances between locations and travel times.

Netherwood said that you have to be very careful when building a complex itinerary to ensure that the agent has enough situational awareness. Otherwise, he posited, you might get a situation where you ask the agent to book a restaurant reservation and it requires a 75 minute cab ride, despite the fact that you&#39;re already booked to visit a museum 30 minutes before the reservation time.

&quot;The models are capable of [itinerary planning],&quot; he said. &quot;I think they&#39;re going to be really capable of that now that we have more effective reasoning models.&quot;

So far, Netherwood said, the launch of Concierge has gone well. &quot;We haven&#39;t had jailbreaks,&quot; he said. &quot;We haven&#39;t had all of the the nightmare things that you would not want to happen.&quot;

One of the next steps beyond improving the AI agent itself involves educating people on how to communicate in natural language with agents.

Consumers, Netherwood said, are used to interacting with chatbots that follow a programmatic tree-based structure – banking support bots that predated generative AI, for example. So they often fail to engage with agents in a way that takes advantage of their capabilities.

&quot;So for example, you can have a really nice conversation with the agent,&quot; he explained. &quot;You can say, &#39;I want to go to New York in March next year, long weekend for our anniversary. It would be fantastic if we could stay somewhere like 20 minutes walking distance from Central Park, but not too expensive in terms of the hotel. We&#39;d like to spend the money on maybe flying upper class,&#39; and [the agent] will go find you that experience. But of course that&#39;s not necessarily intuitive when people are used to going into these systems and saying, &#39;holiday now&#39; or &#39;speak to agent now.&#39;&quot;

(Sometimes, people just want to speak to another human.)

Netherwood said his team has been exploring ways to help people communicate more effectively with AI models and he believes that real-time speech eventually will prove really helpful for these sorts of interactions.

&quot;We just have to be in the place where we can make sure that the tool-calling and instruction-following accuracy is there,&quot; he said, &quot;because the last thing you want is a lovely, natural feeling conversation with an agent and then 50 percent of the time it can&#39;t go find a flight or there&#39;s there&#39;s an error.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Computer History Museum software curator Al Kossow has successfully retrieved the contents of the over-half-a-century old tape found at the University of Utah last month.

UNIX V4, the first ever version of the UNIX operating system in which the kernel was written in the then-new C programming language, has been successfully recovered from a 1970s nine-track tape drive. You can download it from the Internet Archive, and run it in SimH. On Mastodon, &quot;Flexion&quot; posted a screenshot of it running under SGI IRIX.

Last month, we wrote about the remarkable discovery of a forgotten tape with a lost early version of Unix, found by Professor Robert Ricci at the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah. At the time, we quoted the redoubtable Kossow, who also runs Bitsavers, as saying that it &quot;has a pretty good chance of being recoverable.&quot; Well, he was right, and at the end of last week, he did it. Ricci also shared a video clip on Mastodon.

There&#39;s a video of the recovery here. It&#39;s only slightly over five minutes long, but then, UNIX V4 wasn&#39;t very big yet: for instance, the kernel was some 27 kB of code.

The data was recovered using the readtape program by the Computer History Museum&#39;s Len Shustek. Since few of us in the microcomputer world deal with magtapes much, the Greaseweazle tool for archiving old floppy tapes might be a more familiar comparison: rather than trying to copy the bytes or sectors from media – in other words, the processed digital data – both readtape and Greaseweazle sample and record the raw magnetic flux variations. Those can then be used to reconstruct the digital data, making some error recovery possible. In this case, only two blocks wouldn&#39;t read properly and there was enough to reconstruct their contents.

So, in the recovered files on the Internet Archive, you can see there&#39;s a 1.6 gigabyte file created from a tape that only held 40 MB or so of data. You probably don&#39;t want to download that.

Fortunately, Angelo Papenhoff offers a processed version, complete with a README telling you how to run it. For further guidance, then on Reddit, drop_table_allusers suggests:

In the directory where you downloaded all the Unix v4 files, start SimH pdp-11 executable and pass the boot.ini found in the Unix v4 files as parameter. Then press &#39;k&#39;, type &#39;unix&#39;, press enter and it boots…

It&#39;s very small: it contains around 55,000 lines of code, of which about 25,000 lines are in C, with under 1,000 lines of comments. But then, the late Dennis M. Ritchie and co-creator Ken Thompson were very definitely Real Programmers, and as is recorded in ancient wisdom:

Real Programmers don&#39;t need comments – the code is obvious.

Thompson is still active, and recently did his second oral history interview with the CHM, aptly titled A Computing Legend Speaks.

We&#39;ve seen a lot of misunderstanding of this and what it represents online, so we&#39;ll try to set it in some kind of context.

The very first version of Unix, later known as the &quot;Zeroth edition&quot;, was hand-coded in assembly language by Thompson in 1969. He wrote it for a spare PDP-7 at Bell Labs, a Digital Equipment Corporation minicomputer from 1965. The PDP-7 was an 18-bit machine: it handled memory in 18-bit words. This was so long ago that things like the eight-bit byte had not yet been standardized. PDP-7 UNIX was reconstructed from printouts between 2016 and 2019.

It did well enough that a few years later, Thompson got his hands on a PDP-11. Thompson rewrote his OS for this 16-bit machine – still in assembly language – to create UNIX First Edition. At first, the machine had a single RS11 hard disk, for a grand total of half a megabyte of storage, although the rebuilt source code is from a later machine with a second hard disk.

It was followed later the same year by UNIX v2, still on a PDP-11/20. As we reported earlier this year, something like a beta version of UNIX V2 has recently been reconstructed.

UNIX V3 followed in 1972, which introduced the new feature of pipes. This was the version on which the then-new C programming language was first written.

Now, the long-lost UNIX V4 has been found and its files recovered. This was the first version where much of the kernel was rewritten in C. UNIX V4 only ran on a higher-end model of PDP-11, the PDP-11/45.

These days, the nature and evolution of UNIX in its early stages is not well understood. For instance, some things happened simply because Ken and Dennis were working on very limited hardware. At one point, they had a single DEC RK05 hard disk, which held a massive 1.5 MB. When they got access to a second hard drive, they moved all the home directories to it. These were held in /usr – it was short for &quot;users,&quot; and it contained the home directories of both ken and dmr, meaning that it also contained most of the binary files – the actual programs constituting the OS itself. This caused them a problem: how do you mount the second hard disk when the mount command itself is on that disk? The solution: a special /sbin directory on the first hard disk which contained tools needed to, among other things, access any additional hard disks.

Rob Landley wrote an excellent explanation of the history of the split on the Busybox mailing list 15 years ago: Understanding the bin, sbin, usr/bin , usr/sbin split. Landley knows his stuff: he&#39;s the author of Toybox, which is a replacement for Bruce Perens&#39;s BusyBox multi-command binary – as used in Alpine Linux.

Today, it&#39;s part of Unix lore that there&#39;s an important functional distinction between the binaries in the root directory (/bin, /sbin, /lib and so on) and those kept under the /usr tree (/usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/lib and so on). Trying to reconcile this split is a process called the usr merge, and amusingly, the latest Alpine Linux 3.23 has not yet completed it, although it was planned to.

UNIX started out as a quick hack by two geniuses in their spare time, so that they could use a spare computer – an extremely rare thing in the 1960s – to play a videogame one of them had written: SPACEWAR, a version of Computer Space, the first ever commercial video game.

The project they were working on for their day jobs, the MULTICS operating system, became unfairly famous for being huge and over complicated. In fact, it was used for years, and is missed by its former users.

Those two geniuses, Ken and Dennis, wrote something tiny and simple, and in keeping with that, they used tiny cryptic abbreviations and very short file and directory names. Their colleague, the great Brian Kernighan – the &quot;K&quot; in &quot;K&R C&quot; and &quot;AWK&quot; – even suggested the name UNICS as a joke.

The problem is that this tiny, experimental OS escaped the lab. Version 6 got out and became the basis of the famous Lions book, the source of probably the most famous code comment of all time:

(It&#39;s at line 2238 in the annotated source code, if you&#39;re curious. The comment itself inspired a book.)

Unix V7 is the one that did the real damage: it went viral and its descendants, offshoots, and rewrites were widely adopted by industry and academia.

Now, it has grown into a bloated mess millions of times bigger than the OS which inspired it. Those jokey cryptic filenames in cryptic folders are now enshrined as holy writ, and the people maintaining the systems have forgotten their origins.

Meanwhile, the original developers kept working away, improving it and refactoring it and simplifying the design, all the way up to the Tenth Edition – then, it was radically rewritten to become the network-aware Plan 9 from Bell Labs. Today, work on that continues as 9front, which we&#39;ve written about, including its place in history.

Now, though, a crucial early evolutionary step has been found, imaged, and works. It&#39;s almost as if it were a Christmas miracle! ®

            <h2>Oracle's new AI-enhanced support portal leaves users fuming</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/23/oracles_new_aienhanced_support_portal/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Oracle&#39;s new AI-powered support portal is frustrating customers and support engineers who are struggling to find the basics, such as old tickets, links to database patch programs and release schedules for current databases.

The new support portal from Big Red — My Oracle Portal or MOS — which went live in early December, has been frustrating customers and support staff for the last few weeks.

Oracle has yet to respond to a request for comment.

In November, Greg Parikh, Oracle veep for information development and operations, said in a blog post that the MOS portal offers new features, including AI-powered interactions, streamlined navigation, improved search capabilities, and enhanced knowledge access.

It is perhaps remarkable that in making these improvements, Oracle seems to have made the service worse.

One support professional who spoke to The Register said users were increasingly facing a chaotic situation with MOS. &quot;Obviously, Oracle is using this new AI to cover all customer needs, which is not working that well. Support note numbers get no satisfactory results, automatic service requests can no longer be created by Oracle customers, and patches and fixes are no longer visible because the indices are deleted.&quot;

Deutsche Oracle Anwendergruppe (DOAF), the German-speaking user group for Oracle users, also noted unreliable and incomplete search, for example, the Exadata Master Note — formerly Doc-ID 888828.1 — does not appear in the search results. There has also been a loss of favorites and personalization in the switch to the new portal, the user group said.

Meanwhile, support professional has to waste their time contending with broken or internal links and limited patch search and downloads, the user group said.

Frustration also boiled over onto Reddit, as users shared their experiences with the new Oracle portal.

Users pointed out IDs had completely changed, such that searching for 888.1 — the Primary Note for Database Proactive Patch Program — or 555.1 — database 19c Recommended One-off patches returns error message KA912 as the top result. &quot;Links to other documents, which still reference the old IDs, are currently failing for me,&quot; one user said.

Others said they had to waste time recovering information which was previously in easy reach. &quot;Even finding ‘Release schedule of Current Database releases&#39; took me several logins and searches. And the resulting view is definitely worse; at least they could hide the right panel, which effectively shrinks the readable window,&quot; another said.

Eric Guyer, founding partner at Oracle and SAP advisory and consulting firm Remend, said while the old portal was basically all access, to everything, for anyone with an Oracle Customer Support Identifier (CSI), the new portal seemed to have become more minimalist, tightly controlled, and chat-bot driven.

&quot;People used to the old portal will wonder where everything went. Bug or feature I don&#39;t know yet. Might be great… or it might be another signal that Oracle&#39;s focus is elsewhere,&quot; he said.

Iain Saunderson, CTO of Spinnaker Support, which provides support for Oracle and SAP, said the introduction of the new portal was affecting customer onboarding to alternative support to Oracle. &quot;The frustration from the community around the portal launch is that Oracle hasn&#39;t consulted their users. It doesn&#39;t work. People can&#39;t get to the information they need. We&#39;ve had a few concerns from prospective customer who are concerned about their ability to do business in MOS.&quot;

Some readers may be keen to point out that the apparent degradation of its customer support using AI comes at the same time Oracle has seemingly bet the company on AI. In the autumn, Oracle announced a $300 billion cloud compute contract with OpenAI, but KeyBanc analysts warned that Big Red may need to borrow roughly $100 billion over the next four years to build the datacenters required. Concerns over debt and the cost of building AI infrastructure have meant Oracle has lost around a third of its value since it peaked in September, more than the value of the OpenAI deal. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! The bork desk has temporarily reopened during the festive period. The tech world might be having a nap on the sofa after one mince pie too many, but bork never sleeps.

Take this example of some digital signage at PizzaExpress. Spotted by an eagle-eyed Register reader at Edinburgh airport, the screen occupies the space where customers might have once found a generic bit of printed or colored plastic.

However, progress is progress, and every bit of space must now be occupied by migraine-inducing digital signage, capable of displaying whatever important messages the marketing machine thinks prospective consumers must see.

Including, in this case, the Windows desktop. Because there are few things more likely to lure a weary traveler into an emporium of pizza dough and tomato sauce than some forlorn icons and a reminder of the time when Windows Media Player ruled the roost.

It&#39;s not clear exactly what has befallen the screen. Some of the icons reference ViPlex Express, a tool for managing digital signage. However, unless the software has a bork mode, or the establishment is seeking to attract the sort of Register reader who likes to snap shots of screens in distress, the lights are on, but nobody&#39;s home.

And then there is the tempting &quot;test&quot; file. The thumbnail isn&#39;t giving away many clues about its content - we hope that whatever it contains won&#39;t put anyone off their pizza or force a sad-faced engineer to do the walk of shame to HR.

The operating system itself is probably Windows 10, judging by the icons, and will, we&#39;re sure, either have been enrolled in Microsoft&#39;s Extended Security Updates program or be a version still supported since October.

We look forward to the next menu update. Joining the classic Margherita and American Hot will be Scottish Bork, with the famous Sloppy Giuseppe replaced by Slapdash IT. ®

            <div id="article-text">Robot taxis are coming to The Register’s London home in 2026.

Chinese web giant Baidu on Monday announced that a pilot of its Apollo Go robo-ride service will take place in the UK’s capital sometime in the first half of 2026, with help from Uber.

Uber declared itself “excited to accelerate Britain&#39;s leadership in the future of mobility, bringing another safe and reliable travel option to Londoners next year.”

Lyft is also teaming with Baidu in London.

“Our hybrid network - AVs and drivers working together - will serve all of London’s travel needs,” wrote CEO David Risher. “We’re working closely with Transport for London regulators and local communities to expand the rideshare market and create more opportunities for everyone.”

Baidu pointed out that its London experiments represent another entry to a “major right-hand drive market” made possible by its operations in former British colony Hong Kong.

When Uber and other rideshare companies entered new markets during the 2010s, they often scoffed at existing regulations and just started operations before lawmakers figured out how to regulate their services. In the UK, Uber became the subject of protests by cab drivers who saw the service as stealing their livelihoods and devaluing their hard-won – and expensive – licenses.

Uber eventually won a license to operate, then lost it, twice.

This time around, the UK has rolled out the welcome mat for robot cars under 2024’s Automated Vehicles Act.

Robo-taxis have conducted millions of uneventful rides, but remain susceptible to problems.

Last weekend, blackouts in San Francisco caused traffic lights to go dark. Waymo robo-cabs stopped at intersections – seemingly waiting for lights to change – causing traffic jams as they blocked human drivers.

The Register has covered many serious accidents and crashes involving robo-cars, plus moments when clanker chauffeurs struggled to navigate local traffic.

Infosec researchers have found attackers can easily confuse the machines, which can lead to dangerous outcomes.

Anyone with links to the livestreams could view them — no credentials required, as reported by 404 Media.

The livestreams connected to more than 60 of Flock’s AI-powered surveillance cameras were left available to view on the web, allowing someone to see live feeds of each location without needing a username or password, according to findings from tech YouTuber Benn Jordan and 404 Media.

Flock is a technology company that works with thousands of law enforcement agencies and businesses to deploy a network of AI-powered cameras across the country. It also recently partnered with Ring, giving Flock customers the ability to request footage from users in Ring’s Neighbors app. As noted by 404 Media, many of Flock’s cameras are made to scan a vehicle’s license plates. However, the feeds exposed to the internet connect to Flock’s Condor cameras, which can pan, tilt, and zoom to automatically track people and vehicles.

“I watched a man leave his house in the morning in New York,” Jordan says in his video. “I watched a woman jogging alone on a forest trail in Georgia. This trail had multiple cameras, and I could watch a man rollerblade and then take a break to watch rollerblading videos on his phone. How? Because the camera’s AI automatically zoomed in on it — just like it zoomed in on a couple arguing at a street market in Atlanta.”

Jordan worked with Jon “GainSec” Gaines — who previously uncovered security flaws within Flock’s system — to find the live feeds on Shodan, a search engine containing a database of devices connected to the internet.

As reported by 404 Media, the two located dozens of Flock live feeds and administrator control panels, where they could not only view the streams but also freely download video archives from the last 30 days, change settings, delete footage, view log files, and run diagnostics, as reported by 404 Media and Jordan. Anyone with links to the stream could access them, no credentials required, according to 404 Media.

In some cases, Jordan and 404 Media’s Jason Koebler visited the locations of the Flock cameras, where they were filmed and displayed on the openly accessible livestreams.

“This was a limited misconfiguration on a very small number of devices, and it has since been remedied,” a Flock spokesperson said in a statement to 404 Media. Flock didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.

﻿Belkin squeezed a lot of functionality into this smartphone accessory, but not without some compromises.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Belkin’s Stage PowerGrip has shown me that I should be asking more from a wireless magnetic power bank than just boosting battery life while it hangs off the back of my phone. Its clever design adds layers of extra functionality, and the inclusion of a retractable two-way charging cable expands the number of devices you can charge without always having to remember to pack a cord. It also improves your smartphone’s ergonomics when taking photos, but that’s one of a few places where the PowerGrip’s functionality feels disappointingly limited.

The PowerGrip is much chunkier and heavier than I expected, which turned out not to be a bad thing. At 272 grams, most of the PowerGrip’s weight comes from its 9,300mAh battery, but I wouldn’t opt for anything smaller because I like knowing I’ve got enough power to fully recharge my iPhone with headroom to top off other devices like my watch and earbuds.

There are lighter wireless power banks available with more capacity, but the PowerGrip’s heft has some benefits. Most consumers will buy the accessory to make their smartphone feel more like a digital camera, and the PowerGrip mostly delivers. It attaches to the back of any Qi2, MagSafe, or Pixelsnap-compatible smartphone. The magnetic connection feels secure but doesn’t feel quite as strong as the PopSocket I regularly use. I’m not worried my iPhone is going to fall off on its own, but accidentally bumping my phone while I’m only holding the PowerGrip could send my device tumbling.

The protruding grip is sizable and makes your phone feel like a sturdy DSLR. I’ve never found a comfortable one-handed way to shoot with my iPhone that also feels secure, but it’s easy with the PowerGrip, and its weight adds some welcome stability that usually requires two hands.

The design allows the PowerGrip to stand on its edge and function as a smartphone stand. You can attach your phone and make hands-free recordings or video calls, or take advantage of iOS’ StandBy mode on your bedside table. It’s functionality I never intended to use, but have found myself using quite frequently.

The PowerGrip has a dedicated shutter button that connects to your smartphone over Bluetooth. Pressing it once snaps a photo, while holding it down triggers a video recording until released. I would prefer the button positioned at the top of the grip instead of its front edge. I also frequently found myself missing the additional settings dials on my Sony mirrorless camera that are conveniently located within thumb’s reach.

There are other smartphone camera grips, like the Fjorden Pro and the magnetic Leica Lux Grip, that feature more controls, including customizable dials and two-stage shutter buttons for controlling focus. They’re both considerably more expensive than the $80 PowerGrip, and those added controls only work with third-party camera apps, so I understand Belkin’s decision not to take that approach. But with the PowerGrip attached and hanging a half-inch off the bottom of my iPhone 16 Pro, my thumb struggled to reach the onscreen controls in the iOS camera app without awkwardly adjusting my grip. More often than not, one-handed shooting still required screen taps from my other hand, which I found frustrating.

Even more frustrating is the PowerGrip’s power output. Wireless charging rates are limited to just 7.5W, which feels glacial when Belkin has already implemented faster 25W Qi2.2 rates on other chargers. It takes hours to fully charge my iPhone, and it’s not much faster switching to a cable. The PowerGrip has an additional USB-C port and a built-in 30-inch USB-C charging cable. Belkin says the power output maxes out at 15W, but I measured a little over 18W while charging a OnePlus 12 with Plugable’s USB-C voltage meter. However, that output is shared when charging three devices simultaneously. Charging rates for the OnePlus 12 dropped to less than 5W while also wirelessly charging my iPhone and a Kobo e-reader using the retractable cable.

Compared to more expensive camera grip accessories like the $395 Leica Lux Grip or the $149.95 ShiftCam ProGrip that only feature batteries to power themselves, it’s understandable that Belkin had to settle for some compromises to get its Stage PowerGrip on shelves for $79.99. You’ll just want to really take those compromises into consideration when deciding if it’s worth it for you. If you like a lot of functionality in one accessory, it’s worth considering. If you want more charging performance or a grip with more photography-focused functionality, you’ll be better off juggling multiple accessories.

In case you’ve waited until the very last minute to buy Christmas gifts, and there’s a Switch 2 on your shopping list, you’ve really lucked out here. Not only is Nintendo’s powerful handheld readily available online and in stores, it’s still $50 off for the best console bundle you can buy. The set that includes a Switch 2 and Mario Kart World is typically $499.99 (saving you $29 compared to buying the $79 game separately), but you have another — perhaps final! — chance to get it for $449.99. Currently, Best Buy and Target are honoring this limited-time price.

We’ve written about this deal a lot over the past couple of weeks at The Verge, mostly because it was the most unexpected thing to happen in the same year when Nintendo hiked prices on Switch 2 accessories as well as the original Switch. The company made it clear back when the console launched in June that the bundle wouldn’t be around forever, and it shared yesterday on X that quantities are now limited.

The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 7.9-inch LCD display, magnetically attached Joy-Con 2 controllers, backwards compatibility with most original Switch games, and exclusive titles including Donkey Kong Bananza and Kirby Air Riders. Read our review.

            <h2>How Last Samurai Standing adds kinetic action to the Battle Royale formula</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2025-12-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Junichi Okada talks about the new Netflix series and how his role as action planner touches nearly every part of it.

Last Samurai Standing begins with a familiar premise. Desperate samurai dispossessed by the restoration of the emperor enter into a deadly game for a life-changing cash prize — all for the entertainment of anonymous elites. Unlike its inspirations Battle Royale and Squid Game, however, Last Samurai Standing’s violence is chaotic, fast-paced, and kinetic, though it hides a careful choreography that makes the series a more electric proposition than its predecessors.

Viewers have Junichi Okada to thank for that. As well as starring in and producing Last Samurai Standing, he serves as the series’ action planner. Many will be familiar with the results of an action planner’s work — sometimes called an action director, elsewhere a “coordinator,” and even “choreographer” — though perhaps not what the role entails. In the case of Last Samurai Standing, it’s a role that touches on nearly every aspect of the production, from the story to the action itself.

“I was involved from the script stage, thinking about what kind of action we wanted and how we would present it in the context of this story,” Okada tells The Verge. “If the director [Michihito Fujii] said, ‘I want to shoot this kind of battle scene,’ I would then think through the content and concept, design the scene, and ultimately translate that into script pages.”

The close relationship between the writer and director extends to other departments, too. Though an action planner’s role starts with managing fight scenes and stunt performers, they also liaise with camera, wardrobe, makeup, and even editorial departments to ensure fight scenes cohere with the rest of the production.

It’s a role which might appear a natural progression for Okada, who is certified to teach Kali and Jeet Kune Do — a martial art conceived by Bruce Lee — and holds multiple black belts in jiujitsu. Though the roots of his progression into action planning can be traced back further, to 1995 when he became the youngest member of J-pop group V6.

“Dance experience connects directly to creating action,” he says. “[In both] rhythm and control of the body are extremely important.” Joining V6 at the age of 15, that experience has made Okada conscious of how he moves in relation to a camera during choreography, how he is seen within the structure of a shot, and, critical to action planning, how to navigate all of that safely from a young age.

That J-pop stardom also offered avenues into acting, initially in roles you might expect for a young pop star: comic heartthrobs and sitcom sons. But he was steadily able to broaden his output. A starring turn in Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Hana followed, as did voice acting in Studio Ghibli’s Tales From Earthsea and From Up on Poppy Hill. A more telling departure was a starring role in 2007’s SP, in which he played a rookie in a police bodyguard unit, for which he trained for several years under shootfighting instructor Yorinaga Nakamura.

“What I care about is whether audiences feel that ‘this man really lives here as a samurai.’”

In the years since, Okada has cemented himself as one of Japan’s most recognizable actors, hopping between action starring roles in The Fable to sweeping period epics like Sekigahara. Those two genres converge in his Last Samurai Standing role of Shujiro, a former Shogunate samurai now reduced to poverty, working through his PTSD and reckoning with his bloodthirsty past in the game. These days, it’s less of a concern that the character butts up against his past idol image, he suggests. “What I care about is whether audiences feel that ‘this man really lives here as a samurai.’”

For Okada’s work on Last Samurai Standing, as both producer and action planner, that involved lacing high-octane but believable action with the respect for history and character studies of the period dramas he loves. “Rather than being 100 percent faithful to historical accuracy,” he adds, “my goal was to focus on entertainment and story, while letting the ‘DNA’ and beauty of Japanese period drama gently float up in the background.”

A focus on what he defines as “‘dō’ — movement,” pure entertainment that “never lets the audience get bored” punctuated — with “‘ma,’” the active emptiness that connects those frenetic moments. Both can be conversations, even if one uses words and another communicates dialogue through sword blows. This is most apparent when Shujiro faces his former comrade Sakura (Yasushi Fuchikami) inside a claustrophobic bank vault that serves as a charnel house for the game’s less fortunate contestants.

“The whole battle is divided into three sequences,” Okada says. The first starts with a moment of almost perfect stillness, a deep breath, before the two launch into battle. “A fight where pride and mutual respect collide,” he says, “and where the speed of the techniques reaches a level that really surprises the audience.” It’s all captured in one, zooming take with fast, tightly choreographed action reminiscent of Donnie Yen and Wu Jing in Kill Zone.

So intense is their duel that both shatter multiple swords. The next phase sees them lash out in a more desperate and brutal manner with whatever weapons they find. Finally, having fought to a weary stalemate, the fight becomes, Okada concludes, “a kind of duel where their stubbornness and will are fully exposed” as they hack at each other with shattered blades and spear fragments.

It’s a rhythm that many fights in Last Samurai Standing follow, driven by a string of physical and emotional considerations that form the basis of an action planner’s tool kit: how and why someone fights based on who they are and their environment. Here it is two former samurai in an elegant and terrifyingly fast-paced duel. Elsewhere we see skill matched against brutality, or inexperience against expertise.

“I define a clear concept for each sequence,” Okada says, before he opens those concepts up to the broader team. From there, he might add notes, but in Last Samurai Standing, action is a collaborative affair. “We keep refining,” he says. “It’s a back-and-forth process of shaping the sequence using both the ideas the team brings and the choreography I create myself.”

There is a third factor which Okada believes is the series’ most defining. “If we get to continue the story,” he says, “I’d love to explore how much more we can lean into ‘sei’ — stillness, and bring in even more of a classical period drama feel.”

As much of a triumph of action as Last Samurai Standing is, its quietest moments are the ones that stay with you. The charged looks between Shujiro and Iroha (Kaya Kiyohara) or their shuddering fright when confronted with specters of their past. Most of all, Shujiro watching his young ward, Futaba Katsuki (Yumia Fujisaki), dance before a waterlogged torii as mist hovers. These pauses are what elevate and invigorate the breathless action above spectacle.

The pauses are also emblematic of the balance that Last Samurai Standing strikes between its period setting and pushing the boundaries of action, all to inject new excitement into the genre. “Japan is a country that values tradition and everything it has built up over time. That’s why moments where you try to update things are always difficult,” Okada says. “But right now, we’re in the middle of that transformation.”

That is an evolution that Okada hopes to support through his work, both in front of and behind the camera. If he can create avenues for new generations of talent to carry Japanese media to a broader audience and his team to achieve greater success on a global stage, “that would make me very happy,” he says. “I want to keep doing whatever I can to help make that possible.”

The first season of Last Samurai Standing is streaming on Netflix now, and a second season was just confirmed.

Our final episode of 2025: How memory chips became a hot commodity, and what it means for all your devices.

Happy Holidays! As we like to do on The Vergecast, we take this time of year to see our families, relax and recharge, and go extremely deep into a specific technology that matters right now. This year, we picked the tiny chip in all your devices that is suddenly a precious and expensive commodity: RAM.

On this episode, David and Nilay are joined by The Verge’s Sean Hollister to get a primer on all things Random Access Memory. The hosts talk through the history of the technology, what RAM made possible in our computers, how it became utterly ubiquitous in practically every electronic device we own, and why it’s so hard to get right now. (Here’s a very 2025 spoiler alert: it’s about AI.) Then, with the help of producer Travis Larchuk, we play some RAM-related games, which go… well, they go.

After that, Sean and David chat with Dylan Patel from Semianalysis, who explains why the chip market in general is so overwhelmed right now — and why even in boom times, some companies might be reluctant to invest too heavily in scaling up. He also explains how the AI companies have cornered the market on RAM, whether the data center boom will end anytime soon, and what it all means for the prices of our devices.

Thank you so much to everyone who has listened to, watched, and talked with us about The Vergecast this year. Have a happy, restful, memory-filled holiday, and we’ll see you in 2026! Maybe even at our CES live show in Las Vegas!

This morning, I asked my Alexa-enabled Bosch coffee machine to make me a coffee. Instead of running my routine, it told me it couldn’t do that. Ever since I upgraded to Alexa Plus, Amazon’s generative-AI-powered voice assistant, it has failed to reliably run my coffee routine, coming up with a different excuse almost every time I ask.

It’s 2025, and AI still can’t reliably control my smart home. I’m beginning to wonder if it ever will.

The potential for generative AI and large language models to take the complexity out of the smart home, making it easier to set up, use, and manage connected devices, is compelling. So is the promise of a “new intelligence layer” that could unlock a proactive, ambient home.

But this year has shown me that we are a long way from any of that. Instead, our reliable but limited voice assistants have been replaced with “smarter” versions that, while better conversationalists, can’t consistently do basic tasks like operating appliances and turning on the lights. I want to know why.

It was back in 2023, during an interview with Dave Limp, that I first became intrigued by the possibilities of generative AI and large language models for improving the smart home experience. Limp, then the head of Amazon’s Devices & Services division that oversees Alexa, was describing the capabilities of the new Alexa they were soon to launch (spoiler alert: it wasn’t soon).

Along with a more conversational assistant that could actually understand what you said no matter how you said it, what stood out to me was the promise that this new Alexa could use its knowledge of the devices in your smart home, combined with the hundreds of APIs they plugged into it, to give the assistant the context it needed to make your smart home easier to use.

From setting up devices to controlling them, unlocking all their features, and managing how they can interact with other devices, a smarter smart home assistant seemed to hold the potential to not only make it easier for enthusiasts to manage their gadgets but also make it easier for everyone to enjoy the benefits of the smart home.

Fast-forward three years, and the most useful smart home AI upgrade we have is AI-powered descriptions for security camera notifications. It’s handy, but it’s hardly the sea change I had hoped for.

It’s not that these new smart home assistants are a complete failure. There’s a lot I like about Alexa Plus; I even named it as my smart home software pick of the year. It is more conversational, understands natural language, and can answer many more random questions than the old Alexa.

While it sometimes struggles with basic commands, it can understand complex ones; saying “I want it dimmer in here and warmer” will adjust the lights and crank up the thermostat. It’s better at managing my calendar, helping me cook, and other home-focused features. Setting up routines with voice is a huge improvement over wrestling with the Alexa app — even if running them isn’t as reliable.

Google has promised similar capabilities with its Gemini for Home upgrade to its smart speakers, although that’s rolling out at a glacial pace, and I haven’t been able to try it beyond some on-the-rails demos. I was able to test Gemini for Home’s feature that attempts to summarize what’s happened at my home using AI-generated text descriptions from Nest camera footage. It was wildly inaccurate. As for Apple’s Siri, it’s still firmly stuck in the last decade of voice assistants, and it appears it will stay there for a while longer.

The problem is that the new assistants aren’t as consistent at controlling smart home devices as the old ones. While they were often frustrating to use, the old Alexa and Google Assistant (and the current Siri) would generally always turn on the lights when you asked them to, provided you used precise nomenclature.

Today, their “upgraded” counterparts struggle with consistency in basic functions like turning on the lights, setting timers, reporting on the weather, playing music, and running the routines and automations on which many of us have built our smart homes.

I’ve noticed this in my testing, and online forums are full of users who have encountered it. Amazon and Google have acknowledged the struggles they’ve had in making their revamped generative AI-powered assistants reliably perform basic tasks. And it’s not limited to smart home assistants; ChatGPT can’t consistently tell time or count.

Why is this, and will it ever get better? To understand the problem, I spoke with two professors in the field of human-centric artificial intelligence with experience with agentic AI and smart home systems. My takeaway from those conversations is that, while it’s possible to make these new voice assistants do almost exactly what the old ones did, it will take a lot of work, and that’s possibly work most companies just aren’t interested in doing.

Basically, we’re all beta testers for the AI.

Considering there are limited resources in this field and ample opportunity to do something much more exciting (and more profitable) than reliably turn on the lights, that’s the way they’re moving, according to experts I spoke with. Given all these factors, it seems the easiest way to improve the technology is to just deploy it in the real world and let it improve over time. Which is likely why Alexa Plus and Gemini for Home are in “early access” phases. Basically, we’re all beta testers for the AI.

The bad news is it could be a while until it gets better. In his research, Dhruv Jain, assistant professor of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Michigan and director of the Soundability Lab, has also found that newer models of smart home assistants are less reliable. “It’s more conversational, people like it, people like to talk to it, but it’s not as good as the previous one,” he says. “I think [tech companies’] model has always been to release it fairly fast, collect data, and improve on it. So, over a few years, we might get a better model, but at the cost of those few years of people wrestling with it.”

The inherent problem appears to be that the old and new technologies don’t mesh. So, to build their new voice assistants, Amazon, Google, and Apple have had to throw out the old and build something entirely new. However, they quickly discovered that these new LLMs were not designed for the predictability and repetitiveness that their predecessors excelled at. “It was not as trivial an upgrade as everyone originally thought,” says Mark Riedl, a professor at the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. “LLMs understand a lot more and are open to more arbitrary ways to communicate, which then opens them to interpretation and interpretation mistakes.”

Basically, LLMs just aren’t designed to do what prior command-and-control-style voice assistants did. “Those voice assistants are what we call ‘template matchers,’” explains Riedl. “They look for a keyword, when they see it, they know that there are one to three additional words to expect.” For example, you say “Play radio,” and they know to expect a station call code next.

“It was not as trivial an upgrade as everyone originally thought.”

LLMs, on the other hand, “bring in a lot of stochasticity — randomness,” explains Riedl. Asking ChatGPT the same prompt multiple times may produce multiple responses. This is part of their value, but it’s also why when you ask your LLM-powered voice assistant to do the same thing you asked it yesterday, it might not respond the same way. “This randomness can lead to misunderstanding basic commands because sometimes they try to overthink things too much,” he says.

To fix this, companies like Amazon and Google have developed ways to integrate LLMs with the APIs at the heart of our smart homes (and most of everything we do on the web). But this has potentially created a new problem.

“The LLMs now have to compose a function call to an API, and it has to work a whole lot harder to correctly create the syntax to get the call exactly right,” Riedl posits. Where the old systems just waited for the keyword, LLM-powered assistants now have to lay out an entire code sequence that the API can recognize. “It has to keep all that in memory, and it’s another place where it can make mistakes.”

All of this is a scientific way of explaining why my coffee machine sometimes won’t make me a cup of coffee, or why you might run into trouble getting Alexa or Google’s assistant to do something it used to do just fine.

So, why did these companies abandon a technology that worked for something that doesn’t? Because of its potential. A voice assistant that, rather than being limited to responding to specific inputs, can understand natural language and take action based on that understanding is infinitely more capable.

“What all the companies that make Alexa and Siri and things like that really want to do is chaining of services,” explains Riedl. “That’s where you want a general language understanding, something that can understand complex relationships through tasks and how they’re conveyed by speech. They can invent the if-else statements that chain everything together, on the fly, and dynamically generate the sequence.” They can become agentic.

“The question is whether … the expanded range of possibilities the new technology offers is worth more than a 100 percent accurate non-probabilistic model.”

This is why you throw away the old technology, says Riedl, because it had no chance of doing this. “It’s about the cost-benefit ratio,” says Jain. “[The new technology] is not ever going to be as accurate at this as the non-probabilistic technology before, but the question is whether that sufficiently high accuracy, plus the expanded range of possibilities the new technology offers, is worth more than a 100 percent accurate non-probabilistic model.”

One solution is to use multiple models to power these assistants. Google’s Gemini for Home consists of two separate systems: Gemini and Gemini Live. Anish Kattukaran, head of product at Google Home and Nest, says the aim is to eventually have the more powerful Gemini Live run everything, but today, the more tightly constrained Gemini for Home is in charge. Amazon similarly uses multiple models to balance its various capabilities. But it’s an imperfect solution that has led to inconsistency and confusion in our smart homes.

Riedl says that no one has really figured out how to train LLMs to understand when to be very precise and when to embrace randomness, meaning even the “tame” LLMs can still get things wrong. “If you wanted to have a machine that just was never random at all, you could tamp it all down,” says Riedl. But that same chatbot would not be more conversational or able to tell your kid fantastical bedtime stories — both capabilities that Alexa and Google are touting. “If you want it all in one, you’re really making some tradeoffs.”

These struggles in its deployment in the smart home could be a harbinger of broader issues for the technology. If AI can’t turn on the lights reliably, why should anyone rely on it to do more complex tasks, asks Riedl. “You have to walk before you can run.”

But tech companies are known for their propensity to move fast and break things. “The story of language models has always been about taming the LLMs,” says Riedl. “Over time, they become more tame, more reliable, more trustworthy. But we keep pushing into the fringe of those spaces where they’re not.”

Riedl does believe in the path to a purely agentic assistant. “I don’t know if we ever get to AGI, but I think over time we do see these things at least being more reliable.” The question for those of us dealing with these unreliable AIs in our homes today, however, is are we willing to wait and at what cost to the smart home in the meantime?

            <h2>Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130415/organoid-uterus-microfluidic-chip-embryo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses gently into the receptive lining of the uterus and then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear.

This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three papers published this week by Cell Press, scientists are reporting what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus.

The reports—two from China and a third involving a collaboration among researchers in the United Kingdom, Spain, and the US—show how scientists are using engineered tissues to better understand early pregnancy and potentially improve IVF outcomes.

“You have an embryo and the endometrial organoid together,” says Jun Wu, a biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas, who contributed to both Chinese reports. “That’s the overarching message of all three papers.”

According to the papers, these 3D combinations are the most complete re-creations of the first days of pregnancy yet and should be useful for studying why IVF treatments often fail.

In each case, the experiments were stopped when the embryos were two weeks old, if not sooner. That is due to legal and ethical rules that typically restrict scientists from going any further than 14 days.

In your basic IVF procedure, an egg is fertilized in the lab and allowed to develop into a spherical embryo called a blastocyst—a process that takes a few days. That blastocyst then gets put into a patient’s uterus in the hope it will establish itself there and ultimately become a baby.

But that’s a common failure point. Many patients will learn that their IVF procedure didn’t work because an embryo never attached.

In the new reports, it’s that initial bond between mother and embryo that is being reproduced in the lab. “IVF means in vitro fertilization, but now this is the stage of in vitro implantation,” says Matteo Molè, a biologist at Stanford University whose results with collaborators in Europe are among those published today. “Considering that implantation is a barrier [to pregnancy], we have the potential to increase the success rate if we can model it in the laboratory.”

Normally implantation is entirely hidden from view because it occurs in someone’s uterus, says Hongmei Wang, a developmental biologist at the Beijing Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, who co-led the effort there. Wang often studies monkeys because she can interrupt their pregnancies to collect the tissues she needs to see. “We’ve always hoped to understand human embryo implantation, but we have lacked a way to do so,” she says. “It’s all happening in the uterus.”

In the Beijing study, researchers tested about 50 donated IVF embryos, but they also ran a thousand more experiments using so-called “blastoids.” The latter are mimics of early-stage human embryos manufactured from stem cells. Blastoids are easy to make in large numbers and, since they aren’t true embryos, don’t have as many ethical rules on their use.

“The question was, if we have these blastoids, what can we use them for?” says Leqian Yu, the senior author of the report from the Beijing Institute. “The obvious next step was implantation. So how do you do that?”

For the Beijing team, the answer was to build a soft silicone chamber with tiny channels to add nutrients and a space to grow the uterine organoid. After that, blastoids—or real embryos—could be introduced through a window in the device, so the “pregnancy” could start.

“The key question we want to try to answer is what is the first cross-talk between embryo and mother,” says Yu. “I think this is maybe the first time we can see the entire process.”

This isn’t the first time researchers have tried using organoids for this kind of research. At least two startup companies have raised funds to commercialize similar systems—in some cases presenting the organoids as a tool to predict IVF success. In addition to Dawn Bio, a startup based in Vienna, there is Simbryo Technologies, in Houston, which last month said it would begin offering “personalized” predictions for IVF patients using blastoids and endometrial organoids.

To do that test, doctors will take a biopsy of a patient’s uterine lining and grow organoids from it. After that, blastoids will be added to the organoids to gauge whether a woman is likely to be able to support a pregnancy or not. If the blastoids don’t start to implant, it could mean the patient’s uterus isn’t receptive and is the reason IVF isn’t working.

The Beijing team thinks the pregnancy organoids could also be used to identify drugs that might help those patients. In their paper, they describe how they made organoids out of tissue taken from women who’ve had repeated IVF failures. Then they tested 1,119 approved drugs on those samples to see if anything improved.

Several seemed to have helpful effects. One chemical, avobenzone, an ingredient in some types of sunblock, increased the chance that a blastoid would start implanting from just 5% of the time to around 25% of the time. Yu says his center hopes to eventually start a clinical trial if they can find the right drug to try.

The Beijing group is working on ways to improve the organoid system so that it’s even more realistic. Right now, it lacks important cell types, including immune cells and a blood supply. Yu says a next step he’s working on is to add blood vessels and tiny pumps to his chip device, so that he can give the organoids a kind of rudimentary circulation.

That means, in the near future, blastoids or embryos could likely be grown longer, raising questions about how far scientists will be able to take pregnancy in the lab. “I think this technology does raise the possibility of growing things longer,” says Wu, who says some view the research as an initial step toward creating babies entirely outside the body.

However, Wu says incubating a human to term in the laboratory remains impossible, for the time being. “This technology is certainly related to ectogenesis, or development outside the body,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s anywhere near an artificial womb. That’s still science fiction.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, summed it up in three words: “This is embarrassing.”

Hassabis was replying on X to an overexcited post by Sébastien Bubeck, a research scientist at the rival firm OpenAI, announcing that two mathematicians had used OpenAI’s latest large language model, GPT-5, to find solutions to 10 unsolved problems in mathematics. “Science acceleration via AI has officially begun,” Bubeck crowed.

Put your math hats on for a minute, and let’s take a look at what this beef from mid-October was about. It’s a perfect example of what’s wrong with AI right now.

Bubeck was excited that GPT-5 seemed to have somehow solved a number of puzzles known as Erdős problems.

Paul Erdős, one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, left behind hundreds of puzzles when he died. To help keep track of which ones have been solved, Thomas Bloom, a mathematician at the University of Manchester, UK, set up erdosproblems.com, which lists more than 1,100 problems and notes that around 430 of them come with solutions.

When Bubeck celebrated GPT-5’s breakthrough, Bloom was quick to call him out. “This is a dramatic misrepresentation,” he wrote on X. Bloom explained that a problem isn’t necessarily unsolved if this website does not list a solution. That simply means Bloom wasn’t aware of one. There are millions of mathematics papers out there, and nobody has read all of them. But GPT-5 probably has.

It turned out that instead of coming up with new solutions to 10 unsolved problems, GPT-5 had scoured the internet for 10 existing solutions that Bloom hadn’t seen before. Oops!

There are two takeaways here. One is that breathless claims about big breakthroughs shouldn’t be made via social media: Less knee jerk and more gut check.

The second is that GPT-5’s ability to find references to previous work that Bloom wasn’t aware of is also amazing. The hype overshadowed something that should have been pretty cool in itself.

Mathematicians are very interested in using LLMs to trawl through vast numbers of existing results, François Charton, a research scientist who studies the application of LLMs to mathematics at the AI startup Axiom Math, told me when I talked to him about this Erdős gotcha.

But literature search is dull compared with genuine discovery, especially to AI’s fervent boosters on social media. Bubeck’s blunder isn’t the only example.

In August, a pair of mathematicians showed that no LLM at the time was able to solve a math puzzle known as Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem. Two months later, social media erupted with evidence that GPT-5 now could. “Lee Sedol moment is coming for many,” one observer commented, referring to the Go master who lost to DeepMind’s AI AlphaGo in 2016.

But Charton pointed out that solving Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem isn’t a big deal to mathematicians. “It’s a question you would give an undergrad,” he said. “There is this tendency to overdo everything.”

Meanwhile, more sober assessments of what LLMs may or may not be good at are coming in. At the same time that mathematicians were fighting on the internet about GPT-5, two new studies came out that looked in depth at the use of LLMs in medicine and law (two fields that model makers have claimed their tech excels at).

Researchers found that LLMs could make certain medical diagnoses, but they were flawed at recommending treatments. When it comes to law, researchers found that LLMs often give inconsistent and incorrect advice. “Evidence thus far spectacularly fails to meet the burden of proof,” the authors concluded.

But that’s not the kind of message that goes down well on X. “You’ve got that excitement because everybody is communicating like crazy—nobody wants to be left behind,” Charton said. X is where a lot of AI news drops first, it’s where new results are trumpeted, and it’s where key players like Sam Altman, Yann LeCun, and Gary Marcus slug it out in public. It’s hard to keep up—and harder to look away.

Bubeck’s post was only embarrassing because his mistake was caught. Not all errors are. Unless something changes researchers, investors, and non-specific boosters will keep teeing each other up. “Some of them are scientists, many are not, but they are all nerds,” Charton told me. “Huge claims work very well on these networks.”

There’s a coda! I wrote everything you’ve just read above for the Algorithm column in the January/February 2026 issue of MIT Technology Review magazine (out very soon). Two days after that went to press, Axiom told me its own math model, AxiomProver, had solved two open Erdős problems (#124 and #481, for the math fans in the room). That’s impressive stuff for a small startup founded just a few months ago. Yup—AI moves fast!

But that’s not all. Five days later the company announced that AxiomProver had solved nine out of 12 problems in this year’s Putnam competition, a college-level math challenge that some people consider harder than the better-known International Math Olympiad (which LLMs from both Google DeepMind and OpenAI aced a few months back).

The Putnam result was lauded on X by big names in the field, including Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind, and Thomas Wolf, cofounder at the AI firm Hugging Face. Once again familiar debates played out in the replies. A few researchers pointed out that while the International Math Olympiad demands more creative problem-solving, the Putnam competition tests math knowledge—which makes it notoriously hard for undergrads, but easier, in theory, for LLMs that have ingested the internet.

How should we judge Axiom’s achievements? Not on social media, at least. And the eye-catching competition wins are just a starting point. Determining just how good LLMs are at math will require a deeper dive into exactly what these models are doing when they solve hard (read: hard for humans) math problems.

            <div id="article-text">Lately, everywhere I scroll, I keep seeing the same fish-eyed CCTV view: a grainy wide shot from the corner of a living room, a driveway at night, an empty grocery store. Then something impossible happens. JD Vance shows up at the doorstep in a crazy outfit. A car folds into itself like paper and drives away. A cat comes in and starts hanging out with capybaras and bears, as if in some weird modern fairy tale.

This fake-surveillance look has become one of the signature flavors of what people now call AI slop. For those of us who spend time online watching short videos, slop feels inescapable: a flood of repetitive, often nonsensical AI-generated clips that washes across TikTok, Instagram, and beyond. For that, you can thank new tools like OpenAI’s Sora (which exploded in popularity after launching in app form in September), Google’s Veo series, and AI models built by Runway. Now anyone can make videos, with just a few taps on a screen.

If I were to locate the moment slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral this summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical riffs, with people making videos of all kinds of animals and objects bouncing on the same trampoline.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed, quickly scrolling past every AI video in a futile attempt to send a message to my algorithm. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance buried in the nonsense. I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable.

To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I recently spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything. Maybe we have been too quick to dismiss AI slop. Maybe there’s a case for looking beyond the surface and seeing a new kind of creativity—one we’re watching take shape in real time, with many of us actually playing a part.

“AI slop” can and does refer to text, audio, or images. But what’s really broken through this year is the flood of quick AI-generated video clips on social platforms, each produced by a short written prompt fed into an AI model. Under the hood, these models are trained on enormous data sets so they can predict what every subsequent frame should look or sound like. It’s much like the process by which text models produce answers in a chat, but slower and far more power-hungry.

Early text-to-video systems, released around 2022 to 2023, could manage only a few seconds of blurry motion; objects warped in and out of existence, characters teleported around, and the giveaway that it was AI was usually a mangled hand or a melting face. In the past two years, newer models like Sora2, Veo 3.1, and Runway’s latest Gen-4.5 have dramatically improved, creating realistic, seamless, and increasingly true-to-prompt videos that can last up to a minute. Some of these models even generate sound and video together, including ambient noise and rough dialogue.

These text-to-video models have often been pitched by AI companies as the future of cinema—tools for filmmakers, studios, and professional storytellers. The demos have leaned into widescreen shots and dramatic camera moves. OpenAI pitched Sora as a “world simulator” while courting Hollywood filmmakers with what it boasted were movie-quality shorts. Google introduced Veo 3 last year as a step toward storyboards and longer scenes, edging directly into film workflows.

All this hinged on the idea that people wanted to make AI-generated videos that looked real. But the reality of how they’re being used is more modest, weirder—and arguably much more interesting. What has turned out to be the home turf for AI video is the six-inch screen in our hands.

Anyone can and does use these tools: a report by Adobe released in October shows that 86% of creators are using generative AI. But so are average social media users—people who aren’t “creators” so much as just people with phones.

That’s how you end up with clips showing things like Indian prime minister Narendra Modi dancing with Gandhi, a crystal that melts into butter the moment a knife touches it, or Game of Thrones reimagined as Henan opera—videos that are hypnotic, occasionally funny, and often deeply stupid. And while micro-trends didn’t start with AI—TikTok and Reels already ran on fast-moving formats—it feels as if AI poured fuel on that fire. Perhaps because the barrier to copying an idea becomes so low, a viral video like the bunnies on trampoline can easily and quickly spawn endless variations on the same concept. You don’t need a costume or a filming location anymore; you just tweak the prompt, hit Generate, and share.

Big tech companies have also jumped on the idea of AI videos as a new social medium. The Sora app allows users to insert AI versions of themselves and other users into scenes. Meta’s Vibes app wants to turn your entire feed into nonstop AI clips.

Of course, the same frictionless setup that allows for harmless, delightful creations also makes it easy to generate much darker slop. Sora has already been used to create so many racist deepfakes of Martin Luther King Jr. that the King estate pushed the company to block new MLK videos entirely. TikTok and X are seeing Sora-watermarked clips of women and girls being strangled circulating in bulk, posted by accounts seemingly dedicated to this one theme. And then there’s “nazislop,” the nickname for AI videos that repackage fascist aesthetics and memes into glossy, algorithm-ready content aimed at teens’ For You pages.

But the prevalence of bad actors hasn’t stopped short AI videos from flourishing as a form. New apps, Discord servers for AI creators, and tutorial channels keep multiplying. And increasingly, the energy in the community seems to be shifting away from trying to create stuff that “passes as real” toward embracing AI’s inherent weirdness. Every day, I stumble across creators who are stretching what “AI slop” is supposed to look like. I decided to talk to some of them.

Like those fake surveillance videos, many popular viral AI videos rely on a surreal, otherworldly quality. As Wenhui Lim, an architecture designer turned full-time AI artist, tells me, “There is definitely a competition of ‘How weird we can push this?’ among AI video creators.”

It’s the kind of thing AI video tools seem to handle with ease: pushing physics past what a normal body can do or a normal camera can capture. This makes AI a surprisingly natural fit for satire, comedy skits, parody, and experimental video art—especially examples involving absurdism or even horror. Several popular AI creators that I spoke with eagerly tap into this capability.

Drake Garibay, a 39-year-old software developer from Redlands, California, was inspired by body-horror AI clips circulating on social media in early 2025. He started playing with ComfyUI, a generative media tool, and ended up spending hours each week making his own strange creations. His favorite subject is morbid human-animal hybrids. “I fell right into it,” he says. “I’ve always been pretty artistic, [but] when I saw what AI video tools can do, I was blown away.”

Since the start of this year, Garibay has been posting his experiments online. One that went viral on TikTok, captioned “Cooking up some fresh AI slop,” shows a group of people pouring gooey dough into a pot. The mixture suddenly sprouts a human face, which then emerges from the boiling pot with a head and body. It has racked up more than 8.3 million views.

AI video technology is evolving so quickly that even for creative professionals, there is a lot to experiment with. Daryl Anselmo, a creative director turned digital artist, has been experimenting with the technology since its early days, posting an AI-generated video every day since 2021. He tells me that uses a wide range of tools, including Kling, Luma, and Midjourney, and is constantly iterating. To him, testing the boundaries of these AI tools is sometimes itself the reward. “I would like to think there are impossible things that you could not do before that are still yet to be discovered. That is exciting to me,” he says.

Anselmo has collected his daily creations over the past four years into an art project, titled AI Slop, that has been exhibited in multiple galleries, including the Grand Palais Immersif in Paris. There’s obvious attention to mood and composition. Some clips feel like something closer to an art-house vignette than a throwaway meme. Over time, Anselmo’s project has taken a darker turn as his subjects shift from landscapes and interior design toward more of the body horror that drew Garibay in.

His breakout piece, feel the agi, shows a hyperrealistic bot peeling open its own skull. Another video he shared recently features a midnight diner populated by anthropomorphized Tater Tots, titled Tot and Bothered; with its vintage palette and slow, mystical soundtrack, the piece feels like a late-night fever dream.

One further benefit of these AI systems is that they make it easier for creators to build recurring spaces and casts of characters that function like informal franchises. Lim, for instance, is the creator of a popular AI video account called Niceaunties, inspired by the “auntie culture” in Singapore, where she’s from.

“The word ‘aunties’ often has a slightly negative connotation in Singaporean culture. They are portrayed as old-fashioned, naggy, and lacking boundaries. But they are also so resourceful, funny, and at ease with themselves,” she says. “I want to create a world where it’s different for them.”

Her cheeky, playful videos show elderly Asian women merging with fruits, other objects, and architecture, or just living their best lives in a fantasy world. A viral video called Auntlantis, which has racked up 13.5 million views on Instagram, imagines silver-haired aunties as industrial mermaids working in an underwater trash-processing plant.

There’s also Granny Spills, an AI video account that features a glamorous, sassy old lady spitting hot takes and life advice to a street interviewer. It gained 1.8 million Instagram followers within three months of launch, posting new videos almost every day. Although the granny’s face looks slightly different in every video, the pink color scheme and her outfit stay mostly consistent. Creators Eric Suerez and Adam Vaserstein tell me that their entire workflow is powered by AI, from writing the script to constructing the scenes. Their role, as a result, becomes close to creative directing.

These projects often spin off merch, miniseries, and branded universes. The creators of Granny Spills, for example, have expanded their network, creating a Black granny as well as an Asian granny to cater to different audiences. The grannies now appear in crossover videos, as if they share the same fictional universe, pushing traffic between channels.

In the same vein, it’s now more possible than ever to participate in an online trend. Consider  “Italian brainrot,” which went viral earlier this year. Beloved by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, these videos feature human–animal–object hybrids with pseudo-Italian names like “Bombardiro Crocodilo” and “Tralalero Tralala.” According to Know Your Meme, the craze began with a few viral TikTok sounds in fake Italian. Soon, a lot of people were participating in what felt like a massive collaborative hallucination, inventing characters, backstories, and worldviews for an ever-expanding absurdist universe.

“Italian brainrot was great when it first hit,” says Denim Mazuki, a software developer and content creator who has been following the trend. “It was the collective lore-building that made it wonderful. Everyone added a piece. The characters were not owned by a studio or a single creator—they were made by the chronically online users.”

This trend and others are further enabled by specialized and sophisticated new tools—like OpenArt, a platform designed not just for video generation but for video storytelling, which gives users frame-to-frame control over a developing narrative.

Making a video on OpenArt is straightforward: Users start with a few AI-generated character images and a line of text as simple as “cat dancing in a park.” The platform then spins out a scene breakdown that users can tweak act by act, and they can run it through multiple mainstream models and compare the results to see which look best.

OpenArt cofounders Coco Mao and Chloe Fang tell me they sponsored tutorial videos and created quick-start templates to capitalize specifically on the trend of regular people wanting to get in on Italian brainrot. They say more than 80% of their users have no artistic background.

The current use of the word “slop” online traces back to the early 2010s on 4chan, a forum known for its insular and often toxic in-jokes. As the term has spread, its meaning has evolved; it’s now a kind of derogatory slur for anything that feels like low-quality mass production aimed at an unsuspecting public, says Adam Aleksic, an internet linguist. People now slap it onto everything from salad bowls to meaningless work reports.

But even with that broadened usage, AI remains the first association: “slop” has become a convenient shorthand for dismissing almost any AI-generated output, regardless of its actual quality. The Cambridge Dictionary’s new sense of “slop” will almost certainly cement this perception, describing it as “content on the internet that is of very low quality, especially when it is created by AI.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the word has become a charged label among AI creators.

Anselmo embraces it semi-ironically, hence the title of his yearslong art project. “I see this series as an experimental sketchbook,” he says. “I am working with the slop, pushing the models, breaking them, and developing a new visual language. I have no shame that I am deep into AI.” Anselmo says that he does not concern himself with whether his work is “art.”

Garibay, the creator of the viral video where a human face emerged from a pot of physical slop, uses the label playfully. “The AI slop art is really just a lot of weird glitchy stuff that happens, and there’s not really a lot of depth usually behind it, besides the shock value,” he says. “But you will find out really fast that there is a heck of a lot more involved, if you want a higher-end result.”

That’s largely in line with what Suerez and Vaserstein, the creators of Granny Spills, tell me. They actually hate it when their work is called slop, given the way the term is often used to dismiss AI-generated content out of hand. It feels disrespectful of their creative input, they say. Even though they do not write the scripts or paint the frames, they say they are making legitimate artistic choices.

Indeed, for most of the creators I spoke to, making AI content is rarely a one-click process. They tell me that it takes skill, trial and error, and a strong sense of taste to consistently get the visuals they want. Lim says a single one-minute video can take hours, sometimes even days, to make. Anselmo, for his part, takes pride in actively pushing the model rather than passively accepting its output. “There’s just so many things that you can do with it that go well beyond ‘Oh, way to go, you typed in a prompt,’” he says. Ultimately, slop evokes a lot of feelings. Aleksic puts it well: “There&#39;s a feeling of guilt on the user end for enjoying something that you know to be lowbrow. There&#39;s a feeling of anger toward the creator for making something that is not up to your content expectations, and all the meantime, there&#39;s a pervasive algorithmic anxiety hanging over us. We know that the algorithm and the platforms are to blame for the distribution of this slop.”

And that anxiety long predates generative AI. We’ve been living for years with the low-grade dread of being nudged, of having our taste engineered and our attention herded, so it’s not surprising that the anger latches onto the newest, most visible culprit. Sometimes it is misplaced, sure, but I also get the urge to assert human agency against a new force that seems to push all of us away from what we know and toward something we didn’t exactly choose.

But the negative association has real harm for the earlier adopters. Every AI video creator I spoke to described receiving hateful messages and comments simply for using these tools at all. These messages accuse AI creators of taking opportunities away from artists already struggling to make a living, and some dismiss their work as “grifting” and “garbage.” The backlash, of course, did not come out of nowhere. A Brookings study of one major freelance marketplace found that after new generative-AI tools launched in 2022, freelancers in AI-exposed occupations saw about 2% decline in contracts and a 5% drop in earnings.

“The phrase ‘AI slop’ implies, like, a certain ease of creation that really bothers a lot of people—understandably, because [making AI-generated videos] doesn&#39;t incorporate the artistic labor that we typically associate with contemporary art,” says Mindy Seu, a researcher, artist, and associate professor in digital arts at UCLA.

At the root of the conflict here is that the use of AI in art is still nascent; there are few best practices and almost no guardrails. And there’s a kind of shame involved—one I recognize when I find myself lingering on bad AI content.

Historically, new technology has always carried a whiff of stigma when it first appears, especially in creative fields where it seems to encroach on a previously manual craft. Seu says that digital art, internet art, and new media have been slow to gain recognition from cultural institutions, which remain key arbiters of what counts as “serious” or “relevant” art.

For many artists, AI now sits in that same lineage: “Every big advance in technology yields the question ‘What is the role of the artist?’” she says. This is true even if creators are not seeing it as a replacement for authorship but simply as another way to create.

Mao, the OpenArt founder, believes that learning how to use generative video tools will be crucial for future content creators, much as learning Photoshop was almost synonymous with graphic design for a generation. “It is a skill to be learned and mastered,” she says.

There is a generous reading of the phenomenon so many people call AI slop, which is that it is a kind of democratization. A rare skill shifts away from craftsmanship to something closer to creative direction: being able to describe what you want with enough linguistic precision, and to anchor it in references the model is likely to understand. You have to know how to ask, and what to point to. In that sense, discernment and critique sit closer to the center of the process than ever before.

It’s not just about creative direction, though, but about the human intention behind the creation. “It’s very easy to copy the style,” Lim says. “It’s very easy to make, like, old Asian women doing different things, but they [imitators] don’t understand why I’m doing it … Even when people try to imitate that, they don’t have that consistency.”

“It’s the idea behind AI creation that makes it interesting to look at,” says Zach Lieberman, a professor at the MIT Media Lab who leads a research group called Future Sketches, where members explore code-enabled images. Lieberman, who has been posting daily sketches generated by code for years, tells me that mathematical logic is not the enemy of beauty. He echoes Mao in saying that a younger generation will inevitably see AI as just another tool in the toolbox. Still, he feels uneasy: By relying so heavily on black-box AI models, artists lose some of the direct control over output that they’ve traditionally enjoyed.

For many people, AI slop is simply everything they already resent about the internet, turned up: ugly, noisy, and crowding out human work. It’s only possible because it’s been trained to take all creative work and make it fodder, stripped of origin, aura, or credit, and blended into something engineered to be mathematically average—arguably perfectly mediocre, by design. Charles Pulliam-Moore, a writer for The Verge, calls this the “formulaic derivativeness” that already defines so much internet culture: unimaginative, unoriginal, and uninteresting.

But I love internet culture, and I have for a long time. Even at its worst, it’s bad in an interesting way: It offers a corner for every kind of obsession and invites you to add your own. Years of being chronically online have taught me that the real logic of slop consumption isn’t mastery but a kind of submission. As a user, I have almost no leverage over platforms or algorithms; I can’t really change how they work. Submission, though, doesn’t mean giving up. It’s more like recognizing that the tide is stronger than you and choosing to let it carry you. Good scrolling isn’t about control anyway. It’s closer to surfing, and sometimes you wash up somewhere ridiculous, but not entirely alone.

Mass-produced click-bait content has always been around. What’s new is that we can now watch it being generated in real time, on a scale that would have been unimaginable before. And the way we respond to it in turn shapes new content (see the trampoline-bouncing bunnies) and more culture and so on. Perhaps AI slop is born of submission to algorithmic logic. It’s unserious, surreal, and spectacular in ways that mirror our relationship to the internet itself. It is so banal—so aggressively, inhumanly mediocre—that it loops back around and becomes compelling.

To “love AI slop” is to admit the internet is broken, that the infrastructure of culture is opportunistic and extractive. But even in that wreckage, people still find ways to play, laugh, and make meaning.

Earlier this fall, months after I was briefly fooled by the bunny video, I was scrolling on Rednote and landed on videos by Mu Tianran, a Chinese creator who acts out weird skits that mimic AI slop. In one widely circulated clip, he plays a street interviewer asking other actors, “Do you know you are AI generated?”—parodying an earlier wave of AI-generated street interviews. The actors’ responses seem so AI, but of course they’re not: Eyes are fixed just off-camera, their laughter a beat too slow, their movements slightly wrong.

Watching this, it was hard to believe that AI was about to snuff out human creativity. If anything, it has handed people a new style to inhabit and mock, another texture to play with. Maybe it’s all fine. Maybe the urge to imitate, remix, and joke is still stubbornly human, and AI cannot possibly take it away.

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130153/geothermal-energy-carbon-capture-kenya-climate-solution/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The earth around Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater basin in south-central Kenya, does not seem to want to lie still.

Ash from nearby Mount Longonot, which erupted as recently as the 1860s, remains in the ground. Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface.

It’s a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what’s now called the Great Rift Valley.

This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours’ drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya’s electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand.

In June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It’s harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.

In the short term, the impact will be small—each device’s initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO2—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is possible. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia’s communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year.

The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released.

Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It’s a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place.

Last year, the world’s largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change.

Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya’s unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they’re pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn’t even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies.

Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What’s more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC’s main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive.

Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it’s not delivering, and it’s not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn’t deliver?”

Layered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land’s geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don’t even have access to the electricity generated by these plants.

It’s an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project can indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he’s skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry.

“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO2 out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It’s something even an ordinary person can just get,” Sovacool says. “If we’re able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.”

But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.

The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality.

Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn’t want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate solutions. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob’s Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries.

She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He’d been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country’s vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya’s extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

The Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country’s grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn’t be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and expand the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed.

“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me.

So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power.

It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks’ DAC facilities.

“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it’s also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu’s concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”

Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country’s roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths.

“It’s not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality.

“You’re developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it’s also just good for the country.”

In June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi’s Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city.

The staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that’s common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete’s slogan, “No human is limited.”

“It’s impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added.

Although not an official partner of Ndirangu’s Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn’t take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse.

That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden’s ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman.

Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)

Hannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO2 is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture.

The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia’s project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO2 release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics.

And then there’s its energy source: The device operates on more than 80% thermal energy, which in the field will consist of the extra geothermal energy that the power plants don’t convert into electricity. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia’s machines. What’s more, the device’s modular design can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once the demand is there, Mutheu told me.

This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)

Once the CO2 is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region’s special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals.

This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella’s pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO2 this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030.

These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia.

“I’m happy that I’m trying to solve a problem that’s a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.”

Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi’s vision can be fully realized.

Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.

So Ndirangu played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible.

Ndirangu says that she’s already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they’re waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.

But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff.

At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so.

Further compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, one of the world’s largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO2 each year.

Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification.

“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there&#39;s no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”

Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan President William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration’s policies have deepened the country’s external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.

Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University’s Sovacool, aren’t quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool’s research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that’s if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya.

Nevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC’s overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There’s lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front.

The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It’s big. It’s visionary,” Burns says. “You’ve got to have some ambition here. This isn’t something that is like deploying a technology that’s widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”

More than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley’s future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it’s being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries.

To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” after the bright red clay found in abundance.

South of the lake is Hell’s Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region’s five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria.

But for decades most of the Maasai haven’t had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project’s three plants.

Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC.

Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don’t want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.

That’s part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.

DAC is a small industry, and it can’t do everything. But if it’s going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya’s green industrialization, communities like Koilel’s will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change.

When I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn’t necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs.

Power “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”

            <h2>This company is developing gene therapies for muscle growth, erectile dysfunction, and “radical longevity”</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130288/gene-therapies-muscle-growth-erectile-dysfunction-radical-longevity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At some point next month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with two experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial. His long-term goal: to achieve radical human life extension.

The 12 to 15 volunteers—who will be covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in the muscles of their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

But some experts are concerned that the trial involves giving multiple gene therapies to small numbers of healthy people. It will be impossible to draw firm conclusions from such a small study, and the trial certainly won’t reveal anything about longevity, says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a lawyer and medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Unlimited Bio’s blood supply therapy is already accessible at clinics in Honduras and Mexico, says Morgunov—and the company is already getting some publicity. Khloe Kardashian tagged Unlimited Bio in a Facebook post about stem-cell treatments she and her sister Kim had received at the Eterna clinic in Mexico in August. And earlier this week, the biohacking influencer Dave Asprey posted an Instagram Reel of himself receiving one of the treatments in Mexico; it was shared with 1.3 million Instagram followers. In the video, Eterna’s CEO, Adeel Khan, says that the therapy can “help with vascular health systemically.” “I’m just upgrading my system for a little while to reduce my age and reduce my vascular risk,” Asprey said.

Gene therapies typically work by introducing new genetic code into the body’s cells. This code is then able to make proteins. Existing approved gene therapies have typically been developed for severe diseases in which the target proteins are either missing or mutated.

But several groups are exploring gene therapies for healthy people. One of these companies is Minicircle, which developed a gene therapy to increase production of follistatin, a protein found throughout the body that has many roles and is involved in muscle growth. The company says this treatment will increase muscle mass—and help people live longer. Minicircle is based in Próspera, a special economic zone in Honduras with its own bespoke regulatory system. Anyone can visit the local clinic and receive that therapy, for a reported price of $25,000. And many have, including the wealthy longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who promoted the therapy in a Netflix documentary.

Unlimited Bio’s Morgunov, a Russian-Israeli computer scientist, was inspired by Minicircle’s story. He is also interested in longevity. Specifically, he’s committed to radical life extension and has said that he could be part of “the last generation throughout human history to die from old age.” He believes the biggest “bottleneck” slowing progress toward anti-aging or lifespan-extending therapies is drug regulation. So he, too, incorporated his own biotech company in Próspera.

“A company like ours couldn’t exist outside of Próspera,” says Unlimited Bio’s chief operating officer, Vladimir Leshko.

There, Morgunov and his colleagues are exploring two gene therapies. One of these is another follistatin therapy, which the team hopes will increase muscle mass. The other codes for a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. This compound is known to encourage the growth of blood vessels. Morgunov and his colleagues hope the result will be increased muscle growth, enhanced muscle repair, and longer life. Neither treatment is designed to alter a recipient’s DNA, and therefore it won’t be inherited by future generations.

The combination of the two therapies could benefit healthy people and potentially help them live longer, says Leshko, a former electrical engineer and professional poker player who retrained in biomedical engineering. “We would say that it’s a preventive-slash-enhancing indication,” he says. “Potentially participants can experience faster recovery from exercise, more strength, and more endurance.”

Of the 12 to 15 volunteers who participate in the trial, half will receive only the follistatin therapy. The other half will receive both the VEGF and the follistatin therapies. The treatments will involve a series of injections throughout large muscles in the arms and legs, says Morgunov.

He is confident that the VEGF therapy is safe. It was approved in Russia over a decade ago to treat lower-limb ischemia—a condition that can cause pain, numbness, and painful ulcers in the legs and feet. Morgunov reckons, based on previously published estimates, that around 10,000 people in Russia have already had the drug, although he says he hasn’t “done deep fact-checking on that.”

VEGF is a powerful compound, says Seppo Ylä-Herttuala, a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Eastern Finland who has been studying VEGF and potential VEGF therapies for decades. He doesn’t know how many people have had VEGF gene therapy in Russia. But he does know that the safety of the therapy will depend on how much is administered and where. Previous attempts to inject the therapy into the heart, for example, have resulted in edema, a sometimes fatal buildup of fluid. Even if the therapy is injected elsewhere, VEGF can travel around the body, he says. If it gets to the eye, for example, it could cause blindness. Leshko counters that the VEGF should remain where it is injected, and any other circulation in the body, if it occurs, should be short-lived.

And while the therapy has been approved in Russia, there’s a reason it hasn’t been approved elsewhere, says Ylä-Herttuala: The clinical trials were not as rigorous as they could have been. While “it probably works in some patients,” he says, the evidence to support the use of this therapy is weak. At any rate, he adds, VEGF will only support the growth of blood vessels—it won’t tackle aging.  “VEGF is not a longevity drug,” he says.

Leshko points to a 2021 study in mice, which suggested that a lack of VEGF activity might drive aging in the rodents. “We’re convinced it qualifies as a potential longevity drug,” he says.

There is even less data about follistatin. Minicircle, the company selling another follistatin gene therapy, has not published any rigorous clinical trial data. So far, much of the evidence for follistatin’s effects comes from research in rodents, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Clinical trials like this one should gather more information, both about the therapies and about the methods used to get those therapies into the body. Unlimited Bio’s VEGF therapy will be delivered via a circular piece of genetic code called a plasmid. Its follistatin therapy, on the other hand, will be delivered via an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Plasmid therapies are easier to make, and they have a shorter lifespan in the body—only a matter of days. They are generally considered to be safer than AAV therapies. AAV therapies, on the other hand, tend to stick around for months, says Ylä-Herttuala. And they can trigger potentially dangerous immune reactions.

It’s debatable whether healthy people should be exposed to these risks, says Fernandez Lynch. The technology “still has serious questions about its safety and effectiveness,” even for people with life-threatening diseases, she says. “If you are a healthy person, the risk of harm is more substantial because it’ll be more impactful on your life.”

But Leshko is adamant. “Over 120,000 humans die DAILY from age-related causes,” he wrote in an email. “Building ‘ethical’ barriers around ‘healthy’ human (in fact, aging human) trials is unethical.” Morgunov did not respond to a request for comment.

Some people want to take those risks anyway. In his video, the biohacker influencer Asprey—who has publicly stated that he’s “going to live to 180”—described VEGF as a “longevity compound,” and Eterna’s CEO Khan, who delivered the treatment, described it as “the ultimate upgrade.” Neither Asprey nor Khan clinic responded to requests for comment.

Michael Gusmano, a professor of health policy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, worries that this messaging might give trial participants unrealistic expectations about how they might benefit. There is “huge potential for therapeutic misconception when you have some kind of celebrity online influencer touting something about which there is relatively sparse scientific evidence,” he says. In reality, he adds, “the only thing you can guarantee is that [the volunteers] will be contributing to our knowledge of how this intervention works.”

“I would certainly not recommend that anyone I know enter into such a trial,” says Gusmano.

The muscle study is only the first step. The Unlimited Bio team hopes to trial the VEGF therapy for baldness and erectile dysfunction, too. Leshko points to research in mice that links high VEGF levels to larger, denser hair follicles. He hopes to test a series of VEGF therapy injections into the scalps of volunteers. Morgunov, who is largely bald, has already started to self-experiment with the approach.

An erectile dysfunction trial may follow. “That one we think has great potential because injecting gene therapy into the penis sounds exciting,” says Leshko. A protocol for that trial has not yet been finalized, but he imagines it would involve “five to 10” injections.

Ylä-Herttuala isn’t optimistic about either approach. Hair growth is largely hormonal, he says. And injecting anything into a penis risks damaging it (although Leshko points out that a similar approach was taken by another company almost 20 years ago). Injecting a VEGF gene therapy into the penis would also risk edema there, Ylä-Herttuala adds.

And he points out that we already have some treatments for hair loss and erectile dysfunction. While they aren’t perfect, their existence does raise the bar for any potential future therapies—not only do they have to be safe and effective, but they must be safer or more effective than existing ones.

That doesn’t mean the trials will flop. No small trial can be definitive, but it could still provide some insight into how these drugs are working. It is possible that the therapies will increase muscle mass, at least, and that this could be beneficial to the healthy recipients, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Before our call, he had taken a look at Unlimited Bio’s website, which carries the tagline “The Most Advanced Rejuvenation Solution.” “They promise a lot,” he said. “I hope it’s true.”

Correction: This story was corrected to note that half of trial volunteers volunteers receive only the follistatin therapy.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
