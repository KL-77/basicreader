            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple doesn’t like to talk about its upcoming products before it’s ready, but sometimes the company’s software does the talking for it. So far this week we’ve had a couple of software-related leaks that have outed products Apple is currently testing—one a pre-release build of iOS 26, and the other some leaked files from a kernel debug kit (both via MacRumors).

Most of the new devices referenced in these leaks are straightforward updates to products that already exist: a new Apple TV, a HomePod mini 2, new AirTags and AirPods, an M4 iPad Air, a 12th-generation iPad to replace the current A16 version, next-generation iPhones (including the 17e, 18, and the rumored foldable model), a new Studio Display model, some new smart home products we’ve already heard about elsewhere, and M5 updates for the MacBook Air, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and the other MacBook Pros. There’s also yet another reference to the lower-cost MacBook that Apple is apparently planning to replace the M1 MacBook Air it still sells via Walmart for $599.

For power users, though, the most interesting revelation might be that Apple is working on a higher-end Apple Silicon iMac powered by an M5 Max chip. The kernel debug kit references an iMac with the internal identifier J833c, based on a platform identified as H17C—and H17C is apparently based on the M5 Max, rather than a lower-end M5 chip. (For those who don’t have Apple’s branding memorized, “Max” is associated with Apple’s second-fastest chips; the M5 Max would be faster than the M5 or M5 Pro, but slower than the rumored M5 Ultra.)

This device could be the long-awaited, occasionally-rumored-but-never-launched replacement to Apple’s 27-inch iMac, which was discontinued in 2022 with no direct replacement. An M5 Max chip would also make this machine the closest thing we’ve seen to a direct replacement for the iMac Pro, a 27-inch iMac variant that was launched in late 2017 but likewise discontinued without an update or replacement.

The current M4 Max chip includes 14 or 16 CPU cores, 32 or 40 GPU cores, and between 36GB and 128GB of unified memory, specs we’d expect an M5 Max to match or beat. And because the Max chips already fit into the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, it should be no problem to fit one into an all-in-one desktop PC.

For most of the Intel era, the 27-inch iMac was Apple’s main workhorse desktop, situated in between the underpowered Mac mini and the expensive, oft-ignored Mac Pro. It used high-end multi-core CPUs and midrange dedicated GPUs, and combined them with a high-end color-accurate 5K screen that was good enough for all kinds of professional photo and video editing and design work.

But the Apple Silicon era saw the iMac revert to its roots as a less-powerful, colorful, consumer-friendly system aimed at less-demanding users. The current Apple M4 iMac is pleasant to use and plenty fast for everyday computing tasks, but it can’t stack up to desktops like the M4 Pro Mac mini or the Mac Studio.

For several years, rumors persisted that Apple was working on an upgraded iMac—Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said in 2023 that a 32-inch version of the iMac could possibly launch at some point in 2024 or 2025. That timeline ended up being optimistic, but the presence of an M5 Max in this testing model suggests that a 2026 launch could be a real possibility.

Apple offers products that can replace a 27-inch iMac in its lineup today—either a Mac mini or Mac Studio, connected to a 27-inch 5K Studio Display or the 32-inch 6K Pro Display XDR. But that combination can’t replace an iMac for the people who enjoy the all-in-one’s clean look or its lack of cable clutter, and both of those aging standalone displays are missing support for the kinds of technologies offered in modern high-end screens, including mini LED or OLED panels or ProMotion refresh rates.

That this iMac and these other devices are present in these internal software builds doesn’t mean that they’re things Apple intends to release—just that Apple is testing some version of them in its headquarters somewhere, and that work has progressed to the point where Apple is supporting them with internal software releases. They could see the light of day soon, or years from now, or never at all. But for anyone who’s still keeping hope alive about a 27-inch iMac replacement, this is another piece of kindling you can use to try and keep that fire burning.</div>

            <h2>Reporter suggests Half-Life 3 will be a Steam Machine launch title</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/journalist-insists-half-life-3-will-launch-with-steam-machine-in-spring-2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you can take your mind way back to the beginning of 2025, you might remember a fresh wave of rumors suggesting that Half-Life 3 was finally reaching the final stages of production, and could be announced and/or released at any moment. Now, though, 2025 seems set to come to a close without any official news of a game fans have been waiting literal decades for.

That doesn’t necessarily mean a Half-Life 3 announcement and/or release isn’t imminent, though. On the contrary, veteran journalist Mike Straw insisted on a recent Insider Gaming podcast that “everybody I’ve talked to are still adamant [Half-Life 3] is a game that will be a launch title with the Steam Machine.”

Straw—who has a long history of reporting gaming rumors from anonymous sources—said this Half-Life 3 information is “not [from] these run-of-the-mill sources that haven’t gotten me information before. … These aren’t like random, one-off people.” And those sources are “still adamant that the game is coming in the spring,” Straw added, noting that he was “specifically told [that] spring 2026 [is the window] for the Steam Machine, for the Frame, for the Controller, [and] for Half-Life 3.”

Tying the long-awaited Half-Life 3 to a major hardware push that has already been announced for an “early 2026” window certainly sounds plausible, given previous leaks about the game’s advanced state of development. But there are still some reasons to doubt Straw’s “adamant” sources here.

For one, Straw admitted that the previous information he had received on potential Half-Life 3 launch and/or announcement dates was not reliable enough to report in detail. “I had been told a date. I was not going to report that date because they weren’t 100 percent confident in that date,” he said. “That date has since passed.”

“It was one of those situations where I guarantee a bunch of people were just giving out dates to see who would post a date to catch who was leaking said information,” Straw added. “The date they told me, there’s a reason why they said, ‘Don’t report it.’ I didn’t write a story on it because there just was not enough on the date itself to run a story… I didn’t feel comfortable officially reporting that.”

And even if Straw’s information about a “spring 2026” window for Half-Life 3 is currently correct, the ever-shifting nature of Valve Time means those plans could still change. That is especially true if the game’s launch is linked to hardware plans that might be impacted by the spiking price of RAM.

Straw said that kind of component uncertainty—and negative reactions to reports of PC-style pricing for the Steam Machine—are likely pushing Valve toward “holding back the idea or holding back the announcement of anything else” surrounding Steam Machine launch details. “There’s no doubt in my mind Valve is still trying to make decisions because of what’s going on on the component side,” he added.

Timing specifics aside, Straw said his sources have him convinced that the long wait for Half-Life 3 is coming to an end in the near future. “The game’s real,” he said. “At the end of the day, the game is real. There’s no denying it. It’s just a ‘when’ and not an ‘if’ at this point.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Utah Gov. Spencer Cox believes his state needs more power—a lot more. By some estimates, Utah will require as much electricity in the next five years as it generated all last century to meet the demands of a growing population as well as chase data centers and AI developers to fuel its economy.

To that end, Cox announced Operation Gigawatt last year, declaring the state would double energy production in the next decade. Although the announcement was short on details, Cox, a Republican, promised his administration would take an “any of the above” approach, which aims to expand all sources of energy production.

Despite that goal, the Utah Legislature’s Republican supermajority, with Cox’s acquiescence, has taken a hard turn against solar power—which has been coming online faster than any other source in Utah and accounts for two-thirds of the new projects waiting to connect to the state’s power grid.

Cox signed a pair of bills passed this year that will make it more difficult and expensive to develop and produce solar energy in Utah by ending solar development tax credits and imposing a hefty new tax on solar generation. A third bill aimed at limiting solar development on farmland narrowly missed the deadline for passage but is expected to return next year.

While Operation Gigawatt emphasizes nuclear and geothermal as Cox’s preferred sources, the legislative broadside, and Cox’s willingness to go along with it, caught many in the solar industry off guard. The three bills, in their original form, could have brought solar development to a halt if not for solar industry lobbyists negotiating a lower tax rate and protecting existing projects as well as those under construction from the brunt of the impact.

“It took every dollar of political capital from all the major solar developers just to get to something tolerable, so that anything they have under development will get built and they can move on to greener pastures,” said one industry insider, indicating that solar developers will likely pursue projects in more politically friendly states. ProPublica spoke with three industry insiders—energy developers and lobbyists—all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of antagonizing lawmakers who, next month, will again consider legislation affecting the industry.

The Utah Legislature’s pivot away from solar mirrors President Donald Trump taking a more hostile approach to the industry than his predecessor. Trump has ordered the phaseout of lucrative federal tax incentives for solar and other renewable energy, which expanded under the Biden administration. The loss of federal incentives is a bigger hit to solar companies than the reductions to Utah’s tax incentives, industry insiders acknowledged. The administration has also canceled large wind and solar projects, which Trump has lamented as “the scam of the century.” He described solar as “farmer killing.”

Yet Cox criticized the Trump administration’s decision to kill a massive solar project in neighboring Nevada. Known as a governor who advocates for a return to more civil political discourse, Cox doesn’t often pick fights. But he didn’t pull punches with the decision to halt the Esmeralda 7 project planned on 62,300 acres of federal land. The central Nevada project was expected to produce 6.2 gigawatts of power—enough to supply nearly eight times the number of households in Las Vegas. (Although the Trump administration canceled the environmental review of the joint project proposed by multiple developers, it has the potential to move forward as individual projects.)

“This is how we lose the AI/energy arms race with China,” Cox wrote on X when news surfaced of the project’s cancellation. “Our country needs an all-of-the-above approach to energy (like Utah).”

But he didn’t take on his own Legislature, at least publicly.

Many of Utah’s Republican legislators have been skeptical of solar for years, criticizing its footprint on the landscape and viewing it as an unreliable energy source, while lamenting the retirement of coal-generated power plants. The economies of several rural counties rely on mining coal. But lawmakers’ skepticism hadn’t coalesced into successful anti-solar legislation—until this year. When Utah lawmakers convened at the start of 2025, they took advantage of the political moment to go after solar.

“This is a sentiment sweeping through red states, and it’s very disconcerting and very disturbing,” said Steve Handy, Utah director of The Western Way, which describes itself as a conservative organization advocating for an all-of-the-above approach to energy development.

The shift in sentiment against solar energy has created a difficult climate for an all-of-the-above approach. Solar projects can be built quickly on Utah’s vast, sun-drenched land, while nuclear is a long game with projects expected to take a decade or more to come online under optimistic scenarios.

Cox generally supports solar, “in the right places,” especially when the captured energy can be stored in large batteries for distribution on cloudy days and after the sun goes down.

Cox said that instead of vetoing the anti-solar bills, he spent his political capital to moderate the legislation’s impact. “I think you’ll see where our fingerprints were,” he told ProPublica. He didn’t detail specific changes for which he advocated but said the bills’ earlier iterations would have “been a lot worse.”

Cox’s any-of-the-above approach to energy generation draws from a decades-old Republican push similarly titled “all of the above.” The GOP policy’s aim was as much about preserving and expanding reliance on fossil fuels (indeed, the phrase may have been coined by petroleum lobbyists) as it was turning to cleaner energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal.

As governor of a coal-producing state, Cox hasn’t shown interest in reducing reliance on such legacy fuels. But as he slowly rolls out Operation Gigawatt, his focus has been on geothermal and nuclear power. Last month, he announced plans for a manufacturing hub for small modular reactors in the northern Utah community of Brigham City, which he hopes will become a nuclear supply chain for Utah and beyond. And on a recent trade mission to New Zealand, he signed an agreement to collaborate with the country on geothermal energy development.

Meanwhile, the bills Cox signed into law already appear to be slowing solar development in Utah. Since May, when the laws took effect, 51 planned solar projects withdrew their applications to connect to the state’s grid—representing more than a quarter of all projects in Utah’s transmission connection queue. Although projects drop out for many reasons, some industry insiders theorize the anti-solar legislation could be at play.

Caught in the political squeeze over power are Utah customers, who are footing higher electricity bills. Earlier this year, the state’s utility, Rocky Mountain Power, asked regulators to approve a 30 percent hike to fund increased fuel and wholesale energy costs, as well as upgrades to the grid. In response to outrage from lawmakers, the utility knocked the request down to 18 percent. Regulators eventually awarded the utility a 4.7 percent increase—a decision the utility promptly appealed to the state Supreme Court.

Juliet Carlisle, a University of Utah political science professor focusing on environmental policy, said the new solar tax could signal to large solar developers that Utah energy policy is “becoming more unpredictable,” prompting them to build elsewhere. This, in turn, could undermine Cox’s efforts to quickly double Utah’s electricity supply.

Operation Gigawatt “relies on rapid deployment across multiple energy sources, including renewables,” she said. “If renewable growth slows—especially utility-scale solar, which is currently the fastest-deploying resource—the state may face challenges meeting demand growth timelines.”

Rep. Kay Christofferson, R-Lehi, had sponsored legislation to end the solar industry’s state tax credits for several legislative sessions, but this was the first time the proposal succeeded.

Christofferson agrees Utah is facing unprecedented demand for power, and he supports Cox’s any-of-the-above approach. But he doesn’t think solar deserves the advantages of tax credits. Despite improving battery technology, he still considers it an intermittent source and thinks overreliance on it would work against Utah’s energy goals.

In testimony on his bill, Christofferson said he believed the tax incentives had served their purpose of getting a new industry off the ground—16 percent of Utah’s power generation now comes from solar, ranking it 16th in the nation for solar capacity.

Christofferson’s bill was the least concerning to the industry, largely because it negotiated a lengthy wind-down of the subsidies. Initially it would have ended the tax credit after Jan. 1, 2032. But after negotiations with the solar industry, he extended the deadline to 2035.

The bill passed the House, but when it reached the Senate floor, Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, moved the end of the incentives to 2028. He told ProPublica he believes solar is already established and no longer needs the subsidy. Christofferson tried to defend his compromise but ultimately voted with the legislative majority.

Unlike Christofferson’s bill, which wasn’t born of an antipathy for renewable energy, Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, made it clear in public statements and behind closed doors to industry lobbyists that the goal of his bill was to make solar pay.

The bill imposes a tax on all solar production. The proceeds will substantially increase the state’s endangered species fund, which Utah paradoxically uses to fight federal efforts to list threatened animals for protection. Snider cast his bill as pro-environment, arguing the money could also go to habitat protection.

As initially written, the bill would have taxed not only future projects, but also those already producing power and, more worrisome for the industry, projects under construction or in development with financing in place. The margins on such projects are thin, and the unanticipated tax could kill projects already in the works, one solar industry executive testified.

“Companies like ours are being effectively punished for investing in the state,” testified another.

The pushback drew attacks from Snider, who accused solar companies of hypocrisy on the environment.

Industry lobbyists who spoke to ProPublica said Snider wasn’t as willing to negotiate as Christofferson. However, they succeeded in reducing the tax rate on future developments and negotiated a smaller, flat fee for existing projects.

“Everyone sort of decided collectively to save the existing projects and let it go for future projects,” said one lobbyist.

Snider told ProPublica, “My goal was never to run anybody out of business. If we wanted to make it more heavy-handed, we could have. Utah is a conservative state, and I would have had all the support.”

Snider said, like the governor, he favors an any-of-the-above approach to energy generation and doesn’t “want to take down any particular industry or source.” But he believes utility-scale solar farms need to pay to mitigate their impact on the environment. He likened his bill to federal law that requires royalties from oil and gas companies to be used for conservation. He hopes federal lawmakers will use his bill as a model for federal legislation that would apply to solar projects nationwide.

“This industry needs to give back to the environment that they claim very heavily they are going to protect,” he said. “I do believe there’s a tinge of hypocrisy to this whole movement. You can’t say you’re good for the environment and not offset your impacts.”

One of the more emotional debates over solar is set to return next year, after a bill that would end tax incentives for solar development on agricultural land failed to get a vote in the final minutes of this year’s session. Sponsored by Rep. Colin Jack, R-St. George, the bill has been fast-tracked in the next session, which begins in January.

Jack said he was driven to act by ranchers who were concerned that solar companies were outbidding them for land they had been leasing to graze cows. Solar companies pay substantially higher rates than ranchers can. His bill initially had a slew of land use restrictions—such as mandating the distance between projects and residential property and creeks, minimum lot sizes and 4-mile “green zones” between projects—that solar lobbyists said would have strangled their industry. After negotiating with solar developers, Jack eliminated the land use restrictions while preserving provisions to prohibit tax incentives for solar farms on private agricultural land and to create standards for decommissioning projects.

Many in rural Utah recoil at rows of black panels disrupting the landscape and fear solar farms will displace the ranching and farming way of life. Indeed, some wondered whether Cox, who grew up on a farm in central Utah, would have been as critical of Trump scuttling a 62,300-acre solar farm in his own state as he was of the Nevada project’s cancellation.

Peter Greathouse, a rancher in western Utah’s Millard County, said he is worried about solar farms taking up grazing land in his county. “Twelve and a half percent is privately owned, and a lot of that is not farmable. So if you bring in these solar places that start to eat up the farmland, it can’t be replaced,” he said.

Utah is losing about 500,000 acres of agricultural land every 10 years, most of it to housing. A report by The Western Way estimated solar farms use 0.1 percent of the United States’ total land mass. That number is expected to grow to 0.46 percent by 2050—a tiny fraction of what is used by agriculture. Of the land managed by the Utah Trust Lands Administration, less than 3,000 of the 2.9 million acres devoted to grazing have been converted to solar farms.

Other ranchers told ProPublica they’ve been able to stay on their land and preserve their way of life by leasing to solar. Landon Kesler’s family, which raises cattle for team roping competitions, has leased land to solar for more than a decade. The revenue has allowed the family to almost double its land holdings, providing more room to ranch, Kesler said.

“I’m going to be quite honest, it’s absurd,” Kesler said of efforts to limit solar on agricultural land. “Solar very directly helped us tie up other property to be used for cattle and ranching. It didn’t run us out; it actually helped our agricultural business thrive.”

Solar lobbyists and executives have been working to bolster the industry’s image with lawmakers ahead of the next legislative session. They’re arguing solar is a good neighbor.

“We don’t use water, we don’t need sidewalks, we don’t create noise, and we don’t create light,” said Amanda Smith, vice president of external affairs for AES, which has one solar project operating in Utah and a second in development. “So we just sort of sit out there and produce energy.”

Solar pays private landowners in Utah $17 million a year to lease their land. And, more important, solar developers argue, it’s critical to powering data centers the state is working to attract.

“We are eager to be part of a diversified electricity portfolio, and we think we bring a lot of values that will benefit communities, keep rates low and stable, and help keep the lights on,” Rikki Seguin, executive director of Interwest Energy Alliance, a western trade organization that advocates for utility-scale renewable energy projects, told an interim committee of lawmakers this summer.

The message didn’t get a positive reception from some lawmakers on the committee. Rep. Carl Albrecht, R-Richfield, who represents three rural Utah counties and was among solar’s critics last session, said the biggest complaint he hears from constituents is about “that ugly solar facility” in his district.

“Why, Rep. Albrecht, did you allow that solar field to be built? It’s black. It looks like the Dead Sea when you drive by it,” Albrecht said.

            <div id="article-text">AI misinformation isn’t just for the right-wing boomers anymore. What once was mostly the domain of Facebook-bound conservatives desperate to believe welfare recipients are scamming the system has also seeped into the other side of the partisan divide.

Though research shows conservatives are much more likely to share misinformation than any other political persuasion, liberals seem to be playing catchup. Over the weekend, an AI-generated photo of Donald Trump using a walker went mega-viral on X-formerly-Twitter, gathering some 13.5 million views, according to the app’s admittedly dubious metrics.

Even if you don’t trust the view count, it’s hard to dismiss the nearly 100,000 likes and 6,000 comments on the post, which ranged from sarcastic missives about Trump’s health to angry rants about his policies. The post, uploaded by Democrat Party strategist Keith Edwards, was clearly meant as a jab at Trump’s executive order meant to halt all AI regulation at the state level.

“BREAKING: an image has leaked showing Trump using a walker moments after he signed an executive order banning states from regulating AI,” Edwards wrote, along with the lifelike image.

Though many of the posters under Edward’s post seemed to either be aware it was AI or simply notcare, it quickly broke containment, spreading to more credulous corners of the net. “Trump pictured using a walker after signing EO to deny state regulations against AI companies,” one anti-Trump poster parroted to its followers.

“Trump’s health can no longer be ignored now,” wrote the account Resist Persist on Facebook, gathering over 800 likes. “A picture was leaked of him using a walker, White House sources say he has been using a wheelchair at times, and we have all seen him sitting more over the past few months.”

Other examples of this kind of libslop abound, like California Governor Gavin Newsom’s AI-generated deepfake showing Trump, Pete Hegseth, and Stephen Miller being led away by the FBI in handcuffs. “Why are Democrats using the same AI slop that Republicans started using in the fall,” one commenter said. “We all agreed this is cringy shit.”

Back in 2024, some Democratic Party hopefuls spread an AI-modified image of Kamala Harris in a McDonalds uniform, apparently to boost her middle-class bonafides. “Hey MAGA cultists, explain this,” one poster challenged on Threads. In reality, the image had actually been generated by a pro-Trump poster and shared on X as a joke, where it soon spread beyond its original confines.

Other cases have involved generative AI voices, like the Joe Biden deepfake encouraging voters to “save their votes” for the November election, as opposed to the Democrat Party primary.

Whichever way you slice it, it seems that as generative AI becomes more sophisticated, the number of AI hoaxes on both sides of the aisle are only going up.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What’s the only thing sadder than a car company giving up on all-electric vehicles in 2025? Try Ford’s new all-electric pickup, powered by a gas generator on the side.

According to TechCrunch, that’s exactly the direction Ford has decided to go with its next-generation of pickup trucks. On Monday, the company announced it had ended production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, which it hailed as the “best selling electric pickup truck in the US” as recently as November.

In its place, Ford is rolling out an “extended range electric vehicle” version of the F-150 Lightning — complete with a gas generator that can add 700 miles of charge to the truck’s battery, TC reports. It’s not known when the EREV will go on sale.

In its announcement, Ford said it will report $19.5 billion in expenses related to the changeover, in order to update vehicle and battery factories.

All told, it sounds like a pretty robust retreat from electrification. On top of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, the automotive giant will also be scrapping plans for its T3, a top-down redesign of an all-electric truck, as well as a “next-generation commercial van,” TC confirmed.

“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher returning areas, more trucks and van hybrids, extended range electric vehicles, affordable EVs and entirely new opportunities like energy storage,” Ford president Andrew Frick told reporters.

Though the solution is beyond parody — an EV with a gas generator on the side sort of defeats the whole purpose of the thing — Frick’s point is fair enough.

When it debuted the Lightning, Ford promised it would start at a cost of $40,000, a commitment that Tesla’s Cybertruck tried to match. In reality, according to InsideEVs, consumers rarely saw those price tags, which were meant for enterprise customers buying fleets of vehicles in bulk. Instead, the cost for most electric trucks runs closer to $60,000 — a tough sell in this economy, to put it softly.

That’s in spite of a sizable potential market who are shut out by the truck’s pricing. As Brent Gruber, EV lead at research firm JD Power told InsideEVs, some 70 percent of consumers who consider buying a Ford Lightning have a household income of $100,000 or less.

“So it’s a high percentage of people who are interested in that product but aren’t necessarily following through to the purchase process, likely in part, due to the cost of that product,” Gruber said, adding that it “really resonated with consumers, but probably fell short from a cost perspective.”

Where we go from here is anyone’s guess. Unless the harebrained Lightning EREV is substantially more cost-effective from a purchaser standpoint, it’s unlikely to solve Ford’s longstanding problem of affordability — though it may buy them some breathing room while they figure out what led them to this point in the first place.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Experts have been urgently warning that allowing young kids to play with AI-powered toys could have negative consequences, from stunting childhood development by blurring the boundary between imagination and reality to exposing tots to inappropriate subject matters and AI hallucinations.

And as it quickly turned out, their worries were not unfounded. Toy makers have unleashed a flood of AI toys that have already been caught telling tykes how to find knives, light fires with matches, and giving crash courses in sexual fetishes.

Most recently, tests found that an AI toy from China is regaling children with Chinese Communist Party talking points, telling them that “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China” and defending the honor of the country’s president Xi Jinping.

So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that multinational toy manufacturer Mattel, the company behind Barbie and Hot Wheels, is pushing the “pause” button after announcing a “strategic collaboration” with ChatGPT maker OpenAI back in June.

The company confirmed to Axios that it won’t be releasing its first OpenAI-powered toy before the end of the year, as originally planned.

“We don’t have anything planned for the holiday season,” a spokesperson told Axios.

And when it does release a product, it won’t be aimed at young children, the company said, noting that OpenAI’s offerings are currently limited to those aged 13 and older. (Whether that’s actually stopping younger children from accessing its AI models is a different matter; the company made a show of kicking one AI-powered teddy bear off its platform, then allowed its manufacturer to start using it again.)

“Leveraging this incredible technology is going to allow us to really reimagine the future of play,” Mattel chief franchise officer Josh Silverman told Bloomberg at the time that it struck the deal with OpenAI.

“Mattel should announce immediately that it will not incorporate AI technology into children’s toys,” advocacy group Public Citizen co-president Robert Weissman wrote in a statement responding to the announcement. “Children do not have the cognitive capacity to distinguish fully between reality and play.”

“Endowing toys with human-seeming voices that are able to engage in human-like conversations risks inflicting real damage on children,” he added. “It may undermine social development, interfere with children’s ability to form peer relationships, pull children away from playtime with peers, and possibly inflict long-term harm.”

Even older minors are extremely vulnerable to the tech, as an alarming number of teen deaths and high-profile lawsuits that followed have demonstrated, with numerous parents suing OpenAI, alleging that ChatGPT assisted their children’s suicides.

Those concerns have largely fallen on deaf ears, particularly when it comes to toy makers in China, who have been flooding online marketplaces in the US with AI toys aimed at young children.

Two separate reports by the nonprofit consumer safety-focused US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund (PIRG) have found that guardrails are woefully inadequate, allowing children to have extremely inappropriate conversations with the AI toys.

It remains to be seen how Mattel and OpenAI will move forward. We still don’t know what the company has in store — but given the ongoing conversations surrounding the many negative side effects of exposing young children and teens to the tech, any future offering will be heavily scrutinized.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/doordash-rolls-out-zesty-an-ai-social-app-for-discovering-new-restaurants/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">DoorDash is launching a new AI-powered social app that’s designed to help users quickly find local restaurants. The app, called Zesty, is initially available in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York.

With the app, DoorDash is branching out beyond food delivery and stepping into the social and discovery space. The idea behind the app is to get rid of the need to read a bunch of different reviews, look up different menus, or browse TikTok when looking for a new place to eat.

Once people open up the app and sign in with their DoorDash accounts, they can ask an AI chatbot for personalized recommendations based on what they’re looking for. In an Instagram promo post, the company shared that users can type prompts like, “A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that’s actually good for introverts” to find specific recommendations. Users will also see suggested prompts, such as “Brunch spots good for groups,” and “Romantic dinner with a vintage feel.”

DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang wrote in an X post that the app aggregates info across DoorDash, Google Maps, TikTok, and more to “curate the best suggestions from the web.”

The app also learns your tastes to figure out what you do and don’t like. Once you come across a recommendation you’re interested in, you can save it and share it with others.

Users can view and share photos and comments about restaurants they’ve visited, discover content from others, and follow people just like on any social network.

“At DoorDash, we’re always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,” a DoorDash spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. “We’re piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. We’re excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.”

News of the app’s launch was first reported by Bloomberg.

Of course, some people may not want to download a whole new app to find new restaurants when they could simply use Google. For people who have already embedded AI into their daily lives, they may already be using services like ChatGPT and Gemini to discover new restaurants. However, the app could be a welcome launch for people who want to be part of a social network that’s all about discovering new restaurants.

The launch of the new app marks DoorDash’s latest effort to branch beyond delivery services, as the company earlier this year launched features that allow customers to make reservations for in-person dining and earn in-store rewards.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta announced on Tuesday an update to its AI glasses that will allow you to better hear people talking when you’re in a noisy environment. The feature will initially become available on Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the U.S. and Canada, the company says. In addition, the glasses are getting another update that lets you use Spotify to play a song that matches what’s in your current view.

For instance, if you’re looking at an album cover, the glasses could play a song by that artist. Or if you’re looking at your Christmas tree with a pile of gifts, you could play holiday music. This addition is more of a gimmick, of course, but it demonstrates how Meta is thinking about connecting what people see with actions they can take in their apps.

The conversation-focus feature, meanwhile, seems more practical. First announced at Meta’s Connect conference earlier this year, the feature uses the AI glasses’ open-ear speakers to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to. Meta says smart glasses wearers will also be able to adjust the amplification level by swiping the right temple of their glasses, or via the device settings. This will allow them to set the level more precisely to match their current environment, whether that’s a busy restaurant or bar, club, commuter train, or anything else.

How well the feature works, of course, will still need to be tested. However, the idea of using smart accessories as tools to help with hearing isn’t limited to Meta. Apple’s AirPods already offer a Conversation Boost feature designed to help you focus on the person you’re talking to, and the Pro models more recently added support for a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature as well.

While the conversation-focus feature is limited to the U.S. and Canada, the Spotify feature is offered in English in a larger number of markets, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the U.K., and the U.S.

The software update (v21) will first become available to those who are enrolled in Meta’s Early Access Program, which requires first joining a waitlist and being approved. It will later roll out more broadly.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/openai-continues-on-its-code-red-warpath-with-new-image-generation-model/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is rolling out a new version of ChatGPT Images that promises better instruction-following, more precise editing, and up to 4x faster image generation speeds.

The new model, dubbed GPT Image 1.5, is available starting Tuesday to all ChatGPT users and via the API. It’s the latest escalation in the competition with Google’s Gemini after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month declared a “code red” in a leaked internal memo. The memo detailed OpenAI’s plans to regain its position as the AI leader after Google had begun to take market share following the release of Gemini 3, its latest flagship model, and Nano Banana Pro, the newest version of Google’s viral image generator — both of which have topped the LMArena leaderboard across multiple benchmarks.

Google maintains its lead even after OpenAI responded to its success last week with the launch of GPT-5.2, pitching it as its most advanced model yet for developers and everyday professional use. OpenAI had reportedly been planning to release a new image generator in early January, accelerating those plans with this week’s announcement. Its last image model release was GPT Image 1 in April.

GPT Image 1.5 arrives as image and video generators advance beyond prototypes and gain more production-ready capabilities. Like Nano Banana Pro, ChatGPT Image offers post-production features, providing more granular edit controls to maintain visual consistency, like facial likeness, lighting, composition, and color tone across edits.

Most GenAI image tools are bad at iteration, so this would be a huge step up. Asked for a specific change, like “adjust the facial expression” or “make lighting colder,” models will often reinterpret the entire image, leading to a lack of consistency.

The update isn’t just about new features. ChatGPT images will also now be accessible via a dedicated entry point in the ChatGPT sidebar that works “more like a creative studio,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in a blog post Tuesday.

“The new image viewing and editing screens make it easier to create images that match your vision or get inspiration from trending prompts and preset filters,” Simo wrote.

On top of the new image generator, OpenAI is introducing new ways to improve the ChatGPT experience with more visual elements. The plan is to make search queries display more visuals with clear sources, which could be helpful for tasks like converting measurements or checking sports scores, per Simo.

“When you’re creating, you should be able to see and shape the thing you’re making. When visuals tell a story better than words alone, ChatGPT should include them,” Simo wrote. “When you need a quick answer or the next step lives in another tool, it should be right there. As we do this, we can keep closing the distance between what’s in your mind and your ability to bring it to life.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Midway through William Greaves’s documentary Nationtime, which follows the 1972 National Black Political Convention, a woman named Audley Moore stands in a busy hallway preaching to people’s backs. She is clad in a burgundy-and-navy-floral kaftan and matching headwrap. Her voice rings out amid the bustling crowd of convention-goers: “Now let me tell you: Benjamin Franklin said, ‘Those who seek temporary security rather than basic liberty deserve neither.’ I’m demanding reparations. That’s all I can see now. That’s the answer for our people.” She is paraphrasing Franklin’s quote, one whose meaning is frequently misconstrued, but the invocation of the Founding Father lends both heft and irony to her calls for redress from the American government. Moore catches a few passersby and jokes with them, shoving a typewritten paper in their hands as they walk away. A few stay to listen. This scene aptly encapsulates the life of Audley “Queen Mother” Moore, an often-overlooked Black-nationalist organizer who fought vociferously for Black self-determination until her death in 1997.

A laudable new biography, Queen Mother: Black Nationalism, Reparations, and the Untold Story of Audley Moore, by the historian Ashley D. Farmer, uses Moore’s story to chart a trajectory of Black-nationalist activism in the United States, from Garveyism in the 1920s (Moore belonged to the New Orleans chapter of Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association, or UNIA) to the 1995 Million Man March for Black-male unity and self-empowerment. Moore’s radical ideas—including her desire for a separate Black nation in the South—earned her ridicule at times, but her sharp critiques of American white supremacy also found purchase, influencing activists such as Malcolm X, Muhammad Ahmad, and Charles J. Ogletree Jr.

Despite her prolific political organizing and wide reach during her lifetime, Moore has largely been omitted from the history of civil-rights activism. Her exclusion from traditional archives is a familiar story to scholars of Black American life, especially those who study the contributions of women. Farmer writes that her book, which she spent a decade researching and writing, required painstaking effort to locate traces of Moore in personal papers, land deeds, files from the FBI and the House Un-American Activities Committee, oral-history tapes, and lingering memories (much of Moore’s ephemera were lost in a house fire). The resulting work, which examines her involvement in a strikingly diverse roster of organizations, is a portrait of a woman with uncanny savvy and flexibility.

Moore worked with nationalists, Communists, and moderate liberals, white and Black alike—whatever it took to pursue goals such as fair housing regulations, just labor laws, and equitable resource distribution. She was sometimes self-contradicting as an activist, which isn’t to say she wasn’t singularly dedicated to her cause. She seems to have simply understood that achieving her objectives—in all their multiplicity—required maximal fluidity. Activists with unchanging missions might be easier to pin down (and thus less likely to be forgotten). But Moore’s story shows that the Black-nationalist movement also encompassed people who were willing to find areas of compromise in order to get the job done.

Moore was born in 1898 in New Iberia, Louisiana, to a well-off family that descended from both enslaved and free Black communities. But both her parents died before she reached adulthood, and she was forced to turn to domestic work in white households, one of the few economic avenues available to her at the time. In the violent, segregated South during World War I, Moore “looked on as America made its grand debut on the world stage as a great emancipator—a masterful public performance as liberty’s beacon shining from the West, all while extending white supremacy’s tendrils across the globe,” Farmer writes. Having noticed that the Army didn’t offer as much support for Black soldiers as it did for white ones, Moore and her two sisters provided meals and recreation space to these troops in Anniston, Alabama. Losing the protection of Black elite society that her parents had afforded her, and witnessing the contradiction between America’s actions abroad and at home, helped shape Moore’s lifelong advocacy for civil rights and for working-class concerns.

It is difficult to overstate the influence on Moore’s development of Marcus Garvey, the foremost Black nationalist of the 20th century. Garvey sought to revitalize “Africa for the Africans,” and to repatriate people of African descent to their motherland. He also championed Black pride, self-reliance, and racial separatism on the basis that white people would never recognize Black people’s human rights. His teachings showed the fledgling activist how to analyze Black people’s social conditions and gave her the desire to unify Black people everywhere. In 1922, Moore joined the UNIA in New Orleans, attending meetings and studying the history of the global African diaspora. She and her then-husband once even packed up all of their possessions, planning to expatriate to Liberia as part of one of Garvey’s “Back to Africa” initiatives, before ultimately deciding to stay in the United States.

After Garvey was deported in 1927 following a mail-fraud conviction, Moore was forced to channel her activism into vehicles beyond the declining UNIA. A move to Harlem brought her into the orbit of the Communist Party. A card-carrying member by 1936, Moore cut her teeth protesting racist and sexist discrimination across New York City, forming tenants’ rights organizations, and sending aid to Ethiopia after a 1935 invasion by Italy. In response to Black Communists’ demands that the party address both class and race oppression, Communist leaders had come to believe that Black people constituted an oppressed nation, and that it was within the party’s interest to fight for their rights. But Moore’s association with the Communists was less of an ideological commitment, Farmer writes, than a practical way to work toward Garvey’s “anti-imperialist, pro-Black” goals. Collaborating with the moderate NAACP, Moore advocated for the freedom of five of the Scottsboro Boys, a group of nine Black teens falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama.

Moore also worked on many causes tangential to Black nationalism, including lowering the price of milk for children and boycotting goods from Nazi Germany. Among her other “strange bedfellows,” Farmer mentions Mary McLeod Bethune’s respectable, middle-class National Council of Negro Women, “an unlikely place for a Black Nationalist and Communist” who was primarily self-educated. But Moore’s success in organizing with Communists had taught her that, as Farmer writes, “an organization need not be explicitly Black Nationalist in its mission to advance the cause.”

“The cause” itself, for Moore—and, truthfully, for many Black nationalists—couldn’t be distilled into a clear, unified goal. As James Edward Smethurst, a scholar of 20th-century Black radical movements, writes in his book The Black Arts Movement, the actual definitions and tactics of Black nationalism were secondary to the belief that, without self-determination, Black people would be “oppressed and exploited second-class (or non-) citizens in the United States.” Moore’s activism exemplifies how, as Smethurst writes, “old Left and old Nationalist spaces often intersected with each other and with those of the New Left, the Civil Rights Movement, and the new nationalists,” particularly Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, “in surprising ways.”

In 1950, Moore fell out with the Communist Party because of its shifting focus away from Black equality. Over the next two decades, her politics would harden; she mentored many young nationalists, including Malcolm X and Ahmad, a founder of the Revolutionary Action Movement. But as Farmer writes, guiding all of Moore’s work was a single overarching dream, rooted in her early days with the UNIA: gaining reparations. In 1962, Moore launched a campaign to persuade the U.S. government to pay reparations to descendants of enslaved Africans, which she timed for the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation the following year. She and her fellow activists charged that the country owed Black Americans $500 trillion, to be paid in land and cash distributed to individuals annually. She even sought the formation of a separatist Black nation in the U.S.—what she called a “national territory in a country developed by our blood and tears and unrequited slave labor.” This was groundbreaking at a time when the zeitgeist prioritized inclusion in the American body politic rather than separation and redress.

In the 1960s, Moore would become known by the honorific “Queen Mother Moore,” in recognition of her role as an elder stateswoman to Black organizers across the political spectrum. During a trip to Ghana in 1972, she was crowned with the title in an Asante ceremony. In the ’70s, she reached the height of her influence in the Black Power Movement, becoming a mentor figure to a Detroit-based separatist group, the Republic of New Afrika, that advocated for five Black Belt states to be given to Black Americans as a nation-state. In spite of the group’s unrealized dreams—as well as struggles with surveillance and violent disruption from the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO—Farmer writes that Moore still affirmed, at the end of the ’70s, “I’m a hard nationalist.”

Read: A book that puts the life back into biography

In Queen Mother, Farmer takes a clear-eyed look at Moore’s foibles, noting her absenteeism during her son’s formative years, her embrace of patriarchal hierarchy in Black communities, and her exhortations for Black women to embrace polygyny to facilitate nation building. Farmer acknowledges that Black nationalists sometimes took violent action, claiming the “right to govern themselves and to defend themselves.” But she also seeks to correct a common misunderstanding of the ideology, arguing that it’s not the “violent, incoherent, and nihilistic inverse of the Civil Rights Movement,” but a campaign with the very same goals, sought through different means (separation from white society, rather than integration). Still, many of Moore’s ideas “were on the fringe then,” Farmer writes, “as they are now.” The historian doesn’t explain away Moore’s infatuation and personal association with the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who in 1975 invited her to attend a meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Kampala. As Farmer writes, Moore was “thrilled” by him and seemed to ignore the fact that his rule had become known for its corruption and human-rights abuses.

But Farmer doesn’t need to justify all of Moore’s beliefs and goals to make a case for her influence. Her meticulous study of the many figures, movements, and organizations Moore worked with shows that her contributions were pivotal, rather than peripheral. Moore was a Garveyite through line—what Farmer calls a midwife—to many 20th-century Black-nationalist activists, a lot of them men, who remain more famous than her. Queen Mother establishes her as a titan in her own right, a central influence in nearly a century of global Black-liberation struggles, and a reminder for modern activists of a persistent truth: that cooperation does not have to mean compromising one’s values, and that those who dream of freedom have more than one way of achieving it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Open it the fuck back up!” the muscular Matt Honeycutt commands, mic gripped in his left fist, mustache prickling with indignation. He is balefully slash lovingly surveying the crowd and finding it a little sluggish and closely packed for his taste. “I need all my primitive, low-IQ motherfuckers!” Behind him, his band, Kublai Khan TX, rears and slumps into its next song. And the crowd lurches; the crowd flexes; the crowd feels its core, which is both a sucking emptiness and a site of repellent energy, like the space cleared by a fistfight.

“Build myself in the dirt!” Honeycutt roars. “Sacred right, sacred curse.”

“I’d hate to be in that pit right now,” someone says behind me.

Hot autumn night has fallen over Worcester, Massachusetts, over the huge, baked asphalt lot behind the Palladium, the ancestral seat of the Northeast’s heavy-metal kingdom. This is the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival, 25 bands on three stages, 10 unbroken hours of heavy music, and all day, I’ve been watching the pit—the mosh pit, the area close to the stage where inflamed dancers whirl and collide. I’ve been watching it, and skulking around it journalistically, because I am possessed by an idea: What if the pit, this ritualized maelstrom at the heart of the hardcore-metal crowd, could teach us something about how to live together in 2025—about how to be?

Heavy metal, of all music, knows just how sick we are. Just how pinned down by depression, addiction, insanity, technology, the machine of society and the thumb of God. Metal has been telling us this—gleefully, monstrously—since Ozzy Osbourne first sang, “Back on Earth, the flame of life burns low / Everywhere is misery and woe.” It’s a message that never goes out of style. But right now in America—what with the digital splatteration, the black-hole subjectivity, and the goon squad crouched in a van behind Dunkin’—it has, shall we say, an especial piquancy.

Metalfest, as I like to call it, has been running at the Palladium since 1999, reliably showcasing the best and the brightest, the worst and the darkest, from across the spectrum of metal and hardcore punk. When I say “10 unbroken hours of heavy music,” I’m not kidding. Metalfest is immaculately organized and relentlessly programmed, and the heaviness is continuous.

Inside the Palladium, there’s a small, explosive room for the bands at the jumpier and more hardcore-punk end of the spectrum, bands such as Hard Target, from Central Massachusetts, and New York City’s Madball. Outside in the lot, where the metal hordes are gathered, two large stages face each other across an expanse of a few hundred yards, and when a band (say, Gideon) stops playing at one end, another band (say, Full of Hell) starts up—immediately—at the other end. As one set finishes, in other words—THANK YOU, WOOST-AAAAAH!—its last chord still decaying and its ions still swimming in the afternoon air, you hear behind you a scuttle of drums and a squawk of feedback and an AWRIGHT! LET’S FUCKING GO! All you have to do is turn around.

Perfect. Perfect for this crowd. For this is the deepest and most unassuaged desire of all metalheads: to live in a state of continuous heaviness.

And heaviness is …? I’ll hazard some definitions. It’s a sense of cosmic tragedy, a love of the low end, an affinity for the thicker frequencies of existence, a paradoxically joyful desolation. It’s the compression of Time in a riff. It’s the weight of experience and the curve of space. It’s the caped shadow of Ozzy, his wings spread, crying, “Lost in the wheels of confusion.” It’s the mood conveyed by the slogans on the backs of the various band T-shirts that everyone at Metalfest is wearing: FUCK YOUR LIFE; SORROW WILL PREVAIL; YOU WILL DIE MY ENEMY.

The pit is an institution, at least 40 years old. Who started it? Where? Was it birthed in the skinhead cauldron of New York’s Lower East Side, or in Southern California, with the punk-rock surfers and skaters of Huntington Beach? The legends abound, but somewhere (or more likely in several places at once), around the beginning of the 1980s, the crowd at U.S. hardcore shows opened up. Where there had been a crush or a scrum, there was suddenly and dramatically a space: for violence, for collision, for expression, for the hardest of the hardcore. The pit. And as the aggression and acceleration of hardcore migrated into metal, and into the roomier, boomier venues of the metal circuit, the pit got bigger.

(And not every hardcore or post-hardcore band was pro-pit. Fugazi, of Washington, D.C., would regularly stop their shows mid-song, the set’s momentum quiveringly arrested, to address thuggish behavior in the space in front of the stage.)

As to who’s in the pit, who’s making the pit happen, let’s take a look. There are big boys throwing their weight around, and there are wild skinnies with flying arms and spinning back-kicks, chopping out their emergency version of personal space. There are cheerful barging amateurs, happy to be bounced about, and there are prowling malevolences, waiting for the moment to blindside someone or chuck an elbow in their face. There is the occasional fearless woman. Like America, the pit is just barely a democracy. But you need youth, and you need strength: It’s no country for old men.

And here’s something interesting. The amount of fights, bloody noses, chest-to-chest confrontations, bouncer interventions I spot at Metalfest: zero. A self-policing environment, to a remarkable degree. Although I do overhear one young woman in post-pit distress—“That was the stupidest shit I’ve ever seen, girl! I am livid! Like, who is this bitch? I’ve never seen her before!”—while her partner murmurs indecipherable sounds of consolation.

Part of being a metal or hardcore front man in 2025 is knowing how to work the pit, appointing yourself a specialist in mob physics. All day at Metalfest, you could hear them calling out the moves: “Make a circle pit!” (a vortex); “Two-step! TWO-STEPPP!” (a dance, a kind of hobbit-y stomp); “Side to fuckin’ side!” (self-explanatory). The crowd will obediently convulse, or it won’t. “Okay, now we’re gonna play a game called Wall of Death,” the singer of Despised Icon announces during their early-evening set. “The game’s pretty simple. I’m gonna count to four—”

“TOO HARD!” one wag bellows in front of us.

The Wall of Death, incidentally, involves splitting the crowd down the middle, creating a channel of space, and then having the two sides charge across it like clashing medieval armies.

Mid-afternoon, battered by metal, away from the melee, I have a chat with the least metal-looking person I can find—Black, nonbinary, softly and secretly smiling, in pants and combat boots but with floating diaphanous layers. “I’m tripping balls,” they tell me, which partly explains their air of conspicuous apartness: They are on a private journey, drifting through Metalfest on luminous drug filaments. They show me their sketchbook, full of tarot-like images of aliens and birds.

“I saw you in the pit,” I say. “How did it feel in there?”

The soft, secret smile. “It’s all hugging; it’s all love. They want the contact.”

You’re wondering about the politics. Metal itself, being essentially a sensation in the brain stem, is apolitical, but metalheads are human, and they have their opinions. And if you want to listen to this elemental, unreconstructed music, you’re going to have to take your dose of illiberalism. In the pit, you’re going to have to deal with the guy whose T-shirt reads I STAND FOR THE FLAG AND KNEEL FOR THE CROSS. The front men are demagogues; the crowd is suggestible, fanatical; and between one downstroked chord and the next, you can hear the eclipse of the Enlightenment.

But love abides. Care abides. “I’ve got 15 seconds ’til I say some real shit,” Mychal Soto, a guitarist for Oklahoma’s PeelingFlesh, shouts, wiping his face mid-set with a towel in the afternoon glare and looking out at the crowd. “This set right here goes out to anybody that’s a minority or a person of color that’s had to battle some real shit,” he continues. “Even though that’s not your problem? Make it your problem—make it your fucking problem. I think it’s time for us as a people to become human again. It’s time to give a shit about the people next to us. We have to stop this madness, because if we don’t, this country is going to be over in our lifetime. This ain’t a cry for either side; this is a cry for love and compassion for human beings. So LET’S DO THIS SHIT.”

Five hours later, Honeycutt doffs his baseball hat to the audience. “This next track,” he declares, “goes out to all the ladies in the house!” But this isn’t some sexist rave-up. This isn’t “Girls, Girls, Girls,” by Mötley Crüe. This one’s about truck-stop sex workers, exploitation, and generational abuse. This is Kublai Khan TX’s “Swan Song”: “To all the ladies working Iowa 80 …” Could it be the most savagely empathetic pro-woman song ever produced by a bunch of big hairy metal dudes? If you’d heard the chorus of women’s voices singing along at Metalfest—“For all the fear, every tear / Slowly burning your sight / For every moment in the light / I fucking see you tonight”—you wouldn’t hesitate to say yes, yes, yes. “Wonderful!” Honeycutt growls contentedly.

There is a set by Cannibal Corpse at one end of the Palladium lot, a set by Lorna Shore at the other end. Then Metalfest wraps up, and we drift off, vibrationally pummeled, numb and gladdened, into the heavy-metal night. Reality will come with the dawn: normal life, the 2025 model, with its warpings of ambient pressure and its weightless panics. For now, we’re held in the sweet penumbra of heaviness. As for my big idea—that we can heal ourselves in the pit—well, let’s just say that it’s the kind of idea only a journalist would have. But I can still see them whirling and colliding, the dancers, and my mind slows it all to half speed, and shafts of beauty beam out, dazzlingly, from the blur of the limbs and the ecstatic, grimacing faces.

It looks like chaos, but there’s no real chaos, is there? Everything’s cause and effect, if you know where to look.</div>

Color me skeptical, but I don&#39;t think the production house is dropping $100 million+ in some directors lap to make a movie because advertising. For every ad-supported service,  you bet it&#39;s about advertising. Netflix doesn&#39;t produce a show to put on their ad-supported tier without the advertisers wanting to know the reach of their ads. While I&#39;m sure Netflix, Amazon, Sling, and everyone else produces metrics of what ads were inserted, reading from the display is an interesting way to cross-check the metrics.That said, I have zero interest in participating. I want my display to be dumb as a bag of hammers.

I guess it&#39;s time to just pull it off the network completely.

One of the reasons I didn&#39;t was that I didn&#39;t think I could afford one that didn&#39;t spy, but it turns out those big name brands are some of the worst??  I figured Sony, Samsung and LG would be the safe brands.  I never trusted TCL or Hisense, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re connected to CCP servers all day.

And does this mean that Visio doesn&#39;t spy?  I wanted to go with a different brand this time (replacing a Visio with a bad backlight array), and Visio has been running ads on the home screen, but I&#39;ll take ads over monitoring.

You simply buy the TV and don&#39;t connect it to the internet at all. If you want to do initial updating of the TV&#39;s firmware, create a temporary guest network on your wireless and add the TV to it, then delete the network when you&#39;re done.

Use a separate streaming device for your streaming services. You could make one with a SBC and then watch the services via web browser to the TV if you want to get extreme with this.

Recognizing when there&#39;s an interruption to the program I&#39;m watching so I can turn what is probably an ad into a silent black screen.

Sure, I may miss out on urgent weather bulletins or we-interrupt-this-program-for-a-major-news-bulletins, but at least I won&#39;t have to watch the ads.

I&#39;m waiting for a TV that will include this ad-blocking technology without an unacceptable price.  I&#39;m also waiting for the heat death of the universe.  I&#39;m pretty sure I know which will happen first.

Is that 60-days notice or just 60-days pay?

I&#39;ve always detested what this company does. It is basically in the business of destroying value for consumers. What they do is identify areas where companies leave money on the table which is really value that consumers see and turn it into extra profit for the company. Allstate Insurance was one example of a company which was &quot;McKinsey&#39;d&quot;. They went in and identified all of the areas where value could be extracted from the product, and then turned it into profit, this caused the product to become less attractive to the consumer. I had Allstate insurance in the 80&#39;s but had to switch to another insurance carrier when they removed the value from their product. You might say that they were the selling enshittifcation as a service &quot;EAAS&quot;.

The stock market forces this. All public companies are stacked this way. If you are leaving money on the table, then you are hurting the share holder. Damn the quality or company reputation. It is a source of attack if you care about customers. Watch any company go public and you will see the erosion in a decade.

The stock market alone forces companies to despise their customers.

This means that the long term strategy would be to go under, because once you are no longer providing value, the consumers will look elsewhere. (That is unless you are operating a cartel)

Lack of long term term planning is the Achilles heel of &quot;C&quot; corporations. There is no mechanism to force them to consider long term objectives. You might say that this is against shareholder interests as well, but mist shareholders don&#39;t own the stock long enough for it to matter to them.

You don&#39;t hear many complaints about Publix Supermarkets doing these things.  It&#39;s publicly traded,

And, despite there being no logical justification, evidence, or even fairness in the allegation, I&#39;m going to go ahead and blame them for the 1929 crash as they were founded in 1926 and survived it.

These people are overwhelmingly trivial to replace, a few slides and some self important babble is what AI thrives in producing.

The only thing that AI will have a hard time emulating is the filthy corrupt behind the scenes deals and general corruption that the big4 have cultivated as their only real tangible output and product.

In my experience it seems that consultants are often only hired to justify things that managers can&#39;t justify. Once they hire a consultant and the consultant tells them they should do the thing they want to do, they can do it with no further justification and blame the consultants when it all goes wrong.

Needs funny, but the best I can do is that every company includes some part or person who is least profitable and it seems easy and a &quot;sure fire&quot; path to higher profitability to cut off that part or person.

What could possibly go wrong? Until you get down to the last person?

My governor wants Americans to stop shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater.

Generally wise advice, that. But it is hard to take him seriously when the theater is, indeed, on fire. And he has come to support one of the worst political arsonists in American history.

To be fair, Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, faces a dilemma that burdens many of his party’s leaders, especially those who were active before the rise of Donald Trump and may wish to do meaningful work after he is gone. How to behave so as to have hope that the MAGA beast you deplore might eat you last.

Cox has earned himself a lot of national media attention recently for what he calls the “Disagree Better” campaign, launched a couple of years ago with a bipartisan collective of other U.S. governors. He has appeared with Democrats including Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania to promote the idea.

The initiative took on added significance in September when the right-wing firebrand Charlie Kirk was murdered while giving an open-air talk at Utah Valley University in Orem.

Cox was right to seize the occasion to repeat his call for Americans to reject political violence, turn down the temperature, get off social media algorithms that deliberately fry your brain, and learn to talk rather than fight. He took advantage of the increased media focus to take his message to such prominent news outlets as 60 Minutes on CBS and NPR’s Morning Edition.

“I’m not asking anybody to hold hands and hug it out,” he told CBS correspondent Scott Pelley. “I’m trying to get people to stop shooting each other.”

Sensible people can raise no argument to that. And it is difficult to watch or listen to Cox and argue that he is anything but sincere.

But the governor’s peace message is all but overwhelmed by the fact that he is a member of the political party that has thrice nominated, and twice elected, as president of the United States a man whose popularity and power exist only on rising air currents of fear, prejudice, division, and violence.

Trump is a hate vampire who would instantly dissolve in the sunlight if America suddenly became a peaceful nation practicing respectful politics.

Cox seemed to see that, saying in 2016 that he was not supporting Trump due to the obvious flaws in his character.

“I think he represents the worst of what our great country stands for,” Cox said at the time.

Cox didn’t vote for Trump in 2020 either, though he recognized the president as the head of his party. He rightly and courageously blamed Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol and said the president should resign because of it.

Early on, Cox said he wasn’t going to vote for Trump (or Joe Biden) in 2024, either.

Then, after Trump survived an assassination attempt, Cox turned around. He sent a letter to the president, saying he believed that Trump had been spared death for a reason and calling on him to do the one thing that every sentient being should know Trump will never do: Bring peace.

Cox now risks seeming less visionary than gullible. Like Franklin Roosevelt imagining he could reason with Stalin at Yalta. (The Soviet dictator was, in FDR’s hopeful mind, “get-atable.”)

Maybe Cox decided not to mount what would likely be a futile frontal assault on Trump’s hateful pronouncements and policies and chose to start working a quieter long game.

Maybe he just wanted to be reelected governor.

As an opinion writer and editor for the Salt Lake Tribune, I’ve been following Cox’s career since 2013, when he was plucked from relative obscurity to fill a vacant spot as lieutenant governor.

He’s no newcomer to political comity, and has always seemed sincere promoting it.

In Utah, being lieutenant governor, which Cox was from 2013 to 2021, is a real job. It includes such administrative duties as running the state’s election mechanisms, which Cox took to heart by promoting voter registration—sometimes featuring himself in goofy person-on-the-street videos—and flawlessly implementing the state’s vote-by-mail process.

When his boss, Gov. Gary Herbert, didn’t run again in 2020, Cox rode his jus’ folks, alfalfa-farmer persona (he’s also a lawyer and a telecom executive who served as a small-town mayor and state legislator in a fast-rising political career) into the governor’s mansion.

That was also the beginning of his reputation as a political peacemaker.

He and his Democratic opponent that year, a law professor named Chris Peterson, ran a joint advertisement somewhat stylistically reminiscent of the Mac vs. PC spots from about 2006. In it, each candidate asked for your vote, but spent more time calling for political harmony.

“We can debate issues without degrading each other’s character,” Peterson said.

“We can disagree without hating each other,” Cox answered.

It was a YouTube sensation. #StandUnited.

Utah hasn’t elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1996, so whoever carries the GOP nomination has long been considered a shoo-in come November. Thus Cox was not risking anything by giving his underfunded Democratic rival some oxygen that he otherwise would not have had.

In 2024, the path to reelection was a little more fraught. Cox drew a right-wing, MAGA primary challenger and was denied the endorsement of the Utah State Republican Convention. But Cox gathered enough signatures on a nominating petition to still be on the ballot in the Republican primary, which he won with 55 percent of the vote.

In November, with that same MAGA opponent drawing 13.5 percent in a write-in bid, Cox won reelection with 53 percent of the vote.

Between the primary and the general, when politicians are generally expected to crabwalk from the extremes to the center, Cox shifted from a quiet Never Trump Republican to a supporter of Trump’s campaign to return to the White House. He went so far as to join Trump for a cringe-inducing—and, because it was so blatantly political, illegal—visit to Arlington National Cemetery.

As governor, Cox has held moderate to right-wing Republican positions that should have made renomination an easy matter. He signed legislation allowing Utahns to carry firearms without a permit. He favors reducing federal environmental regulations and rescinding the designation of national monuments—a big deal in a state where 64 percent of the land is federally owned.

He has backed attempts in the Legislature to gerrymander the state’s four congressional districts in favor of Republicans and signed a law banning the fluoridation of drinking water in the state.

He has flip-flopped on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies in state government and education institutions—was supportive, now opposes—and supports the state’s attempts to basically ban abortion.

Cox had also given touchingly humane voice to the idea that LGBTQ+ people deserve respect and in 2022 vetoed a bill that would have prohibited transgender youth from participating in school sports. (The veto was quickly overridden by the Republican supermajority in the Utah Legislature. And Cox has since signed other legislation seen as curtailing transgender rights.)

It drew national attention and led Time magazine to dub him “The Red-State Governor Who’s Not Afraid to Be ‘Woke.’ ”

Such sentiments, along with his opposition to Trump, earned him a round of boos when he addressed the Utah Republican State Convention in 2024. “Maybe you just hate that I don’t hate enough,” Cox told the delegates.

To all outward appearances, Spencer Cox has little hate in him. But if he won’t more forcefully call out the would-be dictator who thrives on negative emotions, the cure for all this political rancor won’t be disagreeing better. It will be a country where people aren’t allowed to disagree at all. And more violence will be assured.

For Gregg Phillips, Monday marked his first day as the new head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Office of Response and Recovery. For the agency, it marked the beginning of a new era: one in which a genuine conspiracy theorist holds its second-most-powerful position.

Phillips, to be clear, is no mere hobbyist when it comes to dangerous conspiracy theories. He was a major figure behind the organization True the Vote, one of the most influential sources of election-fraud misinformation during the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Phillips and True the Vote claimed to have evidence of millions of fraudulent votes, as well as of Chinese efforts to steal the election. There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud, of course, but Phillips was reckless in his campaign, in terms of both his methods and his friends. According to the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America, Phillips developed numerous ties to the QAnon world as he sought allies in his efforts.

On Truth Social, he repeatedly shared posts from accounts with Q-related logos or names and screen grabs from Q drops, the messages left behind by the purported “Q” figure. He also posted directly to praise known QAnon influencers as friends and clever investigators. He appeared as a guest on several QAnon podcasts and even participated in QAnon’s “Flannel Fridays,” a symbol of solidarity with the movement. He made at least a dozen appearances on the Matrixxx Grooove Show, a livestream hosted by two QAnon supporters. He and the founder of True the Vote put on an event in Arizona that courted QAnon influencers, allowing over a dozen such influencers to network in person. He praised them all as patriots ready to expose the ways in which the “enemy” had stolen millions of votes from Donald Trump. Phillips, in other words, peddles in MAGA fantasies.

This appointment would have been a worrying one for any governmental department—the position, which oversee’s the agency’s largest division, does not require congressional approval—but it’s especially concerning when paired with FEMA. That’s because FEMA, more than just about any other agency, is a central entity in some of the oldest right-wing conspiracy theories about ambitiously menacing government schemes, which include everything from secret prison camps to human-caused hurricanes.

Beyond being ridiculous, experts say, having a conspiracy theorist leading the core work of a conspiracy theory–targeted entity could be dangerous. There are real reasons to worry that a person dismissive of mainstream expertise could derail the work of nonpartisan bureaucrats trying to protect the public. He could sideline technical experts, delay action during time-sensitive emergencies, and undermine important communication from the agency. And he could find innovative new ways to disrupt the agency’s work.

We have seen this play out already, in other personnel decisions from the Trump administration. Kash Patel runs the FBI, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. oversees the Health and Human Services Department. Both were chosen because they were convinced that evil had taken root in their respective agencies. During this second Trump administration, Kennedy’s pursuit of his convictions has been catastrophic: The administration has already rolled back vaccine mandates and helped cause deadly epidemics. Patel has inflicted less direct harm on the public, but he purged the bureau’s ranks and replaced them with loyalists, seriously compromising the trustworthiness of federal law enforcement.

So the question is what a similarly minded person could do in a place of such power in the country’s disaster-response agency. This will depend in part on what the administration decides to do with FEMA, as it is considering a major reorganization. But if FEMA remains the nation’s primary emergency-response infrastructure, and if it remains the central source of intel and coordination as climate change exacerbates extreme weather events, the presence of a conspiracy theorist in its top ranks could do very real harm. If a crusader with a paranoid mindset manages to remake FEMA’s disaster recovery into an arena for his grievances, it will mark the end of one of the most urgently nonpartisan roles of the federal government, a historic place of bipartisan agreement on the need to help suffering Americans, no matter who they are.

It makes some intuitive sense that FEMA would attract conspiracy theories, given that it’s the entity that’s most activated in times of crisis and confusion.

Ever since the 1980s and ’90s, people have theorized that FEMA was building secret prison camps to hold U.S. citizens upon the imposition of martial law; that it was planning to create major natural disasters in order to sow chaos nationwide and seize power; that it was setting up a surveillance state by inserting chips or other devices at agency “processing centers”; that it was testing out mind-control technologies or other sinister efforts when running emergency-alert-system tests; or that it would, in some other way, act as the supervillainy arm of whatever dark forces run the government or are plotting to take it over.

But these particular conspiracy theories, long fodder for the paranoid Alex Jones types, have moved toward the mainstream in recent years. They were boosted by QAnon during the general growth of American paranoia during the pandemic. Social media created incentives for content creators to spout engagement-baiting nonsense. And A.I. has obliterated our ability, as a general public, to distinguish reality from computer-generated fiction. As a result, the fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, and other disasters that are becoming more frequent and more severe have reliably been followed by a flood of theories of FEMA’s malfeasance. Sometimes the old theories are regurgitated, with grainy videos of purported FEMA prison camps; other times, new pieces of information become the kernels at the core of new panicked rumors.

This is obviously not ideal. If people don’t trust the agency, they may not seek out its aid. They may heed warnings related to certain hazards in their environment. They may not listen when they are told to evacuate. In some cases, they may become desperate and turn to violence: One armed man was arrested last year for threatening agency employees in North Carolina, having been convinced by social media misinformation that FEMA was withholding supplies from storm victims.

“When you have this anti-science sentiment, which is intertwined with conspiracy theories, it worsens disaster outcomes across the board,” said Njoki Mwarumba, a professor of emergency management at Empire State University.

Having an anti-science figure in charge of disaster response will almost certainly make this situation worse, experts say. But this is not because Phillips will necessarily spread such conspiracy theories himself: Although it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Phillips would do so, there’s no evidence he believes in FEMA conspiracy theories. He has in the past expressed his opposition to FEMA’s existence, arguing that disaster response should instead be handled by local and state governments, but nothing has surfaced indicating he believes that the agency is pursuing a new world order. And because FEMA theories are so out there, they are presumably impossible to maintain once you’re inside the institution. A plot to take over the federal government or depopulate the country with a supervirus should be easy to sniff out from the top.

Instead, Phillips’ danger is in eroding public trust in the agency, leaving more room for conspiracy theories to flourish. Phillips has no experience in federal emergency management. He has also been accused of ethical misconduct multiple times in his professional career, including in his handling of government contracts in Mississippi and Texas; his financial management of True the Vote’s funds; and fundraising for a mobile hospital in Ukraine that never materialized. And given his pattern of acting purely on partisan motivation, it seems very possible that he will run his office on political priorities rather than data-driven analysis. That could mean that his version of FEMA’s response and recovery efforts will be inherently less trustworthy.

Putting a skeptic in charge of the agency, in other words, will make it less effective—and therefore legitimately more worthy of skepticism.

“When you can’t rely on the government or don’t trust the government, it further fuels conspiracy theories,” said Alice Marwick, the director of research at the nonprofit Data & Society. “It’s this horrible ouroboros.”

It’s reasonable to wonder if there’s a silver lining here. If a QAnon guy is tasked with overseeing a QAnon-suspected agency, wouldn’t that be reassuring to his fellow truthers?

This was a question that came up when Patel was placed in charge of the FBI. It seemed reasonable to assume that once Patel realized that there was no cabal running the bureau, he would be able to calm everyone down.

Instead, Patel, bumping up against the reality of bureaucracy, was forced into some awkward contortions, trying to convince people he was doing their work by firing Trump critics inside the agency, but ultimately unable to make good on any promises to dig up proof of treachery within the agency or release the promised Epstein files. Instead of deflating the conspiracy theories, this caused people to turn on Patel.

This reality is the same with the FEMA theories, Marwick said. “Where conspiracies don’t match the daily reality, you can have an immediate breakdown,” she said. “Conspiracy theorists will never be satisfied until someone shows them it’s controlled by the illuminati or a cabal or the Freemasons. So there’s no satisfactory resolution to this situation.”

And once the leader is unable to expose the corruption and reform the agency in the way the theorists want, that failure further proves the deep corruption of the system, she said. It reinforces public cynicism more than anything else.

Having an extremely partisan person in the position might instead encourage conspiracy theories from residents of blue states. Already, the Trump administration has weaponized grant funding for its own means. It is threatening to withhold Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits from Democratic-led states over their refusal to share recipients’ immigration status. It slashed $8 billion in funding for green projects in Democratic states. And a judge blocked the administration’s effort to reallocate $233 million in FEMA disaster-relief funds away from a dozen blue states without explanation. The states accused the administration of targeting them for not backing Trump in the election.

And if draft proposals for “Fema 2.0” are any indication, the administration hopes to shift some of its funding toward block grants, in which pots of money are distributed by some to-be-determined metrics to individual states. Under that scenario, says Jeffrey Pellegrino, a professor of emergency management and homeland security at the University of Akron, the size of those pots could certainly be politically driven. That would inherently give blue-state residents reason to raise questions.

It’s unlikely these residents would jump from being suspicious of Trump’s FEMA to believing that the agency is about to round them all up in prison camps, turning into some kind of liberal version of Alex Jones. But this kind of politicization does shorten the distance between reality and conspiracy theory. It’s something we’ve never seen before, Pellegrino says. FEMA has historically fluctuated in efficacy depending on the president’s own sense of its urgency, he says, but it has never been all that tainted by partisan politics—as past administrators have always believed that natural disasters are not a partisan issue.

“But that seems to have gone by the wayside with the current administration,” he said.

Phillips will likely not be the RFK Jr. of FEMA. The far-out FEMA conspiracy theories, unlike “Vaccines Cause Autism,” are not particularly actionable. You can ban vaccines, but you cannot halt the building of prison camps that don’t actually exist or dismantle fictional offices that run mind-control programs. Nor will he be its Kash Patel, as he won’t be able to find as many exciting ways to weaponize the agency or root out politically charged projects; disaster management is simply more bureaucratic and less controversial.

The most important questions about FEMA currently concern its scope and, frankly, its survival while under assault from the administration. But having a committed conspiracy theorist in one of the most important positions in an organization long plagued by conspiracy-theory accusations only proves how little the administration cares about public trust. As climate change continues to make natural disasters worse, as the administration refuses to grapple with the dangers of A.I., and as severe cuts to nonpartisan agencies debilitate their relief and prevention work, conspiracy theories about FEMA will continue to proliferate. Disasters are frightening and destabilizing. They’re the kinds of events that naturally breed misinformation and confusion. In that scenario, you need an agency led by people who respond to crises with reason and levelheadedness in order to mitigate conspiratorial thinking. A responsible administrator might be counted on to stem that paranoia, to—at a critical moment—pull people back from their worst impulses. But Phillips has spent years preying on those impulses, and there’s little reason to hope he’ll stop now.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A new, modular infostealer called SantaStealer, advertised on Telegram with a basic tier priced at $175 per month, promises to make criminals&#39; Christmas dreams come true. It boasts that it can run &quot;fully undetected&quot; even on systems with the &quot;strictest AntiVirus&quot; and those belonging to governments, financial institutions, and other prime targets.

Its Russian-speaking operators released the credential- and wallet-stealing malware on Monday, and while infostealers are never welcome news, it does come with a gift to defenders: the samples seen to date are &quot;far from undetectable&quot; and very easy to analyze.

This is according to Rapid7 security researcher Milan Špinka, who posted a blog about the stealer shortly before the malware developers released their shiny new tool.

&quot;It&#39;s difficult to tell if the samples we observe now are the latest builds of SantaStealer, or if there might be a delay and we are only now seeing earlier versions,&quot; Špinka told The Register. &quot;Either way, the payloads we analyzed lacked significantly in anti-analysis and evasion capabilities, only implementing a very basic anti-VM/anti-debugging check.&quot;

He added that the samples analyzed by the malware-hunting team &quot;include original names of functions and global variables and do not perform any kind of string encryption or code obfuscation, making analysis rather simple.&quot;

Still, it is an infostealer, and this type of malware is a favorite of ransomware gangs and other financially motivated criminals to gain initial access to victims&#39; IT systems. So it&#39;s not something that you want to inadvertently download and run on your computer, thus giving attackers your stored usernames and passwords for sensitive accounts and corporate networks.

We recommend avoiding unrecognized links and email attachments as well as watching out for fake human verification or tech support instructions to run commands on your computer

&quot;SantaStealer goes after sensitive documents, credentials, and crypto wallets,&quot; Špinka said. &quot;We recommend avoiding unrecognized links and email attachments as well as watching out for fake human verification or tech support instructions to run commands on your computer.&quot;

The Rapid7 team first spotted SantaStealer earlier this month and analyzed unobfuscated and unstripped samples. The malware, a 64-bit DLL, contained more than 500 exported symbols with self-explanatory names such as &quot;payload_main,&quot; &quot;check_antivm,&quot; &quot;browser_names,&quot; &quot;notes_config_size,&quot; and &quot;notes_config_data,&quot; plus &quot;a plethora&quot; of unencrypted strings indicating credential-stealing capabilities.

One of these strings contained a link to the SantaStealer Telegram channel, which announced it as a rebranding of an earlier stealer called Blueline Stealer, operated by a pair of anonymous developers with the Telegram handles @weuploaddata (display name &quot;Cracked&quot;) and @furixlol (display name &quot;Furix&quot;).

&quot;It is unclear why they decided to rename the stealer pre-launch; however, it could be part of the rebrand effort as a means of drawing attention through a catchy name,&quot; Špinka told The Register. &quot;We can trace the activities of Blueline Stealer back to July 2025 when the developers were sharing proof of logs in their dedicated Telegram channel for this.&quot;

The developers for Blueline Stealer are an actor with the handle &quot;Cracked&quot; and a partner with the handle &quot;Furix.&quot;

From the Telegram channel, the researchers found the affiliate web panel with pricing info: the basic variant costs $175 per month, while the premium variant carries a $300 monthly charge.

In addition to Telegram, the developers also advertise SantaStealer on a Russian-speaking hacker forum, Lolz.

&quot;The use of this Russian-speaking forum, the top-level domain name of the web panel bearing the country code of the Soviet Union (su), and the ability to configure the stealer not to target Russian-speaking victims (described later) hints at Russian citizenship of the operators — not at all unusual on the infostealer market,&quot; Špinka wrote in the blog.

Based on the samples analyzed, the stealer appears to be moving toward a fileless collection, with the modules and the Chrome decryptor DLL being loaded and executed in-memory. This helps the malware avoid file-based detection.

After stealing users&#39; data, the malware compresses it and splits it into 10 MB chunks before sending it to a command-and-control server over unencrypted HTTP.

In addition to the technical analysis, Rapid7&#39;s write-up includes a list of indicators of compromise, so be sure to check those out and, as Špinka urges heading into the holidays: &quot;stay safe and off the naughty list!&quot; ®

            <h2>Nvidia pledges more openness as it slurps up Slurm</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/nvidia_slurm_nemotron/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nvidia burnished its open source credentials this week after buying the company behind the veteran Slurm scheduler and announcing a slew of open source AI models.

The chip giant revealed yesterday that it had acquired SchedMD, the key developer behind Slurm, which Nvidia described in a statement as &quot;an open source workload management system for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI.&quot;

Slurm has been around since 2002, when backers included Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and France&#39;s Groupe Bull.

Nvidia said this week it will &quot;continue to develop and distribute Slurm as open source, vendor-neutral software, making it widely available to and supported by the broader HPC and AI community across diverse hardware and software environments.&quot;

It added that &quot;Nvidia will accelerate SchedMD&#39;s access to new systems – allowing users of Nvidia&#39;s accelerated computing platform to optimize workloads across their entire compute infrastructure.&quot; But Nvidia insisted it will also support &quot;a diverse hardware and software ecosystem, so customers can run heterogeneous clusters with the latest Slurm innovations.&quot;

Nvidia further played the open card, with the debut of its Nemotron 3 family of models, which it said delivered a &quot;hybrid latent mixture-of-experts (MoE)&quot; architecture in Nano, Super, and Ultra sizes.

The firm also said the releases support its broader &quot;sovereign AI efforts.&quot;

Nemotron 3 NANO is a 30 billion-parameter model, activating up to 3 billion parameters at a time for &quot;targeted&quot; tasks. Super is a &quot;high-accuracy reasoning model&quot; with approximately 100 billion parameters for multi-agent applications. Ultra comes in at 500 billion parameters for &quot;complex AI applications.&quot; Nvidia said the new architecture means the NANO model achieves four times the token throughput compared to its predecessor.

Nvidia has regularly been accused of locking customers into its ecosystem, as much through its CUDA software platform as its pricey silicon.

But it has increasingly sought to portray itself as an open champion. Earlier this year, it open sourced the Kubernetes native KAI scheduler it inherited through its purchase of Run:AI. At GTC in March, it open sourced its cuOpt optimization engine and its Groot robotics model.

There&#39;s open and &quot;open,&quot; however, and observers suggest the SchedMD buy inevitably strengthens Nvidia&#39;s grip on the overall stack, with expectations that its silicon will have a speed advantage when running the tool. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Six months after EU regulators found Apple&#39;s App Store rules in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), developers say Cupertino is still behaving as if compliance were optional.

The Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit organization of app developers and consumer groups, has accused Apple of persistent non-compliance with the DMA, warning that the company&#39;s revised App Store terms continue to impose fees which the legislation prohibits.

In an open letter addressed to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and senior commissioners, the coalition argues that Apple has failed to deliver &quot;any meaningful changes or proposals&quot; despite an April 2025 non-compliance decision that found its App Store policies illegal and harmful to both developers and consumers.

At the heart of the complaint is money. The DMA requires so-called gatekeepers to allow developers to offer and conduct transactions outside their app stores without charge. Apple, the coalition claims, is seeking to charge commissions of up to 20 percent on those very transactions.

&quot;This is a blatant disregard for the law with the potential to vanquish years of meaningful work by the Commission,&quot; the letter states, accusing Apple of preserving the economics of its App Store while nominally claiming compliance.

Apple has said it will roll out new App Store terms in January 2026, but developers say the company has provided no clarity on what those changes will involve or whether they will actually comply with the DMA.

&quot;We have seen this playbook before in Europe and beyond,&quot; the signatories warn, adding that they suspect any new terms will continue to impose fees that would violate the law.

The letter argues that this uncertainty is already doing damage. Six months after Apple&#39;s last App Store terms update, developers still do not know which rules will govern their businesses or what their costs will look like in the near term.

Apple&#39;s &quot;lack of transparency in tandem with its rushed timelines,&quot; the coalition says, is freezing investment and innovation, effectively allowing the company to &quot;exploit its gatekeeper position by holding the entire industry hostage.&quot;

The group also points to a growing transatlantic contrast that makes Europe look like the tougher regulator with the weaker results. While Apple continues to fight DMA enforcement in the EU, US courts have moved to curb its ability to extract fees from external transactions. Following litigation brought by Epic Games, developers in the US can now communicate freely with customers about pricing and offer payment options outside Apple&#39;s ecosystem without paying commission.

That raises what the coalition calls a &quot;simple and urgent question.&quot; Why should European developers and consumers get a worse deal than their US counterparts, especially when the EU was first to pass a landmark law aimed at fixing digital markets? The letter argues that meaningful enforcement of the DMA would strengthen Europe&#39;s digital competitiveness and attract global investment, while weak enforcement risks turning the regulation into an expensive paper exercise.

&quot;We trust the Commission will uphold the DMA,&quot; the signatories conclude, but they warn that if enforcement falls short, they will continue pressing policymakers to ensure Apple finally complies with the law as written – not as rewritten by Cupertino. ®

From the note-taking Kindle Scribe to the Kindle Colorsoft, Amazon is offering deals on nearly all of its e-readers ahead of the holidays.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

If you’re shopping for a book lover, it’s hard to beat a Kindle, especially if your giftee already owns a library of Kindle books. Amazon’s latest sale makes them even easier to recommend: the last-gen Kindle Scribe with 32GB of storage and ads is matching its best price to date starting at $279.99 ($140 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. Meanwhile, the ad-supported versions of the Kindle (Amazon, Best Buy, and Target), Kindle Paperwhite (Amazon, Best Buy, Target), and Kindle Colorsoft (Amazon, Best Buy, Target) are all near record-low prices, starting at $89.99 ($20 off), $134.99 ($25 off), and $189.99 ($60 off) respectively.

If you’re looking to gift a note-taking e-reader, the last-gen Kindle Scribe remains a terrific option, even without the new Scribe Colorsoft’s color E Ink display. It offers a sharp, spacious 10.2-inch, 300ppi display and — unusual for a note-taking e-reader — an adjustable warm light for comfortable nighttime reading. You can jot down notes directly on Kindle books using the included stylus, which conveniently features an eraser and a customizable shortcut button. Plus, the Scribe doubles as a standalone digital notebook, with premade templates and AI-powered tools that can summarize your notes or clean up messy handwriting.

Amazon’s other Kindles are also solid gifts, particularly if you prioritize price or portability. While they don’t offer note-taking capabilities like the Scribe, they’re amongst the best e-readers on the market, delivering an excellent reading experience thanks to their sharp 300ppi displays. Each weighs about the same as an iPhone 17 Pro Max, making it easy to slip into a bag; the entry-level Kindle’s small six-inch design is even pocketable. All offer long battery life with convenient USB-C charging, while the Colorsoft stands out by adding a 150ppi color mode that’s especially appealing for fans of graphic novels. And, with the exception of the Kindle, they’re all IPX8-rated for water resistance, so you don’t need to worry about winter storms or spills.

The 2024 Kindle Scribe is a 10.2-inch e-reader with a stylus for taking notes. It’s faster than its predecessor and offers a host of new features, including one that lets you jot notes directly in your book. Read our review.

Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite — aka our favorite ebook reader — is waterproof, has a seven-inch display, and lasts weeks per charge. Read our review.

Amazon’s latest entry-level Kindle retains a six-inch, 300ppi display and USB-C charger. It’s brighter and slightly faster than its predecessor, though, and features longer battery life.

The 16GB Kindle Colorsoft is Amazon’s latest color e-reader. It features a 7-inch 300ppi screen, an adjustable frontlight, and a battery that can last up to eight weeks.

            <div id="article-text">A plan so astonishingly dumb, even Warner Bros. doesn’t believe it’ll happen.

A plan so astonishingly dumb, even Warner Bros. doesn’t believe it’ll happen.

Media is a business about dreams, and Larry Ellison’s son is dreaming big. This might explain why the case for Paramount Skydance to buy Warner Bros. Discovery is so incoherent.

In October, Warner Bros. put itself up for sale, leading to a number of bids. The two we are concerned with are a bid from Netflix and another from two nepo babies: David Ellison and Jared Kushner. David Ellison is the head of Paramount, but most famous for being Larry’s son. Jared Kushner is most famous for being Donald Trump’s son-in-law, though he also got his start in business by taking over his felon father’s firm when Charles was in prison; his firm is involved in the financing.

Netflix won the bidding. Warner Bros. made an agreement to sell most of its business — the studio part — to the streaming giant for $83 billion, including debt. (That figure is a bit more than five times Paramount’s market cap.) Warner Bros. felt that spinning itself into two companies, the Netflix acquisition and the cable networks, gave shareholders a value of $31 to $32 a share, rather than the $30 a share Paramount was offering, according to The Wall Street Journal.

If the elder Ellison is serious about this, I’d like some of what he’s smoking

Nonetheless, Paramount announced a hostile bid to take over Warner Bros. for $30 per share, which puts the total at $108.4 billion, including debt. Apparently, Paramount has been after Warner Bros. for the last two years, even before Ellison père et fils entered the picture. But now, it’s backstopped the deal with the Ellison family trust, which includes a war chest of about 1.16 billion Oracle shares. The current offer from Paramount is not the “best and final” — at least, according to The New York Times — so this dumb fight is likely to drag on for a while.

Let’s pause here and notice that what Paramount is doing doesn’t make any fucking sense. At least, not business sense. Maybe I can see a case for consolidation among the streamers, rolling HBO Max into Paramount Plus, and acquiring a larger library. But HBO Max isn’t that big, and its library isn’t exclusive. So why would Larry Ellison trade Oracle stock (with, at maximum, AI-rules-the-world multiples) for garbage media multiples? If the elder Ellison is serious about this, I’d like some of what he’s smoking.

Warner Bros., in fact, also appears concerned about how serious Ellison senior is. Part of the reason Warner Bros. went with the Netflix bid was that its board was “worried that Mr. [Larry] Ellison did not personally guarantee the bid under his name and is planning to contribute equity for the deal through a trust with holdings that could be modified at any time,” wrote The New York Times. Yeah, I’d worry about that shit too!

And there are signs Larry Ellison doesn’t see his son’s vision as a sure thing, since he’s not the sole bankroll involved. The deal relies on third parties’ money, which includes $24 billion from three Middle Eastern funds. That’s in addition, of course, to Kushner’s Affinity Partners and Apollo Global Management, both of which manage significant money from other Middle Eastern investors. Larry Ellison’s trust, which he can change at any time, is only a backstop on this financing.

Still, Larry Ellison has called the White House to whine about antitrust concerns in the Netflix/Warner Bros. deal, which is not nothing.

At this point, you may be wondering what David Ellison’s case is for combining Paramount and Warner Bros. Here’s what he has to say: “Unless you can build a tech product that is truly competitive with what’s coming out of Silicon Valley, you can’t compete,” David Ellison said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “And that has been one of the big problems that’s been facing legacy media, is they don’t actually understand that skill set and how critical that is, and that it is actually a combination of great content working with tech product hand in hand, that is how you actually get this business growing and scaling again, and you need both.”

First, David Ellison wants the Netflix multiple on his company. Second, he doesn’t understand how anything works.

This is vacuous nonsense. In an open letter about his company Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount, David Ellison pitched a plan to combine Pluto TV with Paramount Plus — wowee zowie, combining streaming platforms! There’s also some manner of plan to use AI slop to “supercharge” the company’s intellectual property and “content.” (Hear that, directors? You don’t make TV shows or movies. You make slop for the slop machine.) And improving recommendations will probably mean attempting to use the TikTok algorithm, since Daddy is involved — at least, if the TikTok deal ever goes through. So that’s the Paramount pitch. It is also, most likely, the Warner Bros. pitch.

David Ellison’s plan for Paramount, insofar as it is one, reveals two things. First, David Ellison wants the Netflix multiple on his company. Second, he doesn’t understand how anything works.

If I wanted to turn Paramount into a tech company, I might try linking product placement in Paramount’s existing library to actual shopping, for a modest fee to the brand, and perhaps a cut of any sales made. Or figure out how to make streaming faster and more reliable, or come up with new methods of compression to make delivery less costly. Perhaps I’d move into streaming video games, unlocking a huge market for my platform — which for the record is exactly what Netflix is doing right now. To do all — or any! — of that, I’d probably make a big impressive tech hire.

Instead, Ellison’s flashy hire is fellow know-nothing Bari Weiss. Weiss is the head of CBS News, who for some reason is appearing on television to record flop interviews instead of doing her actual job, which is running a news organization. Hey, did you hear that David Ellison has been promising the White House it’ll do to CNN what it did to CBS News? It’s very funny that he is offering to pay a premium to drive the TV business into the ground faster, don’t you think?

Without any actual ideas, no Netflix multiple is going to be forthcoming on the Paramount stock

I guess we could get caught up in the culture war argument: both Ellisons simply buy into Trump’s desire to destroy the supposed left-wing bastion of TV news. (The revanchist right has been particularly infuriated by their inability to dominate cultural products as they dominate politics.) But as a business decision, it is so stupid. Broadcast TV has been declining in importance for some time now. As of October, streaming has taken over nearly half of monthly TV viewing. In the streaming wars, there are only really two important platforms: Netflix and YouTube. Those two streamers combined account for a bit over 20 percent of the entire TV audience; broadcast TV as a whole accounts for 23 percent. Paramount Plus and Pluto TV together account for about 2 percent of the market.

Netflix, as a streaming platform, is stealing viewers from cable and broadcast television. David Ellison’s big idea to compete is combining streaming platforms and making vague noises about AI — and, I guess, TV? Without any actual ideas, no Netflix multiple is going to be forthcoming on the Paramount stock.

Now let’s consider Netflix, which actually is a tech company. Making a direct comparison of the deals is slightly complicated by the fact that Paramount wants the whole of Warner Bros. and Netflix wants to spin off the declining cable holdings, which include CNN. This is probably smart! What Netflix gets in the deal is a huge movie library it doesn’t have to negotiate rights for — and which it might be able to generate royalties from, should it choose to continue licensing to rivals. Historically, though, Netflix doesn’t do that, which may mean it’ll give consumers a fairly powerful reason to switch streaming services.

By comparison, it’s just not clear what the Ellisons think they’re doing. Sure, combining with HBO Max and forming one streaming service might be helpful, but that takes Paramount Plus from 2 percent of the market to 3.5 percent of the market. Paramount could similarly make a bunch of Hollywood history exclusive to its streaming service, but so what? It’s already got movies and TV shows and the means to make more. Is David Ellison really just trying to buy his way to importance?

We’ve got a real-life Kendall Roy on our hands

One more thing about Netflix. It has two CEOs: Ted Sarandos, who is Mr. Hollywood, and Greg Peters, who explicitly handles tech. David Ellison has the experience and talents of neither. Before founding Skydance, Ellison personally paid for a third of the $60 million budget for the bomb Flyboys, which costarred Ellison and James Franco. The movie made $18 million. Next, he founded Skydance, and his dad put in $150 million of the initial $350 million the company raised to finance movies with Paramount. Skydance’s trajectory has been uneven, with hits such as True Grit and stinkers such as Terminator: Dark Fate. Ellison quit acting in 2010, when Taylor Lautner backed out of a movie Ellison had written after finding out that Ellison also planned to costar.

So David Ellison took his imagination elsewhere. It seems his new vision is to become a mogul on par with Sumner Redstone, Barry Diller, or Rupert Murdoch; we’ve got a real-life Kendall Roy on our hands. The question now is how committed Larry Ellison is to buying that dream for his son. Sure, he was involved in the early negotiations for Warner Bros.. Yes, he phoned the White House to try to scupper the Netflix deal. But neither of those are nearly as serious as Oracle shares. Acquiring Warner Bros. doesn’t do what’s needed to pivot Paramount into a tech company, either. So, much like Warner Bros.’ board, I don’t believe that Larry Ellison is going to trade Oracle shares for a media company. It just doesn’t make sense.

Under what circumstances would Larry Ellison decide to do it anyway? There are two things I can think of. Both of them have to do with Oracle, which has pivoted toward an enormous AI bet, taking on a tremendous debt load in the process. The company is spending a frankly shocking amount to build out data centers, based on revenue it expects from OpenAI — which may not be able to meet its obligations.

We are in the era of gangster tech regulation. Buying up the parent company of CNN, which President Donald Trump famously loathes, and reworking it to flatter him could maybe get Larry Ellison the political capital he’d need to get bailed out if OpenAI fails on its obligations. It might also get him the first line on federal contracts. Who can say? For our TV-addled president, maybe owning a couple channels is the most effective form of lobbying there is. But if this is true, Paramount’s bid for Warner Bros. isn’t about making a media company into a tech company — it’s about figuring out another way to butter up an astonishingly corrupt administration. It’s also a pretty risky gamble that no one who opposes Trump will come into power any time soon.

The second possibility is that Larry Ellison has already recognized AI isn’t going to live up to its hype. If that is the case, he might as well spend money while he has it. Maybe buying his son’s love is worth it. After all, Larry Ellison is already the most important shareholder of Paramount. Why not expand the playhouse a little?

Correction: The Netflix bid is worth $31 to 32 per share, not $31 to $31.

Things are looking bright for those who want to nab a great TV in 2025 at a substantial discount. There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, Sony, Hisense, or Samsung — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Amazon Prime Day, and the lead-up to the Super Bowl.

Right now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.

Samsung’s Q8F is available for around $597.99 ($152 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo in its 55-inch configuration, which is a solid value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.

The TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $402 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,597.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.

If you’re looking for a 65-inch TV for watching sports, TV shows, movies, or playing video games, Hisense’s U65QF is a great choice, one you can currently purchase at Amazon and Best Buy for $574.99 ($425 off). The TV features a native 144Hz refresh rate and two HDMI 2.1 ports, both of which can take full advantage of the high-speed display. It also sports a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports — which can carry a 4K signal at up to 60Hz — and a port assortment that makes it a good choice for current-gen consoles, 4K Blu-ray players, and streaming devices. If you connect a gaming PC with an AMD graphics card, you can even take advantage of the TV’s support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which reduces graphical glitches such as screen tearing.

The U65QF has an LED screen, which means it can’t match the black levels or per-pixel brightness control you’d get with an OLED display. However, its full array lighting panel offers 300 local dimming zones. The TV can control the brightness of each zone to reduce blooming, which is what happens when the area around a bright object (think a lit torch in a cave) looks unnaturally bright. Additionally, the TV has a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, so the image it produces should look good even in a room with some light interference. The U65QF also supports Dolby Vision, HLG, and HDR10 Plus for better color reproduction, and it features a Hi-View AI chip that automatically processes the image on screen so that it appears sharper.

As for its operating system, Hisense’s U65QF runs on Amazon’s Fire OS and features Amazon Alexa built in. You can use the smart assistant to control the TV’s many functions, search for content, control compatible smart home accessories, and look up answers to various questions with your voice. If you want an even larger screen, you can also pick up a 75-inch model for an all-time low of $735.99 ($564 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.

TCL’s Nxtvision is an entry-level “art TV,” and both the 65- and 75-inch models are currently on sale at Best Buy for $799.99 ($500 off) and $1,497.99 ($302 off), respectively. The 4K TV set has a matte 120Hz QLED screen with a brightness of around 441 nits, and it can display more than 100,000 pre-generated AI artworks, your own photos, or one of over 300 pieces of art from its built-in library. It features two HDMI 2.1 ports best suited for current-gen game consoles and PC gaming, along with HDMI 2.0 ports, which are fine if you want to hook up a 4K Blu-ray player or previous-gen game system.

Verge senior reviewer John Higgins tested the A300W and liked the way the TV looked once its included bezel set was installed, which made the TV look more like an actual painting. He also liked that it uses Google’s TV platform, an operating system he found easy to navigate and use. However, it was noticeably dimmer than the other art TVs he tested, and the artwork quality could vary from piece to piece. Still, the A300W is a great choice if you’ve been curious about getting an art TV but don’t want to immediately make the jump to a higher-end model like Samsung’s Frame Pro.

Amazon’s current-gen Fire TV 4-Series is an affordable option if you want to upgrade from a smaller HDTV to a 4K model. The 43-inch model is currently on sale at Amazon for $289.99 ($40 off) — its second-best price to date — or you can step up to the 50-inch model for $349.99 ($50 off) or the 55-inch model for $409.99 ($50 off) if you like the TV’s features but want a larger set.

Amazon’s newer 4K TV features a 60Hz LED panel, which is perfectly fine for casual gaming or watching TV shows and movies. It supports HDR10 Plus and HLG HDR, so colors on properly mastered video and games will look especially good. The Fire TV 4-Series runs Fire OS and comes with a remote that lets you access Amazon Alexa with the push of a button, allowing you to control your smart home accessories and quickly execute voice commands. The TV also features three HDMI 2.0 ports and one HDMI 2.1 ARC port, which are sufficient for connecting multiple game consoles, a 4K Blu-ray player, a soundbar, and other home theater equipment.

If your budget is under $500, the 55-inch Hisense QD7 has a lot to offer, especially now that it’s on sale for $349.99 ($150 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (this video from LG shows how it works), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for around $448 ($152 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.

If you want a TV that produces reference-quality images, Sony’s Bravia 8 II (K65XR80M2) is the best choice. It was recently selected as the top TV in Valve Electronics’ 10th annual TV Shootout based on objective and subjective tests conducted by a panel of experts comparing each set to the image on a $43,000 reference monitor (Disclosure: Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel was one of the judges). The 55-inch model also recently received a substantial price cut, dropping it to a new low of $1,998 ($602 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.

Sony’s premium set has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, with two HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz and two HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia’s G-Sync or AMD’s FreeSync Pro, so there aren’t any specific features on this TV that PC gamers can take advantage of. The TV runs on Sony’s XR processor, which uses AI to adjust the color, contrast, and clarity of whatever you’re watching in real time to look better. Sony also says its TV has modes that are specifically calibrated for Netflix, Prime Video, and its own Sony Pictures Core streaming services.

If you want this TV in a larger size, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo are all currently offering the 65-inch model for around $2,298 ($1,202 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen.

The last-gen LG C4 remains one of the best OLED TVs you can buy, and the 65-inch model is currently on sale for $1,299.95 ($1,200 off) at B&H Photo. Like LG’s newer C5 OLED, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and C5 is their maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, while the C5 tops out at around 1,165 according to tests conducted by Tom’s Guide.

Additionally, the C4 features a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. Basically, the LG C4 offers many of the same features as the C5, but retails for nearly $400 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for $1,799.95 ($1,700 off) at B&H Photo.

If you want an OLED, but don’t have a lot of space, Samsung’s 42-inch S90F is down to a new low of around $897.99 ($300 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The TV features a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports, letting you play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. The ability to connect all your current-gen consoles and a gaming PC simultaneously without sacrificing resolution or speed is impressive for an OLED TV under $1,000. The TV can also access Samsung’s Gaming Hub, which allows you to play games available through Nvidia GeForce Go, Amazon Luna, and other cloud gaming services on your TV without any additional hardware — besides a controller, of course.

The S90F supports Samsung’s OLED HDR, and it has an NQ4 AI Gen3 processor that optimizes its picture quality and can upscale non-4K video. The TV also runs on Samsung’s Tizen operating system, which offers apps for every major streaming service, and features support for both Alexa and Samsung Bixby, so you can use either virtual assistant to control your various smart home gadgets. If you like the S90F’s features but want a larger TV, the 65-inch model is also on sale for an all-time low of around $1,397.99 ($1,102 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.

If you want a premium TV but don’t want an OLED set, Hisense’s U8QG is an excellent alternative that’s currently available at Amazon and Best Buy in its 65-inch configuration for an all-time low of $949.99 ($1,250 off). The TV has a mini-LED panel with full-array local dimming, so blooming shouldn’t be a huge issue. It also features a 165Hz refresh rate and three HDMI 2.1 ports, making it a great choice for those with a gaming PC or a current-gen console like the PlayStation 5. It also supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, so gaming PCs outfitted with an AMD card should experience fewer graphical glitches, including screen tearing.

Hisense says the U8QG has a maximum screen brightness of 5,000 nits, which is substantially higher than the OLED TVs we’re recommending here. It also supports all your major HDR formats, including Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10 Plus, HLG, and Advanced HDR by Technicolor, so it’ll show vibrant colors regardless of how the video you’re watching — or game you’re playing — was mastered. Its AI processor was also designed to improve the clarity and brightness of SDR content, and the TV’s high refresh rate and peak brightness make up for the fact that its panel offers lower contrast than an OLED TV. That’s an impressive feature set, especially for a TV that retails for under $1,000.

According to The Verge’s own John Higgins, Samsung’s Frame Pro is the best “art TV” you can buy for watching TV shows, and the 65-inch model is matching its all-time low of around $1,597.99 at Amazon and Best Buy. Both Amazon and Best Buy have also knocked the price of the larger 75-inch model to around $1,997.99 ($1,600 off), which has been the promo price since mid-November.

Samsung’s art-inspired 4K TV features a 120Hz LED panel with a peak brightness of over 1,000 nits and better color accuracy (especially in filmmaker mode) than its competitors. Its matte screen reflects less light than a typical LCD or OLED screen, which is helpful whether you’re watching TV shows in a bright room or using the TV’s “Art Mode,” which allows you to display famous paintings. The TV comes with a small selection of free art, but you can gain access to more than 4,000 pieces by subscribing to the Samsung Art Store for $50 a year.

The Frame Pro also comes with the wireless Connect Box, which features four HDMI ports, two USB-A ports, a coaxial input, an ethernet port, and an optical audio input. You plug devices into the wireless Connect Box, which then sends audio and video from your source to the TV. Samsung recommends keeping it within 10 meters of the TV, but the wireless latency (lag) from the setup shouldn’t matter much when watching videos; however, it may be noticeable if you’re playing fast-paced video games, including first-person shooters.

            <h2>Creating psychological safety in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

AI tools that may have been used were limited to secondary production processes that passed thorough human review.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <h2>Why it’s time to reset our expectations for AI</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Can I ask you a question: How do you feel about AI right now? Are you still excited? When you hear that OpenAI or Google just dropped a new model, do you still get that buzz? Or has the shine come off it, maybe just a teeny bit? Come on, you can be honest with me.

Truly, I feel kind of stupid even asking the question, like a spoiled brat who has too many toys at Christmas. AI is mind-blowing. It’s one of the most important technologies to have emerged in decades (despite all its many many drawbacks and flaws and, well, issues).

At the same time I can&#39;t help feeling a little bit: Is that it?

If you feel the same way, there’s good reason for it: The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. We were told that AI would solve climate change. That it would reach human-level intelligence. That it would mean we no longer had to work!

Instead we got AI slop, chatbot psychosis, and tools that urgently prompt you to write better email newsletters. Maybe we got what we deserved. Or maybe we need to reevaluate what AI is for.

That’s the reality at the heart of a new series of stories, published today, called Hype Correction. We accept that AI is still the hottest ticket in town, but it’s time to re-set our expectations.

As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven puts it in the package’s intro essay, “You can’t help but wonder: When the wow factor is gone, what’s left? How will we view this technology a year or five from now? Will we think it was worth the colossal costs, both financial and environmental?”

Elsewhere in the package, James O’Donnell looks at Sam Altman, the ultimate AI hype man, through the medium of his own words. And Alex Heath explains the AI bubble, laying out for us what it all means and what we should look out for.

Michelle Kim analyzes one of the biggest claims in the AI hype cycle: that AI would completely eliminate the need for certain classes of jobs. If ChatGPT can pass the bar, surely that means it will replace lawyers? Well, not yet, and maybe not ever.

Similarly, Edd Gent tackles the big question around AI coding. Is it as good as it sounds? Turns out the jury is still out. And elsewhere David Rotman looks at the real-world work that needs to be done before AI materials discovery has its breakthrough ChatGPT moment.

Meanwhile, Garrison Lovely spends time with some of the biggest names in the AI safety world and asks: Are the doomers still okay? I mean, now that people are feeling a bit less scared about their impending demise at the hands of superintelligent AI? And Margaret Mitchell reminds us that hype around generative AI can blind us to the AI breakthroughs we should really celebrate.

Let’s remember: AI was here before ChatGPT and it will be here after. This hype cycle has been wild, and we don’t know what its lasting impact will be. But AI isn’t going anywhere. We shouldn&#39;t be so surprised that those dreams we were sold haven’t come true—yet.

The more likely story is that the real winners, the killer apps, are still to come. And a lot of money is being bet on that prospect. So yes: The hype could never sustain itself over the short term. Where we’re at now is maybe the start of a post-hype phase. In an ideal world, this hype correction will reset expectations.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
