            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.25 of the Rocket Report! All eyes are on Florida this weekend as NASA rolls out the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft to its launch site in Florida for the Artemis II mission. NASA has not announced a launch date yet, and this will depend in part on how well a “wet dress rehearsal” goes with fueling the rocket. However, it is likely the rocket has a no-earlier-than launch date of February 8. Our own Stephen Clark will be in Florida for the rollout on Saturday, so be sure and check back here for coverage.

As always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

MaiaSpace scores a major launch deal. The ArianeGroup subsidiary, created in 2022, has inked a major new launch contract with satellite operator Eutelsat, Le Monde reports. A significant portion of the 440 new satellites ordered by Eutelsat from Airbus to renew or expand its OneWeb constellation will be launched into orbit by the new Maia rocket. MaiaSpace previously signed two contracts: one with Exotrail for the launch of an orbital transfer, and the other for two satellites for the Toutatis mission, a defense system developed by U-Space.

A big win for the French firm … The first test launch of Maia is scheduled for the end of 2026, a year later than initially planned, at the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. The first flights carrying OneWeb satellites are therefore likely to launch no earlier than 2027. Powered by liquid oxygen-methane propellant, Maia aims to be able to deliver up to 500 kg to low-Earth orbit when the first stage is recovered, and 1,500 kg when fully expendable.

Firefly announces Alpha upgrade plan. Firefly Aerospace said this week it was planning a “Block II” upgrade to its Alpha rocket that will “focus on enhancing reliability, streamlining producibility, and improving launch operations to further support commercial, civil, and national security mission demand.” Firefly’s upcoming Alpha Flight 7, targeted to launch in the coming weeks, will be the last flown in the current configuration and will serve as a test flight with multiple Block II subsystems in shadow mode.

Too many failures … “Firefly worked closely with customers and incorporated data and lessons learned from our first six Alpha launches and hundreds of hardware tests to make upgrades that increase reliability and manufacturability with consolidated parts, key configuration updates, and stronger structures built with automated machinery,” said Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. Speaking bluntly, reliability upgrades are needed. Of Alpha’s six launches to date, only two have been a complete success. (submitted by TFargo04)

Another PSLV launch failure. India’s first launch of 2026 ended in failure due to an issue with the third stage of its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Spaceflight Now reports. The mission, designated PSLV-C62, was also the second consecutive failure of this four-stage rocket, with both anomalies affecting the third stage. This time, 16 satellites were lost, including those of other nations. ISRO said it initiated a “detailed analysis” to determine the root cause of the anomaly.

Has been India’s workhorse rocket … The four-stage launch vehicle is a mixture of solid- and liquid- fueled stages. Both the first and third stages are solid-fueled, while the second and fourth stages are powered by liquid propulsion. The PSLV Rocket has flown in multiple configurations since it debuted in September 1993 and achieved 58 fully successful launches, with the payloads on those missions reaching their intended orbit.

US military invests in L3Harris rocket motors. The US government will invest $1 billion in L3Harris Technologies’ growing rocket motor business, guaranteeing a steady supply of the much-needed motors used in a wide range of ‍missiles such as Tomahawks and Patriot interceptors, CNBC reports. L3Harris said on Tuesday it ‌is planning ‌an IPO of its growing rocket motor business into a new publicly ​traded company backed by a $1 billion government convertible security investment. The securities will automatically convert to common equity when the company goes public later in 2026.

Shifting investment strategy … “We are fundamentally shifting our approach to securing our munitions supply chain,” said Michael Duffey, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. “By investing directly in suppliers we are building the resilient industrial ⁠base needed for the Arsenal of Freedom.” However, the government’s equity position in L3Harris could face blowback from L3Harris’ rivals, given that it creates a potentially significant conflict of interest for the US government. The Pentagon will have an ownership stake in a company that regularly bids on major defense and other government contracts.

First Ariane 64 to launch next month. Arianespace announced Thursday that it plans to launch the first variant of the Ariane 6 rocket with four solid rocket boosters on February 12 from French Guiana. The mission will also be the company’s first launch of Amazon Leo (formerly Project Kuiper) satellites. This is the first of 18 Ariane 6 launches that Arianespace sold to Amazon for the broadband communications megaconstellation.

A growing cadence … The Ariane 6 rocket has launched five times, including its debut flight in July 2024. All of the launches were a success, although the first flight failed to relight the upper stage in order to make a controlled reentry. Arianespace increased the cadence to four launches last year and will seek to try to double that this year.

Falcon 9 launches the Pandora mission. NASA’s Pandora satellite rocketed into orbit early Sunday from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, Ars reports. It hitched a ride with around 40 other small payloads aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, launching into a polar Sun-synchronous orbit before deploying at an altitude of roughly 380 miles (613 kilometers).

A satellite that can carry a tune … Pandora will augment the capabilities of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Over the next few weeks, ground controllers will put Pandora through a series of commissioning and calibration steps before turning its eyes toward deep space. From low-Earth orbit, Pandora will observe exoplanets and their stars simultaneously, allowing astronomers to correct their measurements of the planet’s atmospheric composition and structure based on the ever-changing conditions of the host star itself.

ArianeGroup seeking ideas for Ariane 6 reuse. In this week’s newsletter, we’ve already had a story about MaiaSpace and another item about the Ariane 6 rocket. So why not combine the two and also have a report about an Ariane 6 mashup with the Maia rocket? As it turns out, there’s a relatively new proposal to retrofit the existing Ariane 6 rocket design for partial reuse with Maia rockets as side boosters, Ars reports.

Sir, maia I have some cost savings? … It’s infeasible to recover the Ariane 6’s core stage for many reasons. Chief among them is that the main stage burns for more than seven minutes on an Ariane 6 flight, reaching speeds about twice as fast as SpaceX’s Falcon 9 booster achieves during its two-and-a-half minutes of operation during launch. Swapping out Ariane 6’s solid rocket motors for reusable liquid boosters makes some economic sense for ArianeGroup. The proposal would bring the development and production of the boosters under full control of ArianeGroup and its French subsidiary, cutting Italy’s solid rocket motor developer, Avio, out of the program. All the same, we’ll believe this when we see it.

Meet the EtherealX Razor Crest Mk-1. I learned that there is a rocket company founded in Bengaluru, India, named Ethereal Exploration Guild, or EtherealX. (Did you see what they did there?) I found this out because the company announced (via email) that it had raised an oversubscribed $20.5 million Series A round led by TDK Ventures and BIG Capital. So naturally, I went to the EtherealX website looking for more information.

Let me say, I was not disappointed … As you might expect from a company named EtherealX, its proposed rocket has nine engines, is powered by liquid oxygen and kerosene, and has a maximum capacity of 24.8 metric tons to low-Earth orbit. (Did you see what they did there?) The website does not include much information, but there is this banger of a statement: “The EtherealX Razor Crest Mk-1 will house 9 of the most powerful operational liquid rocket engines in Asia, Europe, Australia, Africa, South America, and Antarctica – Stallion.” And let’s be honest, when you’ve bested Antarctica in engine development, you know you’re cooking. Alas, what I did not see on the website was much evidence of real hardware.

NASA topples historic Saturn and shuttle infrastructure. Two historic NASA test facilities used in the development of the Saturn V and space shuttle launch vehicles have been demolished after towering over the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama since the start of the Space Age, Ars reports. The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, which was erected in 1957—the same year the first artificial satellite entered Earth orbit—and the Dynamic Test Facility, which has stood since 1964, were brought down by a coordinated series of implosions on Saturday, January 10.

Out with the old, in with the new … Located in Marshall’s East Test Area on the US Army’s Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, the two structures were no longer in use and, according to NASA, had a backlog of $25 million in needed repairs. “This work reflects smart stewardship of taxpayer resources,” Jared Isaacman, NASA administrator, said in a statement. “Clearing outdated infrastructure allows NASA to safely modernize, streamline operations and fully leverage the infrastructure investments signed into law by President Trump to keep Marshall positioned at the forefront of aerospace innovation.”

Space Force swaps Vulcan for Falcon 9. The next Global Positioning System satellite is switching from a United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket to a SpaceX Falcon 9, a spokesperson for the US Space Force Space Systems Command System Delta 80 said Tuesday, Spaceflight Now reports. SpaceX could launch the GPS III Space Vehicle 09 (SV09) within the next few weeks, as the satellite was entering the final stages of pre-flight preparations.

The trade is logical … SV09 was originally awarded to ULA as part of order-year five of the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 contract, which was announced on October 31, 2023. This isn’t the first time that the Space Force has shuffled timelines and switched launch providers for GPS missions. In May 2025, SpaceX launched the GPS III SV08 spacecraft, which was originally assigned to ULA in June 2023. In exchange, ULA was given the SV11 launch, which would have flown on a Falcon Heavy rocket. The changes have been driven largely by repeated delays in Vulcan readiness.

            <h2>“I am very annoyed”: Pharma execs blast RFK Jr.’s attack on vaccines</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/big-pharma-is-openly-railing-against-rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-agenda/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pharmaceutical executives are finally saying how they really feel about the extreme anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been ruthlessly implementing—and it’s not pretty.

According to reporting from Bloomberg at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference that ended today in San Francisco, pharmaceutical executives who had previously been careful to avoid criticizing the Trump administration appear to have reached a breaking point, with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla offering some of the most candid comments.

“I am very annoyed. I’m very disappointed. I’m seriously frustrated,” Bourla said. “What is happening has zero scientific merit and is just serving an agenda which is political, and then antivax.”

Last week, Kennedy and other health officials abruptly announced a mass overhaul of the childhood vaccine schedule, dropping the number of routine recommended vaccinations from 17 to 11. The drastic and unprecedented change bypassed all the scientific review and transparent decision-making processes that would normally underpin such changes, which would likely have taken months if not years.

Kennedy claimed that the move puts the US more in line with peer nations, but as an analysis by Stat News pointed out, the US is now an outlier, recommending significantly fewer vaccines than many other countries. Of 20 so-called peer countries that Stat compared, only one other country has a similarly low number of recommendations: Denmark.

Leading medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, are preparing a legal challenge to block the changes.

But pharmaceutical executives don’t appear comforted by the pushback. “Today it may be childhood vaccines or mRNA, but tomorrow it’s everything,” Noubar Afeyan, co-founder and chairman of Moderna, maker of mRNA vaccines, said. “We have to say not just ‘why is this happening?,’ but ‘Where will it stop?’”

As a bad flu season is underway, Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, noted that the anti-vaccine rhetoric is hitting seasonal flu shots. “With the pressure on vaccination, I cannot foresee flu vaccination increasing in this country over the next three years,” he said in a presentation.

Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson had a similarly pessimistic outlook. “It’s clear this administration has a particular sensitivity around vaccination, and indeed pediatric vaccination,” Hudson said. “I’m asked all the time ‘what are you going to do to fix this?,’ and the truth is we just need to stay extremely objective and continue presenting the evidence. There’s really very little else we can do,” except wait for the midterm elections, he said.

“We will have to maintain a steely focus on the long-term future of vaccines and deal with any uncertainty around vaccine coverage rates in the short-term based on misinformation, Facebook posts, and statements from the top,” he said.

Bourla also worried about the conditions Kennedy is creating to attack drug makers. Kennedy, who is an environmental lawyer with no scientific or medical background, has profited from lawsuits against vaccine makers, as have many of his allies and advisors. “There is also a lot of plaintiffs’ playbook there,” Bourla said. “Everybody will start litigating.”</div>

            <h2>Why I’m withholding certainty that “precise” US cyber-op disrupted Venezuelan electricity</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/unnamed-officials-tell-nyt-precise-cyber-op-took-out-venezuelas-power-grid/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The New York Times has published new details about a purported cyberattack that unnamed US officials claim plunged parts of Venezuela into darkness in the lead-up to the capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.

Key among the new details is that the cyber operation was able to turn off electricity for most residents in the capital city of Caracas for only a few minutes, though in some neighborhoods close to the military base where Maduro was seized, the outage lasted for three days. The cyber-op also targeted Venezuelan military radar defenses. The paper said the US Cyber Command was involved.

“Turning off the power in Caracas and interfering with radar allowed US military helicopters to move into the country undetected on their mission to capture Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president who has now been brought to the United States to face drug charges,” the NYT reported.

The NYT provided few additional details. Left out were the methods purportedly used. When Russia took out electricity in December 2015, for instance, it used general-purpose malware known as BlackEnergy to first penetrate the corporate networks of the targeted power companies and then further encroach into the supervisory control and data acquisition systems the companies used to generate and transmit electricity. The Russian attackers then used legitimate power distribution functionality to trigger the failure, which took out power to more than 225,000 people for more than six hours, when grid workers restored it.

In a second attack almost exactly a year later, Russia used a much more sophisticated piece of malware to take out key parts of the Ukrainian power grid. Named Industroyer and alternatively Crash Override, it’s the first known malware framework designed to attack electric grid systems directly.

What makes Crash Override so sophisticated is its ability to use the same arcane technical protocols that individual electric grid systems rely on to communicate with one another. As such, the malware is more notable for its mastery of the industrial processes used by global grid operators than its robust code. Its fluency in the low-level grid languages allowed it to instruct Ukrainian devices to de-energize and re-energize substation lines, a capability not seen in the attack a year earlier that used a much cruder set of tools and techniques. The concern is that “Industroyer&quot;—the other name given to the malware—can be used against a broad range of electric systems around the world.

Besides the lack of details of the purported hack of Venezuela’s power infrastructure, electricity experts have said that the country’s grid has been in disrepair for years. It’s feasible, they say, that power went out due to inadequate maintenance and investment. Another reason for skepticism is that Venezuela’s government said US missiles were at least partially to blame. An unconfirmed video circulating on social media also purports to show a bombed-out substation.

Whether through kinetic or cyber attacks, military strikes on power grids have been controversial because the collateral damage they cause can take out hospitals and other infrastructure that’s crucial to civilians’ survival.

The NYT said the strike on Venezuela’s power infrastructure “demonstrated [the] precision” of US cyber capabilities and showed the US “could use cyberweapons with powerful and precise effects.” If the attacks were indeed the result of cyber intrusions, there will likely be ample forensic evidence for independent experts in security power grids to confirm. Until then, there’s reason to withhold final judgment.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today is a good day to watch television. That’s because the first two episodes of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy hit the Paramount+ streaming service, becoming the newest addition to the long-running Star Trek franchise. It’s set in the late 32nd century, 120 years after the burn that ended all warp travel, and with it, most of Starfleet in the process. Now that warp travel is once again possible—you’ll have to watch Discovery’s final three seasons for more on that—the Federation is putting itself back together, and that includes reopening Starfleet Academy.

That means this show is about young people in space, like Caleb Mir (Sandro Rosta), who was separated from his mother by Starfleet as a child, 15 years earlier. Mir and his mother, played by Tatiana Maslany, were traveling with a pirate—Nus Braka, played by a scenery-chewing Paul Giamatti—who killed a Federation officer while stealing food for them. The first episode opens on Braka and the Mirs being apprehended by Starfleet. Despite her misgivings, Captain Nahla Ake (Holly Hunter) carries out her order to separate mother and child. She’s to go to a rehabilitation colony, he’s to become a ward of the Federation and go to school on Bajor.

At least that’s the plan until he escapes a few minutes later. Then we jump forward 15 years. Ake is teaching on Bajor, having retired from the Federation, ashamed of what she’d done. Admiral Vance (Oded Fehr) shows up and asks her to become commandant at the newly reopened academy in San Francisco; for the past few decades, new recruits have been trained instead by the War College. But Starfleet needs explorers now, and having a rival school means they can show up at some point to challenge some of the show’s protagonists to a Parrises Squares tournament.

Ake accepts the job, and to atone for her mistake in separating Mir from his mother, she pressgangs him into the Academy as a new recruit. Oh, she’s also a Lanthanite (technically a human-lanthanite hybrid), and 422 years old, which means she remembers working for the pre-burn Federation. She isn’t the only academy instructor with pre-burn experience in Starfleet. Jett Reno (Tig Notaro), who came to the 32nd century with Discovery, teaches the cadets physics. And the Doctor (Robert Picardo) is chief medical officer.

I had hoped this would be the result of a deep cut to “The Living Witness,” an episode of Voyager set in the 29th century where a copy of the Doctor is restored in a museum in the Delta Quadrant. At the end of that episode, that Doctor sets off for Earth, and having him show up would be a nice bit of closure; instead, he probably perished in the burn, which just makes me sad. As chief medical officer, the Doctor is apparently constantly monitoring the cadets’ biosigns—he breaks up an incipient fight after detecting students with elevated excitatory neurotransmitters. That seems more than a little invasive to me, although later he gets a taste of his own medicine from Starfleet’s first holographic cadet, SAM (Kerrice Brooks).

I’ve got a bit of a problem with Cadet Master Commander Lura Thok (Gina Yashere), who is a female Klingon-Jem’Hadar hybrid.

Obviously, a female Jem’Hadar must be canon, because it’s right there on screen, and that’s how Trek canon works. But the Founders bred the Jem’Hadar in tanks, and they lived short, dangerous lives as warriors. What use would sex organs or sexual reproduction be to a species genetically engineered to do a specific job by a race of contemptuous changelings that treat their minions as little more than tools.

That’s the trouble with head canon—the writers go and put something on the TV show that contradicts your clever idea, and you either deal with it or get annoyed. I’ll get over it, because I rather enjoy the hyperaggressive Thok and the way she harangues the cadets.

If you’re just looking for more Next Generation/Deep Space 9/Voyager-era trek, or a few more seasons of Lower Decks, you’re going to be left unfulfilled by Starfleet Academy. The aesthetic is much shinier; the floors are glossy black, not neutral, bland carpet. The characters swear at each other. But EPS conduits still explode, and because the academy has the USS Athena—a starship that, from above, looks a lot like the new comm badges—there should still be plenty of good old exploration going on while the cadets learn their life lessons. And Easter eggs, too, like the Cheronian cadet or an exocomp, although you’ll need to turn on subtitles to get the callback with that one.

If the first two episodes are much to go by, we can expect some young adult drama—love triangles, bros facing off against each other—set to a backdrop of the Federation rebuilding itself and trying to reimpose its post-scarcity order on what has become a more chaotic galaxy. That won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, Earl Grey, hot, but I’m curious to see where it goes.</div>

            <h2>NASA’s first medical evacuation from space ends with on-target splashdown</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasas-first-ever-medical-evacuation-from-space-ends-with-on-target-splashdown/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two Americans, a Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut returned to Earth early Thursday after 167 days in orbit, cutting short their stay on the International Space Station by more than a month after one of the crew members encountered an unspecified medical issue last week.

The early homecoming culminated in an on-target splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego at 12:41 am PST (08:41 UTC) inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The splashdown occurred minutes after the Dragon capsule streaked through the atmosphere along the California coastline, with sightings of Dragon’s fiery trail reported from San Francisco to Los Angeles.

Four parachutes opened to slow the capsule for the final descent. Zena Cardman, NASA’s commander of the Crew-11 mission, radioed SpaceX mission control moments after splashdown: “It feels good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams who got us there and back.”

Cardman and her crewmates departed the space station about 10 hours earlier. NASA astronaut Mike Fincke, Japanese mission specialist Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov round out the crew. NASA reported a medical concern with one of the crew members last week, and agency officials decided to bring the Crew-11 mission home earlier than planned to provide the person access to more comprehensive treatment on the ground.

Officials have not identified whose health was in question or what is afflicting the ailing crew member. Whatever the case, the medical issue did not appear to affect the crew’s return to Earth. The astronauts exited the Dragon spacecraft appearing in good health and good spirits after SpaceX raised the capsule from the water and onto a recovery vessel.

Joel Montalbano, NASA’s deputy associate administrator for space operations, said the astronauts would head to a medical facility in San Diego before returning to their home base at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

NASA officials were careful to say the medical issue was not an emergency. NASA said the crew member was stable on the ISS, and the situation did not require the astronauts to immediately leave the ISS for the first available return opportunity, a capability NASA and SpaceX can execute in the event of a dire event like a traumatic injury or if the complex was hit by a piece of space junk.

“Because the astronaut is absolutely stable, this is not an emergent evacuation,” said James “JD” Polk, NASA’s chief medical officer, in a press conference last week. “We’re not immediately disembarking and getting the astronaut down.”

Amit Kshatriya, the agency’s associate administrator, called the situation a “controlled medical evacuation” in a briefing with reporters.

But without a confirmed diagnosis of the astronaut’s medical issue, there was some “lingering risk” for the astronaut’s health if they remained in orbit, Polk said. That’s why NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman and his deputies agreed to call an early end to the Crew-11 mission.

The Crew-11 mission launched on August 1 and was supposed to stay on the space station until around February 20, a few days after the scheduled arrival of SpaceX’s Crew-12 mission with a team of replacement astronauts. But the early departure means the space station will operate with a crew of three until the launch of Crew-12 next month.

NASA astronaut Chris Williams will be the sole astronaut responsible for maintaining the US segment of the station. Russian cosmonauts Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergey Mikayev launched with Williams in November on a Russian Soyuz vehicle. The Crew Dragon was the lifeboat for all four Crew-11 astronauts, so standard procedure called for the entire crew to return with the astronaut suffering the undisclosed medical issue.

The space station regularly operated with just three crew members for the first decade of its existence. The complex has been permanently staffed since 2000, sometimes with as few as two astronauts or cosmonauts. The standard crew size was raised to six in 2009, then to seven in 2020.

Williams will have his hands full until reinforcements arrive. The scaled-down crew will not be able to undertake any spacewalks, and some of the lab’s science programs may have to be deferred to ensure the crew can keep up with maintenance tasks.

This is the first time NASA has called an early end to a space mission for medical reasons, but the Soviet Union faced similar circumstances several times during the Cold War. Russian officials cut short an expedition to the Salyut 7 space station in 1985 after the mission’s commander fell ill in orbit. A similar situation occurred in 1976 with the Soyuz 21 mission to the Salyut 5 space station.</div>

            <h2>Spotify’s 3rd price hike in 2.5 years hints at potential new normal</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/spotify-to-raise-subscription-prices-by-up-to-2-in-february/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a dozen years of keeping subscription prices stable, Spotify has issued three price hikes in 2.5 years.

Spotify informed subscribers via email today that Premium monthly subscriptions would go from $12 to $13 per month as of users’ February billing date. Spotify is already advertising the higher prices to new subscribers.

Although not explicitly mentioned in Spotify’s correspondence, other plans are getting more expensive, too. Student monthly subscriptions are going from $6 to $7. Duo monthly plans, for two accounts in the same household, are going from $17 to $19, and Family plans, for up to six users, are moving from $20 to $22.

Spotify’s Basic plan, which is only available as a downgrade for some Premium subscribers and is $11/month, is unaffected.

For years, Spotify subscribers enjoyed stable prices, but today’s announcement marks Spotify’s third price hike since July 2023. Spotify last raised prices in July 2024. Premium individual subscriptions went from $11 to $12, Duo subscriptions went from $15 to $17, and Family subscriptions increased from $17 to $20.

In 2024, Spotify blamed the higher prices on its need to “invest in and innovate on our product features.” Today, it said:

Occasional updates to pricing across our markets reflect the value that Spotify delivers, enabling us to continue offering the best possible experience and benefit artists.

The reasoning offered is vague, but some features that Spotify recently implemented include the addition of lossless audio in November, music videos in December, and new Messages features (one that lets you share your listening activity with friends and one that lets you request joint listening sessions called Jams) earlier this month. It also opened an 11,000-square-foot podcast studio in Hollywood this month.

In terms of Spotify’s claims of benefitting artists on its platform, in March the Stockholm-headquartered company put out a report that said it paid $10 billion in music royalties in 2024, which was more than it had ever paid. Spotify also added more ways for video podcasters to make money this month.

Some in the industry still criticize how much artists can make off of Spotify. In 2024, Billboard estimated that changes in how Spotify pays artists would result in musicians receiving millions less in royalties.

Spotify’s higher prices follow some periods of blowback in 2025. Some users and musicians boycotted the platform after learning that then-CEO Daniel Ek heavily invested in Germany military defense AI company Helsing. And in October, the nonprofit Indivisible urged subscribers to cancel Spotify because the streaming platform was running recruitment ads for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This month, Spotify confirmed that the ad campaign ended in late 2025. A November Rolling Stone report, citing an anonymous “industry source,” said that the Department of Homeland Security paid Spotify $74,000 to run the ads. It’s also been facing criticism for the success of AI slop on the platform.

In a quarterly earnings report released in November, Spotify reported double-digit year-over-year (YoY) growth in its number of Premium subscribers (12 percent), active monthly users with Basic subscriptions (11 percent), and its total monthly active users (11 percent). Gross profit increased 9 percent YoY to $1.56 billion (1.35 billion euros).

With financial numbers suggesting that it’s winning customers more than losing them, Spotify may feel confident in adopting more regular price hikes, like other subscription-based businesses do, to fund new business ventures, new features, and royalty payments.</div>

            <h2>Researchers Just Found Something That Could Shake the AI Industry to Its Core</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years now, AI companies, including Google, Meta, Anthropic, and OpenAI, have insisted that their large language models aren’t technically storing copyrighted works in their memory and instead “learn” from their training data like a human mind.

It’s a carefully worded distinction that’s been integral to their attempts to defend themselves against a rapidly growing barrage of legal challenges.

It also cuts to the core of copyright law itself. Copyright is a form of intellectual property law designed to protect original works and their creators. Under the US Copyright Act of 1976, a copyright owner has the exclusive right to “reproduce, adapt, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display the work.”

But, crucially, the “fair use” doctrine holds that others can use copyrighted materials for purposes like criticism, journalism, and research. That’s been the AI industry’s defense in court against accusations of infringement; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has gone as far as to say that it’s “over” if the industry isn’t allowed to freely leverage copyrighted data to train its models.

Rights holders have long cried foul, accusing AI companies of training their models on pirated and copyrighted works, effectively monetizing them without ever fairly remunerating authors, journalists, and artists. It’s a years-long legal battle that’s already led to a high-profile settlement.

Now, a damning new study could put AI companies on the defensive. In it, Stanford and Yale researchers found compelling evidence that AI models are actually copying all that data, not “learning” from it. Specifically, four prominent LLMs — OpenAI’s GPT-4.1, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, xAI’s Grok 3, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet — happily reproduced lengthy excerpts from popular — and protected — works, with a stunning degree of accuracy.

They found that Claude outputted “entire books near-verbatim” with an accuracy rate of 95.8 percent. Gemini reproduced the novel “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” with an accuracy of 76.8 percent, while Claude reproduced George Orwell’s “1984” with a higher than 94 percent accuracy compared to the original — and still copyrighted — reference material.

“While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models,” the researchers wrote.

Some of these reproductions required the researchers to jailbreak the models with a technique called Best-of-N, which essentially bombards the AI with different iterations of the same prompt. (Those kinds of workarounds have already been used by OpenAI to defend itself in a lawsuit filed by the New York Times, with its lawyers arguing that “normal people do not use OpenAI’s products in this way.”)

The implications of the latest findings could be substantial as copyright lawsuits play out in courts across the country. As The Atlantic‘s Alex Reisner points out, the results further undermine the AI industry’s argument that LLMs “learn” from these texts instead of storing information and recalling it later. It’s evidence that “may be a massive legal liability for AI companies” and “potentially cost the industry billions of dollars in copyright-infringement judgments.”

Whether AI companies are liable for copyright infringement remains a subject of heated debate. Stanford law professor Mark Lemley, who has represented AI companies in copyright lawsuits, told The Atlantic that he isn’t sure whether an AI model “contains” a copy of a book or can reproduce it “on the fly in response to a request.”

Unsurprisingly, the industry is continuing to argue that they’re technically not replicating protected works. In 2023, Google told the US Copyright Office that “there is no copy of the training data — whether text, images, or other formats — present in the model itself.”

OpenAI also told the office in the same year that its “models do not store copies of the information that they learn from.”

To The Atlantic‘s Reisner, the analogy that AI models learn like humans is a “deceptive, feel-good idea that prevents the public discussion we need to have about how AI companies are using the creative and intellectual works upon which they are utterly dependent.”

But whether the judges overseeing the litany of copyright lawsuits will agree with that sentiment remains to be seen. The stakes are considerable, particularly as it becomes harder and harder for authors, journalists, and other content creators to make a living — while the AI industry swells to unfathomable value.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Much ink has been spilled over US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s dalliances with anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, brain worms, nicotine pouches, and bizarre self-treatment with a synthetic dye known as methylene blue.

In spite of all those wellness eccentricities of his own, Kennedy is apparently in awe of his boss Donald Trump, who he says spends his days “pumping himself full of poison.”

In a recent appearance on the Katie Miller Podcast — hosted by the wife of Stephen Miller, who currently serves as homeland security advisor to the White House — Kennedy expressed astonishment that the president is even alive.

“He eats really bad food,” the health secretary dished. “Which is McDonald’s, and, you know, candy and Diet Coke. But he drinks Diet Coke at all times. He has the constitution of a deity — I don’t know how he’s alive, but he is.”

Though Kennedy acknowledged that Trump eats “really good food” when he’s staying in a place like Mar-a-Lago, he says those habits fall away the second he gets on the road.

“If you travel with him you get this idea that he’s just pumping himself full of poison all day,” Kennedy told Miller. “He wants to eat food from big corporations because he trusts it and he doesn’t want to get sick when he’s on the road.”

Trump’s health woes have been a topic of heated debate since he assumed his second term in office. He’s currently the oldest person to be elected president in US history, a superlative which has come with complications like daytime fatigue, visible bruising, and what his critics say is observable cognitive decline. (A mysterious CT scan that the president has struggled to explain hasn’t helped dispel those concerns.)

Whether Trump’s diet is contributing to his health woes is hard to say for certain — the administration insists he remains perfectly fit — but if Kennedy’s astonishment is any indication, the BigMacs certainly aren’t helping.

            <h2>ICE’s AI Tool Has Been a Complete Disaster</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/ice-ai-recruitment">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As headlines teem with stories of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers beating protestors, holding children hostage, and murdering people in cold blood, you might be wondering: who the hell hired these guys? As it turns out, AI played a huge role.

According to NBC, when ICE identifies a recruit with prior law enforcement experience, it assigns them to its “Law Enforcement Officer Program.” This is a four-week online course meant to streamline training for those already familiar with the legal aspects of the gig. Everyone else gets shipped off to ICE’s Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia for an eight-week in-person academy. This more rigorous training includes courses in immigration law, gun handling, physical fitness exams, and more.

Yet rather than assign a human to make that call, ICE’s human resources department outsourced the task to an untested large language model (LLM). This AI system was supposed to scan new recruits’ resumes in order to place them in one of the two programs; instead, it automatically flagged the “majority of new applicants” for the fast-track course regardless of their prior experience, officials familiar with the system told NBC.

“They were using AI to scan resumes and found out a bunch of the people who were LEOs weren’t LEOs,” one official said.

Basically, the AI model had approved any resume containing the word “officer” for the LEO program — which opened the door to anyone from a “mall security officer” to those who simply wrote about their aspirations to become ICE officers to take the expedited training course.

The exact number of inexperienced ICE recruits whisked into the fast lane is unknown. At this point, the agency is said to be actively reassessing its duty rosters to call new recruits back for additional training.

The error was first noticed in “mid-fall,” NBC reports, amidst a hiring surge in which ICE rushed to add some 10,000 officers to its ranks — a quota imposed by the Trump administration. Back in October, MS Now reported that ICE was struggling to meet its hiring goals, even after dropping age requirements for new recruits.

It all comes after ICE’s deadliest year since 2004. Throughout 2025, 32 people died in the agency’s custody, and more than 170 US citizens were detained against their will.

Still, it’s unlikely a few more weeks of training would have made much of a difference in those outcomes. As previous reporting has revealed, those responding to the Trump administration’s fascistic recruiting ads aren’t exactly the cream of the crop. During a December investigation into ICE’s hiring standards, an agency official told the Daily Mail that in some cases, the recruits being sent out into the field can barely read, let alone understand complex immigration law.

“We have people failing open-book tests and we have folks that can barely read or write English,” an official said. “We even had a 469lb man sent to the academy whose own doctor certified him ‘not at all fit’ for any physical activity.”

The fact that these gung-ho recruits aren’t being weeded out at the start is a horrifying indictment: either agency officials didn’t think to double check the AI’s work, or they didn’t care to. Either way, the horrifying consequences are sure to continue as ICE’s brutal crackdown on American cities rolls ahead.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Wikipedia has signed training deals with a host of major AI companies, helping it recoup some of the exorbitant costs it accrued from being relentlessly pillaged by data scrapers.

The companies include Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Perplexity, and France’s Mistral AI. As part of the series of licensing deals, revealed Thursday by Wikipedia’s operator the Wikimedia Foundation, the AI developers are joining Wikimedia’s Enterprise program, which provides direct access to its collection of over 65 million articles.

Using Wikipedia and its contents is of course free, but the official program allows quicker access at a “volume and speed designed specifically” for “large-scale reusers and distributors,” like AI chatbots.

Wikipedia had already agreed a licensing deal with Google in 2022, and also signed deals with smaller AI firms like the search engine Ecosia. Now, with the new slew of deals, Wikipedia has partnered up with every big name in town, and it sees the commercial partnerships as a way to keep the lights on, though it didn’t provide specifics on the financials of the deals.

“Wikipedia is a critical component of these tech companies’ work that they need to figure out how to support financially,” Lane Becker, president of Wikimedia Enterprise, told Reuters.

“It took us a little while to understand the right set of features and functionality to offer if we’re going to move these companies from our free platform to a commercial platform… but all our Big Tech partners really see the need for them to commit to sustaining Wikipedia’s work.”

It’s an interesting direction for the nonprofit, which has faced its fair share of struggle over AI’s increasing stranglehold over the internet. AI companies heavily relied on free sources of information like Wikipedia to train their AI models in the first place, and continue to frequently cite the encyclopedia for their responses. But as more people turn to chatbots for answers, fewer are visiting Wikipedia, which relies on small donations to stay afloat, and non-paid volunteers to maintain its articles.

Moreover, the large-scale data scraping of Wikipedia by AI web crawlers placed a heavy toll on its servers, which are growing more expensive to maintain. In effect, Wikipedia was paying for the AI industry’s voracious training — which isn’t what its readers were donating money for, says Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales.

“They’re not donating in order to subsidize these huge AI companies,” Wales told the Associated Press. The donors are saying, “You know what, actually you can’t just smash our website. You have to sort of come in the right way.”

There’s another reason Wales is onboard with the partnerships: better us than less scrupulous sources.

“I’m very happy personally that AI models are training on Wikipedia data because it’s human curated,” he told the AP. “I wouldn’t really want to use an AI that’s trained only on X, you know, like a very angry AI.” (Wales is referring to the website owned by Elon Musk. Musk, by the way, has a vendetta against Wikipedia and launched his own AI-generated “Grokipedia” as an anti-woke alternative, which immediately turned out to be racist.)

All told, it’ll be interesting to see how the deal is received by Wikipedia’s editors and writers, who have crusaded against AI content being used on the platform, and rebelled against the site owners when they tried to deploy AI-generated summaries over articles.

            <div id="article-text">Whether you’re a one-room film production house or a propagandist for a massive arm of the US government, you’re never too good to have an extra set of eyes take a look at your final draft.

That’s a lesson some PR spinsters with the Department of Homeland Security evidently have yet to learn, after the agency posted a 40-second clip for its new drone program, hyping up “American Air Superiority.”

As DHS propaganda goes, it’s your typical fare under Trump 2.0. There’s some cloyingly uplifting music, a few shots of drones in the sky, and bold-lettered copy proclaiming things like “innovation in action.” One detail, though, is so out of place that it feels like parody: the inclusion of footage showing DHS agents using a prominent Chinese drone brand.

The discrepancy was first spotted by drone researcher Faine Greenwood, who noticed that officers in the video were using a remote controller made by DJI, a company headquartered in Shenzhen, China. Given that DJI hardware uses closed-source communication protocols — which means they’re not cross-compatible with other drone brands — it follows that the DHS officer was piloting a Chinese-made drone.

It is our duty to provide our frontline personnel with every tool they need to protect our nation and return home to their families every… pic.twitter.com/ZigPaNFSbE

The optics are bizarre for the Trump administration, which is rabidly anti-China.

“Someone needs to ask Kristi Noem why she and DHS are promoting and using Sinister Chinese Communist drones, instead of Square-Jawed Heterosexual American Drones,” Greenwood quipped.

The humiliating self-own comes after Donald Trump moved to ban Chinese-made drones back in December, a move which specifically included DJI. However, following a Pentagon recommendation, the administration temporarily lifted some of the restrictions on certain brands — though DJI remains prohibited.

That actually raises real questions. Why is the government still using drones, especially for sensitive homeland security purposes, that are expressly prohibited? If they’re really so concerned, there are plenty of perfectly serviceable American brands.

It’s also an astonishing oversight for such a high-profile video — if the government is going to wantonly break its own rules for a little PR spin, shouldn’t it at least make some effort to cover it up?

            <h2>New Law Would Let Grok Victims Sue Creeps Who Generated Nonconsensual Nudes</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, the US senate passed a new law that would allow victims to sue individuals who use AI models like Grok to generate non-consensual nudes and other sexually explicit images.

Dubbed the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits (DEFIANCE) Act, it expands on another law passed last year, the Take It Down Act, which made it illegal to distribute nonconsensual intimate images and required social media companies to remove them within 48 hours, by empowering victims to go after the people responsible for generating the images, including seeking damages and imposing restraining orders, Bloomberg noted.

The new law was put forth by Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill) and passed unanimously.

“Give to the victims their day in court to hold those responsible who continue to publish these images at their expense,” Durbin said in a speech on the Senate floor, via The Hill. “Today, we are one step closer to making this a reality.”

The bill comes as Elon Musk’s X is facing vociferous public backlash after his AI chatbot Grok was used to generate thousands of nudes and sexually explicit images of both adults and children whose photos had been posted to the platform. The volume of these images was so overwhelming that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated the bot was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute.

The lack of response from xAI, the Musk-owned AI startup that develops Grok, has only further catalyzed the outrage from the public and regulators alike, to say nothing of Musk’s blasé attitude to it all. He only indirectly addressed the pornographic generations without ever explicitly mentioning them by asserting in a post that “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” He also joked that the nonconsensual undressing “trend” was “way funnier” than the trends started by other AI chatbots.

If Musk has failed to comprehend the gravity of the situation, governments have not. Some countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, have moved to ban access to his website entirely. UK prime minister Keir Starmer warned that he would bring the hammer down on X while the country’s communications regulator, Ofcom, launched an official investigation into the company.

“Imagine losing control of your own likeness or identity,” said Durbin, per The Hill. “Imagine that happening to you when you were in high school. Imagine how powerless victims feel when they cannot remove illicit content, cannot prevent it from being reproduced repeatedly and cannot prevent new images from being created.”

“The consequences can be profound,” he added.

The DEFIANCE Act now needs to pass a vote in the House before it can officially become law. It had already passed a vote in the Senate when it was previously proposed in 2024, but didn’t pass the lower chamber. Now, with the outrage over Grok, it may stand a better chance.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/anthropic-taps-former-microsoft-india-md-to-lead-bengaluru-expansion/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has appointed Irina Ghose, a former Microsoft India managing director, to lead its India business as the U.S. AI startup prepares to open an office in Bengaluru. The move underscores how India is becoming a key battleground for AI companies looking to expand beyond the U.S. for major growth markets.

Ghose brings deep big-tech operating experience to the role. She spent 24 years at Microsoft before stepping down in December 2025. Her appointment gives Anthropic a seasoned executive with local enterprise and government relationships as it gears up to establish an on-the-ground presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing AI markets.

India has become one of Anthropic’s most strategically important markets, with the country already ranking as the second-largest user base for Claude and usage heavily skewing toward technical and work-related tasks, including software development. Arch-rival OpenAI is also sharpening its focus on the market with plans to open an office in New Delhi — a sign India is fast becoming one of the most contested arenas in the global race to commercialize generative AI.

While India offers enormous scale — with more than a billion internet subscribers and over 700 million smartphone users — converting that reach into meaningful revenue has proven difficult, pushing AI companies to experiment with aggressive pricing and promotions. OpenAI last year introduced ChatGPT Go, its under-$5 plan aimed at attracting Indian users, and later made it available free for a year in the country.

Similar dynamics are playing out for Anthropic: its Claude app recorded a 48% increase from the previous year in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs, while consumer spending surged 572% to $195,000 for the month, per Appfigures — still modest compared with the U.S., where September spending hit $2.5 million.

Anthropic has been stepping up its engagement in India at the highest levels. Chief executive Dario Amodei visited in October and met corporate executives and lawmakers, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to discuss the company’s expansion plans and growing adoption of its tools. Anthropic had also explored a potential partnership with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries to broaden access to Claude, as TechCrunch reported previously. Reliance, however, ultimately struck a deal with Google to offer its Gemini AI Pro plan free to Jio subscribers. That move came as rival Bharti Airtel partnered with Perplexity to bundle access to its premium subscription, underscoring how India’s telecom giants have become critical distribution gatekeepers in the race to scale consumer AI services.

In a LinkedIn post announcing the move, Ghose said she would focus on working with Indian enterprises, developers and startups adopting Claude for “mission-critical” use cases, pointing to growing demand for what she described as “high-trust, enterprise-grade AI.” She added that AI tailored to local languages could be a “force multiplier” across sectors including education and healthcare — signaling Anthropic’s intent to deepen adoption beyond early tech users into larger institutions and the public sector.

The push by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Perplexity comes as India’s homegrown GenAI ecosystem remains relatively early-stage. While the country has a deep pool of software talent and a fast-growing base of AI users, it has produced few startups building large foundation models, with investors instead largely backing application-layer companies rather than committing the scale of capital typically required to train frontier systems.

The appointment also comes ahead of India’s AI Impact Summit 2026 in February, where the Indian government is expected to bring together AI startups, global CEOs, and industry experts to discuss the next phase of AI deployment in the country. The summit is part of New Delhi’s broader effort to signal support for domestic AI development and position India as a serious player in the global AI landscape, as competition intensifies across major markets.

Anthropic is also building out its India team, with job listings for roles including startup and enterprise account executives as well as a partner sales manager, signaling a push to deepen its go-to-market efforts and tap Indian businesses and startups as customers as it expands its presence in the country.

For Anthropic, the hire adds senior local leadership as it looks to turn India’s surging usage into a durable business, navigating a market where distribution partnerships, pricing pressure, and enterprise adoption will shape which AI players emerge as long-term winners.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI and Microsoft tried to dodge a courtroom showdown with Elon Musk, but a federal judge wasn’t having it, as reported earlier by Bloomberg. On Thursday she rejected their dismissal requests and set the case for a jury trial in late April, meaning they’ll officially duke it out in an Oakland courtroom, with Microsoft also dragged into the legal battle.

The backstory reads like a tech soap opera. Musk and Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI with others in 2015 as a nonprofit with lofty charitable goals. But those fuzzy feelings didn’t last — Musk left and in 2023 started his own AI company, xAI, and now claims his former partners betrayed their mission by taking billions from Microsoft and restructuring as a for-profit.

The relationships have seemingly curdled across the board. OpenAI and Microsoft remain business partners but increasingly compete head-to-head in AI. Meanwhile, Musk and Altman have gone from collaborators to arch enemies, with OpenAI dismissing Musk’s lawsuit as “baseless” and “harassment” and an attempt to slow it down.

The judge found enough evidence to let a jury decide whether OpenAI broke its nonprofit commitments. A jury will also now decide whether Microsoft knowingly helped OpenAI break its promises, though the judge dismissed Musk’s claim that Microsoft unjustly enriched itself at his expense.

            <div id="article-text">Newsrooms have been experimenting with AI for several years now but, for the most part, those efforts have been just that: experiments. A relatively unknown startup, Symbolic.ai, wants to change that, and it just signed a major deal with News Corp, the media conglomerate owned by Rupert Murdoch.

News Corp, the major assets of which include MarketWatch, the New York Post, and The Wall Street Journal, is set to begin using Symbolic’s AI platform with its financial news hub Dow Jones Newswires.

Symbolic.ai, which was founded by former eBay CEO Devin Wenig and Ars Technica co-founder Jon Stokes, says its AI platform can “assist in the production of quality journalism and content” and that its tool has even led to “productivity gains of as much as 90% for complex research tasks.” The platform is designed to make editorial workflows more efficient, providing improvements in areas like newsletter creation, audio transcription, fact-checking, “headline optimization,” SEO advice, and others.

In general, News Corp has shown a willingness to integrate AI into its media operations. In 2024, the company signed a multi-year partnership with OpenAI, wherein it would license its material to the AI company. Last November, the media conglomerate signaled that it was considering branching out, and licensing its material to other AI companies.

            <div id="article-text">AI labs just can’t get their employees to stay put.

Yesterday’s big AI news was the abrupt and seemingly acrimonious departure of three top executives at Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab. All three were quickly snapped up by OpenAI, and now it seems they won’t be the last to leave. Alex Heath is reporting that two more employees are expected to leave for OpenAI in the next few weeks.

Meanwhile, Anthropic continues to pull alignment researchers away from OpenAI. The Verge is reporting that one of OpenAI’s senior safety research leads, Andrea Vallone, has left the company for Anthropic. Vallone specializes in how AI models respond to mental health issues — which is a particularly sensitive issue for OpenAI after its recent sycophancy problems. As The Verge notes, Vallone will be working under alignment researcher Jan Leike, who left OpenAI in 2024 over concerns the company wasn’t taking safety seriously enough.

If that wasn’t enough, OpenAI finished things off with one last major poach. Max Stoiber, formerly the director of engineering at Shopify, will be joining the company to work on OpenAI’s long-rumored operating system, in what he describes as a “small high-agency team.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration signed a notable multibillion-dollar trade deal with Taiwan that’s designed to help the United States boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

Under the deal announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce on Thursday, Taiwanese semiconductor and tech companies have agreed to make direct investments of $250 billion into the U.S. semiconductor industry. These investments will span across semiconductors, energy, and AI “production and innovation,” according to a press release. Taiwan currently produces more than half of the world’s semiconductors.

Taiwan will also supply an additional $250 billion in credit guarantees for additional investments from these semiconductors and tech enterprises, according to the commerce department. The time period of these investments is unclear.

In return, the U.S. will invest in Taiwan’s semiconductor, defense, AI, telecommunications, and biotech industries. The press release did not specify a dollar amount tied to the U.S.’s side of the deal.

The news comes the day after the Trump administration published a proclamation that reiterated the country’s goal to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States and acknowledged the process would take time, as only 10% of semiconductors are produced stateside.

“This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated. “Given the foundational role that semiconductors play in the modern economy and national defense, a disruption of import-reliant supply chains could strain the United States’ industrial and military capabilities.”

The proclamation, which announced 25% of tariffs on some advanced AI chips, also stated that once trade talks with other countries — like this deal with Taiwan — are complete, there would be additional semiconductor tariffs.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Through an extension to its previous $50 million Series A round that closed in September, AI video generation startup Higgsfield has sold another $80 million worth of stock, bringing its total Series A to $130 million. The company says it has now hit a $1.3 billion valuation.

Higgsfield offers a tool that allows consumers, creators, and social media teams to create and edit AI-generated videos. The company was founded by Alex Mashrabov, former head of Generative AI at Snap, who landed at the company after it bought his previous startup, AI Factory, in 2020 for $166 million. Mashrabov was a co-founder of AI Factory.

Five months after Higgsfield launched its tool, it touted 11 million users and said it was a platform of choice for content creators. Nine months in, it has now reached over 15 million users and is on a $200 million annual revenue run rate, with that figure doubling from a $100 million trajectory in about two months, it says.

The startup believes this puts it in rarified growth terrain, outpacing companies like Lovable, Cursor, OpenAI, Slack, and Zoom, according to its press release.

To position itself less as an AI slop maker and more as a business tool, Higgsfield now emphasizes that the product is primarily used by professional social media marketers, “a major sign that the platform adoption has evolved beyond casual content creation.”

Of course, it’s still an AI slop engine as well. Last month, Higgsfield was used to create a video called “Island Holiday” that depicted people mentioned in the Epstein files alongside fictional characters on “vacation” on Epstein’s island. (Because of its offensive nature, we’re not going to link to the viral X post.)

            <h2>Trump-Administration Officials Describe an Elementary-School Drop-Off</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Based on how members of the Trump administration rushed to describe Renee Nicole Good, the Minneapolis woman who was shot and killed in her minivan while protesting ICE, as a “domestic terrorist,” a “professional agitator,” and an “anti-ICE rioter” behind the wheel of a “four-thousand-pound missile,” here is how they might describe her dropping off her son at school just before she was killed.

The terrorist drove a 4,000-pound guided missile to deliver her small associate to the rendezvous point. She pulled up to where dozens of others just like her were also making their sinister deliveries at “School.” (An ominously short, unpatriotic name for any building. Where is the “Trump”?) Their tiny accomplices climbed out of the rolling weapons, carrying bags on their backs full of scribbled writings—Codes, perhaps? Or manifestos?—in crayon and pencil and Magic Marker. Some of them were armed with Uncrustables, suspicious, round, sandwich-like objects full of jelly and peanut butter. (Deadly biohazards!) Others had juice boxes.

Despite the snow on the roads, these terrorists were out in force in their four-wheeled missiles. The missiles were garnished, in some cases, with stickers. (Stickers that have slogans on them, religious icons that almost seem to spell out COEXIST—a threat, to be certain.)

Some of them were wearing hats but no makeup. (The mark of a mind disturbed.) Some of these women had a husband at home, and some had a wife. (Could this be part of the hostility toward “traditional American views on family” that is listed in the Justice Department’s new definition of domestic terror?) All of them were up to no good.

More investigation would show their true motives: Who had been funding them? Who had filled their vehicles with such dangerous and costly equipment? You could see the other weapons they carried: stuffed animals (plush, scale models of deadly threats to human life), insufficiently deferential smiles, a disrespectful attitude toward law enforcement—carried openly, in the car, where a child could see them. Who would allow such a thing around a child, knowing its potency! A disrespectful attitude—the kind of weapon that would justify any response, however violent.

Some of the terrorists walked their little cronies into the building, kissing the top of their head and whispering secret codes: “I love you.” “Be kind.” (A terrible thing, to indoctrinate a child.) “See you at pickup.” (A terrible thing, to lie to a child.)</div>

            <h2>Weed Companies Are Cashing In on Dry January</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/high-january-alcohol-cannabis/685624/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many Americans enthusiastically partake in Dry January, but it is rarely pitched as fun. After the holiday stretch of office parties and family gatherings, Americans have come to use the start of every year to abstain from alcohol in the name of health and auspicious beginnings. It’s a time of discipline, of cleansing, of embodying your mood board, even if it makes you a drag at parties. And it is also, as weed companies have learned, a marketing opportunity.

In recent years, weed companies have started to lean into the argument that taking the edge off sobriety with a low-dose gummy or THC drink still counts as dry. My social-media feeds are flooded with posts from cannabis companies pitching their products as fun and approachable tools to get through an alcohol-free month. Mary and Jane, an edibles company, makes a tantalizing proposition: “Dry January made easy.” Artet, which specializes in beverages, sells a “High & Dry January” bundle that includes a bottle of its THC-laced aperitif. Some products are conspicuously health-coded: North Canna describes its cannabis drinks as “functional,” and Feals highlights its edibles’ low calorie count. Above all, the ads emphasize how little booze you drink when you get high instead.

This push for a weed-filled January is, of course, a blatant (and somewhat silly) attempt by cannabis companies to get more customers. But as restrictions on marijuana loosen, and more Americans find themselves able and willing to fit the drug into their lives, Dry January does appear to be offering an opportunity for experimentation. In fact, cannabis sales surged in January 2024, and 21 percent of Dry January participants who responded to a 2023 survey swapped booze for weed that month.

None of the four cannabis-company founders I spoke with framed their products as replacements for alcohol per se. Still, many products marketed as Dry January aids aim to approximate the effect of having a single drink, leaving users buzzed but in control. These products tend to contain a low dose of THC, usually five milligrams or less. (One milligram of THC could give a weed newbie a pleasant buzz, and a heavy user might not feel five milligrams at all.) Wims, which sells THC-laced drink mix-ins, is designed to take effect and wear off in roughly the same amount of time as a serving of alcohol, Lauren Miller, one of the company’s co-founders, told me.

Even if THC can induce a similarly loose state as alcohol at those doses, weed companies still have some distance to overcome. In general, using cannabis as a substitute for social drinking is a harder sell than using it to avoid alcohol at home—not only because most bars don’t serve THC but also because the drug has a better chance of spurring you to melt into the couch than to mingle. Cannabis companies are trying to position their products to be used in the same context as alcohol. In states with looser cannabis laws, such as Minnesota and Tennessee, THC beverages from Nowadays are served at bars and hotels, Justin Tidwell, the company’s CEO and co-founder, told me. Wims can be dissolved into a drink, so “you don’t have to change your rituals or the way that you’re socializing,” Miller said.

The shaky logic of replacing one drug with another during a month dedicated to sobriety is hard to ignore. If the point of Dry January is to improve health, replacing alcohol with cannabis—which is not a benign substance—seems counterproductive. Far less is known about the long-term use of cannabis compared with alcohol, but both can be abused, cause dependence, and interfere with daily function and productivity, Ryan Vandrey, who helps run Johns Hopkins’s Cannabis Science Laboratory, told me. Some people are predisposed to react negatively to cannabis, experiencing anxiety, paranoia, or even cyclical vomiting. Over time, long-term heavy cannabis use can exacerbate mental-health conditions such as schizophrenia and depression. Plus, Vandrey said, weed hangovers are very real (if different from alcohol hangovers).

Still, for people with a more benign response to the drug, cannabis can be a genuinely useful tool for cutting back on booze, Vandrey said. If cannabis helps people drink less, it might indeed lower the health risks associated with excessive alcohol use, such as liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer. Whatever the relative health benefits may be, Rachel Dillon, a co-founder of Mary and Jane, argues that cannabis is a realistic way to satisfy the all-too-familiar desire to decompress.

This month, I decided to put Dillon’s theory to the test. So far, High January, as I’ve come to call it, has mostly replaced my nightly glass of wine. Taking an evening 1.5-milligram gummy has subdued the urgency of the post-work rush—and, importantly, quieted any cravings for alcohol in that context. My mind is clearer, I’m sleeping better, and my mornings are less sluggish.

Yet cannabis has proved to be an imperfect tool for cutting down on my own alcohol consumption. The drug can’t quite re-create the intimacy of sharing a drink; during a recent late-night chat with a friend, I gave myself a free pass to enjoy a glass of Bordeaux. I’ve even experienced the all-too-real weed hangover. And I’ve felt conflicted about the need to soften my reality with any drug. Certainly, there are healthier ways to relax. Maybe I’ll discover them next January.</div>

Brandon LaRoque kept his life savings in a cryptocurrency account. One morning, as he went to check his balance, he discovered that it was all missing. LaRoque is one of many victims of the unregulated crypto industry, and soon there may be more. President Donald Trump has rolled back regulation of the industry. At the same time, he and his family have earned untold billions of dollars from new crypto ventures. Molly White, a writer focused on the intersections of tech and finance, describes the crypto industry, and explains how this new financial industry is shaping our politics and facilitating corruption within our government.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Brandon LaRoque: Things tend to happen to me first ’cause I’m usually the one willing to try something new first. And I hope I’m not the canary in the coal mine.

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum. In this new season, I am asking how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of U.S. politics, and talking to Americans whose lives have been changed as a result.

Today’s episode: cryptocurrency, and the crypto oligarchs whose campaign to prevent any regulation of their industry is corrupting the American economy as well as American politics.

Donald Trump was once skeptical of the crypto industry; bitcoin, he once said, “seems like a scam.” But since his inauguration, Donald Trump and his family have turned 180 degrees and made hundreds of millions of dollars from their own crypto company, World Liberty Financial. At the same time, Trump has deregulated the crypto industry, making life easier for the oligarchs who run it, and potentially allowing them to harm thousands of ordinary consumers.

Brandon LaRoque is one those people, a victim of what he says was a hack involving a crypto coin called XRP.

LaRoque: My name is Brandon Laroque. I’m from Raleigh, North Carolina. I’m an Eagle Scout. I’m a veteran, and for the past 21 years, I ran a bar. We, my wife and I, ran it together. It’s called the Goat Bar, in Raleigh. The bar was our baby.

Every day when I used to leave my bar, if I had any extra cash with me, I would go to the ATM machine and I would buy XRP, and send it to my wallet. That was my savings.  I just kind of wanted to stay out of the banks as much as possible.

Each month what I would do is, since we had retired from our bar, I would sell off a little bit of XRP. So if we needed, you know, $5,000 to pay the mortgage or pay our car payment, or whatever it was, I would actually just sell off whatever I needed. And that’s what we’ve been living off for the past year.

On October 15, which was a Wednesday, I, being in the bar business, I’m a night owl. I’m up all night long. I’m usually going to bed when most people are getting up, going to work.

And I just happened to click on my wallet. I don’t check it every day. I clicked on the app, and I noticed that my XRP had all been just disappeared. It was 4 o’clock in the morning. I woke my wife up, literally in tears. Somehow I was hacked. I don’t know. And I still don’t even know how to this day.

1,210,000 XRP. It was worth approximately $3 million. It was our life savings.

The first week was a haze. I was so lost. I lost 12 pounds in seven days. It’s just so crazy that I’ve gone this long and now I’m right here at the finish line, and it’s gone.

I mean, I hate to say that money caused me the worst day of my life, but it caused me the worst day of my life, unfortunately, to be honest. ’Cause it wasn’t about the money as it was about, you know, I could just see all our dreams kind of disappearing when that happened.

We didn’t know what we were gonna do. I contacted my local sheriff. They did not have a cybercrimes unit. I contacted my local police department. They don’t have a cybercrimes unit. I also contacted the FBI. With the FBI, it was like, Just fill out a report. And I think there’s, like, less than a 1 percent chance of getting any of our crypto back. I mean, I hope there’s more, but I just really doubt it.

I think a lot of people are making a lot of money off the backs of a lot of people.

And, I mean, I’ll say, I am a Trump supporter, but I don’t agree with the Trump coin. I don’t agree with these meme coins. I don’t agree with the whole thing going on. I think it’s called World Liberty or World Finance, whatever it is. I think they’re all terrible.

If I had President Trump’s ear, I would ask him to please work with Congress and make crypto safer and easier for everyone. Even though I don’t like the banks, at least I can walk into a branch and speak to a human being, and they will sit down there and help me with my bank account. Why can’t you do the same thing with crypto?

I think that they all need to get off their butts and pass legislation to make it safer for everybody. Let’s get something done.

Molly White: I think there’s a lot of damage that can potentially happen to everyday people through crypto.

Applebaum: Molly White is a software engineer and researcher. She writes the newsletter Citation Needed, which focuses on the crypto industry and the intersections between finance and tech.

Molly, for listeners who aren’t steeped in finance or who are just unfamiliar, how do you describe what crypto is, and how do you explain how it’s different from traditional banking?

White: Well, crypto is really a form of a digital asset, so there’s no paper currency. Broadly speaking, people are not using crypto for buying their groceries or paying their rent or those types of things. Most people buy and sell them for speculative purposes.

Applebaum: Speculative purposes, meaning they invest in it, and they hope the price will go up.

Applebaum: And how can unregulated crypto hurt ordinary consumers?

White: So there is the risk when it comes to the asset itself in the sense that these assets are highly volatile. Many of them, you don’t know who has created the asset. You don’t know who is running the business. You don’t know their credibility or their background. They aren’t required to disclose it under the current regulatory regime. There have been many, many cryptocurrencies that are known as “rug pulls,” where, essentially, the creators of these assets inflate the price artificially and then sell all their tokens, profiting immensely themselves but at the expense of everyone they convinced to purchase the tokens.

You know, there’s very little regulation preventing that type of activity, whereas you would expect that activity to be quickly shut down in more regulated ends of the financial system. So there’s the sort of asset-level risk, but then there’s also the broader risk, which is that if you buy a stock today through your brokerage account, the price of the stock might go up and down, but you know, fairly confidently, that that stock is still gonna belong to you when you open up your brokerage in a month.

When it comes to the cryptocurrency industry, we’ve seen repeated examples of crypto firms that have gone bankrupt, that have run off with all the money, that have just vanished into thin air practically. We saw the collapse of FTX, in 2022—

Applebaum: Right, Sam Bankman-Fried’s company—

White: Correct, where it turned out that people were trusting this company that was actually taking their money and then using them to trade or to make investments in other companies or to purchase real estate for the executives of that company. And people ended up losing a lot of money when FTX went bankrupt. And now its CEO is spending a long time in jail.

And I think a lot of people don’t understand that there is very little protection against that type of activity. Especially in the United States, I think we’ve all become very comfortable with banks or regulated financial institutions, where there is some degree of oversight, where you expect that a company is not gonna just run off with all your money without any recourse. Or, you know, if your bank fails, you expect that you don’t have to worry about your deposits, because they are insured up to a fairly large amount. And I think a lot of people who are being sucked in by the marketing and the promises of getting rich overnight, frankly, don’t understand that there is that amount of risk that they’re getting into.

Applebaum: So it’s a little bit like the banking industry before deposit insurance, before banks were regulated. It’s as if you could have had your money in a bank, and then the bank could go bankrupt or disappear overnight, and then you would just lose everything.

White: Right, exactly. I mean, that is, when we saw crypto collapses throughout the past handful of years, there were many instances where people lost their funds and they said, I thought I had the same protections as a bank. I thought the FDIC would step in and reimburse me. And now we are actually seeing the regulators being pulled back and told to step away from the crypto industry. And we’re seeing legislation being passed that would essentially enable the crypto industry to expand its business activities without any additional consumer protections.

Applebaum: You keep a running tally of money that’s been lost in schemes and scams since 2021. Where are we now approximately?

White: Let me take a quick look. So the running total on my website for the money that’s been lost is almost $80 billion, and that’s actually a very conservative estimate. So that’s really the lower bound, I would say.

Applebaum: So to be clear, this is $80 billion lost by ordinary consumers.

White: Yeah, it’s a mix of everyday people and institutions.

Applebaum: Let me shift now to the current administration. Maybe we could start with World Liberty Financial. Can you explain what it is and how it works and how it could be used, in effect, to bribe the president?

White: So World Liberty Financial is a cryptocurrency platform that was created by Trump, some of his sons, and a handful of external partners in August 2024.

Applebaum: And one of those external partners is Zach Witkoff, who is the son of Trump’s Middle East and Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff.

White: Right, and this has been a very lucrative project for the Trump family. They’ve earned hundreds of millions of dollars just from selling WLFI tokens that currently don’t really do much, but allow people to buy favor with the president, essentially.

Applebaum: Can we just focus on that for a second? So people are buying tokens, but then there’s nothing they can use those tokens for, right? I mean, they can’t be used to buy anything else, and they can’t be traded easily, and they can’t be sold easily. So the only reason to buy them is to be able to show the president that you spent money on his company.

White: I agree that it really is just a way to buy favor with the president. And we’ve seen that being done through people like Justin Sun, for example, who is a foreign national, is not permitted to contribute to Trump’s campaign, but was making a $75 million purchase of these WLFI tokens. And Trump and his family take a 75 percent cut of that.

Applebaum: So Justin Sun invested in World Liberty Financial, and what did he get in exchange?

White: He ended up being rewarded with an advisory position at the World Liberty project, which gives him close access to the Trump family.

Applebaum: And at the time, he was under an investigation as well, no?

White: Correct. Justin Sun was actively fighting a civil lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission that alleged fraud in addition to the usual unregistered sales of securities.

Applebaum: And since then, those charges have been removed? Or we’re not investigating him anymore?

White: The Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit has been paused, pending resolution. So essentially dropped. And so, yes, I mean he essentially has nothing to worry about anymore in terms of both criminal and civil litigation.

Applebaum: I mean, obviously, we can’t prove the connection, but there is a series of strange events. So, Justin Sun made an investment in World Liberty Financial. Subsequent to that, the investigation into him was lifted, although his investment was locked and frozen, later on, by World Liberty Financial. So obviously, there is more to this story. [Sun has denied any wrongdoing.]

White: Correct. You know, we’ve seen other examples where companies have partnered with Trump’s companies in ways that are very lucrative for the Trump family, and then they’ve seemed to suddenly enjoy relief from legal concerns. We’ve seen, for example, Coinbase spending millions of dollars on political contributions, whether it was to crypto-focused super PACs that were supporting pro-crypto congressional candidates, or if it was sponsorship of the Trump military parade or a million dollars to Trump’s inauguration fund. And then shortly after Trump took office, the SEC enforcement case against them was dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can’t be refiled. I mean, the list really goes on.

Applebaum: Some of this doesn’t sound that new; it just sounds like classic lobbying. The difference, it seems to me, though, is both in the scale, in the amounts of money being thrown around, in the fact that people seem to be paying to get rid of their legal problems. And of course, the huge difference is the personal involvement of the president and his family.

White: They are involved in almost every aspect of the crypto industry at this point. The Trump family is profiting from cryptocurrency businesses and crypto investments, and President Trump is essentially directing the regulation and legislation around the crypto industry.

Applebaum: Can you estimate how much money the president and his family have made through this line of business?

White: We’re talking billions of dollars at this point.

Applebaum: This seems to me the genuinely unusual and new piece of this, actually, which is that you have an industry that is directly benefiting the president. So he is directly, personally, and immediately benefiting from his own regulatory decisions. I mean, what stopped that before? Was it just our norms—presidents just didn’t do that.

White: It’s probably fair to say that some presidents have profited to some extent from the office, but this is certainly a dramatic escalation of directly profiting, and in quite enormous amounts. I think some of it comes down to norms. I think some of it comes down to an unwillingness or inability to investigate and prosecute corruption.

There have been multiple lawmakers calling for investigations into these clear conflicts of interest, and those have largely not gone anywhere, due to the unwillingness of the rest of Congress to step up and look into this type of activity.

Applebaum: Yeah. It seems to me the other big difference is: Other presidents profited after leaving the presidency. They made money from speeches, but I can’t think of, in modern times at least, of a president who has earned this kind of money, this fast, while in office.

Applebaum: We’ve been talking about the tangled web of the crypto world and how Trump and his family have personally benefited. But it feels like hardly anyone is talking about how this new source of money—billions of dollars—is also giving the presidency new levels of autonomy and power.

White: It’s sort of a chicken-and-an-egg question. To what extent has the authoritarianism enabled the policies that have allowed him to acquire so much cryptocurrency? And then the other way around.

Applebaum: Molly, there is one country that has made crypto a central part of its financial system, and that is El Salvador. It’s led by Nayib Bukele, a democratically elected president who has, like Trump, also sought to centralize power and eliminate checks and balances. We know the Trump family admires him. Donald Trump Jr., together with Tucker Carlson, went to Bukele’s inauguration in 2024. How has El Salvador’s experiment with crypto worked out?

White: Yeah, so El Salvador took a very similar approach, frankly, to bitcoin a number of years ago, where the president essentially unilaterally determined that they were going to create this national fund of bitcoin. They were gonna take money belonging to the country and put it into purchasing bitcoin.

This was not something that was particularly popular among the populace, but it was sort of a unilateral decision by Bukele to sort of foist bitcoin upon the everyday people in El Salvador, who were told to download crypto wallets. Businesses were instructed to begin accepting bitcoin in their day-to-day operations.

And it was ultimately not very beneficial to Salvadoran people. This was government money that could have been used in much more socially beneficial ways that was instead being stockpiled away in crypto investments. There were technical problems with the bitcoin wallet, and the [government] rollout that resulted in people’s assets being stolen from them. It was, frankly, fairly disastrous. And so it was a very challenging time for El Salvador.

Applebaum: So it’s not as if El Salvador has created this beautiful model that we can just follow.

White: Well, I mean, it sort of seems like Trump and his family have been emulating El Salvador in many ways. But El Salvador is not a great example of, I think, where this country should be going. But it, unfortunately, has strong parallels to Trump, where the president has consolidated power in very alarming ways. He runs the government in a fairly authoritarian way. And he has gone all in on crypto.

Applebaum: Moving back to the United States, how would you describe the Trump administration’s regulatory approach in this second term?

White: Well, the strategy so far has been to completely defang financial regulators. You know, there have been executive orders instructing the SEC and [the Commodity Futures Trading Commission] to essentially back off from the cryptocurrency industry, and the Department of Justice as well. And the people that the Trump administration has been installing at regulators and in these other agencies have largely been coming from the cryptocurrency industry. I mean, we’ve seen, essentially, this revolving door happening, where many of the people now in charge of regulating the cryptocurrency industry have very direct ties to that industry.

Applebaum: Let me shift now to ask you about the idea of a cryptocurrency reserve, a “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve&quot;, or having crypto be part of the deeper bones of the U.S. financial system. Walk us through what that proposal is and how it would work, and then I’ll ask you about how it could go wrong.

White: So the “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve” and the “Digital Asset Stockpile” were created with sort of an executive order that takes a pile of crypto assets that were already being held by the U.S. government and pledges to continue to hold them rather than sell them. And so the U.S. government actually holds a fairly substantial amount of cryptocurrencies, largely that were seized as a result of law-enforcement activity.

So, for example, if there’s, you know, a criminal case against an online drug marketplace or something like that, and they shut that down, they seize the crypto assets, once that case is finished in court, those assets are forfeited to the government. That means that the government essentially has them in their government crypto wallet, and historically they have sold them off. But now the idea is that the government will actually hold those assets in kind and essentially hope to profit from increases in, for example, bitcoin price.

Applebaum: And how could this be damaging? What’s wrong with doing that?

White: Well, it’s essentially the U.S. government engaging in crypto speculation. These are assets that historically would’ve gone towards funding various treasury activities. Now they’re being held in reserve, and it’s unclear under what circumstances that those assets will be used for normal government purposes. It also, you know, we’re seeing various members of the government, including people who are very active in defining crypto policy, talking about trying to find ways to add to those holdings by purchasing crypto assets.

You know, we saw this sort of mad scramble when Trump was talking about creating this executive order from various crypto companies that wanted their crypto assets included in this stockpile as well, because they understood that this would be both an endorsement of their crypto assets and would drive demand.

Applebaum: And would this also not give the president access to funds or to money that he could spend as he wants? Money that hasn’t been allocated by Congress?

White: I think that’s a very serious question. You know, there is not the type of congressional oversight when it comes to spending these types of alternative funds, and it seems to me that this is a way for Trump to essentially create this stockpile of funds that he could then use without much oversight.

Applebaum: So he would have sort of his own slush fund.

Applebaum: Can you describe the involvement of the crypto industry in the 2024 elections? Was that different from the industry’s previous involvement, and what exactly were they trying to achieve?

White: Yeah. So the crypto industry became very heavily involved in the 2024 elections in ways that they had really not been previously. We saw the involvement of these massive, single-issue pro-cryptocurrency super PACs that were getting heavily involved in congressional elections. The industry contributed over $150 million to those super PACs. They spent around $130 million influencing congressional races, where they were hoping to either install pro-crypto candidates or remove people who were viewed to be enemies of the crypto industry. At one point it was almost half of all corporate spending was coming out of the cryptocurrency industry.

Applebaum: Wow. So that’s even beyond the scale of spending of the oil-and-gas industry, for example.

White: Yeah, I mean, you look at the size of the crypto industry, which is very small comparatively, and they were spending like the pharma industry, like the oil industry.

And it was very, very overt around the messaging. Basically, the industry saying, If you don’t support us, we are going to crush you with millions and millions of dollars in these elections where—these are often states where these crypto companies don’t have any real presence, but they are funneling money to control these elections in ways that the actual residents of those states often have very little say in as a result. And so you end up with these corporations contributing huge amounts of money to essentially raise their interests above those of everyday constituents.

Applebaum: So crypto companies are making enormous contributions to state, Senate, and House campaigns, even where they don’t even have a physical presence, just to be able to have influence in Congress later on. Tell me about the possibility of using crypto for illegal campaign funding. Money is moved around anonymously so easily in that world. For example, if a foreign national wanted to influence a campaign, could they do it via the crypto industry?

White: Potentially. I mean, we’re already seeing these various sort of indirect ways in which foreign nationals and U.S. people are directing funds towards the Trump family, for example. And those are not campaign contributions, but they certainly appear to be influencing policy. You know, essentially, crypto could be a conduit for bribery that is challenging to trace. I mean, one of the goals of crypto is to be fairly anonymous, to make it challenging for people to know where funds are coming from.

Applebaum: Do you expect the industry to be involved in the midterms? Do you expect big investments in campaigns once again?

White: Absolutely. We’ve already seen these same crypto PACs from 2024 raising money for the 2026 elections. We’re actually seeing new super PACs being established. One of them has already committed to spending $100 million in the midterms. And we’re seeing politicians and candidates speaking very frankly about wanting to install pro-crypto candidates. I mean, the chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Tim Scott, recently said the No. 1 thing that the crypto industry can do is fire the legislators that are in your way. So we’re seeing very aggressive incitement for these crypto PACs to get very involved in the midterms.

Applebaum: So legislators who support consumer protection, who care about ordinary people not being ripped off—they’re the ones who will be the target of the crypto funding in the 2026 elections?

White: Absolutely. I mean, we saw Sherrod Brown, for example, in Ohio. The crypto industry spent $40 million to support his competitor to get him out of office. And Sherrod Brown is going to be running again. And we’re already hearing people talking about opposing him because he is such a strong advocate for consumer protections or for actions against big banks, Big Finance. We’ve seen calls for the industry to come out in force against him.

White: And I think we’ll see very similar strategies against other proconsumer protection candidates that run in 2026.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/denmark-afghanistan-nato-america-greenland/685625/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was sunny in southern Afghanistan on June 1, 2010, and the temperature quickly reached 104 degrees. Sophia Bruun was the gunner on a Piranha combat vehicle, guarding two platoons conducting a patrol near the town of Gereshk. They were looking for information from locals about the Taliban.

One of the Piranhas in Sophia’s battle group had hit an IED first thing in the morning, blowing off a wheel, but no one was injured. At the outskirts of a village, they were fired on by the Taliban. They returned fire, and the situation calmed. The patrol continued. But seven minutes after noon, an IED went off under Sophia’s vehicle, flipping it. She was killed instantly, at the age of 22.

In the years after Sophia’s death, her mother, Lene Bruun, returned repeatedly to details of her service, studying letters from the Danish army that she stored in a metal trunk in her home west of Copenhagen. Over time, she allowed herself distance from her grief. “You can put it away for a short time, sometimes longer, but then it comes back,” Bruun, who is 72, told me over coffee at her kitchen table. “And you don’t know what triggers it.”

But these days, Sophia’s mother knows exactly what triggers her grief: “when Trump says we’re not good enough.” Bruun is a tiny woman, with soft white hair and fine lines grooved into her pale skin. But she became flushed when discussing the American president, who has been threatening to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. “Keep your fingers away,” she said with a swatting motion, as if to thwart Trump’s land grab.

The Trump administration’s designs on Greenland have forced European leaders to speak openly about the possible end of NATO. “If the United States attacks another NATO country, everything stops,” Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, warned recently. A military strike by the alliance’s most powerful member would make its promise of common defense obsolete—and risk the outbreak of World War III. It’s a bewildering possibility for the Danes, who see the United States as their most important ally, the country that ushered them into the NATO pact and guaranteed their security for nearly 80 years.

Denmark is small, with a population of just 6 million. But it has tried to uphold its end of the bargain. It lost more soldiers per capita than the United States did in Afghanistan. In all, there were 43 deaths, a sacrifice that Danes accepted as the cost of their international obligations. Sophia was the first female soldier to fall in combat in Danish history, her death a ripple effect of the September 11 attacks, the first time that NATO’s mutual-defense clause was invoked. Triggering Article 5 obligated U.S. allies to assist, including by sending soldiers like Sophia to fight. This time, if Article 5 is invoked, the United States might be the aggressor.

Trump appears unbothered by the prospect that his move against Danish territory might obliterate the American-led order. “If it affects NATO, it affects NATO,” he said recently. “But you know, they need us much more than we need them.” That may be true in a strict sense; U.S. power eclipses Danish capabilities many times over. But when I traveled to Denmark this month, I found there was still fidelity to principles that seem to have vanished from the American government’s calculations, namely a sense of mutual obligation and basic morality.

That’s why Danes feel such an acute sense of betrayal when Trump maligns their value as an ally. “It’s not right what he’s saying,” Bruun protested. “We have done so much for America.” For the families of Danish soldiers who died in the American-led campaign against the Taliban, their country’s partnership with the United States is not an abstraction. Denmark’s loyalty to America brought Sophia Bruun to Afghanistan, and it ended her life.

Sophia’s mother is the one who suggested that she join the armed forces. She was a spunky kid who played handball and gymnastics. As a teenager, she liked to party. After high school, she was directionless, so her mother proposed six months in the military, thinking the experience would prepare her for any profession and give her friends from all over the world. She entered basic training in 2008, acing the physical components, and soon signed a contract that required her to deploy to Afghanistan. “I was furious,” Bruun recalled, never thinking when she proposed a brief course of military instruction that her daughter would actually go to war.

Denmark participated in international operations in the 1990s, but its soldiers didn’t suffer heavy casualties. The country’s engagement in Afghanistan began in December 2001, as Denmark sent aircraft and special forces to aid in the coalition battling the Taliban. Unlike Denmark’s involvement in the American-led war in Iraq, beginning two years later, the decision to participate in Afghanistan wasn’t controversial, Rasmus Mølgaard Mariager, a historian at the University of Copenhagen, told me. “Denmark wanted to be the American empire’s European Gurkha,” he said, referring to the Nepalese fighters who were recruited into the ranks of the British empire starting in the 19th century and proved their soldierly mettle.

Danes can’t boast the same military prowess. “This is not a Viking people,” as one U.S. official in Copenhagen put it to me. Veterans I spoke with said the deployment to Afghanistan was shadowed by two humbling moments in their country’s history, reaching all the way back to 1864, when they were routed by Prussia and Austria. The second defeat was even more chastening. On April 9, 1940, when Nazi forces swept north, invading Denmark, the country’s military couldn’t withstand the attack and folded in what is sometimes called the Six-Hour War. It is understood to be the quickest national defeat at the hands of Hitler’s armies and gave rise to a refrain, “Never again an April 9,” that still motivates Danish soldiers, Søren Knudsen, who served three tours in Afghanistan and later worked at the NATO Defense College, in Rome, told me. “We’re tired of being bullied by these big nations,” he said.

Bruun supported Denmark’s participation in the Afghan War. “Because we are such a small country, we can only go with other countries,” she said. “That’s the only way we can survive.” Denmark expanded its contribution in 2006, when the Danish Parliament approved plans to deploy troops to a British provincial-reconstruction team and other allied efforts in Helmand province, a notorious Taliban stronghold in the country’s south. In all, Denmark sent nearly 20,000 personnel, according to estimates. Many of them helped carry out Britain’s so-called platoon-house strategy, in which small groups of soldiers occupy fortified positions in strategic towns to project authority and fend off the Taliban.

Denmark’s soldiers engaged in the fiercest combat seen by its forces since the war against Prussia and Austria in 1864. The lesson, says Peter Boysen, a deputy commander of Danish soldiers in Afghanistan, was that the country could manage the casualties. “We risked our lives by participating in an operation far from our home,” Boysen, who is now chief of the Danish army, told me. And because the fight was in support of a NATO ally that had come under attack, he said, it was worth it.

As Sophia prepared to deploy to Afghanistan in early 2010, her mother was in Greenland. Bruun worked as a nurse at the time, and she performed rotations on the island. Danes have knowledge of the territory—of its unforgiving climate, and of its people—that the Americans can’t replicate, Bruun insisted.

Greenland became a Danish colony in 1721, when a Christian missionary landed on the island’s west coast. It gained home rule in the 20th century and is now a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark, with a Parliament based in the capital, Nuuk. Denmark still controls Greenland’s defense and foreign affairs, and it provides the island an annual block grant that largely underwrites policing and health care.

This week, Greenland’s prime minister placed his people’s fate with Denmark and Europe. “If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark,” the prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said. “We choose NATO, the Kingdom of Denmark, and the European Union.” Asked about the comments, Trump said that he didn’t know who Nielsen was, but that his choice would be a “big problem for him.”

Before Sophia deployed, Bruun shortened her contract and returned to Denmark. Sophia left days later. Some of her friends came to the airport to say goodbye, along with her mother, father, and younger brother. “She was looking forward to it,” Bruun recalled. “She was going out to do what she was trained to do.”

Sophia called home every so often, reporting that it was hot and sandy. She wasn’t permitted to say much about what she was doing. Sophia’s mother took care of her dog, a cocker spaniel named Minnie, and she filled letters with details of the dog’s activities, including hunting chickens. In a letter home, which her mother read to me, Sophia expressed enthusiasm about returning to Denmark for leave. “And then she said, ‘I will call, I’m getting up early tomorrow, so now I go to bed.’”

Sophia’s mother was at the hospital in her hometown of Holbæk on June 1 when a doctor appeared on her ward and ushered her to a meeting room. As soon as she walked in, a man in military dress said, “Sophia is dead.”

“I said, ‘No, not my Sophia,’” Bruun recalled. “‘Yes, Sophia is dead,’ he said.” Her vision became distorted, and she sat down on the floor.

Sophia hadn’t wanted a big military funeral. In her will, she specified that only soldiers who had served alongside her should attend. The ceremony took place at the family’s church, also in Holbæk. She was cremated and given a spot in the cemetery. She wrote the words now etched across her own gravestone: Wanted to make the world a better place to live in.

Danes are incredulous about the threats emanating from Washington, and angry. I spoke with former soldiers who said they were preparing to ditch their iPhones and Gmail accounts in favor of European alternatives. This month, officials in Denmark’s third-largest municipality vowed that they would continue funding an annual celebration of Independence Day—believed to be the largest event marking July 4 outside the United States—only if official representatives of the U.S. government were excluded.

I told Boysen, the Danish army chief, about the feeling of betrayal I encountered, especially among families of fallen soldiers. “I do understand that anger,” he said. “But I think we need to ask the president, because he’s the one, I mean …” Boysen trailed off, blowing air through his lips.

Danes have a sophisticated understanding of U.S. politics, and they take pains to separate the president from the rest of the population. Still, their goodwill is not infinite. “I think it would be very difficult to gain support for a U.S.-led mission somewhere abroad today,” says Lennie Fredskov Hansen, a retired brigadier general who served as an adviser to Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former NATO secretary-general, when he was prime minister of Denmark in the 2000s. Hansen told me that he worked closely with the U.S. Marine Corps in Afghanistan, where he felt a sense of “brothers in arms.” He expects that individual Danish and American soldiers may still feel that way. But, he added with a note of understatement, “I’m concerned about how that will develop in the future.”

As for the past, I found that certain attitudes are enduring, including among families of soldiers who died in Afghanistan. They haven’t reconsidered their belief in the international campaign against the Taliban. And they don’t fault the U.S. for the disastrous outcome of the war—violent extremism and human displacement on a mass scale. They regret only that the United States withdrew so hastily in 2021. “I have to think, and I still believe, that the mission was for the best,” says Simon Enig, who had two brothers who went to Afghanistan alongside NATO forces; one, Samuel, never returned. Last Friday was the 15th anniversary of the day he was killed by a roadside bomb. Enig visited his brother’s grave, along with his mother. “We were just quiet together,” he told me.

I asked some of the parents I met if they regretted sending their children to die in an American-led war, now that the American president is disparaging Denmark’s contributions to NATO. Maybe, I put it to them, Denmark shouldn’t have been such a loyal ally to the United States.

“No,” said Malene Ebert, whose son Michael served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and was killed in a firefight north of Gereshk in 2009. “We are in an alliance, so we have to fulfill our obligation.” She also said she discounts Trump’s words, and hopes that American voters will elect different leaders. “I can’t understand,” she said, “why the American people have chosen a person like that.”

But Michael’s father, Nicolai Rasmussen, observed at least one positive effect of Trump’s pressure: Denmark and other European countries spending more on their own defense. “I can understand why he is saying, ‘Hey, it’s your safety. You need to pay what you need to pay,’” Rasmussen, a gardener, told me. “I think that’s fair talk.” Ebert, a secretary, had to agree. “I believe that, too,” she conceded. “But I don’t like it; I don’t like war. I would use resources on peace instead.”

For years, the Danish government followed that approach. In the decades after the Cold War, the country downsized its military and scrapped key weapons systems. More than 20 years ago, Denmark decommissioned its ground-based air- and missile-defense capabilities, and began to rebuild them only last year. In 2024, Denmark pulled out of a major NATO training exercise, scheduled for the following year, because of budget constraints. Its absence was an embarrassment, but the Danish government has pivoted quickly since Trump’s return to the White House. In 2025, it raised defense spending to more than 3 percent of its economic output, the highest in at least half a century.

Denmark has many of the advantages that would be expected of a wealthy, highly educated society, including technical expertise, cybercapabilities, and an elite special-forces corps. Its limitations are also evident. The labor market is tight, so competition for workers is fierce. Certain benefits that might otherwise be dangled as an incentive to enlist, such as health care, are already provided to all Danes by the government. So Denmark is getting creative. Last year, it extended its lottery system for possible military conscription to women, joining just two other European countries, its fellow Scandinavian states of Norway and Sweden, in making mandatory service gender-neutral.

Sophia’s mother mentioned that change to me, saying it would mean more soldiers like her daughter. “It’s a new world,” she said. We stood in front of a collage of photos of Sophia, which her mother assembled a month after her death: Sophia with her younger brother at the airport, preparing to deploy. Sophia through the window of a detached car door in Afghanistan, pretending to drive. “It’s typical Sophia,” her mother said. “She was always making jokes.”

It is a new world, I thought—one in which small countries, like Denmark, that have bound themselves tightly to Washington have a lot to worry about: Russia bearing down on Europe, the United States retreating to the Western Hemisphere, and China flexing its power in Asia. Denmark has been an especially generous donor to Ukraine, so much so that one U.S. official groused to me that the country had left its own cupboard bare. That’s of a piece with Denmark’s military track record. It’s been a capable and accommodating partner in foreign wars. But its capacity to defend itself, not least Europe and the parts of its territory that stretch into North America, is limited. Danes, of course, never imagined they might need to defend themselves against the United States.</div>

            <h2>A Tipping Point in Online Child Abuse</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/ais-child-porn-problem-getting-much-worse/685641/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2025, new data show, the volume of child pornography online was likely larger than at any other point in history. A record 312,030 reports of confirmed child pornography were investigated last year by the Internet Watch Foundation, a U.K.-based organization that works around the globe to identify and remove such material from the web.

This is concerning in and of itself. It means that the overall volume of child porn detected on the internet grew by 7 percent since 2024, when the previous record had been set. But also alarming is the tremendous increase in child porn, and in particular videos, generated by AI. At first blush, the proliferation of AI-generated depictions of child sexual abuse may leave the misimpression that no children were harmed. This is not the case. AI-generated, abusive images and videos feature and victimize real children—either because models were trained on existing child porn, or because AI was used to manipulate real photos and videos.

Today, the IWF reported that it found 3,440 AI-generated videos of child sex abuse in 2025; the year before, it found just 13. Social media, encrypted messaging, and dark-web forums have been fueling a steady rise in child-sexual-abuse material for years, and now generative AI has dramatically exacerbated the problem. Another awful record will very likely be set in 2026.

Of the thousands of AI-generated videos of child sex abuse the IWF discovered in 2025, nearly two-thirds were classified as “Category A”—the most severe category, which includes penetration, sexual torture, and bestiality. Another 30 percent were Category B, which depict nonpenetrative sexual acts. With this relatively new technology, “criminals essentially can have their own child sexual abuse machines to make whatever they want to see,” Kerry Smith, the IWF’s chief executive, said in a statement.

The volume of AI-generated images of child sex abuse has been rising since at least 2023. For instance, the IWF found that over just a one-month span in early 2024, on just a single dark-web forum, users uploaded more than 3,000 AI-generated images of child sex abuse. In early 2025, the digital-safety nonprofit Thorn reported that among a sample of 700-plus U.S. teenagers it surveyed, 12 percent knew someone who had been victimized by “deepfake nudes.” The proliferation of AI-generated videos depicting child sex abuse lagged behind such photos because AI video-generating tools were far less photorealistic than image generators. “When AI videos were not lifelike or sophisticated, offenders were not bothering to make them in any numbers,” Josh Thomas, an IWF spokesperson, told me. That has changed.

Last year, OpenAI released the Sora 2 model, Google released Veo 3, and xAI put out Grok Imagine. Meanwhile, other organizations have produced many highly advanced, open-source AI video-generating models. These open-source tools are generally free for anyone to use and have far fewer, if any, safeguards. There are almost certainly AI-generated videos and images of child sex abuse that authorities will never detect, because they are created and stored on personal computers; instead of having to find and download such material online, potentially exposing oneself to law enforcement, abusers can operate in secrecy.

OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and several other top AI labs have joined an initiative to prevent AI-enabled child sex abuse, and all of the major labs say they have measures in place to stop the use of their tools for such purposes. Still, safeguards can be broken. In the first half of 2025, OpenAI reported more than 75,000 depictions of child sex abuse or child endangerment on its platforms to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, more than double the number of reports from the second half of 2024. A spokesperson for OpenAI told me that the firm designs its products to prohibit creating or distributing “content that exploits or harms children” and takes “action when violations occur.” The company reports all instances of child sex abuse to NCMEC and bans associated accounts. (OpenAI has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic.)

The advancement and ease of use of AI video generators, in other words, offer an entry point for abuse. This dynamic became clear in recent weeks, as people used Grok, Elon Musk’s AI model, to generate likely hundreds of thousands of nonconsensual sexualized images, primarily of women and children, in public on his social-media platform, X. (Musk insisted that he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok” and blamed users for making illegal requests; meanwhile, his employees quietly rolled back aspects of the tool.) While scouring the dark web, the IWF found that, in some cases, people had apparently used Grok to create abusive depictions of 11-to-13-year-old children that were then fed into more permissive tools to generate even darker, more explicit content. “Easy availability of this material will only embolden those with a sexual interest in children” and “fuel its commercialisation,” Smith said in the IWF’s press release. (Yesterday, the X safety team said it had restricted the ability to generate images of users in revealing clothing and that it works with law enforcement “as necessary.”)

There are signs that the crisis of AI-generated child sex abuse will worsen. While more and more nations, including the United Kingdom and the United States, are passing laws that make generating and publishing such material illegal, actually prosecuting criminals is slow. Silicon Valley, meanwhile, continues to move at a breakneck pace.

Any number of new digital technologies have been used to harass and exploit people; the age of AI sex abuse was predictable a decade ago, yet it has begun nonetheless. AI executives, engineers, and pundits are fond of saying that today’s AI models are the least effective they will ever be. By the same token, AI’s ability to abuse children may only get worse from here.</div>

Today, Donald Trump announced that he is considering using the Insurrection Act to send the U.S. military to Minneapolis if state officials do not quell anti-ICE protests there. Deploying federal troops on American soil against the objections of state and local officials is an extreme measure––and seems likelier to inflame than to extinguish unrest there, given that needlessly provocative actions by ICE officers helped create conditions on the ground. Yet the president seems eager to suppress the actions of people he calls “professional agitators and insurrectionists.” For months, members of his administration have laid the rhetorical groundwork for a martial crackdown.

Insurrections are rare in U.S. history, but according to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, we’ve had lots of them just since 2024. In his telling, the perpetrators of recent insurrections against the United States include Joe Biden; the Colorado Supreme Court; U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani; U.S. District Judge Jennifer Thurston; Democrats; protesters in Los Angeles; protesters in Paramount, California; protesters in Compton, California; the city of Los Angeles; U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong; various “radical communist judges”; the Chicago Police Department; a crowd that the Chicago police didn’t stop; an Oregon judge; and “Democrat lawmakers.” (Miller has never called the MAGA movement’s storming of the Capitol an insurrection.)

The rhetorical abuse of insurrection is part of a larger pattern. The president and his allies constantly engage in what we might call threat inflation, giving Americans the impression that they face catastrophe on all sides and that the government therefore must respond maximally. In the administration’s telling, drugs enter America via not smugglers, but “narco-terrorists.” Immigrants never sneak into America; they “invade.” And anti-ICE protesters are “domestic terrorists” and “insurrectionists.” These designations rarely match the reality on the ground. Instead, they stoke fear beyond what reality justifies.

A particularly extreme example occurred just last month: Trump issued an executive order that declared fentanyl “a weapon of mass destruction,” a dubious turn in the history of that term. The phrase weapons of mass destruction was coined by Archbishop Cosmo Gordon Lang after the 1937 bombing of Guernica to anticipate the massively damaging aerial bombings of future conflicts. “Who can think without horror of what another widespread war would mean,” he wrote, “waged as it would be with all the new weapons of mass destruction?”

The term grew only more apt with the advent of the atom bomb, and has been used in recent decades to refer to existential threats to cities or even nations. It had not typically been used to refer to any of the voluntarily ingested substances that kill lots of Americans, such as alcohol, cigarettes, and cocaine—until the Trump administration sought to justify the extrajudicial killing of drug smugglers and perhaps to prepare the public to accept military escalation against various drug cartels.

Nor does the logic of the new use stand up to scrutiny. If the CIA discovered a plot to smuggle a weapon of mass destruction, as that term is understood by most Americans, into the Port of Long Beach, no president would hesitate to shut down the whole West Coast supply chain and search every container until the nerve agent, biological weapon, dirty bomb, or nuclear device was found. Yet if a kilogram of fentanyl, theoretically enough for 500,000 overdoses, were in a container ship, the U.S. government would not shut down a major port to find it. Tens of thousands of pounds of fentanyl are smuggled into the U.S. every year.

Clear thinking requires us to distinguish between the existential emergency posed by weapons of mass murder and substances that cause many deaths accumulated slowly over time, as more and more people use them. And the Trump administration would most likely reject applying its own logic consistently. For example, if a news organization waited for fentanyl shipments to arrive in a bunch of U.S. cities and then led a prime-time broadcast with the storyline Trump and his national-security team failed to stop WMD attacks on at least 20 American cities last month, the White House would rightly argue that the outlet was misleading and manipulating its viewers.

The American public is similarly misled each time Trump or members of his team erroneously assert that the country confronts a superlative threat. Terrorism is another word the administration likes to throw around—a particularly ironic threat to exaggerate, in that the intention is to stoke more public fear to achieve political goals. After the ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis, Americans spent days watching and arguing about videos of the incident. Reasonable people disagreed about how to apportion blame. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem could have waited for an investigation before commenting; if she chose to speak, she could simply have argued that the woman who was killed gave the officer in front of her car reason to fear for his life. Instead, she not only presumed to know the motive of the woman who was killed; she also attributed to her the most malign motive possible. “What happened in Minneapolis was an act of domestic terrorism,” Noem declared. Vice President Vance has bizarrely called the incident “classic terrorism.”

The absurdity of Vance’s designation is most evident if, as David French suggested in the The New York Times recently, you compare videos from Minneapolis with actual terrorist attacks. “Many of us have seen footage, for example, of the horrific ramming attack in Nice, France, in 2016 that killed 86 people—or of the domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, Va., the following year, where a white supremacist drove directly into a crowd of ‘Unite the Right’ counterprotesters, killing a woman, Heather D. Heyer, and injuring dozens of others,” French wrote. “In both cases, the murderous intentions of the men driving the vehicles—deploying them as weapons—were unmistakable.”

Trump does not lack the capacity for understatement. In February 2020, at the beginning of a pandemic that would kill more than 1 million Americans, he said, “One day—it’s like a miracle—it will disappear. And from our shores, we—you know, it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We’ll see what happens. Nobody really knows.” That’s how Trump talks when he wants the country to keep its cool.

Confronted with far less deadly threats in his second term, Trump and his allies inflate them daily. They do so to push policies that overreact to the country’s challenges rather than carefully calibrated responses. In the process, their rhetoric fuels the polarization that makes political violence and civic instability more likely. There is less to fear from reality than from the administration’s fearmongering itself.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Will Google Ever Have to Pay for Its Sins?

If the story of journalism’s 21st-century decline were purely a tale of technological disruption—of print dinosaurs failing to adapt to the internet—that would be painful enough for those of us who believe in the importance of a robust free press. The truth hurts even more. Big Tech platforms didn’t just out-compete media organizations for the bulk of the advertising-revenue pie. They also cheated them out of much of what was left over, and got away with it.

Read. Margaret C. Anderson was at the center of a notorious literary-obscenity trial, Sophia Stewart writes. Then she was forgotten.

is this refering to power supply? like electrical lines? or generators/motors? wouldn&#39;t it be better to invest in something needed for nuclear powerplant? that&#39;s my understanding from playing SimCity on SNES.

so the summary refers to data center components, looking up scrap ram recycling prices, there&#39;s not much copper in them.

Don&#39;t nuclear power plants use copper wire?

Nuclear power is too expensive and can&#39;t survive without subsidies. You&#39;re probably going to spend $30-40 billion and get one built in a decade.

Nuclear plants require a 8-10 build-out. They wouldn&#39;t be ready in time for your basic ADHD--addled Chief Widget who will have a heart attack if its company is left behind in the Great AI Stampede.

It makes me want to vomit, the way the United States and the United Kingdom have ceded production of raw materials to China and other countries.

We had trouble with copper until this one mine dared start up again.

England can&#39;t even refine iron ore into steel anymore.

Listen up, cupcakes:  A country that can&#39;t work it&#39;s own raw materials will be subjugated by those who do.

Here endeth the lesson on national sovereignty.

Nothing wrong with international trades. Look at the spice trade that has been going on since ancient times.

Listen up cupcake, destroying your country&#39;s environment means your country isn&#39;t worth living in in order to use the metals for which you seem to have a woodie.

The biggest data centers each require tens of thousands of metric tons of copper for all the wires, busbars, circuit boards, transformers and other electrical components housed there.No, they do not, circuit boards aside. Wires, bus bars, and transformers (which are just a bunch of wire and a core) can all be made of aluminum. They then have to be bigger, but aluminum is cheaper than copper. You have to use AlOx paste where you join aluminum to some other metal, but it&#39;s readily available. Don&#39;t gaslight us.

This makes no sense - Amazon is giving a mining company commute services and cash to secure raw copper, which it will in turn hand off to wire/cable manufacturers in exchange for finished cabling to wire future data centers? This is crazy. I think it&#39;s more likely just an investment intended to increase supply and drive down costs - I can&#39;t believe Amazon actually want raw copper.

On one hand, I agree that it sounds bananas. But on the other, maybe it does make sense. We all know that if done well vertical integration has numerous benefits including cost. For example Brembo owns practically everything they depend on — When you buy brake products from Brembo they are made from ore that companies they own mined and refined and they come in boxes made in their own paper product plant. If Amazon is buying the raw materials and passing them on at cost, then they&#39;re saving the costs

It does not require that much copper.  The calculation is incorrect.

Amazon doesn&#39;t make wire, bus bars, or even circuit boards. Though the latter is a close call.

Since Amazon manufactures none of these things, I can&#39;t help but wonder what their true reason for acquiring the copper supply is. Is it to get in to selling commodities? Is it to control raw materials to their suppliers for a cost benefit, or even a competitive advantage?

I&#39;d really love to know who actually makes these decisions, to buy copper or invest in power generation, and what their thinking is. That Amazon

As a viewer, we got Rogue 1, Andor, and Last Jedi. She seems to have done her best to avoid giving us more of that - more shows for adults, not focused on selling toys. So I&#39;m not going be too upset over her departure.

For me, Star Wars is still only the original trilogy (the reworked fan edit being the best releasse).Everything else that came after more or less doesn&#39;t fit well with those movies.

Though I don’t have much hope for improvement; Dave Filoni seems little better.

I enjoy different takes on things, different types of story in the same universe. It&#39;s a shame more people didn&#39;t watch Andor, or didn&#39;t understand it.

I&#39;d burn the entire back catalogue for another Andor.

Every single movie should have generated a billion+ in profit.  This is Star Wars.  The audience was huge, global, and insanely loyal.

She destroyed the property.  I didn&#39;t bother to see most of them after the shock of his horrible the first ones under her hand were.

Most of the tv shows were crap too.  Sticking a baby muppet in wasn&#39;t enough and that was the highlight of her era.

I saw Star Wars the day it came out. I have the originals on VHS, DVD, Blu-ray. (Han did fire first, BTW)

While I remember dialogue from the original trilogy, and I vaguely know the plot lines of the prequels, I have absolutely no idea what happens in the last three episodes of the series. It&#39;s a blank.

&quot;Under Kennedy&#39;s stewardship, Lucasfilm amassed more than $5.6 billion in box office&quot;

On the face of it, you&#39;d say yes, she was quite good at what she did...

But if we account for how many billion dollar blockbusters there were in the last decade compared to the 1970s... I would say the scale has changed fundamentally. So yeah, she was profitable, sure... but... How profitable could it have been?

As far as I am aware, the Disney theme parks are struggling and merchandise was extremely disappointing on Star Wars in general under her reign. And that is an interesting factor, considering how much merchandise took off with the original films.

One wonders how much the cultural pressure of Star Wars had to do with the numbers not sucking because from where I stand, the media products released under Disney&#39;s Star Wars were mediocre at best.

Disney paid 4.5 billions for Lucas film, and the 5.3 billions is the box office figure, not what went into Disney&#39;s coffers (half of it, maybe ? No idea, really). And that&#39;s not factoring in the cost of production and promotion (and I&#39;m pretty sure that apart from the Mandalorian, none of the series has broken even, nevermind turning in a profit).

Actually, that&#39;s even worse than I imagined. I know there were special clauses in her contract, but how Disney&#39;s execs could have let such

Ah, you&#39;re right, I didn&#39;t think it through. The 5.8 billion wasn&#39;t profit.

Yes, I read that the cinemas take about 50% of the box office and lets not forget that they do not include marketing in production cost. That&#39;s usuall 30 to 50% on top of production cost.

As for why people are allowed to operate like that I have no idea. I am GenX/Millennial. I grew up being told that to a CEO shareholders are akin to God and that shareholders are unfeeling ultracapitalists that would eradicate earths population if th

But that right there is my point... did they think they could make the DEI stuff rain profit? And why were they ready to wait for it for that long?

Vanguard is the largest stockholder of Blackrock at over 8% that isn&#39;t part of the &quot;others&quot; slice.

But Blackrock sure as hell IS a publicly traded company with a LOT of different interests... Why were they allowed to burn that money? Why is Fink still CEO? He holds less than a half percent in stock.

It&#39;s a matter of perspectiveCome on! &quot;From a certain point of view&quot; was right there!

Come on! &quot;From a certain point of view&quot; was right there!

I know what I like and everyone can have a different opinion.

Say what you like about originals / sequels / prequels / TV versions etc. but I enjoyed Rogue One.

I&#39;m still waiting for them to make an equally enjoyable Rogue Two.

What blows my mind is a company that large can invest that amount of money in a &quot;trilogy&quot; without any kind of plot line or story to to map out three films. Especially when the plan is to have three entirely different directors for the films.

The latest/last trilogy started out fairly strong but went downhill from there.

Force Awakens was a well made and directed movie that was too safe and little more than a remake of Star Wars.Last Jedi at least dared to try something new and was enjoyable enough to watch in theatres but it just didn&#39;t treat the characters well and didn&#39;t work as the second part of a trilogy - throw everything away and replace it with almost nothing is not a good idea.Rise of Skywalker was a shitshow, exhausting to watch and ju

Reading about US stories, especially about policy changes and other government actions, reminds me of the &quot;Florida man&quot; stories... &quot;What on earth have they done again?&quot; ...

I love the bit about coal-powered data centers, given the impact of burning coal and the ever-growing need for data centers, that&#39;s match made in heaven.

Why would higher prices on natgas increase carbon dioxide emissions?

Even if people chose coal as an alternative, there are only so many scenarios where that would be possible.  Customers bound to natgas (particularly consumer-level users, of whom there are many) only have the choice of turning down the heat/using less hot water.  In general, higher energy prices means less energy used which means less carbon emitted.

I don&#39;t know but I&#39;d guess that it makes other CO2 intensive generation more attractive.

Ultimately, the majority of fossil fuel generation is doomed, renewables are now comfortably cheaper by pretty much any metric unless you put a very high value on 100% availability.

For a long while the west will probably need a rump of fossil generation because our entire system is built around 100% reliable grid power at any load. It will likely be the developing world that will get there first as they don&#39;t already hav

I&#39;m still waiting on actual price comparisons between natgas and solar/wind + storage.  Seems like every market that fully embraces renewables experiences high electrical prices despite continued assurances that renewables are cheap.

The USA actually had an increase in the price of natural gas due to Russia invading Ukraine, which caused the embargo on Russian oil and natural gas, so a lot of the oil and natural gas produced in the USA is now going to Europe when previously it would have stayed in the USA.   But, we have Moscow Mitch McConnell who WANTS coal to be used, because his third world state is a coal producer, and we have Trump who is against anything that might produce clean energy because his demented mind thinks that it&#39;s ba

I&#39;m not sure that even starting a war with Europe will be enough to get rid of Trump.

Hmm why would anyone blame Trump for going all in on coal making the problem worse...I guess we&#39;ll never know.

Remind us all again which team is trying to ban windmills?

I honestly don&#39;t think Trump&#39;s policy has much to do with it at all.  The big drop from 2005-20[12][1-4] has everything to do with around 1998 being when people started taking carbon reduction seriously.  That period saw a lot of the low hanging fruit and low costs to address emissions sources handled.  You continue to see improvements in the 2020-2024 range due to massive economic contraction related to covid policy.

Nobody wants to pollute, generally speaking more carbon emissions means more energy from no

Who knew that kneecapping the EPA would lead to more pollution?  That gay woke agency created by (checks notes) Richard Nixon?

Stopped reading right there. That&#39;s no &quot;study&quot;, but a speculation based on fantasies.

And yeah, yeah, I know &quot;psychologists&quot; can reliably understand and classify my &quot;psyche&quot; by asking me clever questions.

That Freud portrait out front should have told you so much.

This is the only take worth reading here. Everyone else is just injecting their own opinion. &quot;self reported&quot; is tantamount to completely useless, and any decent researcher is fully aware of this. May as well have titled the study &quot;teens underestimate / lie about screen time&quot;.

The same issue is why most &quot;studies&quot; about diet and weight loss are also useless. People aren&#39;t lab rats.

Gaming and social media use are two completely different things.

Kids are resilient, it&#39;s the adults that can&#39;t handle social media.

i remember quite a few of these “panics”: backwards masking, stranger danger, poisoned halloween candy, dungeons & dragons, rap music, video games the list goes on.

all of them had something in common, which was rabid media outlets with a hot-button issue that drove readers/viewers with a mix of politician grandstanding.

Don&#39;t forget violent video games and He-Man action figures and comic books and Penny dreadfuls. Given the evolution of GTA and politicians dropping f-bombs, some hot button issues clearly became less of a priority.  That said, the hell did my He-Man action figure ever do to some 80s Karen?

Does anyone here have any specimens of adolescents that don&#39;t look like mental cases?

Read the study, the details are there.  We talk all the time on /. about correlation VS causation.

It clearly shows depression, anxiety, and other mental health concerns. They exist and aren&#39;t the point of the study.

With a respectable sample size it
shows that the time spent is not the cause.  In the analysis section it discusses how symptoms of depression and anxiety include withdrawal. Depressed people use it more, but it&#39;s true regardless of the amount they used it. Increas

Simply: usage time is not the cause. Depressed kids do withdraw more, but time spent in games and social media are not the cause behind the depression. More time, average time, less time, and heavily restricted time made no difference.Less time?  How about cutting them off cold turkey?  How about deleting all their accounts and content and THEN studying the mental response?Did the study dare to prove or ask the more relevant problem regarding pure addiction rather than focusing solely on one type of behavioral response?  This is like watching a show focusing on Vegas junkies addicted to pulling slot machine arms for hours a day, but only showing when they lose money instead of showing them losing their cars, homes, families, and sanity.

I can make numbers dance to any tune, too. But that don&#39;t make it true.

Clearly if you have mental issues, you are likely to have fewer real life friends and also have a greater need for socialization.

The basic problem with most of these type of studies is the desire for a simple fix and the fear of the new tend to make the uneducated reverse cause and effect.

If you want to blame something you think is associated with a problem, chances are it is a symptom/attempt to treat that problem.

This is retarded.  The hypothesis has never been that on an individual level, more social media time = more problems.

Here&#39;s what I think:  Most of the intense harm comes in very small lumps.  These harmful lumps might come in a sea of banal harmless usage, or they might be nearly the entire usage some people have.  There is no reason to think that the volume of usage for a given person would correlate with their personal level of harm.

On the other hand, the ubiquity and unavoidability of social media use in

Could we have a study on how much the current sociology and economic environment in the real world is causing teen mental health problems?

Apparently &#39;they&#39; need a study to hammer them with the truly obvious.

&quot;Aw, you can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. 14% of all people know that..&quot; from the episode &quot;Homer the Vigilante,&quot; https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com].

And the &quot;study&quot; does not define what is &quot;weak&quot; just like other studies and &quot; is not _good_ for you&quot; or when the tobacco industry study that showed the elderly benefited from smoking. As they were more likely to be dead and beyond caring...so avoided the issues with geriatrics; the later part was not highlighted.

So, the “experts” have concluded there’s little evidence to suggest social media affects a teens mental health?  OK, let’s prove that theory then.

Gather those experts and lock them in the same room with a couple dozen nothing-to-see-here teens who are forced to give up The Cellular Precious before they got locked in the same room.

After a couple of days, let’s see what the experts have to say about mental health.

Then tell them you’ve deleted all their social media accounts

So, the “experts” have concluded there’s little evidence to suggest social media affects a teens mental health? OK, let’s prove that theory then.Actually, no, they haven&#39;t. The study was only about screen time. By the words of the researcher himself:&quot;(...) our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems -- the story is far more complex than that.&quot;

Before you dismiss this study, pay attention that it is very basic science trying to access specifically the effect of screen time on kids.

&quot;We know families are worried, but our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems -- the story is far more complex than that.&quot;No, it didn&#39;t say that social media is harmless or it doesn&#39;t affect children. It only inferred that screen time alone doesn&#39;t. As with any basic science study, more research is needed to try and understand the subject in full.

Trump has been President for a year. What the fuck have you been doing?

Nah, they built those at the beginning of Trump&#39;s first term. Then when they realized they didn&#39;t need them they rented them to all the migrants suddenly coming in. They&#39;ll soon be vacant again for their intended use.

If you mean &quot;the surge&quot; a few years ago, that&#39;s Don&#39;s own doing: Don advertised them to come, saying &quot;Joe will just let you in&quot;. The world watches Trump on TV also, that fucking oddball is entertaining. But Joe&#39;s border policy wasn&#39;t notably different from prior Presidents such that blaming Joe for the spike doesn&#39;t add up.

Nah, this is a long time obsession with billionaires and likely the idea came from the top.  I had a whole book long ago, before Trump was involved by an expert who consulted with the wealthy wanting to plan their survival ... maintenance of their wealth if everything collapses; and perhaps they were aware of the upcoming housing collapse which could have created a great depression... or other factors.

The problem with all their ideas as the expert pointed out; they needed staff to lord over which maintained

I am in the passenger seat of a stranger’s car in Minneapolis, four days after Renee Nicole Good was killed here. I’m riding with someone who was doing the same kind of work we think Good was doing when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot her. Right now, our work is much quieter. We’re driving in loose loops when a volunteer who is patrolling the streets as a pedestrian observer on the Signal call we’re listening to—a broad network of thousands of locals relaying up-to-the-moment intel on ICE activity—reports two vehicles near Karmel Mall, known locally as “Somali Mall.” Another volunteer fulfilling the role of dispatcher, also on the call, identifies them by make and model. Another observer cross-references the license plates against a running database. They’re confirmed as ICE vehicles, unmarked like they almost always are.

My guide for the day, who I’ll call C, sits up. “They’re going to come past us right here,” they say, accelerating toward the intersection.

Within seconds we spot them: two SUVs moving faster than the flow of traffic. Through their windows, I can see silhouettes of men with heavy Kevlar high on the neck, faces covered, sunglasses.

C begins calling out every turn, street, and direction the SUVs take—while laying on their car horn hard and continuously, like an alarm. The sound is constant and blunt. It could easily be mistaken for an expression of anger, but watching how others in the area—pedestrians, other drivers—react, it’s a signal: a warning to anyone within earshot that ICE is moving through the neighborhood. It turns what ICE hoped would be a discreet operation into a public event. One pedestrian we pass hears the horn, turns, and gives the ICE vehicles the finger.

The SUVs accelerate. We follow closely, C still honking, still relaying their movements. Then they turn onto a familiar street.

“This is my street,” C says. Their posture changes. They look at me. “Can you record this?”

At the next stop sign, the vehicles split. One SUV pauses, blocking our path, allowing the other to pull away, surging into the intersection, cutting ahead of an uninvolved civilian car, using it as a moving barrier. If C had chased through, we would have been hit broadside: “They have absolutely no respect for traffic laws.” That first SUV is gone.

“They sometimes travel in pairs,” C tells me. “You can’t follow both. They’ll break and try to shake anyone observing.”

The remaining ICE vehicle, a Wagoneer, continues through the block. C keeps honking, keeps calling turns. We circle again. “They’re letting me pass my house again,” they report into Signal.

Then: “They’re stopped in front of my house.”

The first thing I noticed when I got to Minneapolis last weekend was the new language. For example: The work C was doing has a name—“commuting”—a deliberately mundane term for pursuing, tailing, and deliberately irritating ICE agents moving through the city in unmarked cars.

As C scans windshields, front seats, and license plates, they tell me about a recent incident near their home. “Three blocks from my house, an unmarked vehicle with four agents in it roll up and just grab a guy off the sidewalk who was walking,” they said. “They violently shoved him into their car.” Their voice trembles as they describe the incident, one they managed to film, hoping that footage might be useful later. “They just snatched him.”

That verb—snatched—is another example of the new language. So is “abduction.” Both are meant to describe the force, speed, and chaos with which ICE is removing people from their city. People are taken before anyone nearby understands what’s happening.

It’s a mistake to think that this transformation started after Good’s killing. The ICE raids intensified in Minneapolis in early December, and the Signal network C volunteers in has been active since then. Minneapolis had already been in an ongoing battle between ICE and the local residents for months when Good was killed.

Her death also occurred just a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police in 2020, an area now dubbed George Floyd Square. The past five years taught this city what it looks like when official accounts collide with video evidence, with witness testimony, with what residents say they watched happen with their own eyes. People I met kept describing this as a reason the infrastructure exists at all: not as a guarantee of safety, but as a way to create a record.

Now, in this frozen tundra of a city, in a state best known for its enduring Midwestern niceness, residents of Minnesota are doubling down.

Since Dec. 1, growth in these networks had been steady. After Renee Good was killed, it exploded. Volunteer residents told me that up until the shooting, roughly 20 people would join every day. Now, it’s hundreds.

I came to Minneapolis to understand what it looks like when a city organizes not around a single protest or flashpoint, but around a daily pattern of federal enforcement that residents describe as their new normal. People kept telling me the same thing: The city has a new infrastructure now, mostly invisible unless you’re inside it. C offered to show me what that looks like in real time.

“When I started in early December,” C tells me, “it was not at all guaranteed to see an ICE agent during patrols.” They pause. “Now I see anywhere from one to upwards of 20 if I’m out for even an hour.”

That morning, C picked me up near the intersection where Good was shot and killed. Like George Floyd Square, the response here had been immediate and spatial. In the first days after her death, neighbors used debris to block the roads, closing the intersection in every direction. For a brief window, the intersection functioned the way so many Minneapolis corners have learned to function: part memorial, part staging ground—an assertion that something had happened here and could not simply be folded back into normal traffic patterns.

By the time I arrived on Saturday morning, the barricades were gone. Traffic had resumed. The memorial had been compressed into the parking lane of the one-way street, clustered near where Good’s SUV had crashed into a parked car. Flowers lined the curb. Candles flickered in the cold. Handwritten signs were fixed to fences and utility poles. The street felt reopened but not reset.

Nearby, a small group of friends arrived together, standing shoulder to shoulder as they took in the memorial. One of them, Kylie, told me she’s still in shock. “On our way here, we watched ICE take somebody from their home. Like 30 minutes ago. They broke her window and took her out of her house.”

That mourners could witness such actions so close to the scene of Good’s death is as useful an indication as any about how things are going in Minneapolis. By most accounts, tensions have only continued to ratchet higher. I flew home on Monday, and on Wednesday another altercation between ICE, a Venezuelan man, and two civilians attempting to prevent the agents from arresting the man resulted in ICE shooting the man they were attempting to arrest in the leg. The two civilians were reportedly “armed” with a snow shovel and a broom, and the incident is being held up as the reason Donald Trump is now floating using the Insurrection Act to enter the city. Meanwhile, Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general, told residents to continue to report possible violations of constitutional rights and other incidents involving federal law enforcement to his office. People I spoke to described the escalation as cause to organize even harder.

That effort continues to be diffuse. The way anonymity is central to how this work functions makes it hard to know specifically who Good was collaborating with when she was killed. The volunteer network is also extremely local and largely homegrown, built by neighbors organizing block by block with the families who live next door. Their stores said a lot about how someone like Good may have gotten involved.

Nick is a local father in South Minneapolis. He’s also an admin in one of the neighborhood-level Signal networks that routes ICE sightings into local response. He told me that he got involved around Dec. 1, when ICE activity in his area started to feel constant. “That was the day that it really sort of got out of hand,” he told me. That day, he said, a neighbor was taken. Then ICE returned. Then they returned again. “When they came back for a third time, we were organized. We were out there watching, whistling. … It’s been like that ever since.”

He ended up on the helm of his particular neighborhood’s efforts largely by default. “I guess I’m very online,” he told me. “I know how to do some technical stuff. So I just kind of took over as one of the admins.” His chat has become an invaluable tool for locals who want to track and observe ICE. Volunteers cross-check license plates against a database of confirmed ICE vehicles, dispatchers track ICE activity, observers patrolling on foot or in vehicles give up-to-the-moment information of ICE whereabouts. He wanted one thing understood immediately: This is not a professional operation. “It is just ordinary people that are doing this,” he said. “This isn’t fun. It’s middle-aged parents who would rather be playing with their kids at home.”

Nick also wasn’t keen on comparing this moment to how he experienced the uprising that followed the killing of George Floyd. He said the two are different in that that was a single instance, and now they see videos of inhumane treatment and police brutality dozens of times a day in their neighborhoods.

Back in the car with C, as we drive in more slow loops, they give me a tour of the city they call home, and clearly love. But in almost in the same breath, they point out places that have become markers in this new geography of enforcement.

“That fish-and-chicken spot,” they say, gesturing, “that’s where [ICE] were initially staging.”

The Signal call runs constantly in the background. The cadence of volunteers is efficient and clipped. C describes what they look for: SUVs and pickups parked in alleys; heavily tinted windows; out-of-state plates; erratic driving; the outline of tactical vests and sunglasses. It has become reflexive, they say, to glance into nearly every vehicle.

Even while so much of the action seems like it is being done car-to-car, people kept telling me the system is bigger than patrols. Volunteers are doing everything they can to keep vulnerable residents from having to be anywhere ICE might be. This means doing things like getting anyone who is trying to avoid ICE’s scrutiny rides, child care, groceries. To understand this part of the work, people told me, I should talk to Anna, who is running one such effort called Neighbors Helping Neighbors.

Anna talked the way people do when they’ve been in crisis mode for too long: fast, specific, typing into her phone without interrupting. In her telling, the last two months didn’t introduce a new fear so much as spread it—turning what many immigrant neighbors have lived with for years into a shared civic atmosphere.

Her days now revolve around a simple system: a form for volunteers, another form for neighbors asking for help. “On average, I would say a week ago we were getting three to five a day,” she said. “Last night from 3 p.m. to this morning we’ve received 51.” The requests were spreading outward into the suburbs—“Farmington … Roseville, Inver Grove Heights, Eden Prairie”—and it’s still intensifying.

When I asked where Neighbors Helping Neighbors came from, she described it as improvised and immediate: “We just started brainstorming and I literally just created a Google form and we just shared it on social media and now it has just become a thing.” It stayed informal even as it grew. “People are like, ‘Who can I Venmo?’ ” she said. “And I’m like, ‘You can Venmo me.’ ” Someone would send her a receipt, and she’d reimburse them. “I don’t know who they are,” she said. “And I’m just Venmoing them.”

She talked about it as mutual aid built in real time, held together by trust and speed, and by a kind of local reflex that Minnesota has rehearsed in smaller ways for years—neighbors pushing each other out of snowdrifts, shoveling sidewalks, checking in. “You have to know your neighbors,” she said. “You need to know their names.”

Neighbors are showing up in droves. Organizers told me their Signal chats were maxing out. Trainings are full. Food pantries were being inundated. And even after the horror of Good’s killing, the new volunteers weren’t seasoned activists, they were regular people who finally reached a point where doing nothing felt worse than the risks of doing something.

Jordan Castillo attended his first training at a church in South Minneapolis on the same day Renee Good was killed. He arrived already unsettled. He remembers murmuring “Holy shit” when he got to the packed parking lot. Inside, he estimated there were “probably about 700 people.” He stopped when he walked in. “I was like, whoa. This is a moment. Like, this is history.”

But Good’s killing isn’t the only thing pulling people in—many volunteers are coming to this work after seeing ICE in their own neighborhoods. When I met Burt Muston in a park near his home, he pointed to the local market he described as “a neighborhood staple.” Two people were taken by ICE here. The market closed afterward. “They’ve been closed ever since.” That was the tipping point for him, he said.

Muston is a large white man, and with his beard and dark sunglasses, he could be mistaken for an ICE agent himself. He saw this as an advantage. “As, like, a big white dude … other than if they want to say I’m obstructing justice, they’re not going to really fuck with me,” he told me.

That doesn’t mean he doesn’t take the risks seriously—he referenced footage where an ICE agent told an observer, “Have you not learned your lesson when we kill that lesbian bitch?” He had already made contingency plans. “I’ve actually set up, if I do get detained or something like that, people to come grab my dog to take care of,” he said. Then he waved it off: “I’ll just cross that bridge if I come to it.”

I spoke to another volunteer, who I’ll call M, in a coffee shop at 7 a.m., just before she headed to another shift as a “commuter.” Responding to ICE-watch calls has become part of her routine—she’s been doing it before work, after getting training months ago. “I’m just getting out of bed in the morning and thinking, Maybe I should wake up earlier. Maybe I should leave the house at 6 a.m. so that I can help make sure that there are eyes on the road, eyes on the bus stop or by the schools.”

But the watching goes both ways. As I sit in the car with C after the second ICE vehicle sped off, the remaining Wagoneer idles midblock—right in front of C’s house. The message C took from it was simple: “We know where you live.” C keeps the horn down and raises a middle finger toward the windshield.

Moments later, the Wagoneer accelerates away on an icy stretch, blowing through a row of intersections with stop signs. C follows cautiously, choosing to stop instead, letting the distance span. The Wagoneer disappears. C scans mirrors, side streets, cross traffic. “I think we lost them,” they say.

“I lost it at the light,” they report to the group call. “If anyone’s further east on 31st past I-35 and can get eyes on it …” No one does.

After federal agents killed an unarmed American citizen in broad daylight last week, high-ranking government officials rushed to defend the shooter, framed a mother’s attempt to escape an escalating confrontation as “domestic terrorism,” and blamed the victim for her own death. The killing of Renee Good is not just a failure of policing—the public response by those in power should alarm every American who believes that being frightened by armed agents and trying to drive away should not be a capital offense. Indeed, recent Supreme Court precedent illuminates why the shooting of Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross is not the case of self-defense that administration officials are suggesting. The totality of events—which has been the standard established by the court since 1989 and was reaffirmed just last year—suggests that it was not reasonable for Ross to shoot Good in the head as she was attempting to drive away from ICE agents trying to forcibly remove her from her car.

Last week, Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a white mother of three, while she was in her SUV, apparently attempting to leave a situation that was becoming increasingly hostile. In cellphone video of the incident, we can see two ICE agents exit a pickup truck and approach Good’s car. As one agent appears to reach through the driver’s open window and tries to open the door, Good slowly reverses, then turns towards the right and drives forward slowly, attempting to leave. At that moment, a third officer, who is standing in front of Good’s car, unholsters his gun and, while moving to the side of the vehicle, fires several shots inside, striking Good in the head. The car continues to move forward and crashes into a parked car. Good was pronounced dead shortly after.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the agent who shot Good, saying, “This was an act of domestic terrorism. ICE officers got stuck in the snow and were attempting to push out their vehicle when a woman attacked them.” President Donald Trump also weighed in immediately after the killing, writing on Truth Social, “The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.” None of the videos that have emerged from the shooting show Good running over the agent or attacking agents prior to her death.

Good was a U.S. citizen, and DHS has stated she was not a target of an ICE investigation. She was shot just blocks from her home.

Another video of the incident follows what happened before the agents approached Good’s SUV. In the video, Good extends her arm from the open driver’s window and makes the “Go ahead” signal to a pickup truck that has just pulled up and stopped a few feet from her car, right before ICE agents exited the vehicle. The footage suggests that Good was not attempting to block agents with her car, as some have claimed.

A third video, taken from the cellphone of the agent who shot Good, features a smiling Good, with her car window rolled down, saying, “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you.” It also shows a woman, later identified as Becca Good, Good’s wife, outside the car, filming the ICE agent. As the agent is filming the license plate of their car, Becca says, “That’s OK, we don’t change our plates every morning, just so you know. It’ll be the same plate when you come talk to us later.” A few seconds later, two agents approach the SUV, one trying to open the driver’s-side door, while yelling, “Get out of the fucking car!” Possibly frightened at what appears to be a hostile situation, Good puts the car in reverse, then drives forward. The camera suddenly points towards the sky, and we hear a thud. Three shots ring out, one immediately after the other. After that, we hear a male voice saying, “Fucking bitch.”

The government has claimed that the agent who shot Good was in fear for his life and was acting in self-defense. The videos illustrate something else: an avoidable tragedy. Again, recent Supreme Court precedent helps explain why.

In assessing whether a law enforcement agent’s use of deadly force was reasonable or excessive, the court this past summer rejected the 5th Circuit’s narrow “moment of threat” doctrine—which stated that the only thing that matters in determining whether an officer reasonably fears for their life in a use-of-force situation is the moment of the shooting itself—as inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment. The court, in Barnes v. Felix, rejected this narrow time-framing approach and repeated what it had held in Graham v. Connor: In assessing the reasonableness of an officer’s use of force, one must consider the totality of circumstances.

Many of those defending the shooting appear to be focusing on the moment just before he fired the first shot. Applying a moment-of-threat approach to this shooting would require one to freeze-frame the video at the moment the officer was standing in front of Good’s car and saw it inching forward. Under such a cramped view of the incident, one might conclude that in that moment, the officer feared for his life and therefore needed to shoot to defend himself.

In contrast, if we broaden the time frame and consider that the agent put himself in front of the vehicle, that a smiling Good had, seconds earlier, told the agent, “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you” and started to move her car forward only after other agents approached her vehicle, with one reaching in through the open window, trying to open the driver’s side door, and screaming for her to get out of the “fucking car,” the claim that the agent needed to shoot Good to save his life seems less plausible. That the agent was able to stay on his two feet, move to the side of the car, and fire two shots into the open driver’s-side window as Good was turning the SUV to the right and trying to drive away further undermines the claim that he acted in self-defense to neutralize an imminent threat to his life. The videos suggest that Good was simply trying to leave what was becoming an increasingly hostile situation, not purposely trying to hit the ICE agent who had dangerously put himself in front of her car.

One question the court left open in Barnes was whether it is appropriate to consider prior conduct of law enforcement that increases the risk of an encounter with a civilian turning deadly—something many have called “officer-created jeopardy.” It seems obvious that if one is applying a totality-of-the-circumstances approach, then prior conduct of law enforcement that increases the risk that the encounter will turn deadly is just part of the totality of the circumstances and ought to be part of the inquiry.

Some have pointed out that putting oneself in front of a moving vehicle is not considered a wise police practice. Similarly, shooting into a moving vehicle is not considered a good police practice unless necessary to stop an armed or dangerous felon (neither of which accurately describes Good), because of the risk of injury to the occupant of the vehicle and nearby bystanders. Although the first shot appears to have gone through the car’s front windshield, the second and third shots seem to have been fired by the agent at Good’s head through the open driver’s-side window as she was trying to leave. The officer by that time was firing from the side of the vehicle, not shooting someone trying to run him over as has been claimed. If he simply wanted to stop the vehicle from escaping, why did he aim at the driver’s head rather than the tires of the SUV?

In discussing the shooting, Noem said, “Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that, in this situation, it was preventable,” suggesting it was Good’s own fault that she had been shot. Similarly, Vice President J.D. Vance has said that Good’s death was “a tragedy of her own making.” With these comments, Noem, Vance, and others defending the officer posit that if Good had simply followed orders and gotten out of the car, none of this would have happened.

Ironically, Good’s death was completely preventable, not because Good failed to comply with the order to exit her car but because the officer could have exercised restraint and refrained from shooting her. He had taken a video of her license plate number, so if the agency wanted to track her down, it could have done so later. When the agent fired two shots into the open driver’s-side window from the side of Good’s car, Good was not posing an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to him or any other agent. Good was not a violent felon trying to flee the scene of a crime. She was just trying to get home to her three kids in one piece.

As the Supreme Court has finally moved toward looking at the merits of President Donald Trump’s attempts to end birthright citizenship, the famous Wong Kim Ark case of 1898 has loomed particularly large.* While that precedent certainly bolsters the case for striking down Trump’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, there is an often-ignored series of cases from much more recently that speak even more directly to the issues in this case. That story of 120,000 Americans stripped of their citizenship by the federal government, between 1946 and 1967, led ultimately to a unanimous Supreme Court conclusion that being born in the United States from foreign parents, documented or not, makes you American. These forgotten cases light the path to the current court decision on birthright citizenship this spring.

Just after World War II, the U.S. government started to implement the provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940 that allowed the federal government to deprive Americans—native-born and naturalized alike—of their citizenship for reasons like voting in a foreign election, joining a foreign army, remaining for six months or longer within any foreign state of which they or either of their parents have been a national, or for evading the draft. Starting in 1945 and continuing until 1967, between 1,000 and 8,000 Americans were stripped of their nationality each year. This practice only ended when the Supreme Court declared these provisions unconstitutional in the 1967 case Afroyim v. Rusk.

Of those stripped of citizenship before that ruling—totaling more than 120,000—a majority were native-born. Some of those affected challenged their loss of citizenship by appealing to the courts. Nine such cases reached the Supreme Court between 1955 and 1967. These cases were among the court’s most divisive, each spurring a fierce debate between opposing camps of justices. Most cases went 5 to 4 with majorities shifting successively on each side. One camp, which included Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice Hugo Black, was willing to declare denationalization unconstitutional. An opposing camp, led by Justice Felix Frankfurter, supported the right of Congress and the executive to deprive some Americans of their citizenship.

On March 31, 1958, the court announced its decision regarding three denationalization cases: Trop, Nishikawa, and Perez. Dallin H. Oaks, one of Chief Justice Warren’s clerks in 1957 and 1958, recorded the climactic courtroom scene in his journal:

Justice William Douglas’ delivery and remarks were easily the most forceful of the afternoon, with Douglas stating that, ‘These are the most important constitutional pronouncements of this century.’ … The courtroom became charged with an electric air of importance from that time forward.

Two of the three defendants whose cases were considered that day—Mitsugi Nishikawa and Clemente Perez—were born in the United States to foreign parents.

Why do these long-forgotten cases matter today? Because the highly divided court was unanimous on one point: Being born in the United States meant being a native-born American, regardless of the status of one’s foreign parents. This unanimous interpretation of the citizenship clause of the 14th amendment was echoed in two subsequent cases—Gonzales in 1955 and Mendoza-Martinez in 1962—involving the deprivation of citizenship of children of immigrants.

The differing opinions delivered by the justices are instructive. So are the debates in the hearings themselves, which are all available to the public on the Supreme Court website.

Take the case of Daniel Gonzales, a child born in New Mexico in 1924 to two Mexican citizens. When he reached the age of 2, Gonzales was taken by his parents to Mexico, where he lived until 1946. That year, the now 21-year-old Gonzales returned to the United States, but not before he registered for the Mexican draft. The United States declared that Gonzales had voluntarily renounced his American citizenship by signing up for a foreign country’s draft during a time of war. To be able to do so, however, Gonzales had to be acknowledged as having been a U.S. citizen in the first place. During the hearings for this case, the following exchange played out.

Justice Frankfurter: Doesn’t the Act establish he is a citizen?

Response of Gonzales’s attorney: He did of course by showing—

Gonzales’s attorney: That he is born in the United States. …

Justice Stanley Reed: That was admitted, wasn’t it?

Gonzales’s attorney: That was not disputed at all.

The justices affirmed the principle underlying this exchange in future cases.

In the 1958 case of Perez v. Brownell, Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the court supporting expatriation by beginning with “Petitioner, a national of the United States by birth …” Frankfurter went on to recount Perez’s history. “The Petitioner was born in Texas in 1909. … At the outbreak of World War II, petitioner knew of the duty of male United States citizens to register for the draft, but he failed to do so.”

In Nishikawa v. Dulles, delivered the same day, Chief Justice Warren wrote on behalf of the majority that “Petitioner was born in Artesia, California, in 1916. By reason of that fact, he was a citizen of the United States.” Frankfurter begins his concurring opinion in Nishikawa by writing: “This case involves a native-born citizen of Japanese parentage who has been declared to have lost his citizenship by virtue of § 401(c) of the Nationality Act of 1940.” Four years later, in Martinez v. Mendoza, Justice Arthur Goldberg delivered the opinion of the court, beginning: “Mendoza-Martinez … was born in this country in 1922, and therefore acquired American citizenship by birth.”

Reaching a decision in each of these cases required the justices to first assess if the petitioners were American citizens. If they were not, the cases would be moot—with no citizenship to be stripped. They were deemed to be U.S. citizens independently of the immigration status of their parents, which the court unanimously found to be irrelevant.

This forgotten history is particularly crucial in this moment. This spring, the current court will have to decide on the interpretation of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment, which establishes that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” Just hours after taking the oath of office for the second time, on Jan. 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14,160, declaring that children born on American soil would no longer receive automatic citizenship unless at least one parent was an American citizen or lawful permanent resident.

The long-settled understanding is that the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to nearly all born on American soil, regardless of their parents’ legal status (with an exception for diplomats’ children). Such an understanding was established in large part by the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which held that a child born in the United States—of Chinese parents who had their permanent domicile and residence in the United States—was entitled to American citizenship. The Trump administration is seizing upon the words “permanent domicile and residence” to argue that one can only be “subject to the jurisdiction of” the United States if at least one of his parents is a lawful permanent resident—like the parents of Wong Kim Ark—or a citizen.

In its coming decision, though, the Supreme Court cannot ignore that from 1955 to 1967, a unanimous court decided that being born in the United States made them “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” Whether or not the Trump administration has found a loophole in Wong Kim Ark, the court decided this issue with some finality just 60 years ago. If the court were to side with the Trump administration, there is no way for it to do so without overturning its own previous unanimous precedents.

Correction, Jan. 15, 2026: This article originally misstated that the Wong Kim Ark case was in 1868.

Last week, the fruits of the Department of Homeland Security’s burgeoning gestapo tactics came into full view. On Wednesday in Minneapolis, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her car. On Thursday in Portland, Oregon, a federal Border Patrol agent shot and wounded Luis David Nino-Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras in their pickup truck. Three unarmed people shot by federal officers within the span of 36 hours.

The administration claims that in both Minneapolis and Portland, the drivers were “domestic terrorists” who “weaponized” their vehicles, that the officers acted in self-defense, that they fired their guns to save their lives. In the first case, we have video to disprove it. In the second, unless a video surfaces, it will be the agent’s word against the victims’.

We should no longer be surprised by the Trump administration’s lies. But it remains surprising that its members continue to stick doggedly to their story in the face of unambiguous video evidence contradicting it. Donald Trump has said that Good “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer,” that he was injured, and that “it is hard to believe he is alive.” But in the clearest of the videos, Good inches forward, then waits for other vehicles to pass. Two officers march toward the driver’s side of her SUV. “Get out of the fucking car,” one says. As Good slowly reverses, one officer yanks at the driver’s-side door handle and reaches through the window. Good points her wheels to the right and begins to pull forward away from the agents. Ross crosses in front of the car, grabs his gun, points it directly at her, and fires through the windshield. Stepping back, he keeps firing as the car moves on. The vehicle never touches him. After he has shot Good, he casually approaches the SUV, looks inside, then strides comfortably away.

It looks like an execution. And yet, far from giving officers pause, the video seems to have goosed them up to further violence. Footage of assaults in the past few days show a set of standard tactics: multiple officers surround their target’s car, take out hammers and smash the windshield or windows, drag the driver out, and tackle, handcuff, and arrest them. In one video, at least eight ICE officers surround a woman’s car. She cries out that she’s a U.S. citizen trying to get to a doctor, as a cascade of glass hits her. The officers slash her seat belt, slam her to the ground, then throw her against the vehicle and handcuff her. In another, a man covered in glass and pinned down by three agents shouts, “Help me!,” and a bystander yells, “He’s not fucking resisting!” As the officers handcuff him, one puts his knee on the man’s neck and bears down. In a third, at least four Border Patrol officers drag a man out of his car, pile on top of him, and crush his face into the ground till he appears to pass out. Other officers fire pepper balls at the protesting witnesses. One man tries to film the scene as an officer marches toward him and shouts, “You go back there one more time and I’m going to put you under arrest!” Back there is the only place the camera can fully capture the officers’ brutality.

We live in extreme times. A president has been sending armies into our cities to hunt people down and kill if necessary. So it is not surprising that the media’s discussion of the shootings has focused on their relationship to our anomalous political moment: Trump’s war on immigration; the mass protests; the polarization that has produced radically divergent accounts of the shootings. But if we focus only on Trump-era lawlessness, we risk missing something equally important to these events but far more systemic and enduring: the quiet success of a long campaign to neutralize video evidence of police brutality, leaving officers secure in the belief that the law cannot touch them.

By the end of the first decade of the 21st century, phone cameras were everywhere. They showed us the culture of police violence as never before, but they also seemed to promise a different future. In 2010 one civil rights lawyer confidently proclaimed that our cameras would democratize evidence and bring about “real justice.” A few years later, the lawyer for Freddie Gray—killed while shackled in the back of a police van—declared, “Thank God for cellphone video cameras, because now the truth is finally coming out.”

The truth did come out, sometimes at least. But truth failed to do what we thought it would. That failure was not accidental but the result of an organized program dedicated to shielding officers from even the most damning footage. From the moment phone cameras began capturing police violence, conservative organizations, police unions, and their allies mobilized. They worked on multiple fronts: financing elections of sympathetic officials and judges, campaigning against the others, producing legislation limiting the camera’s reach, and intervening in precedent-setting court cases. They had three central aims: to block our cameras, to make it easy to suppress or destroy incriminating video, and, when these avenues failed, to alter what the video seemed to show through clever editing, the fabrication of supplementary evidence, and the repetition of lies till they hardened into fact. It was a full program of video gaslighting.

This campaign has succeeded for many reasons, among them the nearly unlimited power officers have to charge those they assault with “resisting arrest” or “obstruction of justice” (deflecting charges from themselves while interrupting filming); the freedom of local departments from oversight, so footage often simply disappears and departments rarely discipline officers for violating protocols; the alliance of prosecutors, police, their lawyers, and judges; qualified immunity; jurors’ interpretive (often racial) biases; and the fact that much of the public no longer seems to care.

For well over a decade, Americans watched videos of people fleeing, pleading, or pinned to the ground—Eric Garner, Alton Sterling, Terence Crutcher, Darrien Hunt, Philando Castile, Miguel Richards—only to see officers walk.

But the issues that motivated Black Lives Matter have now receded into the background, eclipsed by the Trump regime’s daily assaults on the rule of law. Not for those who live them, to be sure: The police killed 1,177 people in 2025, 89 of them unarmed, but only eight of the officers involved have been charged. (Some charges have already been dropped.) But such things have become mostly back-page stories. And yet, what Minneapolis and Portland should teach us is that those issues and Trump’s assaults are really one and the same.

If we look rightly, we can see that the so-called fascist playbook draws directly from the policing techniques long at work in overpoliced communities. The uniforms are different. The scenes are the same: the smashed car windows, the driver slammed to the ground, the officer’s knee on their neck. Or sometimes the deadly shots through the window. No provocation needed. No reasonable suspicion or probable cause. And, in the end, somehow it is not the officer who is charged (with civil rights violations, assault, or battery); it is the victim of their violence. The unprecedented savagery of the Trump administration has obscured the fact that in Minneapolis and Portland—as in other cities and at our borders—federal officers have merely expanded upon these techniques: more blatantly, less apologetically, but with the same certainty that the cameras that serve as witnesses to their acts cannot touch them.

What we see in Minneapolis is important, but what we don’t see in Portland is just as important. The FBI has said that it has found no video of the shooting. And yet, Border Patrol agents have worn body cameras since 2021. If there are videos, we may never see them. In Portland (as elsewhere), the absence of video means that the officers’ narrative wins by default. In Minneapolis (as elsewhere), a video—however incriminating—seems powerless against the forces armed to defeat it.

In considering the events of last week, we need to look past the political spectacle and confront the quieter failure beneath it. Cameras were supposed to be bearers of truth and armor against lies, vehicles of justice and agents of change. The events in Minneapolis and Portland remind us that we need video more than ever—not because it guarantees justice but because without it, official lies prevail unchallenged. They also offer an opportunity to ask, with over a decade and a half of hindsight, why video evidence has failed us again and again, why it has left officers virtually untouchable, and what we can do about it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Senator Elizabeth Warren is leading calls for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Trump Mobile for failing to ship gold phones, months after collecting deposits.

Customers were told to pay $100 deposits by August 2025, with shipping dates repeatedly pushed back from August to November, then December, and still no devices have shipped as of January.

Pre-orders for the T1 remain open, while Trump Mobile sells refurbished Apple and Samsung devices, and &quot;The 47 Plan&quot; – a mobile virtual network service costing $47.45 per month for a SIM-only telco product.

The proposed FTC probe would zero in on Trump Mobile&#39;s marketing practices, which lawmakers claim are &quot;potentially deceptive.&quot;

President Trump announced the Trump Mobile brand in June 2025, along with mockups of a T1 phone. The company attracted criticism for sharing inconsistent designs – earlier versions appeared similar to an iPhone 16 Pro, while subsequent designs more closely resembled a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, lawmakers said.

Also under the microscope of the proposed regulatory review is the company&#39;s initial &quot;Made in the USA&quot; marketing phrases.

The lawmakers&#39; letter [PDF] to the FTC states: &quot;Trump Mobile initially advertised the T1 phone as &#39;made in the USA&#39; on its website. These claims were quietly removed from the website in late June 2025, days after the phone was announced.

&quot;To claim that a product is &#39;Made in USA,&#39; marketers must meet a very specific set of FTC standards, violations of which come with civil penalties.

&quot;Experts have pointed out the impracticality of creating smartphones in the United States given the lack of appropriate manufacturing infrastructure. Since its grandiose announcement, Trump Mobile has replaced its language with vague phrases like &#39;American-Proud Design,&#39; &#39;Proudly American,&#39; and &#39;brought to life right here in the USA.&#39;&quot;

The letter notes that the FTC failed to respond to a similar request made in August about how it plans to investigate the &quot;enormous conflicts of interest&quot; associated with Trump Mobile.

Lawmakers demanded a response to their letter by February 15, saying this proposed probe would serve as a &quot;critical test of the FTC&#39;s independence,&quot; which has been increasingly called into question.

In February 2025, Trump signed an executive order giving the White House more control over regulatory agencies, including the independent ones like the FTC and SEC. Policy decisions are to be approved by the president, who also has control over the commissions&#39; budgets.

The administration framed the move as making regulators answerable to the American people, though critics described it as an authoritarian power grab.

A month later, Trump removed the FTC&#39;s Democrat commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, sparking a Supreme Court case that continues to take shape.

Per a 1935 ruling that came to be known as Humphrey&#39;s Executor, a US president does not have the right to remove executives of independent agencies like the FTC without cause.

The president removed Slaughter on grounds that she was &quot;inconsistent&quot; with his administration&#39;s priorities, which is not one of the reasons listed under the FTC Act.

The Supreme Court&#39;s decision on Slaughter vs USA is not expected for several months. The final ruling, and the validity of Humphrey&#39;s Executor, could have a significant impact on the independence of US regulators.

Given the fractious relationship between the president and the FTC, it is unclear whether the latter will uphold the lawmakers&#39; request for a probe into Trump Mobile. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/rondodox_botnet_hpe_oneview/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A critical HPE OneView flaw is now being exploited at scale, with Check Point tying mass, automated attacks to the RondoDox botnet.

The security outfit says it has identified &quot;large-scale exploitation&quot; of CVE-2025-37164, a maximum-severity remote code execution bug in HPE&#39;s data center management platform. Check Point has tied the activity to RondoDox, a Linux-based botnet that weaponizes publicly known vulnerabilities across routers, DVRs, web servers, and other devices, using an &quot;exploit-shotgun&quot; approach to build sprawling botnet networks for DDoS, cryptomining, and secondary payload delivery.

When HPE first disclosed the bug in mid-December, its fix was greeted with urgency because of its perfect 10 CVSS severity score and the fact that OneView controls servers, storage, and networking from a central point – essentially a high-privilege command center inside many enterprise environments.

At that stage, the big unknown was whether miscreants were moving past proof-of-concept exploitation to full-blown campaigns. Now that uncertainty is gone, tens of thousands of exploit attempts have been observed, Check Point&#39;s telemetry shows, with automated scanners targeting vulnerable systems en masse.

The firm says it observed a &quot;dramatic escalation&quot; in exploit activity on January 7, the same day the flaw was added to CISA&#39;s list of actively exploited flaws.

&quot;Between 05:45 and 09:20 UTC, we recorded more than 40,000 attack attempts exploiting CVE-2025-37164,&quot; Check Point said in a Thursday blog post. &quot;Analysis indicates that these attempts were automated, botnet-driven exploitation.

&quot;We attribute this activity to the RondoDox botnet based on a distinctive user agent string and the commands observed, including those designed to download RondoDox malware from remote hosts.&quot;

Check Point says the majority of the activity came from a single Dutch IP address already well known in threat intel circles, suggesting a particularly active operator.

It added that the attacks were global, with the United States seeing the highest volume, followed by Australia, France, Germany, and Austria, and activity concentrated mainly against government organizations, along with financial services and industrial manufacturers.

HPE has yet to respond to The Register&#39;s questions on Friday, but told us earlier this month that while it had not received reports from customers of the vulnerability being exploited, &quot;it is important that OneView users apply the patch as soon as possible.&quot;

If there&#39;s a takeaway from the latest OneView drama, it&#39;s that management platforms can no longer be left to rot on long patch cycles – because the adversaries definitely won&#39;t wait. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US Congress has rejected plans to slash NASA&#39;s science budget, restoring most funding with one notable exception: Mars Sample Return remains cancelled.

A joint explanatory statement was released earlier this month, and lawmakers have passed the bill. The legislation, passed with 82 senators voting for it, 15 against, and three abstaining, reverses an earlier proposal that would have cut NASA&#39;s overall budget by nearly 25 percent and halved science spending – potentially shutting down many active missions.

Instead, NASA will receive only slightly less than in recent years, though inflation reduces actual spending power.

In a statement, Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said: &quot;The bill rejects the administration&#39;s devastating proposal to cut NASA Science by 47 percent and terminate 55 operating and planned missions.&quot;

In remarks made on the Senate floor, Van Hollen said: &quot;We won&#39;t have a space program if we don&#39;t understand what&#39;s happening in space and get to the fundamentals of science in space.&quot;

However, the budget appears to be the final blow for Mars Sample Return. While the Perseverance rover is collecting samples on Mars, whether the rover&#39;s containers will ever be returned to Earth for analysis is debatable.

The budget requirement for the ambitious mission ballooned as engineers grappled with the challenges, leading then NASA Administrator Bill Nelson to call for alternatives that could return samples more quickly and cheaply.

NASA whittled down the options by the start of 2025, but it looks like another option – cancel the whole thing altogether – will be the final outcome.

The budget, should President Donald Trump sign it off, will come as a relief to the majority of the US space agency and its supporters.

In an email to The Reg, The Planetary Society said: &quot;With this budget, missions such as New Horizons beyond Pluto, VIPER (looking for water resources on the Moon), and the Apophis Explorer, set to study a hazardous asteroid that will barely miss Earth in 2029, will continue operations.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Constructing datacenters accounts for 39 percent of their total carbon dioxide emissions, almost as much as operating them, according to an environmental analysis covering the entire lifecycle of a facility.

The finding comes from a white paper published by European datacenter operator Data4, which conducted a lifecycle assessment (LCA) of one of its own facilities with the assistance of design and engineering consultants APL Data Center.

It claims the results represent a comprehensive, scientific view of the impact it is having on the environment, as LCA is a rigorous framework for evaluating the effects throughout the lifecycle, including raw material production.

Data4 estimates that over 20 years, the carbon footprint of its datacenter comes to 12.6 million kg of CO2 equivalent, or matching the carbon emissions of about 300 French people over the same period.

The facility in question is a 5 MW unit at its Marcoussis campus near Paris, which makes it a relatively modest concern in comparison with many hyperscale server farms or those being built for AI operations.

The construction phase of the datacenter accounted for 39 percent of all the emissions, but this includes the production of equipment, and all the emissions accrued by the production of the building materials used in the facility&#39;s structure, particularly the concrete and steel. The environmental impacts associated with the actual construction project itself are relatively marginal, the report states.

Some Reg readers may recall that in 2024 Microsoft reported its total carbon dioxide emissions as rising by nearly 30 percent since 2020, despite its pledge to become carbon-negative by 2030. The Windows-maker attributed this to indirect emissions (Scope 3) from the construction and provisioning of lots more datacenters to meet the burgeoning demand for cloud services and AI.

For context, Microsoft is trying to address this by exploring  use of &quot;greener&quot; concrete mixes, and even experimenting with datacenters made out of wood.

The operations phase of the datacenter&#39;s lifecycle accounts for most of the greenhouse gas emissions, as you might expect, at 48 percent. This comprises the consumption of electricity for operations: cooling systems, UPS and security systems, the report says. The remainder of the emissions is accounted for by things such as transport to the site and maintenance.

When it comes to water usage, Data4 claims that despite preconceptions, its direct water consumption is minimal, equivalent to the annual requirements of about a dozen people. Most of the water extraction connected with the datacenter&#39;s lifecycle is indirect consumption, with 57 percent through generation of electricity and another 36 percent pertaining to the extraction and transformation of materials.

Data4 says it does not employ cooling towers or adiabatic cooling systems, the latter using water evaporation to pre-cool air, which may explain this counter-intuitive finding. Water consumption is markedly higher in a facility full of hot-running high-performance servers stuffed with GPUs crunching through AI workloads.

According to the report, this Paris datacenter&#39;s water usage effectiveness (WUE) is 0.039 L/kWh (liters per kilowatt-hour), which it claims is 25 times lower than the industry average, so it is perhaps not indicative of datacenters in general.

As The Register has previously reported, facilities using evaporative cooling can get through a lot of water, but they are also relatively energy efficient. The datacenter industry contends that this may be the most sustainable solution in areas where industrial water is plentiful but energy comes at a premium.

Data4 also looked at the impact of the use of mineral and metal resources in datacenters. It found that overall, a facility requires enough of these to construct a 12 km railway. This covers copper used in all the wiring and in transformers, aluminum, and rare earth minerals found in batteries and uninterruptible power supplies.

Readers may be wondering why Data4 is bothering with all of this. The company says carrying out a comprehensive life cycle assessment puts its understanding of its environmental impact on a more scientific footing and helps to prioritize the right actions, such as reducing the amount of concrete used in construction, optimizing cooling, and recycling metals.

In light of the study&#39;s findings, Data4 claims it will be able to reduce the carbon footprint for each new megawatt of IT infrastructure it deploys by 38 percent by 2030.

&quot;We are publishing this analysis in complete transparency, not only to guide our own eco-design actions, but also to encourage the entire industry to go beyond the usual indicators,&quot; said Data4&#39;s Head of Environment & Innovation Linda Lescuyer.

&quot;A sustainable digital future is not only a statement; it must be built, piece by piece, on a scientific basis.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An Estonian e-scooter owner locked out of his own ride after the manufacturer went bust did what any determined engineer might do. He reverse-engineered it, and claims he ended up discovering the master key that unlocks every scooter the company ever sold.

The company in question, Äike, which filed for bankruptcy last year, built app-controlled electric scooters that rely on a phone and backend servers to do as basic a task as turning them on. That setup worked while the startup was still around. Once it wasn&#39;t, owners were left with pricey scooters that only unlocked when the cloud happened to answer.

Some features limped along for a while, others stopped altogether. So rather than trust his commute to a bankrupt startup&#39;s servers, one owner, Rasmus Moorats, an Estonian security researcher and penetration tester, took matters into his own hands and started poking around to see how the scooter really worked.

A closer look at the Android app and Bluetooth traffic showed that locking, unlocking, and basic status checks all occur locally over Bluetooth, with the cloud mostly along for the ride.

Before accepting commands, the scooter runs a simple authentication check: it sends a short challenge, the app replies with a cryptographic response, and access is granted. It&#39;s designed to stop random passers-by from hopping on and riding off. In theory, at least.

In practice, the secret used to generate that response was, Moorats claims, never properly set. Instead of a unique key per scooter, the manufacturer shipped all models with the same placeholder value: a default private key that appears to have been intended to be replaced before production and simply never was.

Once Moorats had worked that out, unlocking his own scooter without the cloud was trivial, and the exact same method works on every other Äike scooter within Bluetooth range, he says. With a short proof-of-concept script and standard tools, he says he was able to unlock any nearby scooter, whether it belonged to him or not.

This isn&#39;t a blueprint for a mass scooter theft spree. Äike never sold scooters at the scale of big rental fleets, and shared scooters appear to use different hardware. Still, the mistake is a familiar one in IoT: default settings left in place, no real key management, and nothing to fall back on once the company vanishes.

Moorats says he disclosed the issue to the hardware supplier, only to be told that key management was the manufacturer&#39;s responsibility – a dead end when that manufacturer is bankrupt.

When smart devices die with their makers, reverse engineering becomes less of a hobby and more of a basic ownership skill. ®

This is not exactly Linux or even Git, his other famous project, in terms of the level of work. Still, many people reacted to Torvalds&#39; vibe coding as &quot;wow!&quot; It&#39;s certainly noteworthy, but has the case for vibe coding really changed?

With vibe coding, the &quot;programmer&quot; describes their requirements in natural language to an AI model. The LLM then generates the code. Unlike AI pair‑programming tools that assume a human will read and refine every line, in vibe coding, you accept the AI&#39;s output largely as‑is and iterate by rerunning and adjusting prompts rather than editing the code.

There&#39;s nothing new about this idea of simply telling a computer to write a program for you. Natural language processing (NLP) goes all the way back to Alan Turing in 1950. You may have heard of him.

More recently, in the late &#39;70s and early &#39;80s, which is when I came on the scene, fourth-generation languages (4GLs) appeared. 4GLs were high‑level, usually domain‑specific languages that let you specify what you wanted from a database, such as queries, reports, and displays, rather than how to do it procedurally, with a focus on business data tasks. You&#39;d ask for, say, a sales report, and they&#39;d generate the COBOL or SQL to deliver it.

I used Adabas/Natural on mainframes to deliver NASA data communication reports back in the &#39;80s. 4GLs are still around, and some, such as SAS and SPSS, remain important in production environments.

They never really caught on because they were too brittle. In addition, and this is the important part, describing a program in natural language is not easy. Just ask all the people who have been trying for ages to get low-code/no-code off the ground.

Who knew? Well, AI researcher Andrej Karpathy did. He&#39;s the guy who coined the phrase &quot;vibe coding.&quot; He described this approach as being &quot;not too bad for throwaway weekend projects... but it&#39;s not really coding – I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy-paste stuff, and it mostly works.&quot;

Exactly. That&#39;s what Torvalds did. It&#39;s fun, and for small projects, it&#39;s productive. However, today&#39;s programs are complex and call upon numerous frameworks and resources. Even if your vibe code works, how do you maintain it? Do you know what&#39;s going on inside the code? Chances are you don&#39;t. Besides, the LLM you used two weeks ago has been replaced with a new version. The exact same prompts that worked then yield different results today. Come to think of it, it&#39;s an LLM. The same prompts and the same LLM will give you different results every time you run it. This is asking for disaster.

Just ask Jason Lemkin. He was the guy who used the vibe coding platform Replit, which went &quot;rogue during a code freeze, shut down, and deleted our entire database.&quot; Whoops!

Yes, Replit and other dedicated vibe programming AIs, such as Cursor and Windsurf, are improving. I&#39;m not at all sure, though, that they&#39;ve been able to help with those fundamental problems of being fragile and still cannot scale successfully to the demands of production software.

It&#39;s much worse than that. Just because a program runs doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good. As Ruth Suehle, President of the Apache Software Foundation, commented recently on LinkedIn, naive vibe coders &quot;only know whether the output works or doesn&#39;t and don&#39;t have the skills to evaluate it past that. The potential results are horrifying.&quot;

Why? In another LinkedIn post, Craig McLuckie, co-founder and CEO of Stacklok, wrote: &quot;Today, when we file something as &#39;good first issue&#39; and in less than 24 hours get absolutely inundated with low-quality vibe-coded slop that takes time away from doing real work. This pattern of &#39;turning slop into quality code&#39; through the review process hurts productivity and hurts morale.&quot;

McLuckie continued: &quot;Code volume is going up, but tensions rise as engineers do the fun work with AI, then push responsibilities onto their team to turn slop into production code through structured review.&quot;

So it is that, while the sheer volume of code being turned in is going up, in no small part because of vibe coding, the quality is going down. This, in turn, puts an ever-growing burden on maintainers who must separate AI slop from high-quality code.

Besides, as the only trustworthy, objective study I&#39;ve seen to date on the &quot;quality&quot; of AI code, last summer&#39;s Measuring the Impact of Early-2025 AI on Experienced Open Source Developer Productivity, found that even experienced programmers using AI tools took 19 percent longer to complete tasks.

That&#39;s with professional developers who were not vibe coding. When you&#39;ve got amateurs who wouldn&#39;t know Ada from Zsh trying to talk their way into good code, you&#39;re just asking for serious trouble.

So, sure, play with vibe coding. Just don&#39;t expect, after the initial excitement has worn off, that you&#39;ll end up with anything worth keeping except for the smallest and most trivial of programs. ®

Researchers say the issue can allow attackers to listen to the mics on wireless audio devices, or track their location.

Several Bluetooth audio devices from companies like Sony, Anker, and Nothing are susceptible to a new flaw that can allow attackers to listen in on conversations or track devices that use Google’s Find Hub network, as reported by Wired.

Researchers from KU Leuven University’s Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group in Belgium discovered several vulnerabilities in Google’s Fast Pair protocol that can allow a hacker within Bluetooth range to secretly pair with some headphones, earbuds, and speakers. The attacks, which the researchers have collectively dubbed WhisperPair, can even be used on iPhone users with affected Bluetooth devices despite Fast Pair being a Google-specific feature.

Fast Pair streamlines Bluetooth pairing and lets wireless audio accessories connect to Android or Chrome OS devices by simply tapping them together. But the researchers found that many devices don’t implement Fast Pair correctly, including a Google specification that says Fast Pair devices shouldn’t be able to connect to a new device while already paired to another.

The researchers tested their WhisperPair attacks on over two dozen Bluetooth devices and were successful in hacking 17 of them. They were able to play their own audio through the compromised headphones and speakers at any volume, intercept phone calls, and even eavesdrop on conversations using the devices’ microphones.

A more serious issue was found to affect five Sony products and Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2. If the devices weren’t previously connected to an Android device and linked to a Google account (which isn’t required when using them with iPhones), WhisperPair could be used to pair and link them to a hacker’s Google account that would be recognized as the device’s owner. That would allow a hacker to use Google’s Find Hub network to track the user’s location and movements through their headphones, assuming smartphone notifications warning that a device was tracking them were dismissed as errors.

A list of the affected devices from 10 different companies can be found here, which includes the Sony WH-1000XM6, WH-1000XM5, and WH-1000XM4 headphones, and the Nothing Ear (a), OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro, and Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds.

The researchers reported their findings to Google in August 2025. The company then recommended fixes to its “accessory OEM partners” in September and updated its certification requirements to mitigate similar issues going forward. “We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report’s lab setting,” Google spokesperson Ed Fernandez says in a written statement to The Verge.

The recommended fixes resolve all the Fast Pair issues once a software update has been installed, but Google implemented an additional Find Hub network update to prevent WhisperPair from being used to track certain Bluetooth devices that haven’t been patched. The researchers told Wired it only took them a few hours to bypass that patch and continue their tracking. According to Fernandez, the researchers used “old/not updated accessory OEM firmware in order to execute their workaround,” and Google is “looking into the bypass for this additional fix,” which was only submitted earlier this week.

The Fast Pair feature can’t be disabled, so the only way to protect against WhisperPair attacks is for users to install firmware updates released by manufacturers that resolve the vulnerabilities. The Verge reached out to all the manufacturers with affected hardware to confirm the progress of fixes. Spenser Blank, the head of marketing & communications for OnePlus North America, told The Verge in a written statement that the company “takes all security reports seriously” and that it’s “currently investigating this matter and will take appropriate action to protect our users’ security and privacy.”

We will update this story as other companies respond.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/column/863319/highlights-musk-v-altman-openai">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an excerpt of Sources by Alex Heath, a newsletter about AI and the tech industry, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.

Elon Musk first sued OpenAI in February 2024. Despite OpenAI’s repeated attempts to throw it out, the case is now headed to a jury trial on April 27th in Northern California federal court.

Musk’s main allegation is that OpenAI and its leaders abandoned the company’s original nonprofit mission that he funded. In turn, OpenAI has treated Musk’s claims as sour grapes. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers recently decided that the case warranted going to trial, saying in court that “part of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible.”

Last week, thousands of pages of evidence from the case were unsealed, including partial 2025 depositions of most of the key players involved, including Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Mira Murati, and Satya Nadella, along with ex-board members Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley — both of whom played key roles in the 2023 firing of Altman.

Bits and pieces of this evidence have started trickling out in recent days, such as the news that Sutskever owned a whopping $4 billion in vested OpenAI shares when Altman was briefly fired two years ago. Altogether, the unsealed evidence offers a fascinating look not only at OpenAI’s early days but also at the circumstances surrounding Altman’s firing and Microsoft’s complex relationship with OpenAI.

I’ve been covering OpenAI in depth for a while, and I closely reported on the whirlwind few days when Altman was fired and then rehired in late 2023. It’s through that lens that I’ve pulled out the below highlights from the evidence in Musk v. Altman:

In 2022, OpenAI’s leaders seemed quite concerned about the prominence of open-source lab Stability AI, and Sutskever voiced his worry over text with Murati and others:

Sutskever: My trepidation around open source is that we’re treating it as a side show, eg def not going far enough to really hurt stability

Murati: We’re missing the opportunity to set standards with this massive growing group of devs, people are hungry to build things and we should lean in and bring our tech to as many people as possible, long term maximize our chance of maintaining lead, reducing competition

But if we do everything to get this in a couple of weeks at any cost out bc we heard stability is open sourcing similar model, that’s not in line at all with my motivations

They were also already considering prohibiting investors from backing competing labs. From an October 2022 exchange:

Sutskever: I guess I just felt betrayed by him founding a direct competitor while simultaneously telling me that “I could not possibly imagine you’d find it objectionable”

Altman: here’s how id summarize my thoughts on this:

pros: he supported us in a moment where no one else would and it was pretty existential--i think openai would have been pretty fucked if he hasn’t stepped up then. also, he was instrumental to getting the first MSFT deal done, and has generally been quite helpful with MSFT related stuff he is generally a good board member.

cons: he is very motivated by `collecting’ status. although i personally think he cares much more about openai than inflection, he was blinded enough by the startup of being able to call himself the cofounder of a company he made an uncareful decision.

also, at this point, i think at this point openai has the leverage to ask for a soft promise for new investors not to invest in competitors, but only a select few companies ever get to do that)

Brockman: oh also an aside, after taking to @Sam Altman, I’m planning to meet Patrick Collison tmrw and demo dv3. Will ask if he’d be interested in participating in the tender under the condition of not investing in AGI/big model competitors

Q: Why did you write “Financially, what will take me to 1 billion?”

A: I think if we were going to do a for-profit entity, that I started to think about what would be motivating financial reward in that case as a secondary consideration.

A: Primary consideration was would we be able to pursue and achieve the mission.

Q: How important was the secondary consideration to you?

A: The second consideration definitely mattered.

Q: At this point, did you aspire to be a billionaire?

A: My primary motivation was to the mission.

Q: Was your secondary motivation to be a billionaire?

A: I believe that as a -- one thing I was definitely motivated by was the idea — I definitely had as a motivation that, yeah, potentially getting to $1 billion.

Q: So we know you achieved that goal at some point. Do you know precisely what day that happened?

A: I do not know what day precisely that happened.

Q: When was the first day you realized you had surpassed that goal?

A: I do not know what day I would say my, at least on paper, net worth would’ve exceeded 1 billion.

Q: Did you feel that your progress was moving more slowly than you had liked?

A: I mean, always as a CEO of a company, I feel my job is to sort of be dissatisfied with the rate of progress at all times. And so “yes” would be the answer, which is both in the absolute sense, which is, can we build products that are more capable in any particular domain, and also, you know, vis-à-vis competition.

There were others achieving things that we looked at and said, “Hey, that’s great, and so how can we make sure we are competitive with it.”

According to an exhibit filed in the case, it was co-written with Marco Iansiti and was in development in 2023. From the first chapter:

On Wednesday, August 24, 2022, with the Pacific Northwest summer showing all of its beauty, Bill Gates hosted a dinner at his home on Lake Washington, just a few miles from the Microsoft campus. No longer a Microsoft board member or even Microsoft’s largest shareholder, Bill remained the iconic co-founder and trusted advisor of the company’s senior technical leaders. Satya suggested the gathering, which included Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott, and a handful of top researchers. Food and drinks would be served, but the main entrée was a hush- hush demo by OpenAl founder Sam Altman of a forthcoming release of ChatGPT powered by GPT-4, an AI built on Large Language Models (LLMs). Bill had long encouraged researchers to develop a truly accomplished AI assistant but had voiced his skepticism about this particular approach.

Musk was opposed to working with Jeff Bezos and wrote the following in an early email to Altman: “I think Jeff is a bit of a tool and Satya is not, so I slightly prefer Microsoft, but I hate their marketing dept.” Altman responded that Amazon had “started really dicking us around.”

In November 2018, after dinner with Altman, Scott told Nadella that OpenAI’s new corporate structure offered both “a commercial vehicle for monetizing Open AI IP” and investment returns “capped at $500B.” Altman claimed the nonprofit would eventually benefit because — though OpenAI had yet to make a single dollar in returns — “[i]f [OpenAI] ever [does] get to $500B in returns, the balance over that goes directly to the 501(c)3.”

Microsoft’s board initially approved a capital investment of $2 billion. But ultimately, it decided to limit its initial investment to $1 billion in the hopes that a smaller investment would “press OpenAI to commercialize,” in direct contravention of the nonprofit’s stated founding principles. In exchange for its investment, Microsoft received a convertible limited partnership interest and rights to OpenAI’s profits, with returns “capped” at 2000% of its $1 billion investment.

Microsoft’s CFO noted in an internal email that the “cap is actually larger than 90% of public companies,” and the limit on Microsoft’s profits is not “terribly constraining nor terribly altruistic.” It was, in fact, “a good investment.” At Microsoft’s request, OpenAI agreed to keep any mention of Microsoft’s promised 2000% return on its investment out of its public announcement.

In March 2021, Microsoft quietly invested another $2 billion in OpenAI. Neither OpenAI nor Microsoft publicly announced the investment, which was subject to a lower 6x return multiple.

In place of its 2019 license to a single OpenAI model, Microsoft secured rights to commercialize any OpenAI model developed during the term of the agreement (except AGI). Facilitating its commercial use of OpenAI’s IP, Microsoft was permitted to embed up to ten of its employees on-site at OpenAI.

Anticipating increased product commercialization, Microsoft and OpenAI agreed to share any resulting revenue.

Just three months later, in June 2021, Microsoft released GitHub CoPilot — its first product incorporating OpenAI’s technology.

Prodding OpenAI to accelerate its own product development, Microsoft told Altman that OpenAI needed to generate $100 million in revenues to secure the next $10 billion commitment from Microsoft. To meet that goal, OpenAI expanded the team responsible for taking products to market and tried to expand its “enterprise business.”

In the summer of 2022, OpenAI began negotiating with Microsoft a new $10 billion investment. That November, OpenAI released ChatGPT. It was an instant hit. Nadella urged Altman to release a paid version and persistently checked on the progress of its commercialization.

Over the next several months, OpenAI secured Microsoft’s $10 billion investment, and the parties again amended the JDCA. OpenAI also changed its corporate structure.

The 2023 agreement “cap[ped]” Microsoft’s return on this investment at 600%, or $60 billion to start, but increased Microsoft’s profit “cap” by 20% per year. Microsoft would receive 49% of OpenAI’s profits, while the OpenAI nonprofit entity would recover just 2% of OpenAI’s profits — at least until all outside investors were paid out their investment returns, valued in total at $261 billion.

Underscoring the profit-focused aim of the partnership, the 2023 JDCA was specifically structured to “remove the impediments in commercialization.”

Microsoft negotiated expanded IP rights to include all OpenAI IP developed before or during the term of the agreement (excluding AGI), and the right to embed up to 20 employees at OpenAI.

Finally, Microsoft and OpenAI established an 80%-20% revenue share.

Altman apparently wanted board members with more “commercial” experience. From Toner’s deposition, in reference to internal discussions about expanding the board before it fired Altman in late 2023:

Q: Was it your impression that Mr. Altman was dragging his feet in these discussions?

A: Yes. I think that’s a fair description.

Q: Did Mr. Altman’s actions result in the board being deadlocked over any proposal to add an additional AI safety board member?

A: I’d say he contributed to us significantly being deadlocked, yes.

Q: Did Mr. Altman propose different candidates to the board?

Q: Were Mr. Altman’s alternative candidates also AI safety experts or did they have different backgrounds?

A: To the best of my recollection, he generally proposed candidates with more of a commercial startup background.

Adam runs a company called Quora, which has a product called Poe, which uses large language models, including those of OpenAI and some of its competitors.

The way I perceived it was after GPT-4 was demoed to the board in summer 2022, Adam began taking his responsibilities as a board member more seriously, because the technology seemed to be advancing, and he became a more engaged board member.

In the lead-up to — between that time in summer 2022 and April 2023, we had had several conversations as a board about what kinds of conflict of interest were acceptable or unacceptable on the board, because many potential board members, and current board members, had various involvements with various AI companies.

So we had fairly detailed discussions about what was an unacceptable conflict of interest and had decided that being closely involved with a company that was training its own large language models, you know, highly advanced frontier language models that would compete with OpenAI’s, was the bar for excessive conflict of interest.

So it was surprising to me when Sam emailed the board in April 2023 saying that Adam’s conflict of interest had grown too large and seemed like he needed to step off the board, and did we agree. Because Adam’s company produced a product that used others’ LLMs, they didn’t — they weren’t training their own. So clearly it didn’t meet the conflict of interest criteria we had all discussed.

When I said as much via email, Greg Brockman chimed in with a different reason to remove Adam, namely that his position as both a customer and a board member was creating communication difficulties internally. I forget who exactly said what on the email chain, but other board members raised questions about that or wanted to know more about that.

Ultimately, I spoke to Sam on the phone, and we sort of — at my urging, we agreed that, surely, the step before just removing Adam from the board, if the problem was how he was communicating inside the company, surely, the next step would be to discuss that with him and see if we can improve the situation. Sam said he would do that, he would have a conversation with Adam, to try and improve how he was communicating inside the company. And then the situation seemed to go away.

I later found out that Sam had never had that conversation with Adam, or that he had talked with him but had never actually tried to solve that problem, but, instead, had just said the only thing that he, Sam, didn’t like about Adam’s product Poe was that it used Anthropic models, because Anthropic was a competitor.

So, all in all, the situation seemed to me like there wasn’t actually a clear, concrete reason to ask Adam to move off the board, but that Sam and Greg were sort of searching for an excuse because he had been providing more active governance of the company.

Adam D’Angelo was at a dinner with some other founders, investors, startup people, who were asking him about the structure of the startup fund and potential conflicts of interest between the startup fund and OpenAI’s investors more generally.

And after that conversation, Adam emailed the board, including Sam, perhaps a couple of other OpenAI executives, to understand the structure better.

And in the resulting back-and-forth, we learned that Sam was the, as I understand it, the owner of the fund. So the initial conversation was around whether it was fair for OpenAI’s investors that OpenAI was sort of contributing to this other fund and was also contributing sort of engineering expertise and time to portfolio companies in the startup fund in ways that may not — where the benefit may not accrue back to OpenAI investors.

After we learned that Sam had a financial stake in the fund, we also had concerns about the fact that he had not disclosed that, given that his position on the board was one of a supposedly independent board director, meaning one with no financial interest in OpenAI.

Sam also suggested that he wanted to make a large, I believe, several-hundred-thousand-dollar campaign contribution to Will, while still expecting him to come back onto the board.

He did not go ahead with this donation because Tasha, Adam, and I all said it seemed very inappropriate. But to me, the fact that he was considering that, the fact that he might have discussed it with Will in advance, the fact it was an option, was just a sign of total disregard for the board’s independence or ability to provide meaningful oversight of the company and the CEO.

Q: And that several-hundred-thousand-dollar campaign contribution, was it — did Mr. Altman discuss that that was going to come from him personally?

I had more context on Bret Taylor than I did on Larry [Summers], and I had concerns about his ability to be — yeah, to make disinterested decisions in a way that was, wasn’t partial to Sam. I mean, you know, we had — he had been proposed by Sam for the board previously when we were there and when we were going through the process of expanding the board. And by the best of my recollection, you know, Sam had — had made recommendations on a number of different people. He was favorable to Bret Taylor.

If I recall correctly, Adam had — I think I recall correctly that Adam had interviewed Bret in the process of considering other candidates, and that one of the — prior to all of this — sorry — like, in the process that we were running over this — you know, in the months prior, when we were trying to expand the board; and at that time, that — one of the takeaways from that conversation was that — I think — I’m going to try to recall this exactly as possible, but it was I think Bret may have expressed concern that — concern around the — the conflicts. I think that he had said he had known Sam for a very long time and had a lot of connections to Sam and whatnot.

Q: Was one of those incidents Mr. Altman’s foot-dragging over adding an AI safety expert to the board?

A: That — that was — you know, I think the fact that that process was unable to result in adding independent members and an AI safety member to the board, it exacerbated our concerns, yes.

Q: And was another one of those incidents that — Mr. Altman’s representation that the three enhancements to GPT-4 had all been approved by the safety board?

Q: Was another one of those incidents Mr. Altman’s failure to disclose that a GPT-4 test was released in India without joint safety board review?

Q: Was another incident Mr. Altman’s failure to inform the board prior to ChatGPT’s release?

Q: And was another incident Mr. Altman’s misrepresentation about you allegedly saying Ms. Toner should obviously leave the board?

Q: And was another incident Mr. Altman’s misrepresentation that the legal department told him GPT-4 Turbo did not need safety board review?

A: Yes, that — that we saw screenshots to that effect.

A text exchange between Altman, Nadella, and OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap revealed the stake. As Microsoft was in discussions to hire Altman and most of the OpenAI team, Lightcap wrote that paying employees for their equity would cost $25 billion or $29 billion, depending on whether Sutskever’s vested shares were included. While it’s impossible to know for sure without more evidence, the exchange suggests that Sutskever was OpenAI’s largest individual shareholder at the time. It’s unclear if he has sold any shares since.

Q: And why did you withdraw your support for Sam Altman being fired?

A: Because I thought that OpenAI would be destroyed.

Altman: i remember seeing you in a tv interview a long time ago (maybe 60 minutes? where you being attacked by some guys, and you said they were heroes of yours and it was really tough.

well, you’re my hero and that’s what it feels like when you attack openai. totally get we have some screwed some stuff up, but we have worked incredibly hard to do the right thing, and i think we have ensured that neither google nor anyone else is on a path to have unilateral control over AGI, which i believe we both think is critical.

i am tremendously thankful for everything you’ve done to help —i dont think openai would have happened without you-and it really fucking hurts when you publicly attack openai

Musk: I hear you and it is certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake.

Altman: i agree with that, and i would really love to hear the things you think we should be doing differently/better.

it’s also not clear to me how the attacks on twitter help the fate of civilization, but that’s less important to me that getting to the right substance.

also, i checked with our team on recruiting from tesla. we really are doing very little relative to the size of the company, but i will make sure we don’t hurt tesla, i obviously think it’s a super important company.

Altman is personally the largest investor in Helion, which is building fusion power technology. From his deposition:

Q: While you were at Y Combinator, did you personally invest in any of the companies that Y Combinator sponsored?

A: I couldn’t give you a list off the top of my head.

Q: Have any of those companies done business with OpenAI?

A: Our conflicts committee keeps track of all this and could tell you. I couldn’t do a list off the top of my head that would be exhaustive. Reddit is one. OpenAI has not yet done business with Helion but intends to if the technology works.

Q: And do you personally agree that the company is worth at least 500 billion currently?

A: That was the willing buyer-willing seller market price, so I won’t argue with it.

Q: Apart from your faith in the willing buyers and willing sellers, do you agree, being the one who runs the company, that the company is worth at least $500 billion today?

A: If I were an outside market investor, I would — I think I would absolutely love to buy OpenAI shares at a 300-billion-dollar valuation, somewhat higher. At 500, I would start to say, “Could be, like, you know, things need to go right, but could be.”

“No, I was not surprised, because I was used to the board not being very informed about things.”

- Toner responding to a question during her deposition about whether she was surprised by the original release of ChatGPT.

“I think there’s a real possibility that five or 10 years from now, people look back and think of the main role OpenAI played during the late 2010s/early 2020s as being the org that set off great excitement about and investment in AGI (and then lost its lead to other orgs).”

- Toner in a message relayed by Brockman to other OpenAI leaders.

“Because of this pattern of lying… as was being reported to me, people in the company were copying that behavior, and there was kind of a culture of lying and a culture of, you know, yeah, deceit. And I think for us, as a board… this was just extremely concerning.”

“I thought it would be one of the coolest things that humanity could ever build. I was a sci-fi nerd. I read a lot of books. I watched a lot of sci-fi TV and movies. And, you know, I thought it would be one of the most helpful things to help humanity prosper.”

- Altman, during his deposition, on why he wanted to join OpenAI.

“I mean, he played a lot of video games.”

- Altman’s response to questioning during his deposition about Musk’s involvement in the early days of OpenAI.

“I estimate that I spend and have spent all the way through about a quarter of my time recruiting for OpenAI.”

“I think it’s hard to find people as successful as Elon Musk.”

“It doesn’t matter who wins if everyone dies.”

            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/863297/asus-pr-mess-rtx-5070-ti-end-of-life-statements-memory-shortages">Visit Original Website</a>

The RTX 5070 Ti will probably still be very hard to find on retail shelves.

The GPU market is turning into a mess again. Asus told Hardware Unboxed earlier this week that it was winding down production of its RTX 5070 Ti, but the PC maker is now walking back that claim and blaming “incomplete information” from its own Asus PR representatives.

“The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB have not been discontinued or designated as end-of-life (EOL),” says an Asus statement. “Asus has no plans to stop selling these models.”

That’s quite the opposite of what Asus told Hardware Unboxed, with the YouTube channel reporting that Asus “explicitly told us this model is currently facing a supply shortage and, as such, they have placed the model into end-of-life status.”

Here’s the full timeline, from Hardware Unboxed, of how this mess unfolded:

• We request RTX 5070 Ti samples from Asus (and other partners)• An Asus PR rep looks into it, comes back and says they cannot provide 5070 Tis due to supply constraints, saying their models are “end of life.”• We ask Asus to clarify whether the RTX 5070 Ti is end of life. They confirm it’s end of life.• We reach out to retailers to see whether they can purchase RTX 5070 Ti stock for their stores, to fact check Asus’ claims. They say there is no supply.• Given we have received an on the record statement from Asus and confirmed the supply constraints with retailers, we publish a video with this information.• Nvidia says all GeForce SKUs are being shipped.• Asus reaches out to clarify that Nvidia told Asus that the RTX 5070 Ti is not end of life, but that Asus are “streamlining some models.”• We publish that statement.• Asus reaches out again to provide another statement (the third statement we’ve received from Asus), now saying the 5070 Ti is not discontinued or end of life. This directly contradicts the original statement.• We immediately request RTX 5070 Ti samples now that the cards are not discontinued or end of life. We haven’t heard back yet.

A global shortage of conventional DRAM and NAND is putting the pressure on RAM and GPU prices, and we’re starting to see a lack of GPU stock or higher pricing. Asus blames fluctuations in supply for both the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB models due to the ongoing memory supply constraints that have affected production output. “As a result, availability may appear limited in certain markets, but this should not be interpreted as a production halt or product retirement,” says Asus.

Nvidia told us yesterday that it was still producing RTX 5070 Ti GPUs and continues “to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability.” Just how many RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB models will be available in the future is anyone’s guess. Perhaps they’ll be as limited in the real world as Nvidia’s own Founders Edition models, which are very rarely ever in stock.

            <div id="article-text">Fighting fires before they ever start, developers and homeowners in California are on the offense.

Down the street from the Los Angeles Angels’ stadium in Anaheim, a crowd gathers to watch two homes burn.

In less than 30 minutes, one structure is reduced to its smoldering, blackened wood frame, while the other, thanks to simple changes to its design, is remarkably unscathed. Of course, this was the point of the demonstration, which was held last June by the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) at a firefighting training center.

The heat from the burning demo home is fierce as we stand outside under a bright, cloudless sky. The plume of thick, black smoke is what eventually pushes me back from the front of the audience. But it’s still nothing like the worst blazes I remember growing up with in Southern California, when the sky glows a hazy orange and ash falls like snow.

Firefighters, housing developers, and insurance professionals gathered for the annual Pacific Coast Builders Conference who I talk to know what that kind of inferno feels like — or at least have to navigate the unthinkable loss left in its aftermath. It’s what brings us all here today — the hope that there are steps to take that can help a home survive. The same demonstration the previous year was enough to convince one builder to change course. “It was shocking,” says Steve Ruffner, a regional general manager and division president at KB Home. “That was when I was like, Okay, we’re in a high fire zone in Escondido. We got to see if we can do this.” KB Home, one of the most prolific homebuilders in the US, had already broken ground on Dixon Trail, a new community in Escondido, California. It was about to get a makeover to be more like the demo house built to withstand a blaze.

It’s the kind of neighborhood-scale action that’s becoming more crucial as wildfire risk rises with climate change. Wildfires are becoming too big a threat for any single homeowner, neighborhood, or even firefighting squad to just play defense. The fight is now collective and starts from the ground up, when homes are built. It continues with everyday actions that hold property owners accountable for their neighbors’ safety, too.

In many ways, Southern California is ground zero for this crusade. Here, builders, fire districts, and homeowner associations are figuring out how to keep living in an already fire-prone landscape that’s increasingly becoming a tinderbox. Preparing for disaster — as the state has done with earthquakes — is part of the ethos. When it comes to wildfires, the “big one” for greater Los Angeles arrived a year ago, when blazes destroyed more than 16,250 structures. Each time the winds pick up on a hot, dry day, that preparation is tested.

“If you just stand right here, which way is the wind blowing?” asks Dave McQuead, fire chief of the Rancho Santa Fe Fire District.

It’s a hot August day, and fortunately, the breeze is cool against our faces. We’re standing on a hill in a posh gated community of Rancho Santa Fe fittingly named Cielo, the Spanish word for sky or heaven.

But what some might otherwise appreciate as an ocean view with a breeze, McQuead sees through a more scrutinizing lens.

We’re looking down at a valley where the hills dip and slope into flatlands just before the ocean. The topography becomes a natural tunnel for coastal gales. If there happened to be a vehicle on fire below that transferred to vegetation, for example, the wind could easily blow heat and flames from that blaze straight to us. As one side of the valley burns, it would transfer heat to the other side of the slope — drying out the vegetation and priming it to also burn. It creates a convection column of gas, smoke, and ash. We’re standing on top of a natural chimney in the landscape.

Megafires start small, often with an ember. Homes that face the most risk often sit where forest or brush meets suburbia, along what’s technically called the wildland-urban interface (WUI — pronounced “woo-ee” in much more innocuous-sounding jargon). Here, a gale might easily fling embers from a forest fire into a neighborhood. An ember might land on a rosebush in a planter or drift into a home through a vent.

Once that first home starts to burn, it can make the situation more explosive for the rest of the community. There are more embers, and now direct flames threatening neighbors. Sheer radiant heat can cause nearby fire-prone materials to combust.

Those three elements combined — embers, direct flame contact, and radiant heat — are what burn communities to the ground, says Kimiko Barrett, lead research and policy analyst at the nonprofit Headwaters Economics.

Conversely, the best way to protect any single home is to harden the entire community against those threats. The goal is to limit weak points where embers might gain a foothold from which to spread into an inferno.

“What we do know about wildfire risk reduction to homes is that it has to occur at that neighborhood scale because of the nature of how homes burn down,” Barrett says. “It’s not a wildfire problem, it’s a structural ignition problem, and that requires a big shift in our paradigm and expectations of what it means to live with wildfires.”

Fire has always been a part of the ecology in some parts of the world, including much of California. Wildfires naturally clear debris, fertilize the soil, and help some seeds germinate. But in the future, living in harmony with those fires is going to take a more concerted effort.

European settlers threw the natural balance out of whack in California. They outlawed Indigenous practices of controlled burns to manage the land, wisdom that policymakers more recently started to heed by reintroducing prescribed burns. The timber industry also stomped out fires that would have been healthy for the forest and nearby communities. Years of all-out fire suppression have allowed dead vegetation to build up into loads of tinder that then fuel much larger conflagrations. Hotter, drier conditions with climate change also supercharge blazes. Human-caused climate change has extended California’s fire season and increased the number of acres burned.

At the same time, unaffordable housing in urban centers has pushed many residents farther into the wildland-urban interface, where they’re more vulnerable to fire. Nearly a third of housing across the US, more than 44 million homes, was located in WUI in 2020, according to federal data. Much of that development has taken place since the 1990s.

Avoiding high-risk areas might be one way to adapt to a warming, more fire-prone world. There’s also talk of “managed retreat,” coordinated efforts to abandon areas that are just too difficult to defend against escalating climate disasters like fires and floods. But that’s often not a feasible or fair option for people, especially when skyrocketing housing prices and rising temperatures that suck the landscape dry mean there’s nowhere safer to go.

McQuead brought me to that Cielo hilltop because the neighborhood is actually known for having survived an inferno, the Witch Creek Fire of 2007, thanks in large part to the proactive measures taken by its former fire chief, Erwin Willis. A decade earlier, the fire district became one of the first to establish new building codes to protect against fire, including residential fire sprinklers and defensible space surrounding homes.

The Witch Creek Fire forced some 21,000 residents within the fire district to evacuate. After the firestorm, the damage was one-sided. No structures were lost in Cielo or other newly-constructed communities in Rancho Santa Fe. More than 60 homes and outbuildings were destroyed by the blaze, but only in areas built before the new building code applied. It was stunning evidence that helped California adopt statewide building codes for fire-resistant construction the following year.

Back at the IBHS burn demonstration in Anaheim, I meet State Fire Marshal Daniel Berlant, who tells me about a pilot program that aims to provide financial assistance to Californians who can’t afford, or can’t physically do the tasks required, to harden a home against fire. After all, he says 90 percent of homes at risk of wildfire in California were built before the building code was updated in 2008.

“A home is significantly more likely to survive a wildfire when it has home-hardening retrofits built to today’s code paired with defensible space. But we continue to see those homes still burn as well,” Berlant says. “Hardening” is the technical term for making a home more resistant to embers, flames, and radiant heat. “And so what we continue to really gain out of our research is that it has to be done at neighborhood scale. If I do everything right, but based on density, my neighbor next to me doesn’t, we’re still both at risk.”

About 11 miles from Rancho Santa Fe, Escondido, California, has a higher risk of wildfire than 98 percent of communities in the US, according to the USDA Forest Service. Nevertheless, it’s still one of the most populous cities in San Diego County, with nearly 150,000 residents and more moving into newly built communities like Dixon Trail.

Dixon Trail is on the edge of town in Escondido, nestled at the foot of shrubby hills. When I ask Steve Ruffner why KB Home would build here despite the risk, he’s unfazed.

“You’re not going to be able to put a community like this in the middle of a city,” he says. Construction in an urban center would avoid the ‘wildland-urban interface’ — but there isn’t enough space to build rows of detached, single-family homes like we see here, and that’s what a lot of buyers want.

What he says next surprises me. By becoming the first neighborhood built in the US to meet IBHS’ home- and neighborhood-level wildfire resilience standards, what I thought would be a vulnerability in the location is now expected to be another firefighting tool. “We will be a backstop to prevent fire going to all those older homes surrounding us,” Ruffner says.

There are no real boundaries between Dixon Trail and the community next door, Eureka (which was not built by KB Home). But it’s easy to see where one ends and the next begins. The older neighborhood is noticeably greener, with manicured lawns, roses, hibiscus, and other bushes climbing up against the walls of homes.

Dixon Trail is purposefully more austere because these homes have been “hardened.” One of the clearest differences is the 5-foot moat of gravel and concrete surrounding the perimeter of each home, a buffer free of any potentially flammable plants or materials that’s called “defensible space.”

Other details are less obvious. Vents in many homes are meant to let outside air in under the floor or roof of a home; good airflow can prevent the moisture that leads to mold or rot. But that flow of air into the home can also let embers inside, potentially igniting a structure fire. With home hardening, vents are designed to block embers, covered with metal mesh to keep embers from sneaking into the house. The garage doors are all metal, with no plastic windows that might melt and let embers inside. Windows are often weak points, so those are all double-pane (instead of single-pane) with tempered glass that’s stronger and more heat-resistant.

Many of the measures are already required in newly built homes by California law, including covered vents and double-pane windows. KB Home followed even more extensive standards set by IBHS. It has since broken ground on another community in the Sacramento area similarly being built to meet IBHS standards at the home and neighborhood level. Here at Dixon Trail, what appears to be wood fencing is actually made of steel, and so are retaining walls. All the upgrades were cost neutral, according to Ruffner. Using recycled metal for fencing, for example, didn’t wind up costing more than heavy timber would have.

Nevertheless, these homes aren’t cheap. Houses in Dixon Trail start at around $1 million, which is close to the median price for the county. But in an already unaffordable housing market, the fire resilience measures are also meant to cut down on soaring insurance costs. I met Kifah Samara and his wife as they were moving into their new home in Dixon Trail in June. Samara coached a soccer team that occasionally played inside of the neighboring community of Eureka, and after spotting the construction, stopped into the Dixon Trail visitor center on a Saturday.

He’d been looking to buy a new home for four or five years already, but got an extra push this year. He says home insurance for his previous condo had jumped from roughly $750 a year to nearly $4,000 after the devastating fires nearby in the greater Los Angeles area in January 2025. Before then, his rate had typically only risen about 20 percent per year. “This year it was crazy,” he says. After moving into Dixon Trail, built to meet insurance industry-developed standards, he says he’s paying closer to $1,400 a year. “I think it was a good decision,” he tells me of the move.

The megafires that laid waste to the communities of Altadena and Pacific Palisades outside of LA weigh heavily on the minds of many of the people I met while reporting this story. “Now that we’ve seen entire cities burn down, if you’re going to start fresh, do it right,” Samara’s next-door neighbor Kevin Walton tells me. He and his wife moved in a couple weeks before we met to be closer to their daughter, who was about to give birth to their grandson. The fire-resilient measures, particularly the indoor sprinkler system, he says, were a plus. “It just gives some peace of mind.”

When I ask Len Gregory, who moved to Rancho Santa Fe about 10 years ago, what brought him here, he tells me emphatically, “The trees! The trees!”

The community’s eucalyptus trees are iconic; they’re even depicted on the Rancho Santa Fe Fire District’s emblem and a patch on Chief McQuead’s uniform. They’re not native to the region. Local lore says that a railroad company planted the trees in the early 1900s as a source of timber for the rail lines, and they’ve taken a foothold ever since. Their fragrant oil also happens to make these trees extremely flammable.

We’re surrounded by them at the Ewing Preserve, a nearly 25-acre parcel of protected land managed by Gregory’s HOA, also called Rancho Santa Fe. Before retiring, Gregory was a distributor of landscape equipment and irrigation products, which gives him a little expertise in leading the HOA’s forest health and preservation work. As much as he loves the trees, part of that work is to remove some of them — replacing the most fire-prone vegetation with less combustible, native species and thinning undergrowth.

It sounds like a hard sell, particularly when the trees are beloved to residents, including Gregory himself. But when it comes to fire mitigation, Gregory says, they’ll do whatever it takes.

“Quite frankly, we live in terror,” Gregory tells me before rattling off a history of infernos from the Witch Fire to the devastating January 2025 blazes surrounding Los Angeles. “I mean, you can’t live in Southern California — actually, anywhere in the West — without being terrified.”

A year after the fires that devastated Altadena and Pacific Palisades, many residents are still coping with the aftermath. After the public outpouring of support and solidarity from politicians, Hollywood celebrities, and philanthropists both near and far, survivors are still left reeling. Reality TV veteran Spencer Pratt, who was among those who lost their homes, announced a mayoral campaign for Los Angeles this month that’s largely fueled by his fury at officials for failing to stop the blazes.

Other people are navigating construction and insurance nightmares with far fewer resources and clout. Few homes have been rebuilt, while others are still standing but uninhabitable from the damage. And each time the region’s Santa Ana winds — which fanned the flames in January 2025 — kick up, it’s a reminder that another terrible fire could break out. It’s all the more reason for many Southern Californians to want to take action.

Here in the Ewing Preserve, much of the work is focused on removing any dead trees, and preventing beetle infestations from killing more. They want to remove any debris that can become “ladder fuel,” which could help flames climb to the tree canopy — a point at which blazes move faster and become harder to control. An even more ambitious project is underway nearby at another preserve called Arroyo along the San Dieguito River.

“Without this work, [firefighters] would be racing a speeding train,” says Jonathan Appelbaum, a biologist working with the nonprofit San Dieguito River Valley Conservancy.

With the blessing of the Rancho Santa Fe HOA that owns the land, the conservancy got a $1.5 million grant in 2024 from the California Wildlife Conservation Board to remove invasive trees — restoring the river corridor habitat into a natural firebreak. Firefighters use these breaks to try to stop an inferno from advancing; the idea is to create or rely on an existing barrier that flames can’t cross. A river and damp vegetation surrounding it is a great option, but less so if it’s choked off and overrun with more fire-prone trees that can fling embers across.

When I visit Arroyo with Applebaum, the river is little more than a trickle. It’s the dry season, but invasive trees aren’t helping. “Eucalyptus is like sticking a straw into the ground and sucking as hard as possible to drink all the water up,” he says.

Eucalyptus and palm trees are Applebaum’s biggest targets. It’s grueling work, particularly in the most dense and remote parts of the preserve, where they’ve had to resort to airlifting trees out by helicopter. Native willows, sycamores, and cottonwood trees are taking their place. Species that evolved to take advantage of the river’s hydrology here are more efficient with how they use water and manage to stay perennially hydrated, Appelbaum tells me. Their higher moisture content makes them less flammable than oil-filled eucalyptus and palms with dead fronds that light up like Roman candles. A year into the grant program, they had removed close to 80 percent of eucalyptus within the target 12-acre area.

Taking a community-wide approach to wildfire prevention is especially crucial for managing shared spaces like this preserve, which can help or hurt neighboring properties when fires approach. But the Rancho Santa Fe HOA is also being proactive when it comes to helping its residents maintain their individual properties. It has also partnered with the startup FireWatch to provide residents with aerial maps of their property that can show risks they might otherwise miss on the ground. By plane, FireWatch can actually use a multispectral camera system to map the health of trees and plants below. The cameras can read near-infrared wavelengths invisible to the naked eye. What looks like a green canopy in a regular image appears in shades of red and pink — with stressed or dying plants, perhaps infested by those pesky beetles, appearing more brown or gray.

“This is a tree in decline. I can tell that this is going to need treatment or it’s going to need to be removed,” Caitlin Kreutz, a biologist at SWCA Environmental Consultants who has worked with FireWatch and the Rancho Santa Fe HOA, says as we flip between looking at the green and pink images of a property from FireWatch’s home base at a small airport in Carlsbad. To the naked eye, she says, it’s just a green tree. But in infrared, it’s much duller in color than its neighbors. Besides, as a homeowner, you’re not going to be able to look down on your tree’s foliage to spot any subtle changes because you’re underneath it. “This just gives a whole other perspective,” Kreutz says.

In 2025, the Rancho Santa Fe HOA was officially designated as a Firewise community, which recognizes adherence to another set of nationally recognized guidance for reducing wildfire risk that was developed by the National Fire Protection Association. The designation saves residents up to 5 percent on their insurance premiums, according to the HOA.

“Communities tend to stand or fall together,” says John Bailey, a professor in the College of Forestry at Oregon State University who studies fire management. “I see a key solution being taking the information that we have [on home-hardening and] expanding it to a critical number if not all neighbors.”

If each home is also relying on their neighbors to do their part, that also means that every convert reached can have an outsize impact with the actions they take. That’s ultimately what the burn demo I attended in Anaheim was all about. After KB Home’s Steve Ruffner attended a similar IBHS demo in 2024 on a whim, his company became a sponsor of the event in 2025.

“I was here just like you last year getting sunburned and wondering what the heck this was about,” Ruffner says to the crowd gathered at the opening of the event. “I can tell you I’ve lived through a lot of red flag days just like you … and I just want to thank you for coming to watch this because it changed my life.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">﻿Fifteen years after laying the groundwork for casting, Netflix has pulled the plug on the technology, but there’s still life left in second-screen playback control.

﻿Fifteen years after laying the groundwork for casting, Netflix has pulled the plug on the technology, but there’s still life left in second-screen playback control.

This is Lowpass by Janko Roettgers, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.

Last month, Netflix made the surprising decision to kill off a key feature: With no prior warning, the company removed the ability to cast videos from its mobile apps to a wide range of smart TVs and streaming devices. Casting is now only supported on older Chromecast streaming adapters that didn’t ship with a remote, Nest Hub smart displays, and select Vizio and Compal smart TVs.

That’s a stunning departure for the company. Prior to those changes, Netflix allowed casting to a wide range of devices that officially supported Google’s casting technology, including Android TVs made by companies like Philips, Polaroid, Sharp, Skyworth, Soniq, Sony, Toshiba, and Vizio, according to an archived version of Netflix’s website.

But the streaming service didn’t stop there. Prior to last month’s changes, Netflix also offered what the company called “Netflix 2nd Screen” casting functionality on a wide range of additional devices, including Sony’s PlayStation, TVs made by LG and Samsung, Roku TVs and streaming adapters, and many other devices. Basically, if a smart TV or streaming device was running the Netflix app, it most likely also supported casting.

That’s because Netflix actually laid the groundwork for this technology 15 years ago. Back in 2011, some of the company’s engineers were exploring ways to more tightly integrate people’s phones with their TVs. “At about the same time, we learned that the YouTube team was interested in much the same thing — they had already started to do some work on [second] screen use cases,” said Scott Mirer, director of product management at Netflix at the time, in 2013.

The two companies started to collaborate and enlist help from TV makers like Sony and Samsung. The result was DIAL (short for “Discovery and Launch”) — an open second-screen protocol that formalized casting.

In 2012, Netflix was the first major streaming service to add a casting feature to its mobile app, which at the time allowed PlayStation 3 owners to launch video playback from their phones. A year later, Google launched its very first Chromecast dongle, which took ideas from DIAL and incorporated them into Google’s own proprietary casting technology.

For a while, casting was extremely popular. Google sold over 100 million Chromecast adapters, and Vizio even built a whole TV around casting, which shipped with a tablet instead of a remote. (It flopped. Turns out people still love physical remotes.)

But as smart TVs became more capable, and streaming services invested more heavily into native apps on those TVs, the need for casting gradually decreased. At CES, a streaming service operator told me that casting used to be absolutely essential for his service. Nowadays, even among the service’s Android users, only about 10 percent are casting.

As for Netflix, it’s unlikely the company will change its tune on casting. Netflix declined to comment when asked about discontinuing the feature. My best guess is that casting was sacrificed in favor of new features like cloud gaming and interactive voting. Gaming in particular already involves multidevice connectivity, as Netflix uses phones as game controllers. Adding casting to that mix simply might have proven too complex.

However, not everyone has given up on casting. In fact, the technology is still gaining new supporters. Last month, Apple added Google Cast support to its Apple TV app on Android for the first time. And over the past two years, both Samsung and LG incorporated Google’s casting tech into some of their TV sets.

“Google Cast continues to be a key experience that we’re invested in — bringing the convenience of seamless content sharing from phones to TVs, whether you’re at home or staying in a hotel,” says Google’s Android platform PM Neha Dixit. “Stay tuned for more to come this year.”

Google’s efforts are getting some competition from the Connectivity Standards Alliance, the group behind the Matter smart home standard, which developed its own Matter Casting protocol. Matter Casting promises to be a more open approach toward casting and in theory allows streaming services and device makers to bring second-screen use cases to their apps and devices without having to strike deals with Google.

“We are a longtime advocate of using open technology standards to give customers more choice when it comes to using their devices and services,” says Amazon Device Software & Services VP Tapas Roy, whose company is a major backer of Matter and its casting tech. “We welcome and support media developers that want to build to an open standard with the implementation of Matter Casting.”

Thus far, support has been limited though. Fire TVs and Echo Show displays remain the only devices to support Matter Casting, and Amazon’s own apps were long the only ones to make use of the feature. Last month, Tubi jumped on board as well by incorporating Matter Casting into its mobile apps.

Connectivity Standards Alliance technology strategist Christopher LaPré acknowledges that Matter Casting has yet to turn into a breakthrough hit. “To be honest, I have Fire TVs, and I’ve never used it,” he says.

Besides a lack of available content, LaPré also believes Matter Casting is a victim of brand confusion. The problem: TV makers have begun to incorporate Matter into their devices to let consumers control smart lights and thermostats from the couch. Because of that, a TV that dons the Matter logo doesn’t necessarily support Matter Casting.

However, LaPré also believes that Matter Casting could get a boost from two new developments: Matter recently added support for cameras, which adds a new kind of homegrown content people may want to cast. And the consortium is also still working on taking casting beyond screens.

“Audio casting is something that we’re working on,” LaPré confirms. “A lot of speaker companies are interested in that.” The plan is to launch Matter audio casting later this year, at which point device makers, publishers, and consumers could also give video casting another look.

            <div id="article-text">Meta continues to trickle out the bad news for VR.

Meta continues to trickle out the bad news for VR.

Two months before it changed its name to “Meta,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally introduced us to his metaverse for work: Horizon Workrooms, envisioned as a virtual space for workers to collaborate. Today, the company announced it’s shutting that space down: “Meta has made the decision to discontinue Workrooms as a standalone app, effective February 16, 2026,” reads the note tucked away on a help page.

Meta will also no longer sell its headsets and software as a service for businesses, another help page reads: “We are stopping sales of Meta Horizon managed services and commercial SKUs of Meta Quest, effective February 20, 2026.”

Meta just laid off roughly 10 percent of its entire Reality Labs division, over 1,000 jobs. In the aftermath, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Zuckerberg has changed his mind about what the word “metaverse” actually means. Mobile yes, smart glasses yes, but maybe not VR.

First, we learned that Meta’s layoffs had completely shuttered three of Meta’s hard-won VR game studios, after previously closing another in 2024. Soon, it came out that it’s abandoning future development on Supernatural, its standout VR fitness app, and that it has reportedly gutted the studio behind Batman: Arkham Shadow as well.

What’s next, Horizon Worlds? Maybe Meta will draw the line there, because it’s one of the few VR experiences Meta has made available on mobile phones too; Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth already said the company’s Horizon team will “double down on bringing the best Horizon experiences and AI creator tools to mobile” in a memo obtained by Bloomberg.

Bloomberg writes that “Meta will continue to develop the metaverse, but with a focus on mobile phones instead of the fully immersive VR headsets that the company initially imagined.” To be clear, the term “metaverse” was coined by Snow Crash author Neal Stephenson to describe a fully immersive shared VR world, but I suppose mobile makes sense if you consider Fortnite to be a metaverse and don’t need the “fully immersive” part.

It stings for true believers in Oculus VR, though and for those who thought more would come out of Facebook buying up all those VR game studios. But it seems the primary audience for Meta’s VR headsets are young teens and kids now, and so perhaps business-to-business VR isn’t where the resources should go.

It appears that Meta Workrooms will shut down abruptly on February 16th, to the point that “any data associated with Workrooms will be deleted.” The company recommends trying Arthur, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom Workplace instead and also writes that the Meta Quest Remote Desktop app will stick around if you want to emulate multiple virtual monitors in your headset.

For Meta Horizon managed services, the company writes that existing customers can continue to access those through January 4th, 2030, and that licenses will be free after February 16th of this year.

Depending who you ask, AI-powered coding is either giving software developers an unprecedented productivity boost or churning out masses of poorly designed code that saps their attention and sets software projects up for serious long term-maintenance problems.

The problem is right now, it’s not easy to know which is true.

As tech giants pour billions into large language models (LLMs), coding has been touted as the technology’s killer app. Executives enamored with the potential are pushing engineers to lean into an AI-powered future. But after speaking to more than 30 developers, technology executives, analysts, and researchers, MIT Technology Review found that the picture is not as straightforward as it might seem. Read the full story.

Generative coding is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Learn more about why that is, and check out the rest of the list!

This story was also part of our Hype Correction package. You can read the rest of the stories here.

Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published our annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

“I am very annoyed. I’m very disappointed. I’m seriously frustrated.”

—Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla tells attendees at a healthcare conference this week his feelings about the anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been implementing, Bloomberg reports.

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published its annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies. As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he bought a new laptop and iPhone. He wanted to reduce the risk of having his personal devices confiscated, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, it’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing. Read the full story.

As thousands of companies trumpet their plans to cut carbon pollution, a small group of sustainability consultants has emerged as the go-to arbiter of corporate climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, helps businesses develop a timetable for action to shrink their climate footprint through some combination of cutting greenhouse-gas pollution and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After years of small-scale sustainability work, SBTi is growing rapidly, and governments are paying attention.

But while the group has earned praise for reeling the private sector into constructive conversations about climate emissions, its rising influence has also attracted scrutiny and raised questions about why a single organization is setting the standards for many of the world’s largest companies.

            <div id="article-text">Happy New Year! I know it’s a bit late to say, but it never quite feels like the year has started until the new edition of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list comes out.

For 25 years, MIT Technology Review has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.

And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.

I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.

Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.

Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.

There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.

In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.

Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.

Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.

There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.

Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.

Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.

This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.

Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.

(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)

There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Africa is still early in the process of adopting AI technologies. But researchers say the continent is uniquely hospitable to it for several reasons, including a relatively young and increasingly well-educated population, a rapidly growing ecosystem of AI startups, and lots of potential consumers.

However, ambitious efforts to develop AI tools that answer the needs of Africans face numerous hurdles. Taken together, researchers worry, they could hold Africa’s AI sector back and hamper its efforts to pave its own pathway in the global AI race. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

“AI will replace humans”, you heard this before.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.

            <h2>Belgian cybersecurity startup becomes unicorn</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/aikido-security-becomes-unicorn">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <h2>AI is old news. Generative AI is the future.</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/generative-ai-is-the-future">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.
