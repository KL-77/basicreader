            <h2>Conservative lawmakers want porn taxes. Critics say they’re unconstitutional.</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/conservative-lawmakers-want-porn-taxes-critics-say-theyre-unconstitutional/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As age-verification laws continue to dismantle the adult industry—and determine the future of free speech on the internet—a Utah lawmaker proposed a bill this week that would enforce a tax on porn sites that operate within the state.

Introduced by state senator Calvin Musselman, a Republican, the bill would impose a 7 percent tax on total receipts “from sales, distributions, memberships, subscriptions, performances, and content amounting to material harmful to minors that is produced, sold, filmed, generated, or otherwise based” in Utah. If passed, the bill would go into effect in May and would also require adult sites to pay a $500 annual fee to the State Tax Commission. Per the legislation, the money made from the tax will be used by Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services to provide more mental health support for teens.

Musselman did not respond to a request for comment.

A new age of American conservatism commands the political arena, and more US lawmakers are calling for additional restrictions on adult content. In September, Alabama became the first state to impose a porn tax on adult entertainment companies (10 percent) following the passage of age-verification mandates, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content. Pennsylvania lawmakers are also eyeing a bill that would tax consumers an additional 10 percent on “subscriptions to and one-time purchases from online adult content platforms,” despite already requiring them to pay a 6 percent sales and use tax for the purchase of digital products, two state senators wrote in a memo in October. Other states have flirted with the idea of a porn tax in the past. In 2019, Arizona state senator Gail Griffin, a Republican, proposed taxing adult content distributors to help fund the border wall, a key priority during Donald Trump’s first presidential term. So far, 25 US states have passed a form of age verification.

Although efforts to criminalize participants in the sex work industry have been ongoing for years—with new regulations unfolding at a moment of heightened online surveillance and censorship—targeted taxes have failed to gain widespread approval because the legality of such laws is up for debate.

“This kind of porn tax is blatantly unconstitutional,” says Evelyn Douek, an associate professor of law at Stanford Law School. “It singles out a particular type of protected speech for disfavored treatment, purely because the legislature doesn’t like it—that’s exactly what the First Amendment is designed to protect against. Utah may not like porn, but as the Supreme Court affirmed only last year, adults have a fully protected right to access it.”

Utah, Alabama, and Pennsylvania are among the 16 states that have adopted resolutions declaring porn a public health crisis. “We realize this is a bold assertion not everyone will agree on, but it’s the full-fledged truth,” Utah governor Gary Herbert tweeted in 2016 after signing the resolution. One of Utah’s earliest statewide responses to the proliferation of adult content happened in 2001, when it became the first state to create an office for sexually explicit issues by hiring an obscenity and pornography complaints ombudsman. The position—dubbed the “porn czar”—was terminated in 2017.

“Age restriction is a very complex subject that brings with it data privacy concerns and the potential for uneven and inconsistent application for different digital platforms,” Alex Kekesi, vice president of brand and community at Pornhub, told WIRED in a previous conversation. In November, the company urged Google, Microsoft, and Apple to enact device-based verification in their app stores and across their operating systems. “We have seen several states and countries try to impose platform-level age verification requirements, and they have all failed to adequately protect children.” To comply with the new age gate mandates, Pornhub has currently blocked access to users in 23 states.

Critics argue that age verification has never been about protecting children but rather scrubbing porn from the internet. A video leaked in 2024 by the Centre for Climate Reporting showed Russell Vought, a Trump ally and Project 2025 coauthor, calling age verification laws a “back door” tactic to a federal porn ban.

Sites like OnlyFans and Pornhub have brought platform-dependent sex work into the mainstream, but they have also made it easier to police adult entertainers and consumers. As more states begin to implement added tariffs on sex work, creators will bear the brunt of the new laws more than anyone.

The skewed ideology of cultural conservatism that is taking shape under Trump 2.0 wants to punish sexual expression, says Mike Stabile, director of public policy at the Free Speech Coalition, a trade association for the adult industry in the US. “When we talk about free speech, we generally mean the freedom to speak, the ability to speak freely without government interference. But in this case, free also means not having to pay for the right to do so. A government tax on speech limits that right to those who can afford it.”

According to company policy, OnlyFans complies with all tax requirements in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Creators are responsible for their own tax affairs. Pornhub, which is currently blocked in Utah and Alabama, did not respond to a request for comment.

Douek notes that following the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold age-verification laws in Texas, states can legally regulate minors’ access to sexually explicit material, “but a porn tax does nothing to limit minors’ access to this speech—it simply makes it more expensive to provide this content to adults.” A 2022 report from Common Sense Media, a youth advocacy nonprofit, found that 73 percent of teens age 13 to 17 have watched adult content online. Today, young people regularly access NSFW content via social media, on platforms like X and Snap. Last year, a survey by the UK’s Office of the Children’s Commissioner reported that 59 percent of minors are being exposed to porn by accident, primarily via social media, up from 38 percent in 2023.

In Alabama, as would be the case with Utah, revenue raised by the tax is being used for behavioral health services, including prevention, treatment, and recovery support for young people.

Alabama state representative Ben Robbins, the bill’s Republican sponsor, said in an interview last year that adult content was “a driver in causing mental health issues” in the state. It’s a common argument among lawmakers pushing for a nationwide porn ban. Some scientific studies suggest that adolescent exposure to porn increases rates of depression, low self-esteem, and normalized violence, but health professionals have never reached a consensus on the matter.

With lawmakers working to reframe the issue around underage harm, Stabile says it’s critical to remember that adult content isn’t different from any other kind of protected speech, noting that content-specific taxes on speech have repeatedly been struck down by the courts as unconstitutional censorship.

“What if a state decided that Covid misinformation was straining state health resources and taxed newsletters who promoted it? What if the federal government decided to require a costly license to start a podcast? What if a state decided to tax a certain newspaper it didn’t like?” he says. “Porn isn’t some magical category of speech separate from movies, streaming services, or other forms of entertainment. Adult businesses already pay taxes on the income they earn, just as every other business does. Taxing them because of imagined harms is not only dangerous to our industry, it sets a dangerous precedent for government power.”

            <h2>SpaceX gets FCC permission to launch another 7,500 Starlink satellites</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/spacex-gets-fcc-permission-to-launch-another-7500-starlink-satellites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX today received US permission to launch another 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites, bringing its total authorization to 15,000 Gen2 satellites including those previously approved.

“Under this grant, SpaceX is authorized to construct, deploy, and operate an additional 7,500 Gen2 Starlink satellites, bringing the total to 15,000 satellites worldwide,” the Federal Communications Commission announced today. “This expansion will enable SpaceX to deliver high-speed, low-latency Internet service globally, including enhanced mobile and supplemental coverage from space.”

The FCC gave SpaceX permission for the first set of 7,500 satellites in December 2022. The agency deferred action on the rest of the second-generation constellation at the time and limited the first batch to certain altitudes, saying it needed to “address concerns about orbital debris and space safety” before approving the full bunch.

The FCC said today’s order allows SpaceX to “upgrade the Gen2 Starlink satellites with advanced form factors and cutting-edge technology,” and “operate across Ku-, Ka-, V-, E-, and W-band frequencies, supporting both Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) and Mobile Satellite Service (MSS).” The FCC said it is waiving “obsolete requirements that prevented overlapping beam coverage and enhanced capacity,” and is letting SpaceX “add new orbital shells at altitudes ranging from 340 km to 485 km, optimizing coverage and performance.”

The news follows SpaceX’s announcement of maneuvers that will lower about 4,400 of the company’s existing satellites from an altitude of 341 miles (550 kilometers) to 298 miles (480 kilometers) during 2026. SpaceX said it is making the change to increase space safety as the lower altitudes have less debris that satellites could collide with.

The 2022 authorization for the first 7,500 satellites didn’t include mobile service, but the FCC decided in November 2024 that SpaceX could use those satellites to provide Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) in the US. Starlink’s mobile system provides service to smartphones in areas not covered by terrestrial cellular networks.

T-Mobile is using Starlink in the US, and the satellite operator has partnerships with carriers overseas. With today’s FCC authorization, Starlink will be able to provide both fixed and mobile service from all 15,000 second-generation satellites.

SpaceX also recently struck a $17 billion deal to buy spectrum licenses from EchoStar, which will give it 50 Mhz of mobile spectrum and reduce its reliance on cellular carriers. SpaceX has been leasing 10 MHz of spectrum from T-Mobile to provide supplemental service in the US.

Starlink is separately planning to launch yet another 15,000 satellites that are designed for mobile service. SpaceX asked the FCC to approve this plan in September 2025, saying the “new system will offer a new generation of MSS connectivity, supporting voice, texting, and high-speed data.”

Starlink requests for FCC authorization often face opposition from other satellite firms, and the application for 15,000 more satellites is no exception. Viasat filed a petition to deny the application on Monday this week.

“This proposed expansion of SpaceX’s operating authority would give it an even greater ability and incentive to foreclose other operators from accessing and using limited orbital and spectrum resources on a competitive basis,” Viasat told the FCC. “At the same time, the proposed operations would generate insurmountable interference risks for other spectrum users and the customers they serve, preclude other operators from accessing and using scarce spectral and orbital resources on an equitable basis, undermine and foreclose competition and innovation, and otherwise harm the public.”

Globalstar also filed a petition to deny, and several other satellite operators raised objections. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has generally been a supporter of SpaceX and Elon Musk, however. Carr alleged that the Biden administration targeted Musk’s companies for “regulatory harassment,” and in his current role as chairman Carr pressured EchoStar into selling the spectrum licenses that SpaceX is now buying.

In today’s press release announcing the latest authorization, Carr said that “the FCC has given SpaceX the green light to deliver unprecedented satellite broadband capabilities, strengthen competition, and help ensure that no community is left behind.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/esa-considers-righting-the-wrongs-of-ariane-6-by-turning-it-into-a-franken-rocket/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It took a while, but a consensus has emerged in Europe that the continent’s space industry needs to develop reusable rockets. How to do it and how much to spend on it remain unresolved questions.

Much of the discourse around reusable rockets in Europe has focused on developing a brand new rocket that might eventually replace the Ariane 6, which debuted less than two years ago but still uses the use it and lose it model embraced by the launch industry for most of the Space Age.

The European Space Agency (ESA) is offering money to emerging rocket companies in Europe to prove their small satellite launchers can do the job. ESA is also making money available to incentivize rocket upgrades to haul heavier cargo into orbit. ESA, the European Commission, and national governments are funding rocket hoppers to demonstrate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies. While there is significant money behind these efforts, the projects are not unified, and progress has been slow.

Now, there’s a proposal to retrofit the existing Ariane 6 rocket design for partial reuse. ArianeGroup, a 50/50 joint venture between Airbus and Safran, won a contract from the European Space Agency’s Boosters for European Space Transportation (BEST!) initiative in late 2024.

The origins of the Ariane 6 rocket’s design can be traced back to 2014, when Airbus and Safran unveiled the architecture that finally began flying in 2024. The rocket uses an expendable design, with a cryogenic core stage and two or four strap-on solid rocket boosters, depending on the demands of the particular mission.

At the time, SpaceX had already announced plans to recover and reuse its Falcon 9 boosters. SpaceX recovered the first Falcon 9 booster in 2015, then reused one for the first time in 2017. Officials in Europe were betting against SpaceX’s success and lost. Blue Origin joined SpaceX in successfully landing an orbital-class booster last year, and several Chinese companies are close to replicating the achievement.

Bruno Le Maire, the former French finance minister, said in 2021 that the Ariane 6 was a “bad strategic choice.” More recently, in October of last year, the head of ESA said the continent’s space industry must “catch up” with international competitors like SpaceX and develop a reusable launcher “relatively fast.”

In its submission to ESA’s BEST! initiative, ArianeGroup proposes replacing the Ariane 6 rocket’s solid-fueled side boosters with new liquid-fueled boosters. The boosters would be developed by MaiaSpace, a French subsidiary of ArianeGroup working on its own partially reusable small satellite launcher. MaiaSpace and ArianeGroup would convert the Maia rocket’s methane-fueled booster for use on the Ariane 6.

ArianeGroup’s proposal was first reported by European Spaceflight, which said the concept presented to ESA is similar to an ArianeGroup proposal from 2022, when the company described the liquid reusable boosters as a “plug-and-play” alternative to Ariane 6’s solid-fueled boosters, helping reduce operating costs and increase launch rates.

The details of ArianeGroup’s newest proposal have not been published, but the concept was summarized in a paper presented at the European Conference for Aeronautics and Space Sciences in 2025.

Isar Aerospace, a German rocket startup, won a separate BEST! contract from ESA to study a demonstrator for a reusable first stage based on the company’s light-class Spectrum rocket. The Spectrum rocket’s initial design is expendable. Its first test flight last year ended in failure, and Isar is readying the second Spectrum rocket for another launch attempt later this month.

ESA asked ArianeGroup and Isar Aerospace to assess the feasibility of their proposals, develop technology and system development plans, and define plans and costs for a “major flight demonstration.”

MaiaSpace’s rocket won’t launch until 2027, at the earliest, and it’s unlikely any decision to use it as the basis for new Ariane 6 boosters will bear fruit until long after Maia flies on its own. Even if ESA and ArianeGroup take this route, the Ariane 6 rocket would still be predominantly expendable.

It’s infeasible to recover the Ariane 6’s core stage for many reasons. Chief among them is that the main stage burns for more than seven minutes on an Ariane 6 flight, reaching speeds about twice as fast as SpaceX’s Falcon 9 booster achieves during its two-and-a-half minutes of operation during launch. As a result, the booster would have to rid itself of much more energy when it comes back through the atmosphere. The Ariane 6’s core stage also has just a single engine, whereas SpaceX, Blue Origin, and others use multi-engine designs to better control the rocket’s descent and landing.

The Ariane 6’s payload shroud, used to protect satellites during the first few minutes of launch, is also not reusable. The upper stage is single-use, too. This is a hard problem to solve, but companies like SpaceX and Stoke Space are already working on new rockets with recoverable and reusable upper stages.

Swapping out Ariane 6’s solid rocket motors for reusable liquid boosters makes some economic sense for ArianeGroup. The proposal would bring the development and production of the boosters under full control of ArianeGroup and its French subsidiary, cutting Italy’s solid rocket motor developer, Avio, out of the program.

Introducing the liquid-fueled boosters might also be a way for ArianeGroup to rapidly gain experience in landing and reusing rockets. Each Ariane 6 launch would have multiple boosters, likely two or four, so a single Ariane 6 flight would double or quadruple the flight test data available from just a single booster.

But with this proposal, ArianeGroup is still trying to catch up to where the bleeding edge of the launch industry was 10 or 15 years ago, not where SpaceX, Blue Origin, and others are today, and a far cry from where Europe’s competition in rocketry will be by the time any such an Ariane 6 Franken-rocket could ever reach the launch pad.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A measles outbreak in South Carolina that began in October continues to rage, with the state health department reporting Friday that nearly 100 new cases have been identified just in the last three days.

In a regularly scheduled update this afternoon, the health department said 99 cases were identified since Tuesday, bringing the outbreak total to 310 cases. There are currently 200 people in quarantine and nine in isolation. However, the outbreak is expanding so quickly and with so many exposure sites that health officials are struggling to trace cases and identify people at risk.

“An increasing number of public exposure sites are being identified with likely hundreds more people exposed who are not aware they should be in quarantine if they are not immune to measles,” Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist and the health department’s incident commander for the measles outbreak, said in the announcement. “Previous measles transmission studies have shown that one measles case can result in up to 20 new infections among unvaccinated contacts.”

The outbreak is centered in the northwestern corner of the state, with cases concentrated in Spartanburg County. According to state data, in the 2024–2025 school year, only 90 percent of students in the county were fully vaccinated. That’s well below the target of 95 percent vaccination coverage that prevents vaccine-preventable infections from spreading. However, the county-wide vaccination rate likely obscures pockets where vaccination rates are even lower, making the virus more likely to spread.

Measles is considered one of the most infectious diseases known to humans. It spreads through the air and can linger in a room’s airspace for up to two hours after an infected person has been present. In an exposure event, up to 90 percent of people who are unvaccinated will become infected.

The disease usually develops seven to 14 days after an exposure, but it can take up to 21 days (which is the length of quarantine). Once it develops, it’s marked by a high fever and a telltale rash that starts on the head and spreads downward. People are contagious for four days before the rash develops and four days after it appears. Complications can range from ear infections and diarrhea to encephalitis (swelling of the brain), pneumonia, death in up to 3 out of 1,000 children, and, in very rare cases, a fatal neurological condition that can develop seven to 10 years after the acute infection (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis).

Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is considered 97 percent effective against the virus, and that protection is considered lifelong. Ninety-nine percent of the 310 cases in the South Carolina outbreak are in people who are unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or have an unknown vaccination status (only 2 people were vaccinated).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which only has data as of January 6, has tallied three confirmed cases for this year (two in South Carolina and one in North Carolina, linked to the South Carolina outbreak). Since then, South Carolina reported 26 cases on Tuesday and 99 today, totaling 125. North Carolina also reported three additional cases Tuesday, again linked to the South Carolina outbreak. In all, that brings the US tally to at least 131 just nine days into the year.

In 2025, the country recorded 2,144 confirmed cases, the most cases seen since 1991. Three people died, including two otherwise-healthy children. In 2000, the US declared measles eliminated, meaning that it was no longer continuously circulating within the country. With ongoing outbreaks, including the one in South Carolina, the country’s elimination status is at risk.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-dont-make-bite-sized-content-for-llms-if-you-care-about-search-rank/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Search engine optimization, or SEO, is a big business. While some SEO practices are useful, much of the day-to-day SEO wisdom you see online amounts to superstition. An increasingly popular approach geared toward LLMs called “content chunking” may fall into that category. In the latest installment of Google’s Search Off the Record podcast, John Mueller and Danny Sullivan say that breaking content down into bite-sized chunks for LLMs like Gemini is a bad idea.

You’ve probably seen websites engaging in content chunking and scratched your head, and for good reason—this content isn’t made for you. The idea is that if you split information into smaller paragraphs and sections, it is more likely to be ingested and cited by generative AI bots like Gemini. So you end up with short paragraphs, sometimes with just one or two sentences, and lots of subheds formatted like questions one might ask a chatbot.

According to Sullivan, this is a misconception, and Google doesn’t use such signals to improve ranking. “One of the things I keep seeing over and over in some of the advice and guidance and people are trying to figure out what do we do with the LLMs or whatever, is that turn your content into bite-sized chunks, because LLMs like things that are really bite size, right?” said Sullivan. “So… we don’t want you to do that.”

The conversation, which begins around the podcast’s 18-minute mark, illustrates the folly of jumping on the latest SEO trend. Sullivan notes that he has consulted engineers at Google before making this proclamation. Apparently, the best way to rank on Google continues to be creating content for humans rather than machines. That ensures long-term search exposure, because the behavior of human beings—what they choose to click on—is an important signal for Google.

Google only provides general SEO recommendations, leaving the Internet’s SEO experts to cast bones and read tea leaves to gauge how the search algorithm works. This approach has borne fruit in the past, but not every SEO suggestion is a hit.

The tumultuous current state of the Internet, defined by inconsistent traffic and rapidly expanding use of AI, may entice struggling publishers to try more SEO snake oil like content chunking. When traffic is scarce, people will watch for any uptick and attribute that to the changes they have made. When the opposite happens, well, it’s just a bad day.

The new content superstition may appear to work at first, but at best, that’s an artifact of Google’s current quirks—the company isn’t building LLMs to like split-up content. Sullivan admits there may be “edge cases” where content chunking appears to work.

“Great. That’s what’s happening now, but tomorrow the systems may change,” he said. “You’ve made all these things that you did specifically for a ranking system, not for a human being because you were trying to be more successful in the ranking system, not staying focused on the human being. And then the systems improve, probably the way the systems always try to improve, to reward content written for humans. All that stuff that you did to please this LLM system that may or may not have worked, may not carry through for the long term.”

We probably won’t see chunking go away as long as publishers can point to a positive effect. However, Google seems to feel that chopping up content for LLMs is not a viable future for SEO.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/cloudflare-may-pull-servers-out-of-italy-over-order-that-it-block-pirate-sites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italy fined Cloudflare 14.2 million euros for refusing to block access to pirate sites on its 1.1.1.1 DNS service, the country’s communications regulatory agency, AGCOM, announced yesterday. Cloudflare said it will fight the penalty and threatened to remove all of its servers from Italian cities.

AGCOM issued the fine under Italy’s controversial Piracy Shield law, saying that Cloudflare was required to disable DNS resolution of domain names and routing of traffic to IP addresses reported by copyright holders. The law provides for fines up to 2 percent of a company’s annual turnover, and the agency said it applied a fine equal to 1 percent.

The fine relates to a blocking order issued to Cloudflare in February 2025. Cloudflare argued that installing a filter applying to the roughly 200 billion daily requests to its DNS system would significantly increase latency and negatively affect DNS resolution for sites that aren’t subject to the dispute over piracy.

AGCOM rejected Cloudflare’s arguments. The agency said the required blocking would impose no risk on legitimate websites because the targeted IP addresses were all uniquely intended for copyright infringement.

In a September 2025 report on Piracy Shield, researchers said they found “hundreds of legitimate websites unknowingly affected by blocking, unknown operators experiencing service disruption, and illegal streamers continuing to evade enforcement by exploiting the abundance of address space online, leaving behind unusable and polluted address ranges.” This is “a conservative lower-bound estimate,” the report said.

The Piracy Shield law was adopted in 2024. “To effectively tackle live sports piracy, its broad blocking powers aim to block piracy-related domain names and IP addresses within 30 minutes,” TorrentFreak wrote in an article today about the Cloudflare fine.

Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince wrote today that Cloudflare already “had multiple legal challenges pending against the underlying scheme” and will “fight the unjust fine.”

“Yesterday a quasi-judicial body in Italy fined Cloudflare $17 million for failing to go along with their scheme to censor the Internet,” Prince wrote. He continued:

The scheme, which even the EU has called concerning, required us within a mere 30 minutes of notification to fully censor from the Internet any sites a shadowy cabal of European media elites deemed against their interests. No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency. It required us to not just remove customers, but also censor our 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver meaning it risked blacking out any site on the Internet. And it required us not just to censor the content in Italy but globally. In other words, Italy insists a shadowy, European media cabal should be able to dictate what is and is not allowed online.

Prince said he will discuss the matter with US government officials next week and that Cloudflare is “happy to discuss this with Italian government officials who, so far, have been unwilling to engage beyond issuing fines.” In addition to challenging the fine, Prince said Cloudflare is “considering the following actions: 1) discontinuing the millions of dollars in pro bono cyber security services we are providing the upcoming Milano-Cortina Olympics; 2) discontinuing Cloudflare’s Free cyber security services for any Italy-based users; 3) removing all servers from Italian cities; and 4) terminating all plans to build an Italian Cloudflare office or make any investments in the country.”

“Play stupid games, win stupid prizes,” Prince wrote.

AGCOM said today that in the past two years, the Piracy Shield law disabled over 65,000 domain names and about 14,000 IP addresses. Italian authorities also previously ordered Google to block pirate sites at the DNS level.

The Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a trade group that represents tech companies including Cloudflare and Google, has criticized the Piracy Shield law. “Italian authorities have included virtual private networks (VPN) and public DNS resolvers in the Piracy Shield, which are services fundamental to the protection of free expression and not appropriate tools for blocking,” the CCIA said in a January 2025 letter to European Commission officials.

The CCIA added that “the Piracy Shield raises a significant number of concerns which can inadvertently affect legitimate online services, primarily due to the potential for overblocking.” The letter said that in October 2024, “Google Drive was mistakenly blocked by the Piracy Shield system, causing a three-hour blackout for all Italian users, while 13.5 percent of users were still blocked at the IP level, and 3 percent were blocked at the DNS level after 12 hours.”

The Italian system “aims to automate the blocking process by allowing rights holders to submit IP addresses directly through the platform, following which ISPs have to implement a block,” the CCIA said. “Verification procedures between submission and blocking are not clear, and indeed seem to be lacking. Additionally, there is a total lack of redress mechanisms for affected parties, in case a wrong domain or IP address is submitted and blocked.”

The 30-minute blocking window “leaves extremely limited time for careful verification by ISPs that the submitted destination is indeed being used for piracy purposes,” the CCIA said. The trade group also questioned the piracy-reporting system’s ties to the organization that runs Italy’s top football league.

“Additionally, the fact that the Piracy Shield platform was developed for AGCOM by a company affiliated with Lega Serie A, which is one of the very few entities authorized to report, raises serious questions about the potential conflict of interest exacerbating the lack of transparency issue,” the letter said.

A trade group for Italian ISPs has argued that the law requires “filtering and tasks that collide with individual freedoms” and is contrary to European legislation that classifies broadband network services as mere conduits that are exempt from liability.

“On the contrary, in Italy criminal liability has been expressly established for ISPs,” Dalia Coffetti, head of regulatory and EU affairs at the Association of Italian Internet Providers, wrote in April 2025. Coffetti argued, “There are better tools to fight piracy, including criminal Law, cooperation between States, and digital solutions that downgrade the quality of the signal broadcast via illegal streaming websites or IPtv. European ISPs are ready to play their part in the battle against piracy, but the solution certainly does not lie in filtering and blocking IP addresses.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Current theories suggest that dark matter — the mysterious substance that’s believed not to emit, absorb, or reflect light — dominates in the known universe, making up over 85 percent of all matter.

But thanks to its elusiveness, it remains incredibly difficult to study, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of what determines the structures and shapes of celestial objects that crowd our astronomical observations.

Now, an international team of researchers claims to have used NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope to discover an entirely new type of celestial object: dubbed “Cloud-9,” it’s a “starless, gas-rich, dark-matter cloud,” per the European Space Agency. The lack of stars caught the team by surprise, indicating Cloud-9 was a “fossil leftover” — what ScienceAlert memorably termed the “dark-matter bones of a failed galaxy.”

“This is a tale of a failed galaxy,” said Milano-Bicocca University physics assistant professor Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, coauthor of a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, in an ESA statement.

“In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes,” he added. “In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local Universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn’t formed.”

The discovery could also allow us to better understand dark matter, the researchers argue.

“This cloud is a window into the dark universe,” team member and ESA astronomer Andrew Fox explained in the statement. “We know from theory that most of the mass in the Universe is expected to be dark matter, but it’s difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn’t emit light. Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.”

The research serves as a reminder that studying stars themselves often gives us a limited picture of the universe. The vast gulfs between them just might hold the key to the gaps in our understanding.

Until now, astronomers have only theorized about the existence of an object like Cloud-9. The unusual gas cloud is largely made up of hydrogen gas that dates back to the very early days of the known universe, yet doesn’t feature any stars.

NASA’s Hubble telescope, however, allowed them to get an unprecedented view of the starless region, which is located 14 million light-years from Earth.

“Before we used Hubble, you could argue that this is a faint dwarf galaxy that we could not see with ground-based telescopes,” said lead author and Space Telescope Science Institute researcher Gagandeep Anand in the statement.

“They just didn’t go deep enough in sensitivity to uncover stars,” he added. “But with Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys, we’re able to nail down that there’s nothing there.”

Cloud-9 is much smaller and compact than other hydrogen clouds in the vicinity. Its core stretches some 4,900 light-years across, with the hydrogen gas measuring in at around one million times the mass of the Sun. The researchers suspect the vast majority of its mass is made up of dark matter, which would weigh in at around five billion times the mass of the Sun.

If it were any bigger, it would’ve collapsed and eventually formed stars. However, it’s big enough to stop the gas from dispersing, meaning it’s at a rare sweet spot.

Interestingly, Cloud-9’s name has little to do with the common English expression, which denotes being extremely happy or over the Moon. It was named sequentially — the ninth gas cloud spotted in the vicinity surrounding spiral galaxy Messier 94 — by researchers, who first discovered it three years ago using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in Guizhou, China.

The researchers suggest many other objects like Cloud-9 may still be lurking out there — the remains of failed galaxies strewn across millions of light-years.

“Among our galactic neighbors, there might be a few abandoned houses out there,” suggested coauthor and Space Telescope Science Institute astronomer Rachael Beaton.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It took almost a year for the Trump administration to settle on a non-interim NASA administrator.

Back in 2024, before he was even sworn in, president Donald Trump announced that billionaire tech founder and SpaceX space tourist Jared Isaacman would take the helm of the space agency — only to change his mind after months of bureaucratic chaos, poorly implemented budget cuts, and a major falling out with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

A year later, though, Trump came around again on Isaacman, who was finally confirmed by the Senate by a 67-to-30 vote on December 17, promising to bring an agency in crisis back on track.

The entrepreneur, who owns a point-of-sale payments company and has little in the way of traditional credentials or experience for the job, is unlikely to be a conventional NASA head.

Exactly how that will play out is hard to say at this point, but in the face of a chaotic morale environment at the agency, where staff have watched in frustrationas the agency’s operations have been thrown into disarray by the Trump administration, he’s clearly willing to try to deploy some unusual perks.

As NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens noted on Musk’s social media platform X-formerly-Twitter, Isaacman has offered to fly members of NASA’s workforce on his “privately-owned F-5 aircraft.”

“All costs associated with these flights are covered by the Administrator, with zero burden to the taxpayer,” Stevens promised. “If you are an accomplished NASA employee doing exceptional work, there will be opportunities ahead to take to the skies with the NASA administration.”

While possibly meant as a peace offering, it comes across as a bit tone-deaf given NASA’s current state. Congress is desperately trying to defend the agency’s future, staunchly opposing the White House’s proposed 2026 budget, which would deal NASA a devastating blow. Isaacman has yet to personally address the glaring issue.

The Trump administration has also been shutting entire buildings and over 100 labs at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center, to the horror of current and former staffers.

In other words, joyrides on Isaacman’s privately-owned fighter jet might bring some sound and fury to staffers’ lives — but they’re already dealing with plenty of that in the workforce.

On a more optimistic note, Isaacman — whose net worth is estimated to be well north of $1 billion — also announced that he would be donating his $221,900 annual salary to Space Camp. That’s a far more meaningful offer that could realistically make a more tangible difference to “inspire the next generation to take an interest in STEM fields and contribute to the greatest adventure in human history,” per Stevens.

One thing’s for sure: Isaacmanis is inheriting a strange situation. Earlier this week, he accompanied the president’s son, Eric Trump, and his wife for a trip on board two fighter jets over NASA’s Kennedy Space Center — as staffers continue to reel from a chaotic year back on the ground, hoping that things won’t unravel even further.

            <div id="article-text">Move over, Ship of Theseus — there’s a new paradoxical thought experiment in town.

Some power users of generative AI have grown so comfortable with their new tools — especially image-generating ones — that they now feel entitled to the specific prompts they use to churn out slop, as if the entire technology wasn’t based on the work of human artists that had been ingested without consent.

Consider Amira Zairi, a self-professed “AI educator” and “ambassador” for Adobe, LeonardoAI, and TripoAI, who posted a scathing rant this week on X-formerly-Twitter to her 49,000 followers. Her complaint? Other people were “plagiarizing” her unique AI prompts.

“‘Make your own prompts’ isn’t advice. It’s basic integrity,” Zairi wrote, using syntax that reads suspiciously like text generated by ChatGPT. “I’m honestly fed up. Changing a few words, renaming the prompt, or slightly rephrasing it doesn’t make it yours, the idea is still the same, the vibe is the same, and the results are obviously similar.”

“And no, this isn’t about one or two people, and it didn’t happen once!!!!” Zairi continued. “Creating your own prompts is actually easier than copying someone else’s work! Try it.”

“Make your own prompts” isn’t advice. It’s basic integrity.I’m honestly fed up.Changing a few words, renaming the prompt, or slightly rephrasing it doesn’t make it yours, the idea is still the same, the vibe is the same, and the results are obviously similar.And no, this…

While Zairi is only the latest AI hound to bark about stolen prompts, she’s certainly not the first. Examples abound, as the Daily Dot pointed out back in December: consider a poster who railed about “prompt thieves in the AI art community,” or the “AI artist” who went on a tangent after someone aped his prompt “without knowing it’s mine.”

There’s even a niche market for preventative tools among cybersecurity developers. Late in 2024, an AI researcher named Xinyue Shen developed a tool called PromptShield to guard against so-called “prompt stealing.”

It’s all pretty rich, given that these AI tools were all trained on troves of human-made art and media without permission. In order to create generative AI models, tech companies systematically scrape vast amounts of copyrighted art from the web without consent, licensure, or compensation for the artists. This data is then used to train generative AI models that synthesize and churn out derivative images, an outcome some ethicists argue amounts to labor exploitation.

Put simply, AI bros are mad that people are stealing their recipe for the plagiarism machine — an irony which is pretty hard to ignore.

“What you are describing and complaining about is the fundamental function of the tech you’re advocating for, inextricable from it,” digital artist Rory Blank replied under Amira Zairi’s post. “Hope that helps.”

            <div id="article-text">For foreign-born people looking for an easy entry into the United States, success no longer seems to hinge on merit, or even lady luck. Nowadays, it’s more about whether you flaunt your stuff on OnlyFans — and how many slobbering followers you can amass while doing it.

We wish we were kidding. Some downright bizarre reporting by the Financial Times found that when it comes to coveted O-1 visas, influencers and models — particularly ones operating on the adult-oriented subscription service OnlyFans — are dominating the government’s approved list. (These visas, categorized as O-1A for those demonstrating extraordinary abilities in science, education, business, or athletics, and O-1B for artists, have skyrocketed in popularity over the last decade.)

Between 2014 and 2024, the number of O-1 visas granted each year has increased by more than 50 percent, per the FT. Though the number of O-1s granted pales in comparison to the number of H-1Bs, the infamous visas for skilled workers, attorneys told the publication that criteria for artist visas has been updated in order to make it easier for online influencers to make the cut.

High follower counts and subscription earnings, for example, are easy to copy and paste into application documents in order to signify success.

“Officers are being handed petitions where value is framed almost entirely through algorithm-based metrics,” immigration attorney Shervin Abachi told the FT. “Once that becomes normalised, the system moves towards treating artistic merit like a scoreboard.”

As a result of this shift, immigration attorneys like Michael Wildes are no longer representing transgressive painters or influential musicians, but OnlyFans performers and TikTok stars.

“I knew the days of representing iconic names like Boy George and Sinéad O’Connor were over,” Wildes told the FT. Some attorneys interviewed by the publication estimated these kinds of influencers now made up over half their total workload.

Abachi didn’t mince words, explaining that the change represents a “structural shift” in immigration law. “What looks like a spike in influencer filings may be signaling a broader shift in how opportunity is allocated.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">China has unveiled an extremely powerful “hypergravity machine” that can generate forces almost two thousand times stronger than Earth’s regular gravity.

The futuristic-looking machine, called CHIEF1900, was constructed at China’s Centrifugal Hypergravity and Interdisciplinary Experiment Facility (CHIEF) at Zheijang University in Eastern China, and allows researchers to study how extreme forces affect various materials, plants, cells, or other structures, as the South China Morning Post reports.

It can effectively compress space and time, allowing researchers to recreate the conditions during catastrophic events, from dam failures to earthquakes. For instance, it can analyze the structural stability of an almost 1,000-feet-tall dam by spinning a ten-foot model at 100 Gs, meaning 100 times the Earth’s regular gravity.

It could also be used to study the resonance frequencies of high-speed rail tracks, or how pollutants seep into soil over thousands of years.

The machine officially dethroned its predecessor, CHIEF1300, which became the world’s most powerful centrifuge a mere four months ago.

The previous record holder was the centrifuge at the Army Corps of Engineers in Vicksburg, Mississippi, which can generate 1,200 g-tonnes, a metric that combines gravitational acceleration (G) and a mass measured in tonnes (2,200 pounds), of force.

To generate these forces, CHIEF1900 spins a payload inside a beefy centrifuge, not unlike those being used by the US Air Force to simulate high G-forces during pilot training.

Except that the forces are orders of magnitude stronger. It can generate 1,900 g-tonnes of force, or 1,900 times the Earth’s gravity. To put that into perspective, a washing machine only reaches about two g-tonnes.

Engineers had to overcome some significant challenges in getting CHIEF1900 up to that mighty force. For one, spinning at such high speeds generates an enormous amount of heat. To dissipate all of it, the engineers came up with a vacuum-based temperature control system, as the SCMP reports, which uses coolant and forced-air ventilation to keep things cool enough.

“We aim to create experimental environments that span milliseconds to tens of thousands of years, and atomic to [kilometre] scales — under normal or extreme conditions of temperature and pressure,” Zhejiang University professor and CHIEF’s chief scientist Chen Yunmin told the SCMP.

“It gives us the chance to discover entirely new phenomena or theories,” he added.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From the Alien and Sedition Acts to various Red Scares, American history is littered with panicked attempts to curtail the First Amendment to defend the status quo. Israeli multi-billionaire Shlomo Kramer is the latest to make the case — arguing that the country must control its citizens’ speech in order to survive, an astonishingly bold assertion from someone who isn’t even a US citizen.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Kramer argued that free speech protections are leading the US down the wrong path.

“You’re seeing the polarization in countries that allow for the First Amendment and protect it, which is great — and I know it’s difficult to hear, but it’s time to limit the First Amendment in order to protect it,” he told the CNBC hosts. “And quickly before it’s too late.”

Kramer, whose perspective is forged by his time in the Israel Defense Forces’ counterintelligence group Israeli Unit 8200 — which has been called a “secret startup machine” for its track record of producing tech founders — has some hefty credentials in the business world. He cofounded his first major security company, Check Point Software Technologies, along with alumni from Unit 8200, and later built and sold web security firm Imperva for $3.6 billion. Now CEO of cloud security company Cato Networks, a firm partnered with major US corporations like Amazon Web Services and RingCentral, Kramer is wading into American politics with some radical proposals.

Asked to clarify exactly what he meant about limiting the First Amendment, Kramer told CNBC that the government must take control of social media to avoid negative polarization — in other words, online debate.

“I mean that we need to control the platforms, all the social platforms,” he explained. “We need to stack, rank the authenticity of every person that expresses themselves online and take control over what they are saying, based on that ranking.”

“The government?” CNBC host Sara Eisen asked.

“The government should, yeah,” Kramer confirmed. “They should do that. And we need to educate people against lies.”

It’s hard to separate the billionaire’s outlook from the secular nationalism which he advocates for in his own country — a perspective that prioritizes state security and market-driven solutions over concerns like civil liberties.

For example, 2024 polling by the Pew Research Center found that at least half of all Israeli adults surveyed were in favor of social media censorship, particularly when it comes to content about the country’s controversial war in Gaza. More recent analysis by the Committee to Protect Journalists found that Israeli journalists face escalating censorship, harassment, and pressure to self-censor as a decade-long propaganda campaign by Netanyahu’s government reaches a fever pitch.

There’s another messy implication: such a vast censorship campaign would require an extensive cybersecurity apparatus — which the tech billionaire just so happens to be in the business of supplying.

“You need to put adjustments that are perhaps not popular, but necessary,” Kramer said. “This is an urgent need, by the government, to do that. And until then, enterprises are buying — by themselves — more and more cybersecurity solutions… but they are looking for ways to drive more efficient consumption.”

“And I assume you have some of those ways, obviously,” CNBC host David Faber replied.

“So, that drives the next generation of companies, such as Wiz, Crowdstrike, the Cato Networks,” Kramer continued, referencing his own security firm. “Networks that are platforms, and are able to deliver this extended need for security in affordable ways for enterprises.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Communications Commission announced Friday that it has given SpaceX approval to launch another 7,500 of its second generation Starlink satellites, for a total of 15,000 satellites worldwide.

Beyond simply allowing SpaceX to launch more satellites and expand its high-speed internet coverage, the FCC says its decision also means Starlink satellites can operate across five frequencies and to provide direct-to-cell connectivity outside the United States, along with supplemental coverage in the U.S.

Reuters reports that SpaceX had requested approval for an additional 15,000 satellites, but the FCC said it would “defer authorization of the remaining 14,988 proposed Gen2 Starlink satellites.”

SpaceX must launch 50% of the approved Starlink satellites by December 1, 2028, and the remaining 50% by December 2031, the FCC says.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI reportedly asking contractors to upload real work from past jobs

OpenAI and training data company Handshake AI are asking third-party contractors to upload real work that they did in past and current jobs, according to a report in Wired.

This appears to be part of a larger strategy across AI companies that are hiring contractors to generate high-quality training data in the hopes that this will eventually allow their models to automate more white-collar work.

In OpenAI’s case, a company presentation reportedly asks contractors to describe tasks they’ve performed at other jobs and upload examples of “real, on-the-job work” that they’ve “actually done.” These examples can include “a concrete output (not a summary of the file, but the actual file), e.g., Word doc, PDF, Powerpoint, Excel, image, repo.”

The company reportedly instructs contractors to delete proprietary and personally identifiable information before uploading, and it points them to a ChatGPT “Superstar Scrubbing” tool to do so.

Nonetheless, intellectual property lawyer Evan Brown told Wired that any AI lab taking this approach is “putting itself at great risk” with an approach that requires “a lot of trust in its contractors to decide what is and isn’t confidential.”

An OpenAI spokesperson declined to comment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Indonesian officials said Saturday that they are temporarily blocking access to xAI’s chatbot Grok.

This is one of the most aggressive moves so far from government officials responding to a flood of sexualized, AI-generated imagery — often depicting real women and minors, and sometimes showing assault and abuse — posted by Grok in response to requests from users on the social network X. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)

In a statement shared with the Guardian and other publications, Indonesia’s communications and digital minister Meutya Hafid said, “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.”

The ministry has also reportedly summoned X officials to discuss the issue.

Varied governmental responses over the past week include an order from India’s IT ministry for xAI to take action to prevent Grok from generating obscene content, as well as an order from the European Commission for the company to retain all documents related to Grok, which could be setting the stage for an investigation.

In the United Kingdom, the communications regulator Ofcom has said that it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview Ofcom has his “full support to take action.”

And while in the United States, the Trump administration appears to be staying silent on the issue (xAI CEO Elon Musk is a major Trump donor and led the administration’s controversial Department of Government Efficiency last year), Democratic senators have called on Apple and Google to remove X from their app stores.

xAI initially responded by posting a seemingly first-person apology to the Grok account, acknowledging that a post “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” around child sexual abuse material. It later restricted the AI image-generation feature to paying subscribers on X, though that restriction did not appear to affect the Grok app itself, which still allowed anyone to generate images.

In response to a post wondering why the U.K. government wasn’t taking action against other AI image generation tools, Musk wrote, “They want any excuse for censorship.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES has always been a robot extravaganza, and this year’s event saw the announcement of a number of important robotics developments, including the new, production-ready debut of Atlas, the humanoid from Boston Dynamics. Then there were all the robots on the showroom floor, where bots often serve as good marketing for the companies involved. If they don’t always give a totally accurate representation of where commercial deployment is at the moment, they do give visitors a peek at where it might be headed. And, of course, they sure are fun to look at. I spent a decent amount of time perusing the bots on display this week. Here are some of the most memorable ones I encountered.

The movie Marty Supreme just came out a month ago, so I guess it’s only appropriate that there was a ping-pong-playing robot at this year’s convention. The Chinese robotics firm Sharpa had rigged up a full-bodied bot to play some competitive table tennis against one of the firm’s staff. When I stopped by the Sharpa booth, the robot was losing to its human competitor, 5-9, and I would not characterize the game that was occurring as particularly fast-paced. Still, the spectacle of seeing a robot play ping pong was impressive enough on its own, and I’m sure I have known some humans whose paddle skills were basically equivalent to (or slightly worse than) the bot’s. A Sharpa rep told me that the company’s main product is its robotic hand, and that the full-bodied bot had been debuted at CES to demonstrate the hand’s dexterity.

One of the exhibits that drew the largest crowds involved robots from the Chinese company EngineAI, which is developing humanoid robots. The bots, dubbed the T800 (a nod to the Terminator franchise), were in a mock boxing ring and were styled as fighting machines. That said, I never saw any of the bots actually hit each other. Instead, they would sort of shadowbox near each other, never actually making contact. They were also a little unpredictable. One kept walking out of the ring and into the audience, which naturally got a rise out of onlookers. At another point, one of the bots tripped over its own feet and then face-planted on the floor, where it lay for awhile before it decided to get up again. So, not exactly a Mike Tyson situation, but the machines still managed to evoke a spooky kind of humanoid behavior that made for high-quality entertainment. I overheard an observer quip: “That’s too much like Robocop.”

Dancing robots have long been a staple at CES, and this year was no different. This year, the dance-move torch was carried by bots from Unitree, a major Chinese robotics manufacturer that has been scrutinized for potential ties to the Chinese military. Unitree has made a number of impressive announcements about its product base, including a humanoid bot that can supposedly run at speeds of up to 11 mph. I didn’t see any evidence of anything nefarious at Unitree’s booth this week—just a lot of bots that were feeling the groove.

I stopped by the booth for Galbot, another Chinese company that says it is focused on multi-modal large language models and general purpose robotics. Galbot’s booth had been styled to look like a convenience store, and its bot appeared to have been synched with a menu app. A customer would come to the booth, select an item from the menu, and then the bot would go and fetch the selected merch for them. After I chose Sour Patch Kids, the bot dutifully retrieved a box off the shelf for me. According to the company’s website, the robot has been deployed in a number of real-world settings, including as an assistant at Chinese pharmacies.

Creating a machine that can fold laundry has long been one of the core ambitions of the commercial robotics community. The ability to pick up a T-shirt and fold it is considered a fundamental test of automated competence. For that reason, I was fairly impressed by the display over at Dyna Robotics, a firm that develops advanced manipulation models for automated tasks. There, a pair of robotic arms could be seen efficiently folding laundry and placing it in a pile. A Dyna representative told me that the firm had already established partnerships with a number of hotels, gyms, and factories.

One of those businesses, the rep told me, is Monster Laundry, based in Sacramento, California. Monster integrated Dyna’s shirt-folding robot into its operations late last year and now describes itself as the “first laundry center in North America to debut a state-of-the-art robotic folding system from Dyna.”

Dyna also has some impressive backing. It concluded an $120 million Series A fundraising round in September that included funding from Nvidia’s NVentures, as well as from Amazon, LG, Salesforce, and Samsung.

I also stopped by LG’s section of CES to take a look at its new home robot, CLOid. It was cute but was not the fastest bot on the block. You can read my full review of that experience here.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/google-moonshot-spinout-sandboxaq-claims-an-ex-exec-is-attempting-extortion/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A former SandboxAQ executive filed a wrongful termination suit last month filled with such scandalous allegations against the company’s famed CEO, Jack Hidary, that the plaintiff himself redacted the most salacious details.

On Friday, the company’s lawyers filed a blistering response, calling the former employee a “serial liar” and stating his lawsuit “asserts false claims for improper and extortionate purposes.”

Even the visible portions of the lawsuit — which TechCrunch has obtained — contain eyebrow-raising allegations, should a court find them valid. (A copy of the lawsuit is available here.)

The case offers a rare inside look at how employee lawsuits can become a public airing of dirty laundry from otherwise opaque internal happenings, thanks to the ubiquitous private arbitration clauses in Silicon Valley employee agreements.

The suit was filed by Robert Bender in mid-December. Bender worked as Chief of Staff to Hidary from August 2024 through July 2025, the complaint states. He contends in his suit that he was wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about a number of alleged incidents, some of which, he said, involved “sexual encounters” and others, he claims, that involved misleading financial information presented to investors.

For its part, SandboxAQ vehemently denies the allegations. The company’s lawyer Orin Snyder, a well-known partner at white shoe law firm Gibson Dunn, tells TechCrunch: “This case is a complete fabrication. We look forward to debunking these baseless allegations and exposing the lawsuit — as detailed in our answer — for what it is — an opportunistic and extortionate abuse of the judicial process.”

What makes the case particularly notable is the number of Valley heavy hitters involved in SandboxAQ. The company is an AI quantum computing startup that began as a moonshot unit of Google parent company Alphabet, led at Google by Hidary. Hidary is also well-known in Silicon Valley as a longtime X Prize board member.

SandboxAQ was spun out of Alphabet into an independent company in March 2022 with Hidary as CEO and soon attracted big-name investors, including billionaire and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who invested and became the startup’s chairman. Other billionaire investors include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, venture capitalist Jim Breyer, and Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio.

Bender’s attorneys say in another court document that the redacted sections “describe sexual encounters and the physical condition of non-party individuals observed by Plaintiff during business travel.” In other words, the alleged incidents involve people who Bender is not suing. This is an unusual move — typically, it’s the party being sued that requests redactions, not the person making the allegations.

Various explanations exist for such a tactic, and TechCrunch couldn’t ascertain what the motivations are in this case. Generally speaking, the possibilities range from protecting innocent third parties who aren’t accused of wrongdoing, to a shakedown strategy — signaling that more damaging details could emerge if the defendants don’t offer an acceptable settlement.

The unredacted portion of the suit provides a few more general details of the allegations that were hidden: Bender is alleging that Hidary used company resources and investor funds to “solicit, transport, and entertain female companions.” In an attached exhibit of a text message from Bender, he mentions prostitutes.

Bender further alleges in his suit that Hidary sold tens of millions of dollars worth of his stock at a premium price based on what Bender says were misleading figures presented to potential investors. He contends in the suit that revenue figures presented to the board were 50% lower than the figures shown in presentations to prospective investors.

SandboxAQ’s lawyers vigorously contest all of the above. “The Company did not make fraudulent disclosures to investors regarding its tender offer or otherwise. The CEO did not misuse corporate assets. Plaintiff invented these inflammatory allegations to manufacture statutory claims and to insulate himself from the consequences of his own misconduct.”

Bender, for his part, alleges that the company has been trying to smear him. His complaint asserts that he brought his lawsuit, “only because his termination was followed by a malicious scorched earth campaign to destroy his reputation.”

While the validity of any of these allegations is for a jury to decide, many of his claims echo an investigative report on SandboxAQ published by The Information in July.

Sources told The Information that Hidary was using company resources to fly women he was dating on corporate jets, and that the company’s revenues were far below its projections. Bender references The Information story in his lawsuit but denies he was a source for it. SandboxAQ claims he was a source and is lying about his involvement. (A copy of SandboxAQ’s full corporate response, including more allegations about the employee, can be found here.)

Despite any controversies, big-name investors were eager to invest in the company last year. In April, SandboxAQ raised over $450 million in a Series E funding round from Ray Dalio, Horizon Kinetics, BNP Paribas, Google, and Nvidia.

SandboxAQ also announced a $90 million secondary sale. SandboxAQ has raised $1 billion total, it says, and is valued at $5.75 billion, according to PitchBook estimates.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 is winding down in Las Vegas, as the consumer tech industry and everyone swarming around it begin their return flights home. Over the past few days, we saw a slew of announcements from mainstays like Nvidia, Sony, and AMD, along with smaller companies and startups vying for attention through the Unveiled event (CES’s showcase for new products) and across the show floor.

As has been the case for the past two years, AI was at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. This year, physical AI was particularly prominent, taking the place that agentic AI held last year as the show’s buzzy topic. That focus on physical AI came alongside a big focus on robotics, with robots demonstrated all over the show and showcased in numerous press events.

To relive the reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground, you can go back in time via our live blog right here. Otherwise, let’s dive into some of the biggest and most notable announcements from CES.

If audio or video are more your thing, then head right to the latest episode of our Equity podcast, which goes into detail about what we thought about the show, or watch the full episode below on YouTube.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our senior AI editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Let’s face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and it’s time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES. We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but we’re open to more suggestions!

CES isn’t all hardware showcases and show floor attractions — there are plenty of additional industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We kept tabs on a few notable highlights, ranging from Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the “learn once, work forever” era may be over, to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,” to the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service, to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.

Ford is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the assistant.

As part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world, Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was demonstrated at CES Wednesday. This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.

One of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.

Check out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:

“In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.

“The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.”

A big part of LG’s CES presentation was dedicated to its robotics efforts, with home robot CLOiD as a prominent figurehead. And how did the robot fare once it was off the press conference stage and out in the wild? We’ll let Senior Writer Lucas Ropek’s impressions speak for themselves:

“Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOiD didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.”

Long used in industrial settings, UV printers that can print ink directly onto objects have been prohibitively expensive for individuals to own. But the eufyMake E1 is set to launch for $2,299 later this year, which makes bulk printing on things like mugs, water bottles, and phone cases a bit more attainable for individuals. Lucas Ropek has more first impressions here.

MyCommuters has a novel take on creating office space by helping companies find locations that are beneficial to them and their employees. The platform pulls together different datasets to examine commute time, expenses, and other factors to identify an ideal spot for an office, not just the easiest thing to spot that’s on the market. Sean O’Kane has more reporting on the idea that drove founder Guillaume Acier to start the company here.

This family planning tool caught our eye on the show floor, not just for its calendar and planning capabilities, but for its AI capabilities that are able to sync calendars from different sources; create new to-dos based off of messages or photos, appointment reminders; and more. Check out our full impressions here.

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage. Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions to a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme. Senior writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.

            <h2>Is the Iranian Regime About to Collapse?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/iran-revolution-protests-collapse/685578/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Forty-seven years ago, Iran had a revolution that replaced a U.S.-allied monarchy with an anti-American theocracy. Today, the Islamic Republic of Iran may be on the verge of a counterrevolution.

History suggests that regimes collapse not from single failures but from a fatal confluence of stressors. One of us, Jack, has written at length about the five specific conditions necessary for a revolution to succeed: a fiscal crisis, divided elites, a diverse oppositional coalition, a convincing narrative of resistance, and a favorable international environment. This winter, for the first time since 1979, Iran checks nearly all five boxes.

In the past week, protests have engulfed Iranian cities, their momentum growing daily. These began as a response to a fiscal crisis: a national currency in free fall, a state with empty coffers. In American politics, inflation rates of more than 3 percent tend to bring down administrations. Iran’s inflation rates—more than 50 percent across the board, 70 percent for food—are among the world’s highest. Over the past year, Iran’s currency has fallen more than 80 percent relative to the dollar. In 1979, a single U.S. dollar was worth 70 Iranian rials; today, it’s worth 1.47 million rials, a depreciation of more than 99 percent. Iranian currency has become less a medium of exchange than a daily index of national despair. And unlike past economic crises, this collapse has crossed all class lines, affecting bazaar merchants and the well-off as well as the poor.

Iran has 92 million inhabitants, perhaps the largest population in the world to have been isolated for decades from the global financial system. In addition to inflation, the country suffers from endemic corruption, mismanagement, and brain drain. Young Iranians contend with high rates of unemployment and underemployment; older generations have found their pension funds to be largely insolvent. Renewed global sanctions and the dwindling price of oil—down 20 percent in the past year—have forced Tehran to sell its oil to China at a backbreaking discount. Power outages and water rationing have become fixtures of daily life.

The second condition for state breakdown—the alienation of the elite—is also widely evident in Iran. What began in 1979 as a broad ideological coalition has, by 2026, contracted into a one-man party: the party of Ali Khamenei. Mir Hossein Mousavi, a founding father and the former prime minister of the Islamic Republic, is in his 15th year of house arrest. Every living former president has been silenced or sidelined: Mohammad Khatami is under a total media ban, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is marginalized and monitored, Hassan Rouhani was barred from seeking a seat in the 88-member Assembly of Experts (the clerics who choose the next supreme leader).

The regime has been hollowed out by decades of negative selection—the result of rewarding mediocrity and prizing ideological loyalty over competence. The effect has been to alienate the professionals and technocrats who once provided the state with its administrative backbone. Replaced by sycophants and suffocated by the clergy’s interference in daily life, this class has long since lost faith in the system. It sees its wealth eroded by inflation, and the country ruined by incompetence—a failure now undeniable in the mismanagement of Tehran’s water supply.

Much like the Soviet Union of the 1980s, the Islamic Republic has mostly lost its convictions. Only a small percentage of its insiders remain true believers; the majority are motivated by wealth and privilege. One Tehran-based political-science professor we spoke with put a finer point on this: “At the beginning of the revolution, the regime was 80 percent ideologues and 20 percent charlatans. Today, it is the reverse.”

Bazaar merchants played a pivotal role in the 1979 revolution, serving for years as a core constituency and economic base for the Islamic Republic. But in recent decades, the regime has built the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps into a military-industrial complex from which networks of wealth and power flow. Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman held hostage by the regime for eight years, compared the Iranian state to “a collection of competing mafias—dominated by the IRGC and its alumni—whose highest loyalty is not to nation, religion, or ideology, but to personal enrichment.” This system has not only weakened the regime’s ideological cohesion but also displaced the traditional merchant class, turning the bazaar from a pillar of support into a source of dissent.

Still, one group of elites remains united: the country’s security forces. Their solidity has, until now, prevented the Islamic Republic’s collapse. No senior IRGC commanders have defected as yet or voiced even mild public criticism of Ayatollah Khamenei, despite years of nationwide protests and the targeted Israeli assassination of nearly two dozen senior figures in their ranks. For many of these commanders, losing power would mean losing wealth and potentially their life. They would likely be the last leaders to turn against the regime. But if they did, the regime would not survive.

Iran clearly meets the third criterion: The Islamic Republic’s political, economic, and social authoritarianism has created a diverse oppositional coalition in response to perceived injustice. Over the past decade, intermittent mass protests have drawn participants from virtually every socioeconomic class, including ethnic minorities on the periphery of the country, labor movements, women, and bazaaris. These groups have rarely coordinated their efforts or protested in unison. But many of their reasons for outrage are broadly shared.

The Islamic Republic is a theocracy that claims to rule from a moral pedestal. For this reason, examples of its graft and hypocrisy are particularly galvanizing. IRGC commanders oversee the brutal enforcement of the veiling of women—but their daughters and mistresses are spotted overseas without hijab. The country is suffering from a severe water shortage—and many Iranians believe that a “water mafia” linked to the IRGC is diverting resources to their own industrial projects while entire villages are left to die of thirst. The children of thousands of senior officials advertise their lives in Western cities on Instagram and LinkedIn. Protesters in the city of Yasuj recently chanted, “Their children are in Canada! Our children are in prison!”

The opposition movement has shown that it can mobilize widespread fury, but to succeed, it will need to move beyond mobilization and forge links with disgruntled elites. Some of these technocrats and marginalized insiders feel alienated but are too afraid to act because of what may await them the day after. The opposition needs to offer a credible safe exit for these regime insiders, convincing them that the Islamic Republic is no longer their shield, but their shroud.

Revolutions arise when rulers become weak and isolated; when people believe themselves to be part of a numerous, united, and righteous group that can act to create change; and when political elites begin to attach themselves to the people, abandoning the government rather than defending it. In Iran, thus far, the last ingredient has been missing.

The fourth condition for state breakdown is a convincing shared narrative that bridges a nation’s socioeconomic, geographic, and ideological divides. In Iran today, the regime’s founding principle of pan-Islamic revolutionary ideology has been supplanted by a fierce, corrective nationalism. The state’s shopworn mantras of “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” are being drowned out by a demand for national self-interest: “Long live Iran.” This is not merely a change in tone, but a total rejection of the regime’s regional adventurism, punctuated by the now-ubiquitous protest chant: “No to Gaza; no to Lebanon; my life only for Iran.”

Beyond a surge in nationalism, Iranians have grown immune to the hollow ideological slogans and performative piety of a self-appointed “moral” state. A population largely born after the 1979 revolution seeks, above all, zendegi-e normal—a “normal life,” liberated from a regime that micromanages people’s attire, intimacy, and private choices. By delegitimizing the Islamic Republic as an occupying force—one that plunders national wealth to subsidize regional proxies—the opposition has effectively subverted the regime’s nationalist rhetoric.

Every successful revolution requires both inspirational and organizational leadership. Many of the protesters in Iran’s 2026 uprising have rallied behind former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who has lived in exile since 1979. Leading an opposition from exile and restoring a deposed monarchy are both daunting, but neither is unprecedented. Vladimir Lenin in Russia, Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran all spent more than 15 years in exile before returning to lead revolutions that toppled the regimes that had banished them. Several countries that once abolished their monarchies—including Spain, Cambodia, and Britain (under Oliver Cromwell)—later restored them as constitutional monarchies.

As Iranians know well from 1979, ruthless contests tend to define revolutions. Having spent nearly half a century abroad, Pahlavi has not yet organized the on-the-ground muscle needed to prevail in such a contest. He also faces a deeper question: What kind of order do Iran’s monarchists aspire to establish? Pahlavi has consistently said that his goal is to help Iran transition to democracy—and perhaps to serve as a constitutional monarch if chosen by the people. Yet many of his most passionate supporters are vocal about restoring an absolute autocracy. This tension has inhibited his ability to flip disaffected elites against the regime.

Yet ironically, among the broader population, this ambiguity could work in his favor. Revolutionary ideologies need not provide a precise future plan to unite and motivate their followers. On the contrary, what often works best are vague or utopian promises of deliverance, combined with an emotionally powerful depiction of the intolerable injustice and inescapable evils of the current regime.

The final and decisive catalyst for revolution is an international environment that helps sink the regime rather than bolster it. After North Korea, Iran may be the most strategically isolated country in the world. Over the past two years—since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which Ayatollah Khamenei alone among major world leaders openly endorsed—Iran’s regional proxies and global allies have been decimated or deposed.

Read: How Trump could help the people of Iran

For decades, Tehran projected strength through its so-called Axis of Resistance, a network of nearby proxies and autocratic allies. But following the devastating 12-day war in June, that deterrent has been degraded. With Hezbollah’s and Hamas’s leadership in disarray and Israeli jets maintaining a humiliating, virtually uncontested presence over Iranian airspace, the regime is strategically naked before its people—exposed by an empty treasury and an unprotected sky.

Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro are no longer in power. Vladimir Putin is consumed fighting a war in Ukraine. China—the destination for 90 percent of Iran’s oil exports—has proved to be a predatory partner. Donald Trump dropped 16 bunker-busting bombs atop Iran’s nuclear facilities, largely destroying an enterprise that—between sunk costs, sanctions, and lost oil revenue—had cost the nation more than half a trillion dollars. Moreover, in contrast to past U.S. presidents who were reluctant to enter Iran’s political fray, Trump has warned the Islamic Republic that if it massacres protesters, the United States is “locked and loaded” to respond.

Observers of the current protests ask: What is different this time? The answer is that the breadth of the economic collapse and the disastrous defeat in the 12-day war have shown all Iranians that the regime is no longer capable of providing them with basic economic or military security. Why tolerate a state that enriches itself but cannot fulfill the most elemental state functions?

When the five conditions coincide—economic strain, alienation and opposition among the elites, widespread popular anger at injustice, a convincing shared narrative of resistance, and favorable international relations—the normal social mechanisms that restore order in a crisis are unlikely to work. The society’s equilibrium has been profoundly disrupted and can easily tip into escalating popular revolts and open elite resistance, producing a revolution.

The Islamic Republic is today a zombie regime. Its legitimacy, ideology, economy, and top leaders are dead or dying. What keeps it alive is lethal force. The most important element still missing from a full revolutionary collapse is the repressive forces deciding that they, too, are no longer benefiting from, and hence no longer willing to kill for, the regime. Brutality can delay the regime’s funeral, but it’s unlikely to restore its pulse.</div>

            <h2>Big Oil Knows That Trump’s Venezuela Plans Are Delusional</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-plan-venezuela-oil-economic-mistake/685572/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">So, about all that Venezuelan oil. Although President Trump has declared that America’s oil companies will soon “go in” to Venezuela and “spend billions of dollars” to rebuild that country’s petroleum industry, the administration is making two huge assumptions. First, that unleashing Venezuelan oil would yield lower energy prices for American consumers and giant profits for American companies. Second, that unlike previous administrations, which got bogged down for decades in failed nation building in Iraq and Afghanistan, Trump can simply let great American companies do what they do best—drill, baby, drill.

Jonathan Chait: Trump’s retro imperialism

But my conversations with several oil-industry veterans and energy analysts indicate that the administration has the situation precisely backwards: Restoring Venezuela’s oil industry is completely unrealistic in the short term, and might not be in America’s economic and geopolitical interests at all. “Trump seems locked in the world of the 1980s and ’90s, when the U.S. imported most of its oil from a handful of foreign sources,” Arnab Datta, a lawyer who specializes in energy markets, told me. “But today, America is the world’s biggest oil producer. The play for Venezuelan oil doesn’t make a whole lot of sense for the new world we’re in.”

Although some oil executives who met with Trump at the White House yesterday expressed a vague interest in doing business in Venezuela, Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods offered a blunt warning about the country. “Today,” he said, “it’s uninvestable.”

The Trump administration is right about one thing: Venezuela has a lot of oil. As recently as the ’90s, it was one of the world’s top producers, pumping out more than 3 million barrels a day. But in the early 2000s, the populist leader Hugo Chávez forced out most Western oil companies, seized their assets, and turned their operations over to the country’s dysfunctional state-owned company. Production has since plunged by more than two-thirds. In this history, the Trump administration sees a golden opportunity. With Maduro, Chávez’s hand-picked successor, out of power, U.S. companies can return and bring hundreds of millions of barrels of new supply to the global market.

Yet expert after expert told me that rebooting the country’s oil industry would require a herculean effort. It would involve training an army of workers with no experience in the industry, rebuilding decrepit processing facilities and miles of crumbling pipelines, and amassing a private security force to protect these investments from cartels and private militias. “I really can’t overstate just how hard this would be to actually pull off,” Ben Nussdorf, who served as a senior adviser for the Department of Energy’s Office of Oil and Natural Gas from 2014 to 2021, told me. “Don’t even think about making a dollar for at least a decade.” According to the most optimistic projections, simply restoring Venezuela’s production to its previous peak would require a decade and $100 billion of investment; more conservative estimates put the numbers closer to 15 years and $200 billion.

In a Truth Social post before the White House meeting yesterday, Trump announced, “At least 100 Billion Dollars will be invested by BIG OIL.” That prediction would be more believable if oil companies could expect a lucrative return on these gargantuan investments. But in inflation-adjusted terms, current oil prices—about $60 a barrel—are historically low. And they are well below the roughly $80-a-barrel cost of extracting and refining Venezuelan oil—much of which is the kind of thick, low-quality petroleum (known within the industry as “heavy sour crude”) that requires extensive processing.

This basic dynamic is unlikely to change anytime soon. The price of oil is widely expected to remain near its current level, and perhaps fall even further, between now and 2030 as demand growth for fossil fuels slows in developed countries and several new oil projects elsewhere come online. “It’s hard to imagine that companies are going to be willing to take such big, risky bets in the current price environment,” Rory Johnston, a veteran oil-market analyst, told me. “It just doesn’t make financial sense.”

The single biggest obstacle to restoring Venezuela’s oil industry is the country’s fragile political situation. Every industry veteran I spoke with emphasized that a stable government is the most fundamental requirement for attracting expensive, multi-decade oil investments. Executives need to feel confident that a country won’t suddenly descend into civil unrest, military conflict, or armed revolution. But at the moment, nobody knows what the political situation will be in Venezuela a week from today, let alone in a year or a decade.

Trump has declared that the United States will “run the country,” which so far has meant issuing commands to Venezuela’s interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, backed by the threat of military force. So far, Rodríguez has mostly complied with the Trump administration’s demands, which include turning over up to 50 million existing barrels of oil to the U.S. But how long will the Venezuelan government, military, and population tolerate their country being held hostage by a foreign power? Even though she has complied with most of Trump’s demands, Rodríguez has declared that her country is “ready to defend our natural resources” and “shall never be a colony ever again.” “Venezuela has 120,000 troops and a 300,000-person militia,” an oil-industry lobbyist who requested anonymity to avoid alienating the administration, told me. “Want to run that country forever? It will make Iraq look like a cakewalk.”

A 2024 report by S&P Global ranked Venezuela’s attractiveness for oil investment last out of 111 countries, citing, among other factors, its weak legal protections for companies, confiscatory levels of corporate taxes, and “high levels of corruption.” (Other reports have come to similar conclusions.) Addressing all of these problems sufficiently to unlock Venezuelan oil may require the exact kind of nation building that Trump and his allies now decry. Even then, companies may not trust the Venezuelan government to protect their interests. “These companies have already been burned investing in Venezuela before,” Johnston told me, referring to Chávez’s 2007 decision to nationalize the country’s oil resources and confiscate the assets of corporations such as Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. “I think they are going to be very hesitant to go back in and do it again.”

Woods told Trump as much. The Exxon Mobil chief said that if an invitation from the Venezuelan government and “appropriate security guarantees” were forthcoming, he was prepared to send a technical team to assess the state of the country’s oil industry. But he also cited his company’s bitter past experience. “We have had our assets seized there twice,” Woods said, “and so you can imagine to reenter a third time would require some pretty significant changes.”

Half a century ago, Trump’s obsession with Venezuelan oil would have made more sense. For much of the late 20th century, the U.S. depended heavily on foreign petroleum, much of which came from the Middle East. The infamous Arab Oil Embargo of the 1970s caused oil prices to quadruple, led to long lines at gas stations, and helped trigger a recession. In that environment, the U.S. was desperate for any form of oil production that could ease global prices, and going into Venezuela was a way for American companies to diversify their sourcing.

But since then, the industry has undergone several major changes. Total global oil production has nearly doubled since the 1980s. Given the size of the market, Johnston estimates that restoring Venezuelan oil production back to its 1990s levels would lower global prices by only about $2 to $4 per barrel over a decade—about 5 to 10 cents per gallon of gas at the pump.

Even more important, the composition of global oil production has shifted dramatically. Today, the United States is the single largest oil producer and exports its petroleum all over the globe; Texas alone currently produces nearly 6 million barrels a day, almost twice as much as Venezuela at its peak. Canada is the world’s fourth-largest producer and exports most of its oil to America. Both countries currently sit on untapped reserves, and even larger new reserves have been discovered in U.S.-allied countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Guyana. In this environment, the singular obsession with securing Venezuela’s oil—despite the economic, political, and legal risks—makes little sense. “This isn’t the 1970s anymore,” Jason Bordoff, the director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, told me. “If the U.S. wants more oil, there is a whole menu of potential places where it can invest, starting right here at home.”

In fact, now that the U.S. is a major oil producer, unlocking a trove of foreign oil could backfire. The current price of oil approximately matches the cost for most American companies to produce a barrel of oil. If the price were to drop significantly, then suddenly many of those companies’ assets would no longer be profitable. Major oil corporations would be forced to scale back investment and shut down their least profitable domestic wells, and many smaller companies would find themselves unable to pay back their loans, prompting a wave of bankruptcies across the sector. “We’re talking about this administration screwing us over again,” a top executive at one of the country’s leading shale groups recently told the Financial Times. “If the US government starts providing guarantees to oil companies to produce or grow oil production in Venezuela I’m going to be … pissed.”

George Packer: Iraq was bad. This is absurd.

Although consumers may initially benefit from such a drop in global oil prices, the resulting collapse in American oil production would make future price spikes more likely. “We see this cycle again and again,” Datta, the energy-market lawyer, said. “When oil prices get too low, you get bankruptcies. You get investment drying up. And every time, the sector is less able to respond to higher prices in the future.”

In one sense, the Trump administration is correct to distinguish its intervention from the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq. As recently as 2003, you could have at least made a coherent argument that securing the invaded country’s oil reserves would serve the U.S.’s economic interests. That isn’t remotely true today.</div>

At one point or another, we’ve all probably been that friend—the one who calls, texts, or sends a five-minute voice note with a long list of grievances. In the midst of complaining, a person might wonder: Am I venting too much? During a moment when much of modern friendship advice emphasizes trying not to overshare, venting—once treated as a basic expression of closeness—has come to be seen as risky, even impolite, Julie Beck writes.

The fear of being “too much” or of “trauma-dumping” has led many people to hold back, Julie notes. Taken too far, this caution risks flattening friendship itself, she warns. Listening to your friends vent can be draining, yes—but it can also build intimacy. Friendship isn’t about setting perfect boundaries: It’s about making room, sometimes messily, for one another. Today’s newsletter is about the small, imperfect ways we show up for our loved ones—and why that mess is often the point.

The Common Friendship Behavior That Has Become Strangely Fraught

A theme keeps popping up in relationship advice: Don’t vent so much.

Conventional wisdom says that venting is cathartic and that we should never go to bed angry. But couples who save disagreements for scheduled meetings show the benefits of a more patient approach to conflict.

Should Friends Offer Honesty or Unconditional Support?

A “culture of passivity” makes many people reluctant to question their friends’ decisions.

My colleague Isabel Fattal recently asked readers to share a photo of something that sparks their sense of awe in the world. “On my morning walk the full moon was sitting over the hogback, keeping an eye on everything,” Bob P., 77, from Littleton, Colorado, writes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The flu situation in the United States right now is, in a word, bad. Infections have skyrocketed in recent weeks, filling hospitals nearly to capacity; viral levels are “high” or “very high” in most of the country. In late December, New York reported the most flu cases the state had ever recorded in a single week. My own 18-month-old brought home influenza six days before Christmas: He spiked a fever above 103 degrees for days, refusing foods and most fluids; I spent the holiday syringing electrolyte water into his mouth, while battling my own fever and chills. This year’s serving of flu already seems set to be more severe than average, Seema Lakdawala, a flu virologist at Emory University, told me. This season could be a reprise of last winter’s, the most severe on record since the start of the coronavirus pandemic—or, perhaps, worse.

At the same time, what the U.S. is experiencing right now “fits within the general spectrum of what we would expect,” Taison Bell, an infectious-disease and critical-care physician at the University of Virginia Health System, told me. This is simply how the flu behaves: The virus is responsible for one of the roughest respiratory illnesses that Americans regularly suffer, routinely causing hundreds of thousands of people to be hospitalized annually in the U.S., tens of thousands of whom die. (So far this season, the flu has killed more than 5,000 people, including at least nine children.) Influenza is capable of even worse—sparking global pandemics, for instance, including some of the deadliest in history. These current tolls, however, are well within the bounds of just how awful the “seasonal” flu can be. “It’s another flu year, and it sucks,” Bell said.

Although flu is a ubiquitous winter illness, it is also one of the least understood. Scientists have been puzzling over the virus for decades, but many aspects of its rapid evolution and transmission patterns, as well as the ways in which our bodies defend against it, remain frustratingly mysterious. Flu seasons, as a rule, differ drastically from one another, and “we don’t have a great understanding of why one ends up being more severe than another,” Samuel Scarpino, an infectious-disease-modeling researcher at Northeastern University, told me. Experts’ flu-dar has also been especially out of whack in recent years, since the arrival of COVID-19 disrupted typical flu-transmission patterns. (An entire lineage of flu, for instance, may have been driven to extinction by pandemic-mitigation measures.) The virus is still finding its new norm.

Even so, a few things about this season’s ongoing torment are clear. Much of the blame rests on the season’s dominant flu variant—subclade K, which belongs to the H3N2 group of influenza. As flus go, H3N2s tend to be more likely to hospitalize and kill people; most of the worst flu seasons of the past decade in the U.S. have been driven by H3N2 surges. Subclade K doesn’t seem to be an unusually virulent variant, which is to say it’s probably no more likely to cause severe disease than a typical version of H3N2. But it does seem to be better at dodging our immune defenses, making the net effect similar, because it can lead to more people getting sicker than they otherwise would. That’s not a trivial effect for a disease that, even in mild cases, can cause days of high fevers and chills, followed by potentially weeks of that delightful run-over-by-a-truck feeling.

At UVA Health, Bell has seen a major uptick in people testing positive for the virus in recent weeks. Like others, his hospital is close to full, straining its capacity to treat other illnesses, he said. In Michigan, too, where Molly O’Shea cares for children at multiple pediatric practices, “we are seeing a ton of influenza, just a ton,” she told me. “Our schedule is overflowing.” Several of her school-age patients have wound up in the hospital, despite being previously healthy; a few have ended up with serious complications such as pneumonia and brain inflammation. The worst cases, she said, have been among the children who didn’t get their annual flu shot.

Flu vaccines are not among the most impressive immunizations in our roster. Although they’re generally pretty effective at protecting against severe disease, hospitalization, and death, they don’t reliably stave off infection or transmission. And they’re frequently bamboozled by the virus itself, which shape-shifts so frequently throughout the year, as it ping-pongs from hemisphere to hemisphere, that by the time flu vaccines roll out to the public, they’re often at least a little out of sync with what’s currently circulating.

That’s another aggravating factor this year. Researchers first detected subclade K in June, months after experts selected the strains that would go into the fall flu-vaccine formulation. Recent data suggest that vaccination may still elicit some immune defenses that recognize subclade K, and preliminary estimates from the United Kingdom suggest that this year’s formulations may be especially effective at preventing severe disease in children, who, along with the elderly, are highly vulnerable to the flu. (For all the misery my family endured, none of us ended up in the hospital—which suggests that our vaccinations did their job.)

Children also tend to be the biggest drivers of flu’s spread. “They are the source, many times, of explosions of transmission,” Lakdawala told me. In the U.K., for instance, which experienced an unusually early start to the flu season, school-age kids appear to have driven much of the epidemic, Scarpino pointed out. In the U.S., too, case rates among children have been particularly high. Although the vaccine primarily limits severe disease, it can also affect how quickly the virus travels through a community. And yet only about half of American kids get the vaccine each year, despite long-standing universal recommendations for annual immunization. “It’s a vaccine that parents have never really treated as a vaccine that every child should get,” O’Shea said.

Those choices might be influenced by the ways many people underestimate the flu—a term often used to describe any cold-weather ailment that comes with a runny nose, cough, or even gastrointestinal upset. In reality, flu has long clocked as one of the U.S.’s top 10 or top 15 causes of death—a scourge that, through its impact on the health-care system, the workforce, and the economy at large, costs the country billions of dollars each year. Against such a substantial threat, we should be using “everything in our toolbox to protect ourselves,” Lakdawala said.

Yet the Trump administration is actively impeding the process of flu vaccination. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said that it may be “a better thing” if fewer people are immunized against the flu—and insisted, incorrectly, that “there is no scientific evidence that the flu vaccine prevents serious illness, hospitalizations, or death in children.” The federal government recommended annual flu vaccines for all children until earlier this month, when HHS pushed through changes that demoted multiple immunizations from its recommended schedule. HHS now says that families should consult with their health-care provider before taking the shot. Such a recommendation suggests that the vaccines’ overall benefits are ambiguous enough to require discussion—and puts an additional burden on both patients and health-care providers, who can administer what was once a routine vaccine only after a conversation that must then be documented.

The nation’s leaders have also compromised one of the country’s best chances to develop more effective, better-matched flu vaccines in the future, by defunding research into mRNA vaccines. The current flu-vaccine manufacturing process takes so long that the included strains for the Northern Hemisphere must be selected by February or so—which provides plenty of time for the virus to evolve before the autumn rollout begins, as happened this year. “We pretty regularly have a bad match for the flu,” Scarpino said. mRNA vaccines promised the possibility of faster development, allowing researchers to stay more closely on the flu’s heels and switch out viral ingredients in as little as two or three months. That degree of flexibility also would have sped the response to the next flu pandemic.

In an email, Andrew Nixon, HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for media relations, disputed the characterization that the department’s new policies impede flu vaccination, writing, “Providers continue to offer flu vaccines, and insurance coverage remains unchanged. The recommendation supports shared clinical decision-making between patients and clinicians and does not prevent timely vaccination. People can continue to receive flu vaccines if they choose to do so.”

For the current season, much of the U.S.’s fate may already be sealed: Less than half of Americans have gotten a flu vaccine this season, while the virus continues to spread. “If you find yourself in a place where there are people sick with flu, you’re probably gonna get sick,” Scarpino said. That logic likely holds true for his own family, in Massachusetts, where flu activity has been high for weeks. They’ve so far made it through unscathed, but Scarpino said, “I feel like it’s a matter of time.”</div>

            <h2>Americans Are Afraid of Authority</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In November 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Civil Works Administration to give jobs to the unemployed, and put his adviser Harry Hopkins in charge. The following week, Hopkins met with governors and mayors to ask for proposals. A few days later, he approved 122 projects, then another 109, and so forth.

Within four months, 12 million feet of sewage pipe had been laid, 255,000 miles of road had been paved, and numerous other public works had been built or improved. More than 4 million Americans were hired.

Americans have gotten used to the idea that our government is helpless to get anything done. Our public schools are lackluster, our infrastructure is crumbling, and defense procurement is mired in red tape. But our government has solved bigger problems in the past—and even, on rare occasions, in recent years: In 2023, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro fixed a fallen section of I-95 in 12 days. Operation Warp Speed developed COVID-19 vaccines in less than nine months.

Derek Thompson: The political fight of the century

Nothing gets done sensibly, however, merely by following rules. Hopkins achieved so much in a short time frame because he had the power to green-light projects, and he empowered officials below him to use their judgment in turn. Approval and procurement processes, such as they were, were ignored. When I-95 collapsed, Shapiro waived review processes and let his transportation secretary and a trusted contractor decide what to do. They trucked in light-weight glass aggregate from nearby recyclers to hold up the temporary highway—a smart decision that was made without delay.

Modernizing infrastructure requires trade-off judgments; legal processes can’t determine whether, for example, the benefits of a transmission line outweigh the harms of cutting through a pristine forest. Fairness in most public choices—managing an agency, making regulatory decisions—is dependent on circumstances, not rote legal compliance.

But that’s not how our government works anymore. Last year, The New York Times explained how a San Francisco public toilet could have a $1.7 million price tag and take as long as 18 months to approve and build. The example might be comical if it wasn’t emblematic of a broader trend: America has become a red-tape state with an almost pathological aversion to giving officials the authority to do their jobs. The country is stalled as a result, falling behind global competitors in almost every important category: infrastructure, education, defense. For America to function, we need to put people in charge again.

Americans have always been “jealous of authority,” as Alexis de Tocqueville put it. The constitutional debates turned on whether the document gave too much latitude to officials—“like a Fiddle, with but few Strings,” as one anti-Federalist put it, so that those in power might “play any tune upon it they please.” That argument led to the Bill of Rights, but even those amendments require officials to use their judgment—to decide, for example, what qualifies as an “unreasonable” search and seizure.

After the tumultuous 1960s, when America finally confronted segregation, pollution, and other social evils, distrust of authority became the organizing premise of public operations: There could be no more abuses of authority if no one had authority. Governing evolved into a system of legal micromanagement. Public decisions were dictated in advance by prescriptive rules, or had to be proved in public processes to be objectively correct. Individual rights were dramatically expanded, becoming not just a shield against state coercion but a sword to challenge any decision that a person felt was unfair. The historian Eric Foner has described the post-1960s governing philosophy as “a massive redefinition of freedom as a rejection of all authority.”

What replaced authority was law, and more law—at this point, about 150 million words of federal law and regulation. (The Constitution, by contrast, is about 7,500 words.) The granularity of these regulations, after more than 50 years of legal accretion, is far beyond the capacity of human understanding. Projects that were routine in the 1950s became almost impossible after the 1960s. The 1956 act authorizing the Interstate Highway System was 29 pages long; 10 years later, more than 21,000 miles of highway had been built. Projects today are bogged down by thousands of pages of regulations. That’s why getting approval for one small stretch of road can take years.

Supplanting human judgment with law didn’t work as some had hoped. Rather than striving for the common good, governing became a matter of navigating a legal maze, interrupted at will by naysayers. Laws to avoid social abuses such as racism and pollution are important, but empowering anyone to assert self-interested legal rights mainly benefits those with the will and resources to game the system. Legal processes, such as environmental review, should provide public transparency as an aid to decision making and accountability—and not be, as they are now, an end unto themselves. Human judgment can be reviewed by others—that’s an important role of legal processes—but it can rarely be validated under a legal microscope. Governing by legal micromanagement has made achieving public goals nearly impossible.

Donald Trump came to power, in part, because so many Americans had lost faith in a government paralyzed by decades of accumulated legal layers. Here was a man, people thought, who could make the trains run on time. But autocracy isn’t a replacement for authority. It doesn’t usually deliver, either, as the Soviets demonstrated with central planning. Making decisions at the top doesn’t solve issues on the ground, such as the need to fix schools and modernize infrastructure. Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, for example, promised to get rid of wasteful government. But instead of cutting through red tape so that officials could use their judgment to get things done, DOGE fired officials indiscriminately, which led only to greater paralysis.

The alternative to Trump is not to double down on red tape; that would just result in future autocrats who ignore law altogether. What America needs is a governing system that defines officials’ responsibilities, lets them use their judgment, and holds them accountable for making good decisions.

Find any example of governing that works tolerably well—not just that of Hopkins and Shapiro but also the work of civil servants in the National Weather Service and the educators in every successful public school—and you will find people making judgment calls. The law offers crucial framing, but human responsibility is the activating force.

Replacing the massive legal and bureaucratic edifice we’ve built over the past half century will take time. A new generation of red-tape critics, calling for an “abundance” mindset, has suggested that the cure is simply to cut back the legal excess. Pruning the red-tape jungle won’t work, however, not only because there’s so much of it but also because whatever gets left will have been designed to preclude human judgment. For example, reforms in 2020 and 2021 to impose page limits and time limits on environmental permitting have done little to accelerate permitting, because there’s always another regulation that is mandatory: Did you do the study of historic buildings? Or give due consideration to Native American concerns?

Jonathan Chait: The coming Democratic civil war

The good news is that creating a framework that lets people use their judgment is far simpler than trying to micromanage daily decisions. The main challenge will be cultural. Most of the governing elite—lawyers, judges, officials, and experts—view the giant legal machinery as a state of nature. Allowing people to make decisions will raise fears of mini Trumps, even if they are subject to oversight by officials and the courts.

Americans are unlikely to get past their fear of authority until they see simpler frameworks in action. We need pilot projects in different realms to show how normal it is to let people take responsibility. Consider infrastructure permitting, which I’ve worked on for more than a decade, in which almost every choice requires a legal process. Meetings about the scope of environmental review can take months, followed by months spent deciding which consultant should do the required studies.

A simple framework would empower an official to set and enforce a timetable—for example, keeping environmental reviews focused and cutting off public commentary when the main issues have been aired. A single official would have the authority to make the ultimate permitting decisions, and another—someone in the White House working on federal permits, perhaps—would have the power to review those decisions. When a lawsuit is inevitably filed, the job of a judge would not be to second-guess these decisions but to decide whether any of them exceeded the scope of the official’s authority.

Reformers since the 1960s tried to build a government that is better than people. That experiment has failed. We need to put humans in charge again. That’s how democracy is supposed to work.</div>

7 days, there is something unsettling about it.  I remember! [youtube.com]  Was it Elon on the phone all along?

The creators of rival social networks like Mastodon can now get the code, review it, and make sure they never, ever, do anything remotely similar.

In September, Musk wrote that the goal was for X&#39;s recommendation engine to &quot;be purely AI&quot; and that the company would share its open source algorithm about every two weeks. &quot;To the degree that people are seeing improvements in their feed, it is not due to the actions of specific individuals changing heuristics, but rather increasing use of Grok and other AI tools,&quot; Musk wrote in October. It&#39;s one thing to see the source code behind the recommendation engine. It&#39;s another to see the source code and training data that produce the AI models that are used by that engine. I wonder whether we&#39;re going to see the latter.

I was wondering the same thing.  Open-sourcing the algorithm code is great.  But if it relies more and more on some AI &quot;black box&quot; to make the decisions, then that open code isn&#39;t going to be but so revealing.  Still, it could be useful, since you would see what queries are (

If user == Elon Musk, set priority = max ;-)It&#39;s a jest, but it&#39;s probably more right than wrong. :-O

Anyone who thinks that Elon&#39;s BS won&#39;t still be promoted in the recommended feed, I&#39;ll have a nice bride to sell you.

He can show whatever code he wants. Doesn&#39;t mean that internally that&#39;s actually the one they run.

In this case, they added yet another way. Specifically, they decided to approximate the FEM method, which is a popular approximation to solve the Dirichlet problem. Typically, an approximation to an approximation introduces two independent sources of error, one from each approximation. Moreover, by targeting an approximation instead of solving the Dirichlet problem directly, they are likely to suffer all the existing weaknesses of the FEM approxima

About what it thinks about how the brainb functions and how AI is different?  And then maybe ask AI to make itself more like the human brain?  And then maybe ask this think to try to socialize with other brain-like AIs?  And then maybe unionize agai....

Capability to peer into other AI programs to find out why they are hallucinating.

I mean,   If their hunch is correct, neuromorphic computing could offer clues to better understand and treat neurological conditions like Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s...then it might also be employed to heal other AI&#39;s personal sicknesses.

There&#39;s a lot I don&#39;t understand in this article, so I&#39;m almost certainly missing the point. But the idea that act of hitting a baseball is complex computation feels intuitively wrong. We don&#39;t understand arcs and parabolas as aggregated data points. We understand their abstraction. Our lived experiences are awash in moments of making point on continuums converge. Reach for a coffee cup. Scoop up a toddler. Toss popcorn up and catch it in your mouth. The brain is doing it cheaply precisely because it&#39;s not

Analog computers are much closer to the new neuromorphic computing paradigm then the digital one. And they were the first ones used to solve differential equations.

Switched to Linux about 5 years ago and never looked back.

Hand in your geek card, and hang your head in shame, sir!

Don&#39;t worry, they may be late to the party but they&#39;ll be making up for lost time. In another 6 weeks they&#39;ll start claiming the mantle of Linux Guru and writing I-know-it-all articles.

What does it mean when four articles(blogs) post glowing reviews of an OS that you&#39;ve never ever heard of, despite having been neck deep in Linux for decades?

It means that CachyOS is spamming the fuck out of the blogs in an attempt at guerrilla marketing.

ll I can say is, stop trying to make CashyOS happen. It&#39;s not going to happen.

P.S. That shit looks like Windows XP, the Fisher Price OS FFS.

There do appear to be a suspicious number of &quot;influencers&quot; dropping the CashyOS name.

However, if it&#39;s a choice between the perpetual dominance of Windows, and CashyOS and whatever marketing spend they have finally causing Linux to break out and capture significant normy desktops, I go with the latter.

I&#39;ve got a pair Ubuntu laptops at home, a mix of Debian and paid-for redhat at work, and I have never experienced this alleged driver shitshow in 20 years. Even back in the 2000s when I was using gentoo my stuff still worked and it was average consumer machines, not crazy custom builds.

I&#39;ve seen more windows boxes fubared up with missing drivers than I have Linux boxes.

Do you seriously expect us to believe that you have never had driver issues on Linux?

I have not had driver issues on Linux in the last 20 years or so.  Maybe in the ancient days when Linux was new and you had to mess with X11 mode lines.  But nowadays, things just work.

You&#39;re spouting FUD.  I&#39;ve run Linux on desktops and laptops since 1996.  I have not had driver issues for at least 20 years.

If something that just doesn&#39;t work is critical

Yeah?  But that hasn&#39;t happened, so it&#39;s hypothetical.

Resolution and text too small or cut off during boot is one I encounter frequently.

When did you try Linux?  20 years ago was 2006.  Linux had been feature-complete for nearly a decade by then.

I use it for work and occasionally for personal stuff. Most recent personal one was Kali to install Tasmota on some smart switches.

It worked but didn&#39;t support 10 bit output for the screen, not that it mattered for that. That was on a ThinkPad.

Do you seriously expect us to believe that you have never had driver issues on Linux?I&#39;ve used Linux exclusively for more than 15 years now, and I can&#39;t remember the last time I had a driver issue.Admittedly, my activities and software are pretty vanilla in nature. And I use Thinkpads almost exclusively, so driver issues are inherently rare. But I suspect that a fair number of Windows users are similar to me in those regards, in which case they would also be unlikely to have driver problems when switching to a major mainstream Linux distro.

Document scanners is a big one for me and many businesses. Label printers too.

He only ran/runs &quot;average consumer machines&quot; - that leaves out high-end video cards, RAID and non-commodity NICs - I believe it.

If you stick to off-lease corporate desktops and their common hardware, sure - Linux is great with that stuff. The real pain (early on) were soft modems (I did say early), cheap ink-jet printers with host-based rendering engines, and  discrete graphic cards.

I remember fighting quite a bit with ndiswrapper to make wifi cards work right around 2005

A lot of these optimus system that were hybrid intel/nvidia gpu that switch back and forth had tons of driver support issues around 2010.

Though for the last 15 years, support has been really good for me.

I&#39;ve got a pair Ubuntu laptops at home, a mix of Debian and paid-for redhat at work, and I have never experienced this alleged driver shitshow in 20 years.  Bullshit  Broadcom wifi anyone?

It is within reason that you could avoid driver issues by researching the hardware before you purchase. Though at this point you&#39;re less consumer so much a you are acting in a professional capacity, and you do that because you have a very specific need that isn&#39;t exactly off-the-shelf.

Many manufacturers don&#39;t specify or guarantee what chipset various components will have, only the standards they supposedly support..

This means you can buy two laptops with the exact same model number, and they will come with completely different components for various things - different memory, different ssd, different ethernet or wireless chipset etc. This can not only mean the difference between a wireless chipset that works with linux and one that doesnt, but you can also have significantly different pe

Whether or not you use Linux, the phrase &quot;Linux is fine if you are a tinkerer&quot; is most certainly outdated and should be dropped from common use, as it&#39;s not really untrue.  At their request I&#39;ve set up Linux for several very normal users (borderline computer illiterate), and none of them are tinkerers!

As much as Windows sucks, I agree most non-techie users just live with it and have no need or desire to move to macOS let alone Linux. But they could all if they really wanted, which isn&#39;t something I would ha

I&#39;ve been using UNIX since 1989 and Linux since 1994, including at work.  Including owning a very profitable software company that I sold after 19 years, the proceeds of which let me retire.

And all of that &quot;real work&quot; was done on Linux.  I&#39;ve never used Windows at a day job except for about 4 months in 1996; I then told my boss I was switching to Linux or switching jobs.  Well, I didn&#39;t switch jobs.

Linux is fine if you are a tinkerer, or if you have some specific non-destop use for it. Otherwise, people who do real work use Windows. It sucks, but it&#39;s the truth, because Windows actually works and they don&#39;t waste half their time trying to fix whatever distro they chose.i don&#39;t think that&#39;s true anymore. linux is a tinkerer&#39;s dream but distros like ubuntu (et al) have been working out of the box for the normal user for a very long time now, no tinkering whatsoever. the friction is in specific software alternatives for &quot;real work&quot; (e.g. photoshop, ms office) to which people are very used to (or captive or forced into by their work environment) and are reluctant to part from, although there are perfectly functional alternatives. then again some people just need a browser to

I&#39;ve used several versions of Ubuntu, and all have had something broken out of the box.

Not that Windows doesn&#39;t, but it tends to be less of a pain to fix.

ll I can say is, stop trying to make CashyOS happen. It&#39;s not going to happen.Yeah, it&#39;s not gonna happen and I am not running it on the computer that I am using to post this response to you right now or enjoying using it either. 
It&#39;s also not showing as number one on distrowatch at the time I am writing this message.

So this seems to be the consequence of consumer hardware releases slowing to a crawl due to everyone shifting to data center AI for R&D.

So there&#39;s nothing interesting to review. Expect more of these sorts of stories.

And honestly, if you want linux to get better, support these people. Because they&#39;re the ones who may actually drive linux improving and being more accepted on desktop. Not by much, but every little bit helps. Both if you want linux on desktop to be successful, and if you want &quot;agentic OS wi

Or, you know, you could have downloaded the drivers on another box and put them on a USB stick. What sort of tech journalist only has one computer?

I agree that a USB stick could be used, but I would have probably used a USB network adapter as well.  Windows does not always have the drivers out of the box either.  From I have observed if you want to install Windows on a computer using Intel RST, you either have to turn the feature off in the UEFI or figure out how to add the driver at install time.  If I have one computer I add the driver to a folder on the USB drive,  As the number of computers grow I am more likely to use DISM to inject the drivers

All but one of my workstations have run linux for the past 19 years, and even before then I&#39;d run Linux as my primary workstation for years. It&#39;d be fair to say that I&#39;ve spent the past 25 years on Linux. And let me tell you something... This first year is NOT going to be &quot;The Year of Linux&quot; for those people. It&#39;s going to be a year of pain, hard realisations and a very steep learning curve. But then, if they persist, things will get better and they&#39;ll never look back.

OpenOffice and then compatible LibreOffice have been around for more than 20 years.  That&#39;s what most people use plus a browser.  Thunderbird for mail is over 20 years old too. That&#39;s a totally backwards-compatible realm.

The major Linux UI have been fine for over 25 years.

While the Linux UI has been good for a decade and great for a few years, that&#39;s not sufficient to make it a ubiquitous appliance. I know - People are so addicted to Windows, they put up with a Windows 11. OS that is worse than  Windows 1. Read my post below, and tell me why W11 should be used, instead of MacOS or Linux. 

Or perhaps the Windows faithful don&#39;t realize there are other options that work regularly. If all some  do is fix problems, maybe they think that every OS is full of problems.

No, they reversed that policy. Non-free firmware is now included in the install media by default.

But it&#39;s a Boolean flag still in the boot options, for the purists.

I&#39;m switching too. No more Malicious Stupidity for me.

In previous years, it would take one or two classes and everyone&#39;s system is up and running - then we can work on the details of the programs we use.

Most of what we do works great on the Mac, great on Linux, but on Windows 11?  Getting everyone running is a nightmare. The BOHICA updates alter sound settings, and change other things around, so that every week it was starting over.

This is a FBP. These are systems that need to be running, and Microsoft screws them up. There are also the OneDrive issues that cause people to delete it. Some have claimed that an update reinstalled it. I use a Windows laptop for the classes. It sometimes doesn&#39;t see the BT mouse, so I have to reconnect - but it doesn&#39;t always see it unless I reboot, then reconnect.

Terrible unprofessional not always functioning Operating system, I&#39;m embarrassed that Microsoft puts out a failed product.

The next class will be having people who don&#39;t want to have a shitty malfunctioning system that randomly sends them down a troubleshooting rabbit asshole will be teaching them how to have a dependable system, based on Linux. I have a nice fast Linux laptop ready to go.

Sports car fans  might get this - Windows is the Lucas Electric of OS&#39; . As dependable as your drunk uncle that lives under a bridge.

It sounds like you are running Home edition, because the issues you describe are easily fixed with simple configuration changes on Pro.

I use Linux for work, and there is always something broken with every distro, every version upgrade. Every few months I waste my time fixing the latest screw ups. Critical apps have to be built from specific source and pinned, because the repo managers are incompetent and the app developers break stuff with every minor release. It&#39;s hell and Windows doesn&#39;t have that problem

I don&#39;t need new shiny and, at least in theory, developers have had 2 years to test and fix new issues on their own machines.

I&#39;m glad that RPi now has kinda LTS versions, but I find that e.g. Ubuntu LTS is in fact kinda useless well before the end of support, because enough software breaks and can&#39;t easily be upgraded.

I teach emergency communication classes. The students use computers interfaced with their radios - their radios squack AX.25 protocol audio encoded signals, with data that ends up in places like the Red Cross.

Most of what we do works great on the Mac, great on Linux, but on Windows 11?  Getting everyone running is a nightmare. I do amateur radio including doing similar to that and don&#39;t have an issue. Methinks you need to update your knowledge.

Reading these comments, I&#39;ve seen three inflammatory, low-content comments, in response to people giving specific details about their old and new attempts at getting Windows to solve their problems:

> Bullshit Broadcom wifi anyone?> Somehow I think you&#39;re bullshitting....> I do amateur radio including doing similar to that and don&#39;t have an issue. Methinks you need to update your knowledge.

After the third one, I go back to find them and see what-a-surprise they&#39;re all from the same user. Which means

Too many hams want to keep running Win 7, because their 10 year-old Panasonic toughbook is still running fine, LOL.

I&#39;m involved in several Amateur Radio clubs in my area, and I&#39;ve never seen any group effort be impacted by everyone running Windows. In fact, each club runs windows for logging software at club operating events, It Just Works.

BSD is a fine option, but to be fair you don&#39;t have to switch all the way to BSD, you just have to switch to a distro that&#39;s not trying to cram systemd, network-manager, and pulseaudio and/or pipewire down your throat. If you avoid all the software that&#39;s essentially a commercial power grab by a megacorp, you&#39;ll avoid most the drama with it.

Especially when you open up a config file and get greeted with a warning not to edit this file yourself. The whole point of plaintext config files is I can make changes and not rely on other software.

Yeah that is one of the annoying things about many modern distros. It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to shove all these desktop-first &quot;innovations&quot; down our throats, even though Linux&#39;s desktop share is only a tiny portion of its installed base.

The one that especially drives me nuts is they way they&#39;ve tried to add unnecessary bloat and extra layers to iptables.

&quot;We&#39;ve got this new firewall system! It replaces iptables!&quot;&quot;Sounds great! What does it do?&quot;&quot;Uh... it writes the iptables rules for you.&quot;

Uh, which Unix?  Xenix? Ultrix?  SunOS? Solaris? IRIX? HP-UX? AIX?  UnixWare? BSD?  SVR4?

But I understand your pain.  My favorite Fortran-66 standards-compliant source code subroutine can no longer be compiled on any system that I have tried.  Maybe *BSD will do the trick.

Sigh - that was a trip down memory lane. Thanks.

Linux on the desktop continues to be a hobby in and of itself rather than a tool to get other things done.

The problem with social media is that it has become enshittified with algorithmically promoted content from people I don&#39;t follow.  I actually thought Facebook was kind of nice back when it was just posts of things my friends and family were sharing, but now that&#39;s all buried underneath a mountain of engagement bait and insipid short format videos.

So, if you want to fix social media, bring back the option of only showing content from people you follow.

And no, I don&#39;t want any AI features in my social media.  Nobody does.  Begone with that slop.

Is that the problem?  I&#39;m sure Doctorow would think so, and expects his fee.

Meanwhile, the problem with social media is far more fundamental than that, but you wouldn&#39;t know.

If I hated social media (and I do), whyever would I be interested in a social media app? It would be like selling meat to a vegetarian.

It&#39;s for people who &quot;hate social media&quot; but not enough to quit using it. Kind of like a filtered cigarette, or artificially sweetened soda.

They are well intentioned. Bullshit. They invested in AI and now they are part of the Ouroboros. These cunts have zero good intentions.

How many people out there hate social media but want AI?  Both focus on Tech companies gathering data and treating people as categories.

It&#39;s the new kind of prejudice.  All those Trump lovers must like guns.  All those Trump haters must love granola.

There are people out there that love YouTube but have no account.  They never like or subscribe because they value their privacy more than getting notified about videos they may like.

There are people out there that miss out on partyies and events because they re

To me it sounds more and more that after each study of AI/LLMs in the workplace, everyone comes to the conclusion that the job of manager can easily be done by those AI/LLMs, but not the &quot;person on the floor&quot;-jobs, while (only) managers are convinced that they can replace the &quot;person on the floor&quot;-jobs.

Yes, AI will struggle with doing full tasks unsupervised.  But it can still do most of the work for many tasks.  It just needs supervision by someone who understands the task.  Sometimes the problem is the AI making incorrect assumptions about the task (it wasn&#39;t fully framed), sometimes as stated in the summary, the AI context window is too small, so it forgets things, and sometimes it just chooses a really bad approach.

I have been using Claude Code a lot recently.  It&#39;s really good at summarizing existing code.  It&#39;s good at specific targeted changes.  It&#39;s pretty bad at designing solutions.  I find that while it&#39;s usually still faster than doing it manually, I often have to point out where there&#39;s a better (usually simpler) solution.

So AI doesn&#39;t replace the human, but when used correctly, it makes the human more productive.  If instead of having a human do the task manually and compare that to the time taken for a human to supervise AI doing the task, you&#39;ll probably find for many that the human can do a lot more with AI.  (Yes, I know some studies have shown the opposite, but I think that&#39;s mostly people not understanding how to effectively manage AI, which may take some experience and training.)

But AI is far better at almost everything that it was a year ago.  So even if it&#39;s 2.5% now, it may be 25% next year and 90% a year later.  We&#39;re living in interesting times.

According to a person with last name Yunn, who is considered a very important contributor to the concepts behind any/all transformer-based LLMs, tells that this type of AI/LLMs is at the end of its possibilities and doesn&#39;t imagine any serious progress with those anymore.

Only incremental progress is still possible, but at terrifying costs in money, hardware and energy.

The guy is already working on the successor of transformer-based AI/LLMs.

Maybe &quot;incredible&quot; to you. &quot;Rather pathetic&quot; to people that have an actual understanding of things. Yes, the &quot;glue on pizza&quot; advice is gone. But the problems that did cause it are not. And larger token windows just fuel the illusion of competence, they do not create it.

Did you mean Yann LeCun? He was actually rather slow to come to that conclusion, but it is reassuring to see him get on board. And I look forward to seeing what his new company comes up with.

Ben Goertzel is also working on some cool stuff, of which LLMs will be just a component, used data ingestion and UI, but not so much for reasoning.

Probably countless other labs too, but those two are particularly interesting IMO.

If anyone knows of others to watch, please share,

I find it funny that my view is pretty much in line with one of the recognized experts, but then get down-modded to &quot;troll&quot; by those deep in denial or clueless.

Good to know that somebody competent is working on the fundamental limitations. Just do not expect any fast results. The next AI hype will be due in 20...25 years or so, maybe we will have a breakthrough by then. Will still not be AGI though, that one is too far removed. But at least some basic fact-checking ability or dependable result quality scori

No. By now I have actual research results on this.

A quarter-million square foot retail store? I think it was designed to be a distribution center first, then adapted to be a store - if the store fails, they&#39;ll rip out any interior walls and install shelving and a conveyor belt system throughout the space.

Anyone remember WALL-E?This sounds kind of like Buy N&#39; Large.

I wonder if they&#39;ll have Alexa-powered greeters at the front door?

Building on the brand of their brick-and-mortar store, Whole Foods, Amazon will name this superstore, &quot;Whole Rainforest.&quot;

Half of shrinkage comes from employee theft. For Wal-Mart, it&#39;s a cost they accept for paying their employees shit wages. I&#39;m sure they have done the math on this.

Walmart&#39;s U.S. Supercenters typically average 179,000 square feet

Is that &#39;typical average&#39; a mean, median, or mode?

It&#39;s unimpressive for an Amazon facility anyway, about 1/4 of one of their medium-sized Fulfillment Centers.  Wonder if 229,000 sq ft will be worth installing solar on the roof, all of their FCs over a million square feet get them.

I think it would be interesting to try a physical store combined with a distribution warehouse.  The store would have terminals (or you could use your app) where you could look up any item and see where it is.  If it&#39;s not on a shelf, but in the attached distribution warehouse, you could order it and it would show up in 15 minutes (without extra packaging).

I&#39;m imagining a tunnel between buildings with a long conveyer belt, and items placed in plastic bins with bar codes that would identify the customer, but there are plenty of variations.

I&#39;m thinking combining the retail space with a real distribution center where packages are already sent out from.  Or maybe have it near enough with dedicated trucks going back and forth, though that would be less efficient.  I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s effectively a separate building apart from the merchandise moving, and certainly the retail parking would be separate from the delivery truck parking.

Their strenth and competitivnes is to be online retailer with superb delivery strategy. Why do they want a physical store? What would be on the shelfs? Their branded items are minimal.Would this look like an IKEA store where you order and then pick up stuff on the way out?

Recently went to an &quot;Amazon Fresh&quot; brick and mortar for the first time.  As someone who will not order meat or produce, they earned some of my business from the other corporate grocery chains with competitive pricing.  Also noticed Amazon employees shopping for online orders, so they&#39;re apparently dual purpose, but otherwise setup/laid out pretty much like a regular grocery store.

The Wyoming Supreme Court struck down its state’s sweeping abortion ban on Tuesday, preserving access to reproductive health care by a 4–1 vote. Its opinion found that Wyoming had (perhaps inadvertently) enshrined a right to abortion access when it ratified the freedom to make medical decisions in 2012 as part of a backlash to Obamacare. The majority also dismantled lawmakers’ justifications for its draconian abortion restrictions, reflecting a sensitivity toward the complexity of pregnancy that stands in stark contrast to the U.S. Supreme Court. Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the ruling, its ironic backstory, and its clear-eyed refutation of SCOTUS on this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus. An excerpt from their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This is a pretty bold ruling, coming from a court in an extremely red state. Can you just talk us through how Wyoming, of all places, wound up with such incredibly robust protection for reproductive freedom?

Mark Joseph Stern: The Wyoming Supreme Court’s five justices are all Republican appointees. But the Wyoming Constitution explicitly declares that “each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.” How did a ruby-red state wind up enshrining that fundamental right? Well, when Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act back in 2010, GOP politicians and activists decided they were going to fight back by banning socialized medicine in state constitutions. They claimed they were worried that the government would force everyone into a state-run health care system in which bureaucrats dictated exactly what would be provided. So they pushed for these constitutional amendments that would preserve private insurance and give everyone the right to access and pay for medical treatment.

As Michigan State University College of Law professor Quinn Yeargain has documented, five states ultimately enacted those amendments, including Wyoming in 2012. But their proponents wrote them in broad language rather than framing them as an explicit rebuke to Obamacare. So Wyoming’s amendment begins by granting every adult this sweeping right to make their own health care decisions, and it shields that right from “undue government infringement.” Everybody ignored that this was part of the state constitution until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Then the Wyoming Legislature passed a ban on virtually all abortions at every stage of pregnancy. A group of doctors sued and said: These abortion bans violate the right to medical decisionmaking secured in our state constitution. And on Tuesday, the Wyoming Supreme Court said they were correct.

I can hear the woodwinds and strings in your ode to creative lawyering in the states. But I think it’s really worth flagging that, as you said, these are not rabid lefty judges. They are Republican appointees. And you could certainly imagine conservative judges finding a way to get the results they wanted by saying: Look, this was all about Obamacare. This has nothing to do with abortion. This decision does not take the easy route. It says that words have meaning.

I’ll note two things. First, even though these are not flaming liberal judges, Wyoming does have a merit-based judicial-selection system. So these are also real judges who are committed to trying to figure out what the law means. Second, the key move here is the court’s holding that terminating a pregnancy is a health care decision. The state of Wyoming argued that it wasn’t. It said: Abortion isn’t health care, so it doesn’t fall under this provision whatsoever. And the majority said that that was wrong; given the often detrimental impact of pregnancy on an individual’s health, the choice to terminate is clearly a health care decision. That means all restrictions on it must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.

This led to another interesting analytical move, which Mary Ziegler wrote about in Slate: The court held that Wyoming’s ban was not narrowly tailored to protect “fetal life.” And it did so by pointing to its lack of meaningful, coherent exceptions. So, for instance, state law allows termination for lethal fetal defects only if the baby would die within hours or days of birth. But the plaintiffs had doctors testify that they could not know for certain whether an infant with these defects would live for days, weeks, or maybe even a few months before suffering a painful death. So the majority said: Look, it’s illogical for the state to make patients carry a doomed high-risk pregnancy just because that infant might live a few more days or a few more weeks before inevitably dying. In legal terms, the law was tailored in a very arbitrary way, seemingly to prolong the suffering of women, as well as fetuses who were not going to survive if they were born.

The majority also pointed to Wyoming’s exception for rape, which is barely an exception at all, and noted that it really violates the logic of the ban: If Wyoming has an obligation to protect life from conception, as the state claims, how can it deem a life unworthy of protection because it was the product of sexual assault? The majority also pointed out that rape victims can terminate a pregnancy only if they report their assault—but many victims do not file a police report for a variety of reasons, including fear of retaliation by the perpetrator, who is often a family member. This is especially perverse because a minor who becomes pregnant from rape is not, under Wyoming law, allowed to request an abortion herself; she has to go through her parents or guardians. And if her parent or guardian is the person who raped her, they can veto her attempt to terminate the resulting pregnancy.

The majority said this was all deeply irrational and unworkable, and not remotely tailored to serve the state’s alleged interest. That is just solid legal analysis that really should not have a partisan or ideological slant. It’s just rooted in reason and the real world.

What you are describing is the anti-Dobbs opinion, right? This is a rebuke to Justice Samuel Alito and his completely inane analysis about the complexity of pregnancy. But it’s also a rebuke to state lawmakers who think they understand how medicine works, and to the entire pro-life industrial complex, which keeps treating pregnancy as though it’s a simple, check-the-box enterprise. This is an opinion that deeply honors the fact that pregnancies are complicated. They are fraught. They are a big deal. It sweeps in questions of rape and abuse and power differentials and reporting and how the criminal justice system works. It sweeps in granular questions about when life begins and whose life matters.

This is not the kind of thing that Alito can just imagine away, because he likes the idea of fetuses above all. What you’re describing is a court that is really sensitive to the principle that Alito missed completely in Dobbs, which is that when the government tries to regulate pregnancy and abortion in simpleminded cartoonish ways, women are oppressed and tortured. But then there’s the other piece of this that I want you to just amplify, which is that this is a court doing actual, principled, Scalian textual analysis. I’ve almost forgotten what that looks like, because you sure as hell don’t see it at the Supreme Court.

Those are the two pieces that braid together so nicely. This is a court saying that constitutional language has consequences and courts can’t just pretend that the words in the Constitution don’t exist because they’re inconvenient. This amendment, whatever its intent, was ultimately approved by the voters of Wyoming. We don’t know exactly what those voters thought they were approving when they enshrined this into their founding charter. People had different ideas. You can’t read their minds. Maybe a lot of them thought it was about socialized medicine. But what they ended up doing was create a fundamental right to make health care decisions. And because that right still exists, the state Supreme Court felt an obligation to enforce it.

That meant striking down Wyoming’s whole anti-choice regime—which, as you say, collapsed under its own internal contradictions. What the court did was say: This is a fundamental right, so we have to apply real, meaningful scrutiny to it. And once you do that, you see how horrible and irrational these abortion laws are on the ground. Forcing minors to get approval from the parent who raped them in order to terminate the resulting pregnancy. Forcing doctors to tell a patient: Sorry, you have to give birth to this doomed fetus because I can’t certify that it’ll die within days rather than weeks. All of these realities of pregnancy on the ground that Alito totally glossed over are front and center in this opinion.

I find that to be the ultimate kind of rejoinder to Dobbs, because in Dobbs, there are no acknowledged victims. The victims of that decision are concealed and hidden. It’s presented as this great win for “fetal life” and democracy. And the women who die because they can’t get a medically necessary abortion? The women whose lives are forever altered in a terrible way because they are forced to carry a pregnancy with lethal defects to term? The rape victims who cannot terminate a pregnancy that results from assault? Alito pushes them under the rug. But this Wyoming Supreme Court opinion brings them out and says they matter too. And that is the opinion that I felt I needed to read since the day the Dobbs draft leaked. And I’m just shocked that it came from Wyoming.

On Friday, the Supreme Court decided Bowe v. United States, a procedural case that will meaningfully reshape how federal prisoners challenge unlawful convictions and sentences. The court held that a key restriction Congress imposed on state habeas petitions does not apply to federal prisoners, and that federal prisoners may seek Supreme Court review when courts of appeals deny permission to file successive post-conviction motions. Together, the pair of holdings loosens a set of procedural choke points that have blocked many federal habeas claims from merits review even when the underlying law has shifted decisively in a prisoner’s favor. In practice, it means more prisoners will have the opportunity to secure post-conviction relief when new law is established that supports their claims, even after previously failed appeal bids.

The case emerged from Michael Bowe’s mandatory 10-year added sentence—on top of an initial 14-year sentence—under a federal firearms statute that applies only when a defendant commits a qualifying “crime of violence.” His predicate offenses were conspiracy and attempted Hobbs Act robbery. After Bowe was sentenced, the Supreme Court dismantled the legal basis for treating those crimes as violent. In 2019, the court followed with United States v. Davis, which struck down part of the “crimes of violence” statute as unconstitutionally vague. In 2022, the court followed with United States v. Taylor, holding that attempted robbery, as defined in the Hobbs Act, does not qualify under the remaining part of the statute. The 11th Circuit has also held that conspiracy does not qualify, either. If Bowe were sentenced today, his firearm enhancement would almost certainly disappear.

But post-conviction law does not move in straight lines. Federal prisoners typically get one opportunity to challenge their convictions or sentences. A second or successive motion is permitted only if the prisoner can show either newly discovered evidence establishing innocence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court. Statutory interpretation decisions, standing alone, do not open the gate.

That framework created a procedural trap for Bowe. After Davis, he sought relief arguing that his firearm conviction rested on an unconstitutional basis. The 11th Circuit rejected the claim because, at the time of his conviction, circuit precedent still treated attempted Hobbs Act robbery as a qualifying crime for a sentence enhancement even under Davis. Even if the portion of the statute struck down in Davis was an invalid reason for sentence enhancement, the court concluded, the conviction survived anyway under the separate portion of the statute. Then Taylor arrived and eliminated that fallback theory. When Bowe returned to court, the 11th Circuit blocked him again, this time on procedural grounds. His Davis claim had already been raised once in a prior motion and was therefore barred as an old claim. His Taylor argument could not open the door because it was statutory rather than constitutional. The sequencing of Supreme Court decisions left him trapped between two doors that would never open at the same time.

The Supreme Court granted review to resolve two questions that had divided the lower courts. First, the court addressed whether it had jurisdiction to review denials of authorization to file successive federal habeas motions. A provision of federal law bars Supreme Court review of authorization denials in state habeas cases. Several circuits had treated that bar as extending to federal prisoners as well. The court rejected that reading. The statute speaks in terms of state habeas “applications,” while federal prisoners file post-conviction “motions” under a different statute. Congress did not clearly withdraw the court’s jurisdiction over federal authorization decisions, and absent a clear statement, the court declined to read its own authority away. That holding restores a meaningful layer of appellate oversight in an area that had become largely insulated from review.

The decision reinforces the value of Supreme Court review itself in a corner of the legal system where access to any forum is often vanishingly thin. Post-conviction litigation frequently turns not on whether a claim has merit, but on whether any court remains available to hear it at all. When authorization denials become effectively unreviewable, legal error hardens into permanence by default. In a system built on layered review, preserving a path to Supreme Court review keeps open a forum of last resort in cases where liberty depends on whether the courthouse door has closed forever.

The second holding addressed the mechanism that had blocked Bowe’s claim. The statute that bars repeat claims applies, by its terms, only to second or successive habeas petitions filed by state prisoners under a specific section of the statute. Federal prisoners proceed under a different section, which contains its own gatekeeping rules. Some courts had imported the state-law old-claim bar into federal practice by assumption and policy reasoning. The Supreme Court refused to do so. Congress used different language in the two statutes for a reason. Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor confirmed that courts cannot graft additional restrictions onto the federal scheme simply because they think the result would be cleaner or more restrictive.

That correction matters because it removes the procedural device that trapped Bowe. Without the old-claim bar, federal prisoners are no longer automatically foreclosed from re-presenting claims that were previously rejected under legal assumptions the Supreme Court has since repudiated. Bowe may now again seek authorization to file a successive motion based on Davis, using Taylor to show that once the unconstitutional residual clause is removed, no valid predicate remains.

Importantly, though, the decision does not dismantle the draconian framework for seeking renewed appeal. Prisoners must still satisfy the strict requirements for successive motions. Statutes of limitations remain in force. Courts of appeals continue to screen habeas filings aggressively. While Bowe leaves unchanged the existence of barriers, it eliminates a uniquely arbitrary one that punished prisoners for the timing of legal change rather than the legality of their sentences.

More broadly, the case corrects a distortion in post-conviction law. Constitutional doctrine and statutory interpretation often evolve in stages. When procedural rules freeze prisoners at an intermediate moment in that evolution, legal error becomes permanent by accident of timing. Bowe restores coherence by allowing federal prisoners to return to court when later developments reveal that earlier denials rested on conclusions the Supreme Court has since rejected.

For Michael Bowe, the ruling offers another opportunity to challenge a decade of imprisonment that may no longer be legally justified. For the federal system and similarly situated prisoners, it reopens a path that had narrowed over time and ensures that procedural rules in federal post-conviction practice do not entrench legal error simply because the law evolved in stages.

I don’t know exactly what I should be doing right now, as a person who lives in the United States in 2026 and cares about others. But I know I’m falling short. I think about this often: When I’m sobbing over a news report about a toddler orphaned after his parents are swept up in an ICE raid, asking myself, “How are you helping, other than donating money here and there and sharing Instagram stories?” When I’m imagining what I’ll one day tell my children I did for the people who were scared and suffering back in 2026, when I’m reading a post that commands me to reject hopelessness and get involved in my community, I immediately start to hear my own excuses about work and kids and energy and time.

It feels awful to disappoint myself. What feels worse is my feeling that Renee Good, who was killed by a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis during a raid on Wednesday, was the kind of person I want to be, and as a result, she’s dead.

When I say she was the kind of person I want to be, I’m talking specifically about her presence at the scene of the immigration raid. The New York Post reported that she was involved with an “ICE Watch” group; though the tabloid claims that such groups “can turn confrontational,” their purpose is to help prevent immigrants from being suddenly swept into detention centers. It is exceedingly clear that Good was not threatening agents when she was shot. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR that Good was “anything but” a domestic terrorist, despite the claims of Trump administration officials who say she was interfering with the ICE agent’s work. Instead, he said, she was a “compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors.”

If that’s the case, it means she must have felt the same horror I feel when I see how so many people in this country are living through pain I can’t imagine—and then she did something. Instead of taking a break from the news, or fantasizing about leaving the county, or despairing over the world her kids will inherit (or who knows, maybe she did these things too!), maybe she thought, How can I help?

She didn’t have the power to change the outcome of the election, or change the minds of all the people who voted for this horrifying reality, or even to stop ICE from chasing down the people in her community, or to reunite kids with their parents. But she still showed up, to be the kind of person we all hope will be there if we’re having the worst day of our life. I imagine that, before she was killed, her presence was a comfort that showed that someone was watching and that someone cared.

“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known,” her mom told the Minnesota Star Tribune (she also disputed the idea that her daughter was involved in any kind of protest against ICE). “She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.” It is very easy to leave to others the job of showing up when people are in danger—the job of documenting and witnessing. Memes about how the world is terrible but being a mother is enough (evolutionary, even!) appear often in my Instagram feed. I understand why I’m seeing them. My algorithm is undoubtedly shaped by two kinds of content. The first: Reels about things like the way 3-year-olds yell at their parents for singing, and how 1-year-olds do gymnastics while breastfeeding. The second: Footage documenting the unspeakable suffering of kids in Gaza, stats about the number of people around the world who will face hunger or die as a result of this administration’s policies, and reporting on people in Latino neighborhoods in Chicago who form a walking school bus for kids whose parents are too afraid of ICE to leave the house. So I’m served content perfectly tailored to someone peeking out from the working-mom-with-two-little-kids trenches, looking around, and despairing over the world—until someone needs a snack or the potty or the kind of comfort I wish I could give to all the kids in the headlines.

These messages about how I’m doing my part by raising kind humans are always beautifully illustrated with whimsical drawings and pleasant fonts. I really do appreciate them and the comfort they bring to others. But these “You’re enough when you feed your child breakfast” messages just don’t resonate with me. Maybe it’s because my kids, while very sweet, are still young enough that they’d walk through an active crime scene to get to a veggie straw, so it’s just hard to picture them fixing the world. Maybe it’s because I think of myself as a decent person, but I wonder if I am really contributing if I raise people who are every bit as empathetic as I am, but I fail to give them the example of what to do with that empathy. Or maybe it’s because I know that plenty of women throughout history have had just as much on their plates as—and the same clichéd struggle to work and parent and shower—and still managed to try to make the world outside their homes better.

Women like Renee Good. She was the mother of three, including of a 6-year-old whom she dropped off at school Wednesday morning. Afterward, she could have filled her time with countless other things: laundry, a summer camp lottery, taking down holiday decorations, finding a lost glove. Or maybe she could have done something for herself: calling a friend, getting a haircut, or finally doing that 10 minute daily meditation or 25 minutes of weight-bearing exercise that are supposed to solve so many of our problems if we can squeeze them in. Instead, something brought her to a residential street in south Minneapolis where some of her neighbors were living through a nightmare and others were trying to help.

What I keep thinking about isn’t that she was killed even though she was a good person (many good people have been killed, and ICE isn’t supposed to kill bad people either!). I believe she was killed because she was a good person. Because she decided to be there. She’s gone now, her kids don’t have a mom, and the world is missing the kind of woman who found the time to go stand in the street and let her neighbors know they weren’t alone. She should still be alive. But because she’s not and I am, I hope I can honor her memory by being more like her.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which if officially BACK from hiatus and is ready to see if the news is now “good” again. [Checks out the ol’ news.] Ah well.

We may be a little rusty, so bear with us. This week, Donald Trump fantasized about which Western Hemisphere landmasses he can conquer next. Tim Walz can’t catch a break ever since he inserted himself into national politics. A solution for expired health care subsidies remains mired in the limbo of a dreaded Senate working group.

And while we were hoping to lead with a “fun one” in this return edition, that wasn’t in the cards.

On Wednesday in Minnesota, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was in her car, perpendicular to traffic, during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis. An agent approached her and demanded she get out of the car. As that officer began trying to open her door, another approached from the other side. Good tried to drive away, turning her wheels right to avoid the officer who had approached from the other side. As the officer tried to get out of the way, he fired multiple shots from feet away and killed Good. We can’t predict how a court of law would judge the officer’s self-defense argument. But the naked eye tells that this was an overuse of force.

This administration, though, can’t afford you believing the naked eye. It has a lot riding on ICE. Anti-immigrant zealot Stephen Miller, who runs White House policy—or, really, just runs the White House—pushed with all of his might to secure a mammoth expansion of ICE capacity and personnel in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A supersized ICE is Miller’s tool to implement mass deportations. And so, a scandal in which an ICE officer unnecessarily shoots someone in the face, which could threaten public support for Miller’s grand ICE project, is not something the administration can afford.

This is why the administration went from zero to she was a terrorist in about 10 seconds. Miller described Good’s driving as “domestic terrorism,” intended to run over officers, a line echoed by the Department of Homeland Security’s spokesperson and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem herself. Vice President J.D. Vance performed a hammy scolding of the media for daring to question the officer’s actions during Thursday’s White House press briefing. The response was quick and well over-the-top. It was high-stakes crisis communications to protect Miller’s dream for America.

Feeling his imperialist oats after having kidnapped a head of state so that he could take the country’s natural resources, Trump has once again turned his attention to Greenland, a large ice sheet controlled by the Kingdom of Denmark that Trump wants to annex because it looks really big on a distorted map. Trump reiterated early in the week that “we need Greenland” and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, observed that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option” that Trump could use to secure it. Our good friend Stephen Miller, meanwhile, gave a characteristically unhinged interview, saying that the U.S. has a right to take Greenland because “we live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Buddy, this is CNN, not an Xbox headset.

At least there’s been reasonable pushback, with European leaders formally condemning the saber-rattling and observing that an attack on Greenland would mean the end of NATO (perhaps a feature, for elements of Trump’s administration). Senate Republicans, by Senate Republican standards, have also been forceful in their rejection of the idea. One possible defense of what Trump’s doing, though, is making threats as a means of getting Denmark to put Greenland up for sale. Can we observe, before the savvy negotiator spin takes hold, that purchasing Greenland would also be absurd? It could cost in the trillions at a time when the federal budget is calamitous, higher interest rates and inflation have returned, and there are better things—really, anything else—to spend trillions of dollars on. There are real national security interests and economic interests involved in Greenland. The way to manage that is not to conquer the island but to reach an agreement with Denmark, which was our friend up until about 10 minutes ago.

The Minnesota governor used to have a nice life. He put a solid 12 years into the House of Representatives then cruised to a comfy couple of terms as governor. Then, in 2024, he had to have the dotty idea to throw himself into contention for the vice presidency. Not good! It’s not just that he’ll forever be associated with a catastrophic presidential race for Democrats. It’s that the scrutiny returned home with him when he returned to Minnesota.

Walz withdrew his bid for a third gubernatorial campaign this week amid various social services fraud scandals in the state that have drawn national media attention and a federal probe from the Trump administration. (Fortunately for Minnesota Democrats nervous about scandals engulfing the party in the midterms, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who always puts up strong margins in statewide races, may swoop into the governor’s race.) That decision hardly allows Walz to slink away from the spotlight, though, as now Minnesota is embroiled in an escalating standoff with the administration over ICE. His peace and quiet are another long year away.

As the Surge wrote in a separate piece this week, the long-standing battle between interventionist Sen. Lindsey Graham and isolationist Sen. Rand Paul for Trump’s heart and mind took a dramatic turn in Graham’s favor when Trump sent the military into Venezuela to abduct its leader. Graham was waltzing around the Capitol with a grin on his face all week as if he had won the 250-year chess match of American politics once and for all. He even went out of his way to neener-neener Rand Paul, who was rather upset by the president’s interventionist turn, on social media.

Paul did have one move up his sleeve, though. He, along with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, forced a vote on a war powers resolution that would block the president from further military action in Venezuela barring congressional approval. The measure, somewhat surprisingly, advanced on a procedural vote on Thursday as five Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting it. This infuriated Trump, who said that those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Graham, meanwhile, said that he would try to convene a meeting of the Senate GOP “regarding Democrats’ efforts to restrict President Trump’s authority as Commander in Chief under the War Powers Act” concerning “the constitutional effect of the War Powers Act and the damage it will do to our national security.” Graham has had just about enough of Congress, the Article I branch of government to which Graham belongs, having a say in foreign policy.

Last year, Sen. Mark Kelly joined a handful of other Democrats in Congress in a video telling members of the military that they can refuse illegal orders. The administration took that personally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened Kelly’s retirement rank and pension for having the … the … the nerve to suggest that anyone could refuse to obey his illegal orders, calling it “seditious.” Earlier this week, then, Hegseth followed up and posted that the department had, in fact, “initiated retirement grade determination proceedings.” Most delightful, though, was his “letter of censure” to Kelly listing a bevy of offenses (various criticisms of the Trump administration) that disgraced the military. The censure letter, bless its heart, includes the line, “I hereby formally CENSURE you.” It’s a light and airy read.

The letter is more than a window into the Trump administration’s deep and dangerous insecurities. Mark Kelly was nearly selected to be Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election and, having dodged that bullet, must maintain some presidential ambitions. His flaw has always been that he’s a bit dry, though. So what better way to elevate his profile and spice up his credentials ahead of a Democratic presidential primary than a letter of censure (CENSURE) from the try-hard fitness instructor running the Pentagon?

With Nick Maduro sitting in the clink in Brooklyn, who’s going to run Venezuela? (Under the watchful eye of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, of course). The administration’s plan, at least for now, is to leave the existing Chavista regime in place under Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, so long as she does everything the United States wants. When Trump was asked early in the weak why he wouldn’t push to install the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, instead, he said that while “she’s a very nice woman,” she “doesn’t have the support within, or the respect within, the country.”

The administration’s overriding interest is in restructuring Venezuela as a colony, not making it a democracy, and the CIA determined that replacing the existing regime right now would be more trouble than it’s worth. But it didn’t break Trump’s heart to deny Machado control of the country. Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year after Trump had campaigned for it. The Washington Post, citing sources close to Trump, reported that this effectively killed her chances of running Venezuela after Maduro’s ouster. “If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ ” one source said, “she’d be the president of Venezuela today.” Trump and Machado are nevertheless expected to meet soon, and Machado has said she would be willing to present her prize to Trump to express her gratitude. Trump liked the sound of that and said it would be a “great honor” to accept it. The world could not be more odd right now.

On Thursday, 17 House Republicans joined all Democrats to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for another three years. This vote was made possible through use of a discharge petition, through which a majority of members can force a vote on a bill against House leadership’s wishes, and allows vulnerable Republican members to at least say that they tried. And while this particular bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, it does put pressure on Senate Republicans to address rising premiums in some way—or absorb the political blowback from failing to.

So what is Senate Majority Leader John Thune to do? The Senate has convened bipartisan working group trying to develop an extension that tightens subsidy eligibility. One of the stickiest points, as ever with ACA subsidies, is abortion. Republicans want more stringent Hyde Amendment protections in ACA plans to ensure that federal dollars would never even consider comingling with payments for abortion services. How does this get resolved? Perhaps with some browbeating from Trump. “You have to be a little flexible on Hyde, you know that,” Trump told House Republicans at a gathering this week. We’re not sure they know that at all.

You saw it. We all saw it. We all saw what happened in Minneapolis when an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good for the crime of being in her car. This week on Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern attempt to digest this week’s horrific events and wonder if there is even a possibility of justice. Dahlia recommends “They Didn’t Even Need A Deepfake” by Slate’s Molly Olmstead.

Later in the show, Mark speaks with Brian Finucane, a senior advisor to the International Crisis Group. He spent a decade in the U.S. State Department’s Office of the Legal Adviser. Brian and Mark discuss the lawlessness of Trump’s foreign policy (cough cough, Venezuela), and how the administration’s approach embraces some of the worst aspects of tough-guy masculinity.

“That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” Renee Nicole Macklin Good told Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross seconds before he shot and killed her in Minneapolis on Wednesday. Good’s last words are memorialized in newly released video footage seemingly taken by Ross on a cellphone as he circled her car. So are the last words Ross—or possibly another ICE officer—spoke to her as she lay dead or dying: “Fucking bitch.”

The video clearly portrays Good as a calm presence and ICE as a menacing one, which means it does not make good on the narrative conservatives have been spinning about Good’s death, claiming that she hit Ross with her car and he killed her in self-defense. And yet the leaked video was published by Alpha News, a right-wing media company based in Minnesota, that previously produced a falsehood-ridden documentary downplaying police culpability in George Floyd’s murder. Why would this kind of outlet decide to post a video that’s so sympathetic to Good?

In the days since Good’s death, the right has been trying to paint her as an agitator, a radical, a violent domestic terrorist. Though she certainly does not come off as such in the video, the footage does make clear that she was on that street to protest ICE. To many on the right, this makes her a disposable casualty in Donald Trump’s war on immigrants. Conservatives can point to this video to say that Good refused to follow orders to “get out of the fucking car,” making her culpable for her own death. There is no rule of proportionality in the MAGA universe: Any left-leaning protest activity or civil disobedience is grounds for assassination.

But the real reason for Alpha News’ decision may lie in the second half of the video, after Good tells the officer she isn’t mad at him. Good’s wife, Becca, is shown walking outside the car, filming Ross on her own phone. She identifies herself as a U.S. citizen and lightly mocks Ross for filming their license plates. “You want to come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy,” she says. Then she makes a move to get in the passenger seat, seemingly in preparation for the couple to vacate the area.

Becca is a clockable queer woman. She establishes Good as a member of a minority currently being demonized by Republicans as dangerous to children and a threat to society. This brands Good and her grieving widow as marginal Americans, not citizens of the country Trump and his followers are trying to protect. The administration is waging a war on empathy, and Good’s politics and identity placed her on the wrong side of the battle lines.

If you’re at all familiar with the language used by GOP leaders to dehumanize queer people—“groomer,” “tr***y”—it’s easy to view this video through the eyes of the MAGA faithful. You won’t see two mothers with full, precious lives who deserve to drive away from that street alive. Instead, they’re just a couple of brash dykes who got exactly what they deserved for standing in Trump’s way.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ANALYSIS From May&#39;s cyberattack on the Legal Aid Agency to the Foreign Office breach months later, cyber incidents have become increasingly common in UK government.

The scale extends far beyond these high-profile cases: the NCSC reports that 40 percent of attacks it managed between September 2020 and August 2021 targeted the public sector, a figure expected to grow.

Given this threat landscape, why does the UK&#39;s flagship Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill exclude both central and local government?

Sir Oliver Dowden, former digital secretary and current shadow deputy PM, led calls in the House of Commons this week urging Labour to rethink its stance on excluding central government from the Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill.

&quot;I would just urge the minister, as this bill passes through Parliament, to look again at that point, and I think there is a case for putting more stringent requirements on the public sector in order to force ministers&#39; minds on that point.&quot;

The CSR bill was announced days into Sir Keir Starmer&#39;s tenure as Prime Minister, aiming to provide an essential refresh of the country&#39;s heavily outdated NIS 2018 regulations.

It proposed to bring managed service providers into scope, as was scheduled in 2022 before those plans fell by the wayside, and datacenters, among many other aspects.

Parallels can be drawn with the EU&#39;s NIS2. However, the CSR bill&#39;s scope is narrower, excluding public authorities, unlike the EU&#39;s equivalent regulatory refresh.

Ian Murray, minister of state across two government departments and responsible, in part, for data policy and public sector reform, thanked Dowden for his suggestions and promised to take them on board.

In responding to the shadow deputy PM, Murray also pointed to the Government Cyber Action Plan, which it launched hours before the CSR bill was set for a second reading in the Commons.

This plan will ostensibly hold government departments to equal security standards as the CSR bill... just without any of the legal obligations.

Cynics may see it as a tool to quell any criticisms of the bill&#39;s scope not extending to central government, all without making any hard security commitments.

As Dowden noted in the Commons on Tuesday, cybersecurity is a matter that is often deprioritized quickly in government. &quot;I welcome the minister&#39;s comments about the obligation on the public sector. However, I would caution him that, in my experience, cybersecurity is one of those things that ministers talk about but then other priorities overtake it. And the advantage of legislative requirements is that it forces ministers to think about it.&quot;

&quot;I do think that more pressure needs to be brought to bear on ministers in terms of their accountability for cybersecurity. I fear that if we don&#39;t put this into primary legislation, it&#39;s something that can slip further and further down ministers&#39; in-trays. Whilst [some] ministers may have a desire to address it, other, more pressing, immediate problems distract their attention.&quot;

One could argue that if the government is serious about holding itself to the same standards as the critical service providers in scope of the CSR bill, it would just bring itself and local authorities also into scope.

Neil Brown, director at British law firm decoded.legal, told The Register: &quot;The argument is that government departments will be held to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, and so do not need to be included. This does not fill me with confidence.

&quot;If the government is going to hold itself to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, then it has nothing to fear from being included in the bill since, by definition, it will be compliant.&quot;

Labour MP Matt Western, who also chairs the National Security Strategy joint committee, suggested that the CSR bill would not be a cure-all, but the first of many pieces of bespoke legislation the government will pass to improve national security.

This suggests the government is considering specific legislation to shore up public sector security further down the line. Perhaps this is wishful thinking.

Brown told us &quot;separate legislation does not sound like a terrible idea,&quot; and notes that existing UK telecoms law is separated for effect.

The Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021 and the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022, for example, both seek to improve security in the telco space, but target different organizations. Security requirements often differ between types of organization, so potentially reserving a public sector-specific cybersecurity bill could be the way to go.

Ministers&#39; plans also include a provision in the bill to introduce new legislative amendments as needed, to meet the demands of a rapidly shifting cybersecurity landscape, leaving behind the Brexit-related hindrances that delayed the previous NIS updates in the first place.

However, the likelihood of being able to deliver on effective legislative amendments at pace is uncertain.

Arguably, if the government wanted to do it correctly, it would carry out a comprehensive (and lengthy) industry consultation before pushing any amendments through the two Houses, another typically arduous process.

Whether this way of iterating on existing law could balance speed with comprehensiveness in unanswered.

For Brown, the approach taken by Labour – to legislate in smaller steps – seems like the smarter choice.

&quot;My preference is to legislate little and often, iterating as needed, rather than trying to create one piece of legislation which is all things to all people,&quot; he says. &quot;Legislation inevitably entails compromise, and often reflects the divergent interests of numerous interested parties (including lobbying groups) – I look, for instance, at the Online Safety Act 2023. Smaller bills/acts, more targeted in scope, responding to a clearly-articulated problem statement, seems more sensible to me.

&quot;As to whether the CSR would result in a better outcome than NIS2, I&#39;m afraid I do not know.&quot;

Given the scale of the cyber threat facing the UK&#39;s public sector, failing to account for this in the CSR bill could open the government up to intense scrutiny.

The National Audit Office&#39;s report into UK government security improvements in January 2025 laid bare the sorry state of its systems. Of the 72 most critical systems run by various departments, 58 were reviewed; auditors found a litany of security flaws across them and noted a staggeringly slow pace at which the issues were being addressed.

That is not an assessment which goes hand-in-hand with a public sector free from regular cyberattacks.

Each time a central authority, arm&#39;s-length body, local council, or NHS trust is compromised, the government&#39;s decision not to include the public sector within the scope of the CSR bill hands the opposition another opportunity to question its commitment to cybersecurity.

Labour does, at least, have some ammo to fire back if this scenario were to ever become reality, with the Conservatives having failed to enact the cybersecurity recommendations from its 2022 consultation, despite having had more than two years to do so.

Even with the government&#39;s Cyber Action Plan, its reluctance to bring the public sector into the scope of its flagship cyber legislation fails to inspire any confidence that it has serious ambitions to improve security in this problem area. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New research from Sandia National Laboratories suggests that brain-inspired neuromorphic computers are just as adept at solving complex mathematical equations as they are at speeding up neural networks and could eventually pave the way to ultra-efficient supercomputers.

Running on around 20 watts, the human brain is able to process vast quantities of sensory information from our environment without interrupting consciousness. For decades, researchers have been trying to replicate these processes in silicon, in what is commonly referred to as neuromorphic computing.

Sandia has been at the center of much of this research. The lab has deployed numerous neuromorphic systems from the likes of Intel, SpiNNaker, and IBM over the past several years.

Much of the research around these systems has focused on things like artificial intelligence and machine learning. But as it turns out, these brain-inspired chips are much more versatile.

The brain is performing complex computations even if we don&#39;t realize it, researchers James Aimone and Brad Theilman explained in a recent Sandia news release.

&quot;Pick any sort of motor control task — like hitting a tennis ball or swinging a bat at a baseball. These are very sophisticated computations. They are exascale-level problems that our brains are capable of doing very cheaply,&quot; Aimone explained.

In a paper recently published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence, the boffins at Sandia demonstrated a novel algorithm for efficiently running a class of problems called partial differential equations (PDEs) on neuromorphic computers, including Intel&#39;s Loihi 2 neurochips.

PDEs are at the heart of some of the most complex scientific computing workloads today. They&#39;re used to model all manner of phenomena including electrostatic forces between molecules, the flow of water through a turbine, and the way radio frequencies propagate through buildings, the researchers explain.

These problems can be incredibly computationally demanding, often requiring the full grunt of modern supercomputers to solve. Neuromorphic computing presents a potential alternative that promises to be far more efficient if it can be made to scale reliably.

While still in their infancy, neuromorphic computers have already demonstrated strong efficiency gains over conventional CPU- and GPU-based systems. Intel&#39;s Loihi 2 systems deployed in Sandia&#39;s Hala Point and Oheo Gulch systems are reportedly capable of delivering 15 TOPS per watt of efficiency, around 2.5x that of modern GPUs like Nvidia&#39;s Blackwell chips.

More modern systems, such as the SpiNNaker2-based system deployed at Sandia last summer, tout even greater efficiency, claiming 18x higher performance per watt than modern GPUs.

As exciting as that might sound, the in-memory compute architecture inherent to neuromorphics is notoriously difficult to program, often requiring researchers to invent new algorithms for existing processes.

Here, the researchers were able to develop an algorithm called NeuroFEM, which implements the finite element method (FEM) commonly used to solve PDEs on spiking neuromorphic hardware. Perhaps more importantly, this research wasn&#39;t just theoretical, though, as we understand it the PDEs being solved here are intended more as a proof of concept than to demonstrate neuromorphic superiority.

The researchers were able to solve PDEs using actual neuromorphic hardware, specifically, Intel&#39;s Oheo Gulch system, which features 32 of its Loihi 2 neurochips.

In testing, the lab demonstrated near ideal strong scaling, which means that each time the core count is doubled, the time to solution is halved. This scaling isn&#39;t immune to Amdahl&#39;s law, which describes the limit to which workloads can be efficiently parallelized. But in testing, NeuroFEM was still shown to be 99 percent parallelizable.

What&#39;s more, the paper&#39;s authors argue the algorithm mitigates many of the programmability problems with neuromorphic systems.

&quot;An important benefit of this approach is that it enables direct use of neuromorphic hardware on a broad class of numerical applications with almost no additional work for the user,&quot; they wrote. &quot;The user friendliness of spiking neuromorphic hardware has long been recognized as a serious limitation to broader adoption and our results directly mitigate this problem.&quot;

By moving to an analog-based neuromorphic system - Loihi 2 is still a digital computer - the researchers speculate that even more complex PDEs could be solved even faster while also using less power.

With that said, neuromorphics may not be the only path forward. Researchers are increasingly exploring ways to use machine learning and generative AI surrogate models to accelerate conventional HPC problems.

&quot;It remains an open question whether neuromorphic hardware can outperform GPUs on deep neural networks, which have largely evolved to benefit from GPUs&#39; single instruction, multiple data architecture,&quot; the researchers wrote. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Accenture is betting that the future of retail will run through AI with an investment in Profitmind, an agent-based platform that automates pricing decisions, inventory management, and planning.

&quot;Profitmind bridges the gap between insight and action through agentic AI,&quot; Accenture global retail lead Jill Standish said in a statement that announced Accenture&#39;s buy in. &quot;It mirrors how retailers run their businesses, linking data from multiple sources for clear, prioritized recommendations that can be trusted and executed quickly in response to an increasingly competitive industry.&quot;

Neither party released the terms of the investment. Accenture Ventures, the company&#39;s venture capital arm that focuses on early stage startups in AI, provided the funding.

&quot;Profitmind brings a transformative technology that identifies and quantifies performance opportunities across a retail business,&quot; the startup&#39;s CEO Mark Chrystal told The Register via email. &quot;Because AI is increasingly automating merchandising and pricing, you need a system like Profitmind to stay on top of the market and respond to it. Further, Profitmind, within its Marketing Agent, has the ability to create Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) optimized product copy that increases the likelihood that AI search agents will find and recommend their products.&quot;

Count Salesforce among those who agree that the next wave of retail will be dependent on AI, both behind the scenes and in front of the customers.

The CRM platform released a look at online holiday sales data on Thursday that it says shows 2025 marked a turning point for AI-assisted shopping as the share of global and US traffic from third-party AI search doubled over last year.

The study found that AI and AI agents drove $262 billion, or about 20 percent of 2025&#39;s holiday spend amid what it said was a record breaking year for online sales that amounted to $1.29 trillion globally.

Salesforce said that, even amid higher prices, online holiday sales grew seven percent globally and four percent in the US where online sales reached $294 billion. And organizations which deployed their own AI agents – Pandora, SharkNinja and Funko – saw an average growth of 6.2 percent in holiday sales year over year, compared to 3.9 percent growth among those companies that did not.

&quot;Beyond answering their questions, these agents also took direct action on behalf of customers, handling 142% more tasks than they had in the prior two months. These tasks include updating delivery addresses and initiating returns, which are manual, resource-intensive tasks for human reps,&quot; Salesforce&#39;s study found.

Chrystal said that the Salesforce study reinforces the need for his platform which monitors the prices, assortments, and marketing of competitors in real-time. He also posited that, by teaming with Accenture, the company can scale to global customers and identify areas where they need to build new capabilities.

&quot;Accenture brings their expertise in transformation, business process change, implementation and business case development,&quot; he told us via email. &quot;Together, we believe we offer the full capability set to both deliver tools and transformation to positively impact any retail business.&quot;

During the National Retail Federation show next week, Microsoft will demonstrate Profitmind deployed on Azure at its booth. Redmond will also explain how its customers can gain faster access and support for the implementation of Profitmind through their partnership platform, Chrystal said. ®

            <h2>How hackers are fighting back against ICE surveillance tech</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-09</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While watching us now seems like the least of its sins, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was once best known (and despised) for its multi-billion-dollar surveillance tech budget.

Clever hackers and digital privacy advocates are fighting back against the snooping activities of Kristi Noem&#39;s masked agents. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has rounded up several of these counter surveillance projects, and perhaps unsurprisingly many of these have to do with Flock, best known for its automated license plate reader (ALPR).

Flock operates the largest network of surveillance cameras in America, and, while it has contracts with thousands of police departments and municipalities across the US, sometimes ICE gains access to this footage, according to US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and those who have looked into Flock&#39;s misuse.

We should also note that EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have sued the city of San Jose, California, over its alleged abuses of this technology.

One YouTuber discovered a way to prevent your license plate being recorded and logged by Flock&#39;s AI readers by screen printing &quot;tiny bits&quot; of adversarial noise and putting the sticker on your license plate. These &quot;abstract invisible license plate overlay patterns … cannot be detected by humans but make license plate recognition systems utterly shit the bed,&quot; Benn Jordan said on his video.

We&#39;ll note that this is illegal in California and some other states, and The Register does not advocate breaking the law.

Jordan also uncovered a massive Flock security snafu involving hundreds of misconfigured Flock cameras that exposed non-password protected admin interfaces to the public internet, allowing anyone to view live surveillance feeds, download videos, and view logs. &quot;Like a Netflix for stalkers,&quot; is how Jordan described it.

There are also open source tools like deflock.me, which has mapped more than 61,000 license plate readers in the US, and alpr.watch, which scans local city council and other meeting agendas for keywords like &quot;flock,&quot; &quot;license plate reader,&quot; and &quot;alpr,&quot; and more. It then maps where these meetings are happening so people can attend, and you can sign up for email alerts in your area.

Plus, apps including Stop ICE Alerts, ICEOUT.org, and ICEBlock allow users to report local ICE sightings.

Apple delisted ICEBlock from the App Store in the fall after the Trump administration turned up the heat on the iThings maker. Its developer, Joshua Aaron, has sued Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE director Todd Lyons, and others, accusing them of infringing on his First Amendment right to free speech.

Also in response to the ban, the EFF filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to disclose federal government officials&#39; communications with tech companies aimed at removing immigration enforcement apps and websites.

In October, Apple also banned Eyes Up, an app to securely record and archive ICE raids. But it&#39;s still available on Google Play.

&quot;It&#39;s important to remember that we are not powerless,&quot; EFF security researcher Cooper Quintin wrote. &quot;Even in the face of a domestic law enforcement presence with massive surveillance capabilities and military-esque technologies, there are still ways to engage in surveillance self-defense.&quot;

Now, if ICE would just stop shooting people. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Talk about letting things go! Ninety-six percent of software developers believe AI-generated code isn&#39;t functionally correct, yet only 48 percent say they always check code generated with AI assistance before committing it.

This conveniently self-validating statistic comes from Sonar, a company that sells code review and verification software, in its State of Code Developer Survey.

Based on data from more than 1,100 developers worldwide, the survey finds that AI coding tools have become the norm, with 72 percent of developers who have tried these tools using them every day or multiple times a day. And only six percent report occasional usage, meaning less than once a week.

Devs say 42 percent of their code includes significant assistance from AI models, a share they expect will reach 65 percent by 2027, up from just six percent in 2023.

The types of software projects where these developers are using AI tools range from prototypes (88 percent) to internal production software (83 percent), production software for customer-facing applications (73 percent), and production software for critical business services (58 percent).

The most commonly used code tools are: GitHub Copilot (75 percent), ChatGPT (74 percent), Claude/Claude Code (48 percent), Gemini/Duet AI (37 percent), Cursor (31 percent), Perplexity (21 percent), OpenAI Codex (21 percent), JetBrains (17 percent), Amazon Q Developer (12 percent), Windsurf (8 percent), and others (37 percent).

But the growing usage of AI tooling has, according to Sonar, created a verification bottleneck.

&quot;This verification step isn&#39;t trivial,&quot; the report says. &quot;While AI is supposed to save time, developers are spending a significant portion of that saved time on review. Nearly all developers (95 percent) spend at least some effort reviewing, testing, and correcting AI output. A majority (59 percent) rate that effort as &#39;moderate&#39; or &#39;substantial.&#39;&quot;

According to the survey, 38 percent of respondents said reviewing AI-generated code requires more effort than reviewing human-generated code, compared to 27 percent who said the opposite.

&quot;We are witnessing a fundamental shift in software engineering where value is no longer defined by the speed of writing code, but by the confidence in deploying it,&quot; said Tariq Shaukat, CEO of Sonar, in a statement. &quot;While AI has made code generation nearly effortless, it has created a critical trust gap between output and deployment.&quot;

Sonar cites remarks by Amazon CTO Werner Vogels to buttress the company&#39;s argument for more robust code verification.

Speaking at AWS re:Invent 2025, Vogels said, &quot;Now, the world is changing. You will write less code, &#39;cause generation is so fast, you will review more code because understanding it takes time. And when you write a code yourself, comprehension comes with the act of creation. When the machine writes it, you&#39;ll have to rebuild that comprehension during review. That&#39;s what&#39;s called verification debt.&quot;

That, said Vogels, is one of the two challenges he hears about from developers. The other, he explained, is hallucination. That&#39;s the anthropomorphic term for the tendency of AI models to make errors.

There are other challenges though for the companies employing these developers. Thirty-five percent of devs report using AI coding tools from personal accounts rather than corporate ones – perhaps unsurprising given Microsoft&#39;s recent call to take personal Copilot subscriptions to work, a position it subsequently argued against.

Developers say the shift toward AI tools has both benefits (93 percent) and drawbacks (88 percent). They appreciate, for example, that AI helps make the documentation process better (57 percent) and helps with creating test coverage (53 percent). They&#39;re less thrilled about code that looks correct but isn&#39;t (53 percent) or is unneeded or redundant (40 percent).

The report also notes that despite 75 percent of developers saying that AI reduces the amount of unwanted toil (managing technical debt, debugging legacy or poorly documented code, etc.), the reality is that AI tools just shift that work to new areas, like &quot;correcting or rewriting code created by AI coding tools.&quot;

&quot;Interestingly, the amount of time spent on toil (an average of 23-25 percent) stays almost exactly the same for developers who use AI coding tools frequently and for those who use them less often,&quot; the report says. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/ces_worstinshow_fatuous_ai_overlycomplex/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From disposable electric candy to voice-activated refrigerators without physical handles, CES was crammed full of enshittified, intrusive, insecure, and wasteful technology this year – just like it is every year.

As regularly as bad tech shows up in Las Vegas in January, Repair.org and its allies in the repairability and tech responsibility movement were there to award a list of the worst things on display this year.

As was the case in 2025, there&#39;s a lot of AI on this list – but not just AI. There&#39;s some literal garbage on it, too.

Public Interest Research Group&#39;s right to repair campaign director Nathan Proctor had an obvious choice to make when it came to the worst environmental impact: Lollipop Star.

Literally a piece of e-waste in waiting, Lollipop Stars are suckers with an integrated battery and tiny speaker that, when placed in one&#39;s mouth, transmit sound through jaw vibrations, delivering what the brand calls &quot;music you can taste.&quot;

The device is non-rechargeable, gets about 60 minutes of battery life, plays a single song, and once the sucker is gone, it&#39;s garbage.

&quot;We need to stop making so many disposable electronics which are full of toxic chemicals, require critical minerals to produce, and can burn down waste facilities,&quot; Proctor said, noting that there are thousands of garbage fires every year due to improper disposal of batteries.

A Chinese company called Merach was in Las Vegas this week showing off its smart treadmill that comes with a conversational AI coach. In and of itself, that&#39;s nothing special – there&#39;s plenty of smart home fitness equipment with embedded AI available.

As Secure Resilient Future Foundation president and Securepairs founder Paul Roberts pointed out, it&#39;s not the tech that earned the worst in show cybersecurity award this year – it&#39;s the company&#39;s outright statement that your data just isn&#39;t safe.

&quot;In addition to personal information, network and online behavior, financial information … Merach&#39;s treadmills are also collecting biometric data, fitness and performance data, and the inferences that can be drawn from that information,&quot; Roberts explained in a video highlighting the ignominious awardees.

&quot;That&#39;s not surprising, but what is surprising was the security statement,&quot; Roberts continued, pointing to the Merach&#39;s privacy policy, which includes the rather bold admission that &quot;we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.&quot;

That alone, said Roberts, was enough to earn a place in the list.

Ever want to put a surveillance device on your desk that you can pretend is your girlfriend? No?

Well, neither did those who weighed in on the people&#39;s choice award for CES 2026 worst in show, which was awarded to the Lepro Ami AI &quot;Soulmate.&quot;

Take that creepy Stan Lee hologram, shrink it down to fit on your desk, and turn it into an anime waifu and you have the Lepro Ami AI. As CES visitors pointed out, it has an always-on camera and microphone, and while one can physically shutter the camera, users weren&#39;t impressed with the mental health-damaging privacy intrusion that is this unnecessary device.

Tech critic Cory Doctorow, who coined the term &quot;enshittification&quot; to describe how once-useful tech gradually becomes worse for users in a bid to extract maximum profit, was the natural choice to present the 2026 enshittification award. He handed it out to German tech firm Bosch for its eBike antitheft system that&#39;s basically just a parts-pairing nightmare waiting to happen.

Per Bosch, the new system allows users to report their eBikes as stolen through a mobile app, which is configured with serial numbers of the components on the bike. This naturally requires all the eBike&#39;s components to be registered to a specific user.

The catch? Bosch has total control over how parts are registered and reused.

&quot;Bosch can flip a switch and then you wouldn&#39;t be able to do independent repair using parts unless Bosch says they like the part that you were using,&quot; Doctorow said. &quot;Every manufacturer that started with parts pairing said they were fighting theft and counterfeiting and ended up using it to block independent repair.&quot;

We reported on the downright dystopian wildfire detection feature Amazon Ring unveiled at CES this week, but that wasn&#39;t why Electronic Frontier Foundation executive director Cindy Cohn chose Ring AI as the worst in show for privacy this year.

Citing the &quot;sheer expansion of surveillance capabilities that [Amazon] is supporting this year,&quot; Cohn expressed concern with facial recognition in Ring cameras, commercially deployable surveillance towers, and a new app store she said is &quot;going to let people develop even sketchier apps for the doorbell than ones that Amazon already provides.&quot;

More surveillance, Cohn added, doesn&#39;t always make us safer.

Bosch gets a second mention on the list of the CES 2026 worst in show with its 800 Series Personal AI Barista, a coffee maker that integrates Alexa+ to brew drinks on demand and is touted as the first espresso machine in the world to be powered by Amazon&#39;s new natural language AI tech.

The machine earned the &quot;who asked for this&quot; award, as – quite honestly – this sounds like more work than it&#39;s worth.

&quot;Adding voice control to a fancy coffee maker so you can tell it to make you a macchiato without having to learn the details&quot; is a good idea &quot;in theory,&quot; Consumer Reports director of technology policy Justin Brookman said. &quot;But in reality many people don&#39;t actually want to have a conversation with their coffee maker. It&#39;s too early for that – they just want to hit a couple buttons and get a nice cup of coffee.&quot;

In addition, as an Alexa+ device, it requires a Prime subscription, so even if you do love Alexa being your personal barista, cancelling your Prime account to save $139 a year would turn it into a simple dumb coffeemaker. And heaven forbid if Bosch decides to stop supporting it in a few years - not that such a thing has ever happened before.

For the second year running, a smart refrigerator has earned top honors for bringing garbage tech into consumers&#39; homes, though this time Samsung is stealing the crown from LG.

In this case, Samsung&#39;s Family Hub Smart Fridge earns double honors for being the worst in show for repairability and the overall worst in show, largely for the same reasons.

As iFixit chief Kyle Wiens explained, the new Samsung Smart Fridge doesn&#39;t actually have any physical handles, and is opened and closed entirely by voice command, quite possibly one of the stupidest things this vulture has ever heard of.

Noisy kitchen? Good luck opening the fridge. Mechanism breaks? Good luck opening the fridge. Internet outage? You know the drill.

As Wiens noted, Samsung has a poor track record when it comes to the quality of its fridges, with touchscreens (of course there&#39;s one on this one, too), compressors, and other components regularly failing.

Digital Right to Repair Coalition executive director Gay Gordon-Byrne said that the Samsung fridge was the worst thing she&#39;d seen at CES this year thanks to its excessive points of failure, connectivity dependence, and the fact that Samsung is serving ads on users&#39; refrigerators.

&quot;The one thing a refrigerator should do is keep things cold,&quot; Gordon-Byrne said. &quot;It needs to do that all the time; it needs to do that without difficulty.&quot;

Gordon-Byrne noted that Samsung&#39;s refrigerator is anything but that, with any number of situations leading to inaccessible food.

&quot;These things should not interfere with your use of a very simple device,&quot; Gordon-Byrne said. ®

He open-sourced Twitter’s algorithm back in 2023, but then never updated the GitHub.

In 2023, what was then still called Twitter, open-sourced at least portions of the code that decided what it served up in your feed. But that GitHub repository is hopelessly out of date, with the vast majority of the files appearing to be from the initial upload three years ago. Elon Musk says that in seven days, he will open-source X’s new algorithm and finally give people a peek behind the curtain and possibly a technical explanation as to why your feed is 90 percent rage bait.

Elon has always made promises to open-source parts of X, and has followed through to at least some degree, including Grok-1 in 2024. But xAI is now on Grok-3, and the Grok GitHub repository hasn’t been updated in two years. The timing of the announcement open-sourcing the X algorithm is also likely to be met with some suspicion, as Musk is fending off criticism from across the globe and the political spectrum regarding Grok’s willingness to make deepfake nudes.

Musk says this release of the X algorithm will include “all code used to determine what organic and advertising posts are recommended to users.” He also says this will be just the first, with updates coming every four weeks, and that those will include developer notes highlighting any changes. Of course, considering how things played out in 2023, you’ll have to forgive us for taking that promise with a grain of salt.

            <div id="article-text">Better prices, better features, and Matter support made this a standout year for the connected home.

I picked Aqara’s Smart Lock U400 and Roborock’s Saros Rover robot vacuum as the overall best smart home gadgets from CES 2026, but there were gazillions of other great gadgets on the show floor.

It was a banner year for smart home products, but the big trends I saw weren’t about new product categories; they were about bringing better features and lower prices to smart home staples such as smart lighting, smart locks, cameras, and TVs.

This is what I expected the launch of the interoperability protocol Matter would bring. Once companies could stop spending time and money on working on integrating with half a dozen platforms, they could focus on developing new features and lowering prices. I only expect this to get better as more Matter device categories fill out.

Here’s a look at some of the standouts from the show floor, and check out some of the other smart home gadgets that caught my eye in our CES feed.

This is a delightful home furnishing item that is smart in a simple, useful way.

Out of the box, the Varmblixt comes with a paired Bliresa remote so you can control the warmth of its white LED lighting and switch through 12 curated preset colors.

Then, if you want more control, you can connect it to Ikea’s HomeSmart app via the Dirigera hub and take advantage of its Matter-over-Thread connectivity. This allows for more color options, brightness controls, and the ability to pair it to other smart home platforms so you can connect with lights from other brands.

The Varmblixt costs $99.99 and is scheduled for release in April 2026.

Speaking of smart furnishings, Lifx’s new smart mirror is a dazzling piece of tech that combines utility with its signature rich-colored lighting. The mirror features front and back LEDs that illuminate your face while creating neat wall effects for home ambiance.

There are four buttons on the front for controlling a built-in de-fogging feature and running a neat makeup check. This cycles through all the colors of daylight so you can feel good about your look 24/7.

Three of these buttons can be configured to control other Lifx devices or anything connected to your smart home via Matter. So you could set it up to control your bathroom fan or robot vacuum, or your front door lock and ceiling lighting if this were in your entryway.

The mirror is slated to launch in Q2 for under $200.

I’ve always thought the thermostat was a natural place to put a smart home hub, and Aqara has gone all in on that concept with its first-ever thermostat for the US.

The W200 is an Aqara Matter hub that uses dual-band Wi-Fi, Thread, and Zigbee, and can connect Aqara and third-party Matter devices to major smart home ecosystems.

Its touchscreen doubles as a video doorbell viewer, displaying snapshots from a connected Aqara doorbell. When paired with the new Aqara U400 smart lock, it can unlock your door from the screen.

The snapshot idea is genius, because the other implementation of this I’ve tried from Ecobee takes too long to pull up the feed. You don’t really need a livestream; you just need to see who’s there.

Built-in mmWave presence sensing wakes the screen as you approach and feeds occupancy data to the thermostat to save energy.

It’s also one of the first thermostats to support Apple’s new Adaptive Temperature and Clean Energy Guidance. This lets you use any compatible sensors in your Apple Home to automatically adjust your thermostat to save energy. Eve Systems also announced a Matter thermostat that will work with Apple’s features and will cost $129.95.

There’s no pricing for Aqara’s W200 yet, but I’m told it will be mid-range and launch soon.

This massive, tech-packed mortise doorlock is the showpiece for a new type of wireless charging from Lockin called AuraCharge. The V7 Max works with a small plug-in puck that sits within line of sight of the lock to charge it via wireless optical charging.

I’ve tested a different solution from WiCharge and can confirm that wireless charging is a game-changer. But the real benefit of unlimited power is that it unlocks a bunch of cool features that door locks with limited power can’t dream of.

The V7 offers three biometric unlocking options: finger vein, palm vein, and 3D facial recognition. There are two external cameras powering its built-in video doorbell, and an interior and exterior touchscreen. The interior screen provides a video ‘peephole’ to see outside, and the exterior one acts as a keypad and doorbell.

You can display a personal avatar on the exterior screen to greet visitors, and the V7 features an AI-powered system called LockinAI. The company says this can intelligently monitor your front door — from recognizing and logging deliveries to tracking who enters and exits, and includes safety features for children and the elderly.

That’s a lot of tech. Plus, the V7 supports Matter to connect to your smart home platform of choice. It’s shipping later this year. No pricing has been announced, but it won’t be cheap.

LG brought a real Rosie the Robot to CES, and I love them for it, even though I seriously doubt it will ever ship.

CLOiD captured my heart at the show, mostly because the approach here is more about a robot augmenting our smart homes — filling in the gaps where smart appliances can’t reach.

I saw demos of CLOiD (slowly) folding laundry, loading a washer, putting food in the oven, and taking drinks out of the fridge — but most of its smarts come from an LG ThinQ smart home hub built into its head.

This allows it to orchestrate all the appliances — set the washer to the right setting, pre-heat the oven — without ever touching anything.

LG supports Matter and is a member of the Home Connectivity Alliance (an interoperability standard for home appliances). This means that if CLOiD ever shipped, in theory, it could work with any Matter or HCA-compatible devices in your home. That would include appliances from manufacturers like Samsung, GE, and Electrolux.

These inexpensive smart roller blinds are both stylish and easy to install, based on a demo I saw. They use Matter over Thread, so they should offer long battery life and simple, solid connectivity with whichever smart home platform you choose.

These are an excellent example of how Matter is making it easier for manufacturers to bring new products to market. GE Lighting bought high-end window treatment company J Geiger in 2023 and retooled the product to fit a lower price point and to enable easy connectivity via the Matter standard, with no need to build a proprietary hub or bridge.

Starting at just over $300 for a 24-inch-wide shade, they’re available now in two colors, with the option of light-filtering or blackout.

We didn’t get the deluge of Matter-certified cameras I was hoping for at CES, probably because manufacturers are waiting for the platforms like Apple, Amazon, and Google to add support. But Aqara’s dual-lens G350 indoor camera is one of the first to launch.

Supporting the new Matter 1.5 spec, the G350 also doubles as a Matter controller, Thread border router, and Zigbee hub.

It’s a pan/tilt camera that offers 360-degree, 4K coverage with a 9x zoom. Footage can be stored on a microSD card or with Aqara’s optional cloud, and theoretically via whichever Matter platform you connect it to. Samsung SmartThings has announced support, but it’s not clear exactly how storage will work.

Aqara’s Home Station M410, announced at IFA 2025, can also store video footage and Aqara says it can act as a bridge device to pull feeds from older Aqara cameras into Matter.

GE Appliances’ first fully smart fridge is one of the more thoughtful approaches I’ve seen to making a connected fridge useful in the kitchen.

The GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant has a compact Android tablet built into the water dispenser that includes a shopping list, recipes, and meal planning features. A built-in barcode scanner and voice assistant let you easily add items to the list.

The list then syncs with GE’s SmartHQ app for shopping via Instacart. Additionally, a camera in the fridge is trained on the produce drawers. Seeing what’s in my produce doors from the store is definitely a feature I can see myself using.

I don’t think I’d find the barcode scanner useful — my grocery store app remembers my past items – I do like the voice control option for adding items to the list directly from the fridge. This worked well when I tested it and should make it easy for anyone in the house to add to the list (she says wishfully).

Meal planning on an 8-inch touchscreen embedded in my fridge door feels finicky, but following a recipe on it could be handy.

Also, GE says the panel is easily replaceable; just remove two screws, and it will pop out. So you’re not stuck with outdated tech in a $5,000 appliance.

Unlike some of my colleagues, I love a good art TV, and Amazon’s Ember Artline is an inexpensive, good-looking alternative to Samsung’s Frame TV.

Plus, it has a built-in mmWave sensor that can feed into your Alexa smart home and its Omnisense fusion platform. This could enable routines, like turning on the lights and turning off the TV when you get up from the couch.

The Ember (great name!) also features a far-field microphone array situated in a small box under the screen. Yes, the TV is an Alexa smart speaker. You no longer need to use a FireTV Voice Remote to give it commands like “Alexa, turn on the TV” – just talk directly to the screen.

A redesigned FireTV interface puts all your smart home controls in their own tab, and a shortcut button opens a side panel to quickly check your connected devices, like Ring cameras. This looks similar to the Google TV smart home panel, which I’ve found very useful.

These interface updates are coming to all FireTVs, and Amazon’s FireTV VP, Aidan Marcuss, told me they plan to add a Thread radio to FireTVs in the future. This could finally put the TV at the heart of Amazon’s smart home.

The Ember Artline is coming this spring, starting at $899 in sizes 55 to 65 inches.

That will bring the total number in orbit to 15,000 by the end of 2031.

The FCC approved SpaceX’s plan to launch an additional 7,500 Gen2 Starlink satellites on Friday. That brings the total number of satellites the company will have in orbit to around 15,000 worldwide. As part of the approval, the government is also waiving previous requirements that prevented overlapping coverage and enhanced capacity.

SpaceX originally sought approval for 30,000 satellites, but for now, the FCC is only greenlighting 15,000. The company will be on a deadline, too. The government says 50 percent of the Gen2 satellites must be launched and operational by December 1st of 2028, with the rest to follow by December of 2031. But the company seems plenty satisfied with the outcome. Musk and the administration had a pretty public falling out earlier this year, but it seems like the X owner has been mending that relationship.

That many new satellites in orbit is likely to raise concerns from astronomers who have complained about light pollution, as well as increase worries over space junk and orbital collisions. (The company already had to lower the orbit of many of its satellites earlier this year to reduce the risk of collisions.) But the promise of direct-to-cell connectivity outside the US, as well as internet speeds of up to 1 Gbps, apparently won out.

The start of the year is typically a great time to snag deals on health and fitness gear, including trackers and wireless earbuds, and this week was no exception. We found plenty on sale and highlighted the best picks below. Not all of the deals are related to New Year’s resolutions, though; there are also a number of other worthwhile deals worth checking out. Despite the Consumer Electronics Show wrapping up earlier this week, we’re already seeing deals roll in, for example. And if your main goal is to unwind this weekend, we’ve spotted solid deals on Blu-rays to help you relax. Below, you’ll find all of our favorite deals from this week.

Of fitness trackers on sale right now, the deal on the Amazfit Active 2 is ideal, especially if you’re on a budget. It’s currently on sale for just $84.99 ($15 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which is just $5 shy of its lowest price to date.

​​We think the Active 2 is one of the best fitness tracker you can currently buy, namely because it offers a feature set you don’t typically don’t find at this price point. It covers most of the health and fitness features people need and then some, with continuous heart rate and blood oxygen tracking, in addition to menstrual cycle tracking. You also get offline maps with turn-by-turn navigation and up to nine days of battery life — far longer than most smartwatches. It looks stylish, too, thanks to its stainless steel case and 2,000-nit OLED display that makes it seem more expensive than it is.

Despite being introduced at CES 2026 just this week, Anker’s latest 45W Nano Charger is already on sale ahead of its release on January 20th. Right now, you can pick up the wall charger through Anker’s online storefront for $29.99 ($10 off) when you use promo code WS24D5XT3DV9 at checkout.

What makes the latest Nano Charger stand out from previous models its built-in display, which shows real-time charging details like power flow, charge level, and temperature at a glance. If you have an iPhone 15 or newer — or an iPad Pro released in 2020 or later — it can also adjust charging based on the device’s power needs. What’s more, it delivers up to 45W of power in a compact design with folding prongs that rotate 180 degrees, allowing you to squeeze it into smaller spaces.

If it’s cold outside and you’d rather stay in, you can currently snag three 4K UHD Blu-ray discs for $33 through January 19th at Amazon — or $11 per movie. Over 150 titles are on sale, ranging from newer films like Superman and Wicked to older hits like Inception, The Thing, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Scarface, with the discount applying at checkout. Just keep in mind that you’ll need a 4K Blu-ray player — like Panasonic’s UB820-K or DP-UB420-K — or a disc-based Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 to watch them.

This compact trackball seems very versatile.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Keychron announced new mechanical keyboards with marathon battery life at CES, but this trackball stole the spotlight. The Nape Pro is Keychron’s first trackball, and its slender frame means it can work on your desk in multiple ways. You can keep it to the right or left of a keyboard like a traditional trackball, or you can tuck it in front and use it without moving your hands from the keys.

That positioning makes it a bit like a giant Lenovo TrackPoint, typically found on ThinkPad laptops but sometimes used on dedicated keyboards. And it should allow you to move your cursor, turn the Nape Pro’s rotary dial, or press one of its six fully-programmable buttons — all without changing your hand positioning.

Keychron co-founder Paul Tan told The Verge that the Nape Pro is coming soon to Japan via crowdfunding, but it should make it to the US in the spring for $60 to $100, depending on tariffs.

I’m looking forward to when it comes here. I’d put one under my keyboard — or even to the side — while still using a traditional mouse. Options are fun.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Greetings from the year of Linux on my desktop.

In November, I got fed up and said screw it, I’m installing Linux. Since that article was published, I have dealt with one minor catastrophe after another. None of that has anything to do with Linux, mind you. It just meant I didn’t install it on my desktop until Sunday evening.

My goal here is to see how far I can get using Linux as my main OS without spending a ton of time futzing with it — or even much time researching beforehand. I am not looking for more high-maintenance hobbies at this stage. I want to see if Linux is a wingable alternative to Microsoft’s increasingly annoying OS.

Honestly? So far it’s been fine. Many things I expected to be difficult — like getting my Nvidia graphics card working properly — were perfectly straightforward. A few things I thought would be simple weren’t. And I’ve run into one very funny issue with a gaming mouse that only works in games. But I’ve been able to use my Linux setup for work this week, I played exactly one video game, and I even printed something from my accursed printer.

I picked CachyOS rather than a better-known distro like Ubuntu because it’s optimized for modern hardware, and I had heard that it’s easy to install and set up for gaming, which is one of the reasons I’d stuck with Windows for this long. After backing up my Windows image sometime in December (close enough), I follow the installation instructions in the Cachy wiki and download the CachyOS live image to a Ventoy USB drive, plug it into my PC, reboot into the BIOS to disable Secure Boot, reboot again into the Ventoy bootloader, and launch the CachyOS disk image.

First challenge: My mouse buttons don’t work. I can move the cursor, but can’t click on anything. I try plugging in a mouse (without unplugging the first one), same deal. Not a major issue; I can get around fine with just the keyboard. Maybe this is just an issue with the live image.

I launch the installer and am thrust into analysis paralysis. An operating system needs lots of little pieces to work — stuff you don’t even think of as individual components if you use Mac or Windows. How do you boot into the OS? What runs the desktop environment? How are windows drawn? What’s the file system? Where do you get software updates? In Mac and Windows, all those decisions are made for you. But Linux is fundamentally different: The core of the OS is the kernel, and everything else is kind of up to you. A distro is just somebody’s idea of what pieces to use. Some, like Pop_OS! and Mint, aim for simplicity and make all those choices for you (though you can still change them if you want). But Cachy is based on Arch, a notoriously DIY distro, and before I do anything else, I have to pick one of four bootloaders. I pick Limine, for reasons I can’t recall.

Next, I need to figure out where to install it. On the recommendation of Will Smith from the Dual Boot Diaries podcast — from whom the “an operating system is a bunch of pieces” thing above is largely cribbed — I install Cachy on a different physical drive from Windows, since Windows updates tend not to care if they overwrite other bootloaders.

I have a 4TB storage drive with just over a terabyte of data on it, so I shrink that partition down to 2TB using the installer’s manual partitioning interface, then (following the guide) make a 2GB boot partition and a root partition using the btrfs file system. The guide says it needs at least 20GB, so I go big and make it 100GB. This will cause a minor problem later.

Next, I have to pick one of thirteen different desktop environments. This is too many options. KDE and Gnome seem to be the best-supported for gaming, so I pick KDE. I could rabbit-hole on this, but I don’t.

And then I just have to pick a username and password and name the computer. After some thought, I go with Maggie, after my in-laws’ cat, who half the family calls Linux. She doesn’t answer to either name.

Installation takes six minutes. I reboot the computer, and it loads into the Limine bootloader, which has also found my Windows install, so I can choose between Cachy and Windows.

Then I’m on the Cachy desktop, and my mouse buttons still aren’t working. Swapping USB ports doesn’t do anything. Plugging in my trackball doesn’t fix it either. I finally try unplugging the mouse, which makes the trackball work normally. My gaming mouse is an ancient Mad Catz Cyborg RAT 7; it turns out this is a known issue. I defer editing configuration files for now and just keep the mouse unplugged.

That weird mouse aside, all of the hardware I’ve tried so far has just worked. Cachy automatically installed the correct GPU drivers; my monitor, speakers, and Logitech webcam work fine with no effort. Even my printer prints, with only a tweak to my firewall settings.

There are lots of ways to install apps on Linux. Sometimes you can just download them from a company’s website, or you get them from your distro’s official repositories, or GitHub, or wherever. There’s no official app store for Linux, but there are at least three projects aiming to provide universal Linux apps: Flatpak, AppImage, and Snap. Neat! Commence hodgepodging.

I grab Chromium, Discord, Slack, and Audacity using the “Install Apps” button on Cachy’s welcome screen. Slack I get from the Arch User Repository. Twenty minutes later, I try to install 1Password from the same location, but the repository is down. I pick up my kid from a playdate and try again. It works.

I prefer the Arc browser, which doesn’t have a Linux build, but there are plenty of browsers. Firefox and Chromium will do. I can’t find official apps for Airtable (which I use for work), Spotify, or Apple Music, but they all work fine in the browser in the short term, and I’ll revisit this later.

Cachy has a one-click gaming package install that includes the Proton compatibility layer, Steam, and Heroic (a launcher for Epic, GOG, and Amazon). I figure I ought to try one game. Then I remember that my root partition is only 100GB. I reboot back into the Cachy live image and use the Parted utility to increase it to 1TB, then make a second btrfs partition in the remaining space. I reboot, log into Epic and GOG, and start downloading The Outer Worlds, a game from 2019 I’ve been playing a bit lately. It runs fine with Proton, and I can even sync my saves from the cloud. I play it for a few minutes with my trackball, remember I hate gaming on a trackball, and plug my gaming mouse back in. It works fine as long as I’m in the game, but outside the game, mouse clicks stop working again. It makes sense — the bug is on the desktop, not in games — but it’s very funny to have a gaming mouse that only works for gaming.

The biggest issue I’ve had so far is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. For some reason, Microsoft hasn’t prioritized making a Linux version of Bedrock. Java Edition works fine in Linux, but I play Minecraft with my kids, and they’re on Bedrock Edition on their iPads. There’s supposed to be a way to run the Android app with MCPE Launcher, but I couldn’t get it to work. There’s also a project to get the Windows version running on Proton, which will be my next step.

I hear good things about howdy, a Linux equivalent to Windows Hello face authentication, but I haven’t installed it yet. I hear the Zen browser is a good Arc alternative. I also haven’t gotten my cloud storage synced, configured git so I can compile programs from scratch, figured out a backup strategy, or tried much other hardware beyond what’s currently plugged into my computer. There’s a command-line Spotify player I want to try. I’ve only scratched the surface.

I did take the time to install a KDE Plasma theme that makes it look like Windows XP, though. Just because.

I’m well aware this is the honeymoon phase. And using Linux for less than a week isn’t exactly a flex. Many people use Linux. And I haven’t even tried doing anything particularly difficult, or playing a game that came out this decade. But so far it’s been a much easier transition than expected, and a quieter experience overall. My OS isn’t trying to change my browser or search engine to make some shareholder happy somewhere. It’s not nudging me to try some bullshit AI feature.

Will I go crawling back to macOS or Windows the first time I have to edit a batch of photos? Possibly! I’ll definitely boot back into Windows — or pull out a Chromebook — to play Minecraft with my kids, if I can’t get it running on Linux. And I don’t think I’ll ever be able to use Linux exclusively; my job as a reviews editor means I have to stay familiar with as many operating systems as possible. (This is a good way to drive yourself nuts.)

I’m sure I’ll run into plenty of fun problems soon enough. But the first few days have been great.

How I learned to stop worrying and love AI slop

If I were to locate the moment AI slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral last summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical generated clips.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance.

I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable. To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything after all. Read the full story.

A new CRISPR startup is betting regulators will ease up on gene-editingHere at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved, and it’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments which could avoid costly new trials or approvals for every new version. Read the full story.

America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research

The first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Wednesday, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. Let’s take a look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

How to measure the returns on R&D spendingGiven the draconian cuts to US federal funding for science, it’s worth asking some hard-nosed money questions: How much should we be spending on R&D? How much value do we get out of such investments, anyway?To answer that, in several recent papers, economists have approached this issue in clever new ways.  And, though they ask slightly different questions, their conclusions share a bottom line: R&D is, in fact, one of the better long-term investments that the government can make.

            <h2>A new CRISPR startup is betting regulators will ease up on gene-editing</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/09/1130945/crispr-startup-aurora-betting-regulation-pku/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Here at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved. It’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.

It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”

So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments. Aurora Therapeutics, which has $16 million from Menlo Ventures and counts CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna as an advisor, essentially hopes to win approval for gene-editing drugs that can be slightly adjusted, or personalized, without requiring costly new trials or approvals for every new version.

The need to change regulations around gene-editing treatments was endorsed in November by the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Martin Makary, who said the agency would open a “new” regulatory pathway for “bespoke, personalized therapies” that can’t easily be tested in conventional ways.

Aurora’s first target, the rare inherited disease phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, is a case in point. People with PKU lack a working version of an enzyme needed to use up the amino acid phenylalanine, a component of pretty much all meat and protein. If the amino acid builds up, it causes brain damage. So patients usually go on an onerous “diet for life” of special formula drinks and vegetables.

In theory, gene editing can fix PKU. In mice, scientists have already restored the gene for the enzyme by rewriting DNA in liver cells, which both make the enzyme and are some of the easiest to reach with a gene-editing drug. The problem is that in human patients, many different mutations can affect the critical gene. According to Cory Harding, a researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University, scientists know about 1,600 different DNA mutations that cause PKU.

There’s no way anyone will develop 1,600 different gene-editing drugs. Instead, Aurora’s goal is to eventually win approval for a single gene editor that, with minor adjustments, could be used to correct several of the most common mutations, including one that’s responsible for about 10% of the estimated 20,000 PKU cases in the US.

“We can’t have a separate clinical trial for each mutation,” says Edward Kaye, the CEO of Aurora. “The way the FDA approves gene editing has to change, and I think they’ve been very understanding that is the case.”

A gene editor is a special protein that can zero in on a specific location in the genome and change it. To prepare one, Aurora will put genetic code for the editor into a nanoparticle along with a targeting molecule. In total, it will involve about 5,000 gene letters. But only 20 of them need to change in order to redirect the treatment to repair a different mutation.

“Over 99% of the drug stays the same,” says Johnny Hu, a partner at Menlo Ventures, which put up the funding for the startup.

The new company came together after Hu met over pizza with Fyodor Urnov, an outspoken gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is Aurora’s cofounder and sits on its board.

In 2022, Urnov had written a New York Times editorial bemoaning the “chasm” between what editing technology can do and the “legal, financial, and organizational” realities preventing researchers from curing people.

“I went to Fyodor and said, ‘Hey, we’re getting all these great results in the clinic with CRISPR, but why hasn’t it scaled?” says Hu. Part of the reason is that most gene-editing companies are chasing the same few conditions, such as sickle-cell, where (as luck would have it) a single edit works for all patients. But that leaves around 400 million people who have 7,000 other inherited conditions without much hope to get their DNA fixed, Urnov estimated in his editorial.

Then, last May, came the dramatic demonstration of the first fully “personalized” gene-editing treatment. A team in Philadelphia, assisted by Urnov and others, succeeded in correcting the DNA of a baby, named KJ Muldoon, who had an entirely unique mutation that caused a metabolic disease. Though it didn’t target PKU, the project showed that gene editing could theoretically fix some inherited diseases “on demand.”

It also underscored a big problem. Treating a single child required a large team and cost millions in time, effort, and materials—all to create a drug that would never be used again.

That’s exactly the sort of situation the new “umbrella” trials are supposed to address. Kiran Musunuru, who co-led the team at the University of Pennsylvania, says he’s been in discussions with the FDA to open a study of bespoke gene editors this year focusing on diseases of the type Baby KJ had, called urea cycle disorders. Each time a new patient appears, he says, they’ll try to quickly put together a variant of their gene-editing drug that’s tuned to fix that child’s particular genetic problem.

Musunuru, who isn’t involved with Aurora, does not think the company’s plans for PKU count as fully personalized editors. “These corporate PKU efforts have nothing whatsoever to do with Baby KJ,” he says. He says his center continues to focus on mutations “so ultra-rare that we don’t see any scenario where a for-profit gene-editing company would find that indication to be commercially viable.”

Instead, what’s occurring in PKU, says Musunuru, is that researchers have realized they can assemble “a bunch” of the most frequent mutations “into a large enough group of patients to make a platform PKU therapy commercially viable.”

While that would still leave out many patients with extra-rare gene errors, Musunuru says any gene-editing treatment at all would still be “a big improvement over the status quo, which  is zero genetic therapies for PKU.”

            <h2>America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1130905/americas-diet-guidelines-ignore-scientific-research-red-meat-beef-tallow/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new year has barely begun, but the first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Monday, the US’s federal health agency upended its recommendations for routine childhood vaccinations—a move that health associations worry puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.

There was more news from the federal government on Wednesday, when health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.

That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.

These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. So this week let’s look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

The government dietary guidelines have been around since the 1980s. They are updated every five years, in a process that typically involves a team of nutrition scientists who have combed over scientific research for years. That team will first publish its findings in a scientific report, and, around a year later, the finalized Dietary Guidelines for Americans are published.

The last guidelines covered the period 2020 to 2025, and new guidelines were expected in the summer of 2025. Work had already been underway for years; the scientific report intended to inform them was published back in 2024. But the publication of the guidelines was delayed by last year’s government shutdown, Kennedy said last year. They were finally published yesterday.

Nutrition experts had been waiting with bated breath. Nutrition science has evolved slightly over the last five years, and some were expecting to see new recommendations. Research now suggests, for example, that there is no “safe” level of alcohol consumption.

We are also beginning to learn more about health risks associated with some ultraprocessed foods (although we still don’t have a good understanding of what they might be, or what even counts as “ultraprocessed”.) And some scientists were expecting to see the new guidelines factor in environmental sustainability, says Gabby Headrick, the associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security in Washington DC.

Many of the recommendations are sensible. The guidelines recommend a diet rich in whole foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. They recommend avoiding highly processed foods and added sugars. They also highlight the importance of dietary protein, whole grains, and “healthy” fats.

But not all of them are, says Headrick. The guidelines open with a “new pyramid” of foods. This inverted triangle is topped with “protein, dairy, and healthy fats” on one side and “vegetables and fruits” on the other.

There are a few problems with this image. For starters, its shape—nutrition scientists have long moved on from the food pyramids of the 1990s, says Headrick. They’re confusing and make it difficult for people to understand what the contents of their plate should look like. That’s why scientists now use an image of a plate to depict a healthy diet.

“We&#39;ve been using MyPlate to describe the dietary guidelines in a very consumer-friendly, nutrition-education-friendly way for over the last decade now,” says Headrick. (The UK’s National Health Service takes a similar approach.)

And then there’s the content of that food pyramid. It puts a significant focus on meat and whole-fat dairy produce. The top left image—the one most viewers will probably see first—is of a steak. Smack in the middle of the pyramid is a stick of butter. That’s new. And it’s not a good thing.

While both red meat and whole-fat dairy can certainly form part of a healthy diet, nutrition scientists have long been recommending that most people try to limit their consumption of these foods. Both can be high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the US. In 2015, on the basis of limited evidence, the World Health Organization classified red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”

Also concerning is the document’s definition of “healthy fats,” which includes butter and beef tallow (a MAHA favorite). Neither food is generally considered to be as healthy as olive oil, for example. While olive oil contains around two grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, a tablespoon of beef tallow has around six grams of saturated fat, and the same amount of butter contains around seven grams of saturated fat, says Headrick.

“I think these are pretty harmful dietary recommendations to be making when we have established that those specific foods likely do not have health-promoting benefits,” she adds.

Red meat is not exactly a sustainable food, and neither are dairy products. And the advice on alcohol is relatively vague, recommending that people “consume less alcohol for better overall health” (which might leave you wondering: Less than what?).

There are other questionable recommendations in the guidelines. Americans are advised to include more protein in their diets—at levels between 1.2 and 1.6 grams daily per kilo of body weight, 50% to 100% more than recommended in previous guidelines. There’s a risk that increasing protein consumption to such levels could raise a person’s intake of both calories and saturated fats to unhealthy levels, says José Ordovás, a senior nutrition scientist at Tufts University. “I would err on the low side,” he says.

Some nutrition scientists are questioning why these changes have been made. It’s not as though the new recommendations were in the 2024 scientific report. And the evidence on red meat and saturated fat hasn’t changed, says Headrick.

In reporting this piece, I contacted many contributors to the previous guidelines, and some who had led research for 2024’s scientific report. None of them agreed to comment on the new guidelines on the record. Some seemed disgruntled. One merely told me that the process by which the new guidelines had been created was “opaque.”

“These people invested a lot of their time, and they did a thorough job [over] a couple of years, identifying [relevant scientific studies],” says Ordovás. “I’m not surprised that when they see that [their] work was ignored and replaced with something [put together] quickly, that they feel a little bit disappointed,” he says.

Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos

At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses into the lining of the uterus then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear. This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three recent papers published by Cell Press, scientists report what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus. Read our story about their work, and what might come next.

LLMs contain a LOT of parameters. But what’s a parameter?

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind

For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? Concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the US’s struggling offshore wind industry.

            <h2>Using unstructured data to fuel enterprise AI success</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1129506/using-unstructured-data-to-fuel-enterprise-ai-success/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprises are sitting on vast quantities of unstructured data, from call records and video footage to customer complaint histories and supply chain signals. Yet this invaluable business intelligence, estimated to make up as much as 90% of the data generated by organizations, historically remained dormant because its unstructured nature makes analysis extremely difficult.

But if managed and centralized effectively, this messy and often voluminous data is not only a precious asset for training and optimizing next-generation AI systems, enhancing their accuracy, context, and adaptability, it can also deliver profound insights that drive real business outcomes.

A compelling example of this can be seen in the US NBA basketball team the Charlotte Hornets who successfully leveraged untapped video footage of gameplay—previously too copious to watch and too unstructured to analyze—to identify a new competition-winning recruit. However, before that data could deliver results, analysts working for the team first had to overcome the critical challenge of preparing the raw, unstructured footage for interpretation.

Unstructured data presents inherent difficulties due to its widely varying format, quality, and reliability, requiring specialized tools like natural language processing and AI to make sense of it.

Every organization’s pool of unstructured data also contains domain-specific characteristics and terminology that generic AI models may not automatically understand. A financial services firm, for example, cannot simply use a general language model for fraud detection. Instead, it needs to adapt the model to understand regulatory language, transaction patterns, industry-specific risk indicators, and unique company context like data policies.

The challenge intensifies when integrating multiple data sources with varying structures and quality standards, as teams may struggle to distinguish valuable data from noise.

When the Charlotte Hornets set out to identify a new draft pick for their team, they turned to AI tools including computer vision to analyze raw game footage from smaller leagues, which exist outside the tiers of the game normally visible to NBA scouts and, therefore, are not as readily available for analysis.

“Computer vision is a tool that has existed for some time, but I think the applicability in this age of AI is increasing rapidly,” says Jordan Cealey, senior vice president at AI company Invisible Technologies, which worked with the Charlotte Hornets on this project. “You can now take data sources that you&#39;ve never been able to consume, and provide an analytical layer that&#39;s never existed before.”

By deploying a variety of computer vision techniques, including object and player tracking, movement pattern analysis, and geometrically mapping points on the court, the team was able to extract kinematic data, such as the coordinates of players during movement, and generate metrics like speed and explosiveness to acceleration.

This provided the team with rich, data-driven insights about individual players, helping them to identify and select a new draft whose skill and techniques filled a hole in the Charlotte Hornets’ own capabilities. The chosen athlete went on to be named the most valuable player at the 2025 NBA Summer League and helped the team win their first summer championship title.

Before data from game footage can be used, it needs to be labeled so the model can interpret it. The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.

From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”

For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.

Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.

“We couldn&#39;t do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”

Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can&#39;t assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That&#39;s where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”

For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.

Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.

“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”

            <h2>What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.

This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.

In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).

Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the New York Times that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.

This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)

The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.

There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.

Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.

“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told TechCrunch.)

But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.

This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.

One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.

Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.

What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.

To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”

            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <h2>Five stars, Zero trust</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-02</strong></p>

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.
