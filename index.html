            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/motorola-reveals-the-razr-fold-a-book-style-foldable-launching-this-summer/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Motorola is no stranger to foldables, having revived the Razr as a flip-style foldable phone in 2020. Now that it has a few iterations of modern flip phones under its belt, Moto is embarking on a new challenge: big foldables. The new (and thoroughly leaked) Motorola Razr Fold is a book-style foldable like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold and Google’s Pixel Fold lines, offering a smartphone-sized external display with a big foldable panel inside.

Motorola is taking the opportunity to reveal the phone at CES, but it’s far from ready for launch. Currently, Motorola is aiming to release the Razr Fold this coming summer for an unknown amount of money—Motorola won’t confirm pricing or really much of anything about the Razr Fold at this time.

What we do know is the device will be about as big as other large foldable phones, featuring a 6.6-inch external display and an 8.1-inch internal one. Moto says the main foldable OLED panel will have a 2K resolution, which means roughly 2,000 pixels tall. Again, this is similar to existing foldables.

The Razr Fold will be compatible with the new Moto Pen Ultra, an active stylus designed with the Fold in mind. This will at least set the Razr Fold apart from the competition. Samsung supported the S Pen stylus on several generations of its Z Fold line, but that ended with 2025’s Galaxy Z Fold 7. Moto will integrate stylus support in its stock apps, but there’s no word on third-party support, which was always the S Pen’s downfall.

We’re still months out from any firm release details, so it’s not surprising that Moto is playing this one close to the chest. One of the few things Moto is willing to talk about is the camera setup, probably because it feels the comparison between the Razr Fold and similar devices will be flattering. And it is… kind of.

The Razr Fold will have a triple 50MP camera system. Some foldable devices like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 have flagship-level main sensors, but the others are a big step down due to space constraints. Motorola will use a 50MP Sony Lytia sensor for the primary, along with a 50MP ultrawide (with macro) and a 50MP 3x telephoto. The camera module adds a fair bit of chunk to the back panel—it looks to almost double the thickness of the phone in that area, but Moto has not released official measurements to confirm that.

Motorola is offering a few hints about how the software on this phone will work, but unsurprisingly, there’s a lot we don’t know. For instance, it’s launching in the summer, so does that mean it will run Android 17? Google changed the release schedule in 2025 to account for the glut of new Android devices that launch each summer.

We are also told the Razr Fold’s software will take advantage of the form factor with “flexible layouts, “adaptive interfaces,” and “multitasking enhancements.” The company declined to elaborate on how any of those will work. Motorola will continue offering AI features like Catch Me Up and Pay Attention, but they’re joined by a new AI experience called Qira, which the company says will be accessible across both Motorola and Lenovo devices.

The idea is that Qira remembers your context from other devices, allowing you to take action across apps, create documents, and get supposedly useful reminders. Qira will launch on Lenovo laptops soon, with Motorola phones in the Edge and Razr family soon after. The new AI platform, which relies on technology from the likes of Microsoft and Perplexity, will be available on the Razr Fold at launch.

We also have no idea what Motorola will charge for this phone. Most book-style foldables retail for around $2,000, and the components that go into these phones are not getting cheaper. In fact, many of them could be getting much more expensive in 2026. When pressed, Motorola refuses to even offer a ballpark estimate of MSRP. We should get more details on the Razr Fold specs and pricing as the summer launch window approaches.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As a Windows system built inside of a functioning membrane keyboard, the HP EliteBoard G1a announced today is a more accessible alternative to other keyboard-PCs.

The Commodore 64 made the keyboard-PC famous in the 1980s, but the keyboard-PC space has been dominated by the Raspberry Pi. In 2019, the single-board computer (SBC) maker released the Raspberry Pi 400, which is essentially a Raspberry Pi 4 SBC inside a case that also functions as a keyboard for the system. USB, HDMI, and Ethernet ports, plus a GPIO header and native Raspberry Pi OS Linux distribution add up to a low-end desktop computer experience that only costs $100. Then the Raspberry Pi 500 with a Pi 5 powered by a quad-core, 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 inside, and the Pi 500+, which has NVMe SSD, instead of microSD, storage, and is built inside of a low-profile mechanical keyboard (it’s also twice as expensive at $200).

But Raspberry Pis largely appeal to tinkerers, DIYers, and Linux fans, making Pi-as-a-desktop a niche product with a substantial learning curve for newcomers.

Alternatively, HP’s EliteBoard will bring Windows and a more powerful x86 architecture to the keyboard-PC form factor. HP says the EliteBoard will support Windows 11 Pro for Business and an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series processor with up to 50 TOPs NPU. The device will be sold with a 32 W internal battery and is part of Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC program.

The EliteBoard is aimed at workplaces that would benefit from ultraportable computers that can be quickly set up, such as corporate offices where employees don’t have assigned seats (also known as hot desking). In its announcement, HP said that the EliteBoard, which weighs 1.65 pounds, was built to “move, connect, and adapt to any workspace with ease.”

HP hasn’t released further specs, but based on what we do know, the EliteBoard will have limited computing power, especially compared to other Windows 11 business PCs. Still, the unique system is set to bring new capabilities and a familiar interface to keyboard-PCs. It could garner deeper interest for the category from IT departments seeking easy hybrid workplace solutions, makers, and minimalists interested in experimenting,

HP is demoing the keyboard-PC at CES 2026 in Las Vegas this week and plans to release it in March. It hasn’t set a price yet.</div>

            <h2>With GeForce Super GPUs missing in action, Nvidia focuses on software upgrades</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/nvidia-leans-on-dlss-improvements-to-make-up-for-a-lack-of-gpus-at-ces/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the first time in years, Nvidia declined to introduce new GeForce graphics card models at CES. CEO Jensen Huang’s characteristically sprawling and under-rehearsed 90-minute keynote focused almost entirely on the company’s dominant AI business, relegating the company’s gaming-related announcements to a separate video posted later in the evening.

Instead, the company focused on software improvements for its existing hardware. The biggest announcement in this vein is DLSS 4.5, which adds a handful of new features to Nvidia’s basket of upscaling and frame generation technologies.

DLSS upscaling is being improved by a new “second-generation transformer model” that Nvidia says has been “trained on an expanded data set” to improve its predictions when generating new pixels. According to Nvidia’s Bryan Catanzaro, this is particularly beneficial for image quality in the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, where the upscaler has to do more guessing because it’s working from a lower-resolution source image.

DLSS Multi-Frame Generation is also improving, increasing the number of AI-generated frames per rendered frame from three to five. This new 6x mode for DLSS MFG is being paired with something called Dynamic Multi-Frame Generation, where the number of AI-generated frames can dynamically change, increasing generated frames during “demanding scenes,” and decreasing the number of generated frames during simpler scenes “so it only computes what’s needed.”

The standard caveats for Multi-Frame Generation still apply: It still needs an RTX 50-series GPU (the 40-series can still only generate one frame for every rendered frame, and older cards can’t generate extra frames at all), and the game still needs to be running at a reasonably high base frame rate to minimize lag and weird rendering artifacts. It remains a useful tool for making fast-running games run faster, but it won’t help make an unplayable frame rate into a playable one.

To Nvidia’s credit, the new DLSS 4.5 transformer model runs on GeForce 20- and 30-series GPUs, giving users of older-but-still-usable graphics cards access to the improved upscaling. But Nvidia said that owners of those GPUs would see more of a performance hit from enabling DLSS 4.5 than users of GeForce 40- and 50-series cards would, and initial testing from some outlets seems to be bearing that out. Compared to the DLSS 4.0 transformer model, Mostly Positive Reviews found that the new DLSS 4.5 model reduced performance on an RTX 3080 Ti by between 14 and 24 percent depending on the game and the settings, though performance is still presumably better than it would be on the same card if you tried to run those games at native resolutions.

The DLSS 4.5 transformer model is available now, after a driver update, and you can use the Nvidia App to select the new transformer model in games that already support DLSS upscaling (whether the option appears in any in-game menus remains up to the game developer). The Multi-Frame Generation updates will be available sometime in spring 2026.

One feature that hasn’t broken cover yet? Nvidia’s Reflex 2, an update to its input lag reduction technology that the company announced at CES last year. Upscaling and frame generation technologies generally, something that Reflex helps to offset, and the company claimed an up to 75 percent reduction in lag when using Reflex 2 on a 50-series card. But Nvidia didn’t mention Reflex 2 this year, and hasn’t provided any updates on when it might be released.

In another era, CES 2026 would have been a good time to introduce a 50-series Super update, a mid-generation spec bump to keep the lineup fresh while Nvidia works on whatever will become the GeForce 60-series. The company used CES 2024 to launch the RTX 40-series Super cards, helping improve the value proposition for a bunch of cards that had launched at prices many reviewers and users grumbled about.

Indeed, the rumor mill suggested that Nvidia was working on a 50-series Super refresh for the 2025 holiday season, and its biggest improvement was going to be a 50 percent bump in RAM capacity, said to be possible because of a switch from 2GB RAM chips to 3GB chips. This would have given the theoretical 5070 Super 18GB of RAM, and the 5070 Ti Super and 5080 Super were said to have 24GB of memory.

Assuming those rumors are correct, those plans could have been dashed by the abrupt RAM shortages and price spikes that started late last year. These have been caused at least in part by sky-high demand for RAM from AI data centers; given that modern-day Nvidia is mainly an AI company that sells consumer GPUs on the side, it stands to reason that the company would allocate all the RAM it can get to its more profitable AI GPUs, rather than a mid-generation GeForce refresh.

In fact, none of the major dedicated GPU manufacturers has introduced new products at CES this year. AMD and Intel announced products with improved integrated GPUs, which use system RAM rather than requiring their own. But there wasn’t a peep about any new dedicated Radeon cards, and Intel hasn’t introduced a new dedicated Arc graphics card in almost a year, despite some signs that a midrange Arc B770 card exists and could be nearly ready to launch.</div>

            <h2>Letting prisons jam contraband phones is a bad idea, phone companies tell FCC</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/letting-prisons-jam-contraband-phones-is-a-bad-idea-phone-companies-tell-fcc/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Federal Communications Commission proposal to let state and local prisons jam contraband cell phones has support from Republican attorneys general and prison phone companies but faces opposition from wireless carriers that say it would disrupt lawful communications. Groups dedicated to Wi-Fi and GPS also raised concerns in comments to the FCC.

“Jamming will block all communications, not just communications from contraband devices,” wireless lobby group CTIA said in December 29 comments in response to Chairman Brendan Carr’s proposal. The CTIA said that “jamming blocks all communications, including lawful communications such as 911 calling,” and argued that the FCC “has no authority to allow jamming.”

CTIA members AT&T and Verizon expressed their displeasure in separate comments to the FCC. “The proposed legal framework is based on a flawed factual premise,” AT&T wrote.

While the Communications Act prohibits interference with authorized radio communications, Carr’s plan tries to sidestep this prohibition by proposing to de-authorize certain communications, AT&T wrote. “This legal framework, however, is premised on a fundamental factual error: the assumption that jammers will only block ‘unauthorized’ communications without impacting lawful uses. There is no way to jam some communications on a spectrum band but not others,” AT&T wrote.

Previous FCC leaders recognized the problem that radio jammers can’t differentiate between contraband and legitimate devices, AT&T said. “As explained above, there are no technical workarounds to that limitation with respect to jammers,” AT&T wrote.

In 2013, the FCC explained that jamming systems transmit on the same frequencies as their targets in order to disrupt the links between devices and network base stations and that this process “render[s] any wireless device operating on those frequencies unusable. When used to disrupt wireless devices, radio signal jammers cannot differentiate between contraband devices and legitimate devices, including devices making 911 calls. Radio signal jammers block all wireless communications on affected spectrum bands.”

That apparently hasn’t changed. The FCC’s new proposal issued in September 2025 said the commission’s “understanding is that jamming solutions block calls on all affected frequencies and… are unable to allow 911 calls to be transmitted.” But the proposal indicates this may be an acceptable outcome, as “some state DOC [Department of Corrections] officials have indicated that correctional facilities typically do not allow any calls from within, including emergency calls.”

If the FCC adopts its plan, it would “authorize, for the first time, non-federal operation of radio frequency (RF) jamming solutions in correctional facilities,” the proposal said.

Carr said in September that previous FCC actions, such as authorizing “contraband interdiction systems” and letting wireless carriers disable contraband phones at a prison’s request, have not been enough. “Contraband cellphones have been pouring into state and local prisons by the tens of thousands every year,” Carr said. “They are used to run drug operations, orchestrate kidnappings, and further criminal enterprises in communities all across the country.”

Carr said that prisons and jails will not be required to install jamming systems and that the FCC “proposes to authorize targeted jamming. Jamming technology can be precise enough that it does not interrupt the regular communications of law enforcement or community members in the vicinity.” The FCC proposal asks the public for comment on “restrictions that might prove necessary to ensure that jamming solutions are limited to this targeted use, and to mitigate the risk that these solutions are deployed in contexts other than a correctional facility environment.”

Jamming has support from 23 state attorneys general, all Republicans, who told the FCC that “inmates routinely use smuggled phones to coordinate criminal enterprises, intimidate witnesses, and orchestrate violence both inside and outside prison walls.” More jamming support came from the state Department of Corrections in both Florida and South Carolina.

Prison phone companies that would financially benefit from increased use of official phone systems also support jamming cell phones. Global Tel*Link (aka ViaPath) called the plan “one more tool to help combat the serious problem of contraband wireless devices in correctional facilities.”

NCIC Correctional Services, another prison phone firm, said that jamming to create “‘dead zones’ within correctional facilities would permit smaller jails to restrict contraband device access where it is not cost-effective to install managed access systems.” Detection Innovation Group, which sells inmate-tracking technology to prisons and jails, also urged the FCC to allow jamming.

Telecom industry groups say that limiting the effect of jamming will be difficult or impossible. The harms identified over a decade ago “remain the same today, although their effects are magnified by the increased use of wireless devices for broadband,” said the Telecommunications Industry Association, a standards-development group. “If an RF jamming solution is deployed at a correctional facility, such deployment risks not only interfering with voice communications but disrupting vital broadband services as well within the facility itself as well as the surrounding community.”

Verizon told the FCC that the Communications Act “requires more restrictive use of jamming devices than the NPRM [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking] proposes.” The CTIA argued that jamming isn’t necessary because the wireless industry already offers Managed Access Systems (MAS) as “a safe and effective contraband interdiction ecosystem.”

A Managed Access System establishes “a private cellular network that captures communications (voice, text, data) on commercial wireless frequencies within a correctional facility, determines whether that exchange is coming from or going to a contraband device, and, if so, prevents those communications from connecting to the wireless provider’s network,” the CTIA said. “At the same time, MAS allows communications to and from approved devices to be transmitted without interruption, including 911 and public safety calls within the correctional facility.”

More opposition came from the Wi-Fi Alliance, a tech industry group that tests and certifies interoperability of Wi-Fi products. The FCC proposal failed to “address the potential impact of such jamming on lawfully operating Wi-Fi and other unlicensed devices,” the group told the FCC.

The FCC plan is not limited to jamming of phones on spectrum licensed for the exclusive use of wireless carriers. The FCC additionally sought comment on whether contraband devices operating on Wi-Fi airwaves and other unlicensed spectrum should be subject to jamming. That’s concerning to the Wi-Fi Alliance because Wi-Fi operates on unlicensed spectrum that is shared by many users.

“Accordingly, declaring that a jammer on unlicensed spectrum is permitted to disrupt the communications of another device also operating on unlicensed spectrum is contrary to the foundational principle of Part 15 [of FCC rules], under which all unauthorized devices must cooperate in the use of spectrum,” the group said. “Moreover, authorizing the use of jamming equipment in unlicensed spectrum pursuant to Part 15 would undermine decades of global spectrum policy, weaken trust in license-exempt technologies by providing no assurance that devices using those technologies will work, and set a dangerous precedent for the intentional misuse of unlicensed spectrum.”

Letting jammers interfere with Wi-Fi and other unlicensed devices would effectively turn the jammers into “a de facto licensed service, operating with primary status in bands that are designated for unlicensed use,” the Wi-Fi Alliance said. “To achieve that undesirable result, the Commission would be required to change the Table of Frequency Allocations and issue authorizations for operations on unlicensed spectrum (just as it contemplates for the use of cell phone spectrum in jamming devices). That outcome would upend the premise of Part 15 operations.”

The GPS Innovation Alliance, another industry group, warned that even if the FCC imposes strict limits on transmission power and out-of-band emissions, “jammer transmissions can have spillover effects on adjacent and nearby band operations. Only specialized, encrypted signals, and specialized receivers and devices designed to decrypt those signals, are jam-resistant, in contrast to how most commercial technologies work.”

Now that public comments are in, Carr has to decide whether to move ahead with the plan as originally written, scrap it entirely, or come up with a compromise that might address some of the concerns raised by opponents. The FCC’s NPRM suggests a pilot program could be used to evaluate interference risks before a broader rollout, and the pilot idea received some support from carriers in their comments. A final proposal would be put to a vote of commissioners at the Republican-majority FCC.</div>

            <h2>Dell’s XPS revival is a welcome reprieve from the “AI PC” fad</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/dells-xps-revival-is-a-welcome-reprieve-from-the-ai-pc-fad/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After making the obviously poor decision to kill its XPS laptops and desktops in January 2025, Dell started selling 16- and 14-inch XPS laptops again today.

“It was obvious we needed to change,” Jeff Clarke, vice chairman and COO at Dell Technologies, said at a press event in New York City previewing Dell’s CES 2026 announcements.

A year ago, Dell abandoned XPS branding, as well as its Latitude, Inspiron, and Precision PC lineups. The company replaced the reputable brands with Dell Premium, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. Each series included a base model, as well as “Plus” and “Premium.” Dell isn’t resurrecting its Latitude, Inspiron, or Precision series, and it will still sell “Dell Pro” models.

The revival of XPS means the return of one of the easiest recommendations for consumer ultralight laptops. Before last year’s shunning, XPS laptops had a reputation for thin, lightweight designs with modern features and decent performance for the price. This year, Dell is even doing away with some of the design tweaks that it introduced to the XPS lineup in 2022, which, unfortunately, were shoppers’ sole option last year.

Inheriting traits from the XPS 13 Plus introduced in 2022, the XPS-equivalent laptops that Dell released in 2025 had a capacitive-touch row without physical buttons, a borderless touchpad with haptic feedback, and a flat, lattice-free keyboard. The design was meant to enable more thermal headroom but made using the computers feel uncomfortable and unfamiliar.

The XPS 14 and XPS 16 laptops launching today have physical function rows. They still have a haptic touchpad, but now the touchpad has comforting left and right borders. And although the XPS 14 and XPS 16 have the same lattice-free keyboard of the XPS 13 Plus, Dell will release a cheaper XPS 13 later this year with a more traditional chiclet keyboard, since those types of keyboards are cheaper to make.

Dell’s about-face comes amid ongoing declines in its consumer PC revenue and global PC market share. It also represents a divergence in Dell’s messaging to computer shoppers.

Last year, Dell, as well as many other computer makers, committed to convincing people that they not only needed to buy a new computer but also a new “AI PC.” Corporate desire to leverage newly mainstream interest in AI to push PC sales was part of the reason Dell made new brand names for its 2025 computers.

“The AI PC market is quickly evolving,” Kevin Terwilliger, VP and GM of commercial, consumer, and gaming PCs at Dell, told reporters last year when announcing the new branding. “(E)veryone from IT decision makers to professionals and everyday users are looking at on-device AI to help drive productivity and creativity. To make finding the right AI PC easy for customers, we’ve introduced three simple product categories to focus on core customer needs,” he said.

But this week, as Dell unveils its ultralight laptop lineup, AI is taking a backseat.

“We’re getting back to our roots with a renewed focus on consumer and gaming,” Clarke said in a statement accompanying Dell’s announcement today.

The website for the new XPS laptops makes an obligatory nod to Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC program but is primarily focused on the computers’ thin build, low weight, battery life, and display. It seems Dell has accepted that these are the things that the average person cares about in their primary laptop, not the computer’s ability to run AI locally.

The XPS 14 launched today starting at $2,049, and the XPS 16 launched with a starting price of $2,200. A Dell spokesperson told Ars Technica that Dell will release additional configurations in February that are “well under $2,000.” Dell hasn’t shared final specs, pricing, or a release date for the 2026 XPS 13.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/news-orgs-want-openai-to-dig-up-millions-of-deleted-chatgpt-logs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not only does it appear that OpenAI has lost its fight to keep news organizations from digging through 20 million ChatGPT logs to find evidence of copyright infringement—but also OpenAI now faces calls for sanctions and demands to retrieve and share potentially millions of deleted chats long thought of as untouchable in the litigation.

On Monday, US District Judge Sidney Stein denied objections that OpenAI raised, claiming that Magistrate Judge Ona Wang failed to adequately balance the privacy interests of ChatGPT users who are not involved in the litigation when ordering OpenAI to produce 20 million logs.

Instead, OpenAI wanted Stein to agree that it would be much less burdensome to users if OpenAI ran search terms to find potentially infringing outputs in the sample. That way, news plaintiffs would only get access to chats that were relevant to its case, OpenAI suggested.

But Stein found that Wang appropriately weighed ChatGPT users’ privacy interests when ordering OpenAI to produce the logs. For example, to shield ChatGPT users, the total number of logs shared was substantially reduced from tens of billions to 20 million, he wrote, and OpenAI has stripped all identifying information from any chats that will be shared.

Stein further agreed that news plaintiffs needed access to the entire sample because, as Wang wrote, even “output logs that do not contain reproductions of News Plaintiffs’ works may still be relevant to OpenAI’s fair use defense.”

Although OpenAI argued that Wang should have approved the “least burdensome” path to users’ privacy, the AI company cited no case law to support that argument, Stein wrote, nor its claims that Wang owed them any explanation for rejecting that path.

“Judge Wang’s failure to explain explicitly why she rejected OpenAI’s search term proposal is not clearly erroneous or contrary to law given that she adequately explained her reasons for ordering production of the entirety of the 20 million de-identified log sample,” Stein wrote, affirming Wang’s order.

OpenAI is currently reviewing if there are any avenues left to fight the order, but it basically looks like the end of the road, after the AI firm vowed to do everything in its power to avoid sharing ordinary users’ conversations.

Asked for comment, OpenAI pointed Ars to a blog documenting its fight, last updated in mid-December. That blog confirmed that all data that will be shared has “undergone a de-identification process intended to remove or mask PII and other private information.” News plaintiffs will be able to search the data but will be unable to copy or print any data not directly relevant to the case, OpenAI said.

News groups, spearheaded by The New York Times, believe that output logs will show evidence of infringing chatbot responses, as well as responses that water down news organizations’ trademarks or remove copyright management information (CMI) to obscure the source and facilitate unlicensed outputs of their content.

They appear beyond frustrated by what their court filings described as delay tactics from OpenAI and co-defendant Microsoft, which has agreed to share 8.1 million Copilot logs but won’t say exactly when those logs will be shared.

Late last year, news organizations asked the court to consider whether sanctions on OpenAI may be warranted.

Allegedly, it took 11 months for news groups to learn that “OpenAI was destroying relevant output log data” by failing to suspend deletion practices as soon as litigation started—including a “quite substantial” fraction of ChatGPT Free, Pro, and Plus output log data. This data, which was allegedly deleted at a “disproportionately higher rate,” is most likely where infringing materials would be found, news groups claimed, as users prompting ChatGPT to skirt paywalls would most likely set chats to delete.

OpenAI provided “no explanation for why it was destroying roughly 1/3 of all user conversation data in the month after [The New York Times] filed suit other than the irrelevant non-sequitur that the ‘number of ChatGPT conversations was uncharacteristically low (shortly before New Year’s Day 2024),’” the filing said.

Describing OpenAI’s alleged “playbook” to dodge copyright claims, news groups accused OpenAI of failing to “take any steps to suspend its routine destruction practices.” There were also “two spikes in mass deletion” that OpenAI attributed to “technical issues.”

However, OpenAI made sure to retain outputs that could help its defense, the court filing alleged, including data from accounts cited in news organizations’ complaints.

OpenAI did not take the same care to preserve chats that could be used as evidence against it, news groups alleged, citing testimony from Mike Trinh, OpenAI’s associate general counsel. “In other words, OpenAI preserved evidence of the News Plaintiffs eliciting their own works from OpenAI’s products but deleted evidence of third-party users doing so,” the filing said.

It’s unclear how much data was deleted, plaintiffs alleged, since OpenAI won’t share “the most basic information” on its deletion practices. But it’s allegedly very clear that OpenAI could have done more to preserve the data, since Microsoft apparently had no trouble doing so with Copilot, the filing said.

News plaintiffs are hoping the court will agree that OpenAI and Microsoft aren’t fighting fair by delaying sharing logs, which they said prevents them from building their strongest case.

They’ve asked the court to order Microsoft to “immediately” produce Copilot logs “in a readily searchable remotely-accessible format,” proposing a deadline of January 9 or “within a day of the Court ruling on this motion.”

Microsoft declined Ars’ request for comment.

And as for OpenAI, it wants to know if the deleted logs, including “mass deletions,” can be retrieved, perhaps bringing millions more ChatGPT conversations into the litigation that users likely expected would never see the light of day again.

On top of possible sanctions, news plaintiffs asked the court to keep in place a preservation order blocking OpenAI from permanently deleting users’ temporary and deleted chats. They also want the court to order OpenAI to explain “the full scope of destroyed output log data for all of its products at issue” in the litigation and whether those deleted chats can be restored, so that news plaintiffs can examine them as evidence, too.</div>

            <div id="article-text">“Men do not make laws,” goes a maxim attributed to US president Calvin Coolidge. “They do but discover them.”

If that’s true, then the US attack on Venezuela just uncovered a legislative mother lode. A new law proposed by New York representative Ritchie Torres on Monday would make it illegal for government employees with access to nonpublic information from trading on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.

If that sounds like something that should probably already be illegal, Coolidge might agree, in his own laissez-faire way.

“Laws must be justified by something more than the will of the majority,” he concluded. “They must rest on the eternal foundation of righteousness.”

In any case, the “Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026,” would include new restrictions on elected officials, political appointees, and executive branch staffers, according to Forbes. It would also apply to government employees who have not yet been privy to nonpublic documents, but “may reasonably obtain such material nonpublic information in the course of performing official duties.”

The proposed legislation comes on the heels of compelling evidence that someone with inside information about the recent kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro placed a series of large bets on Polymarket on whether an attack would take place. Just two days before the surprise attack, the account in question invested over $30,000 in a prediction that either Maduro would be “out” or that US troops would set foot “in Venezuela by” January 31st.

The payout was staggering: a profit of $400,000 in less than 24 hours, as sports entrepreneur Joe Pompliano estimated.

“Seems pretty suspicious!” Pompliano wrote. “Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged.”

Beyond the Venezuela attack, prediction markets have raised serious anxiety about geopolitical strife around the world. Recent advances in the sector have made it so that crypto bros can gamble on deadly conflicts in real-time, betting thousands of dollars on questions like “will Russia capture all of Kupiansk by March 31?”

Back in October, Reuters reported that the Trump Media and Technology Group was working with Crypto.com to implement prediction market functionality into Truth Social. That came as dozens of federal investigations into crypto-based price fixing, securities fraud, and regulatory noncompliance have been dropped at the Trump administration’s urging. Two of those cases were against prediction platforms Polymarket —the very same implicated in the Venezuela allegations — and Kalshi, for selling options contracts related to congressional elections.

Whether Torres’ new bill makes it very far remains to be seen. Recent history shows that Congress has little appetite for regulation of insider trading — and for now, there doesn’t yet seem to be a wager on the outcome of the bill on either Polymarket or Kalshi.

            <div id="article-text">Grok, the flagship chatbot created by the Elon Musk-founded AI venture xAI and infused into X-formerly-Twitter — a platform also owned by Elon Musk — continues to be used by trollish misogynists, pedophiles, and other freaks of the digital gutters to non-consensually undress images of women and, even more horrifyingly, underage girls.

The women and girls targeted in these images range from celebrities and public figures to many non-famous private citizens who are often just average web users. As Futurism reported, some of the AI images generated by Grok and automatically published to X were specifically altered to depict real women in violent scenarios, including scenes of sexual abuse, humiliation, physical injury, kidnapping and insinuated murder.

Because Grok is integrated into X, this growing pile of nonconsensual and seemingly illegal images are automatically published directly to the social media platform — and thus are disseminated to the open web, in plain view, visible to pretty much anyone. As it stands, X and xAI have yet to take any meaningful action to stem the tide.

Below is a timeline of how this story has so far unfolded, and which we’ll continue to update as we follow whether X and xAI take action against this flood of harmful content.

A normal company, upon realizing that its platform-embedded AI chatbot was being used at scale to CSAM and unwanted deepfake porn of real people and spew it into the open web, would likely move quickly to disconnect the chatbot from its platform until a problem of such scale and severity could be resolved. But these days, X is not a normal company, and Grok is the same chatbot infamous for scandals including — but not limited to — calling itself “MechaHitler” and spouting antisemitic bile.

The story here isn’t just that Grok was doing this in the first place. It’s also that X, as a platform, appears to be a safe haven for the mass-generation of CSAM and nonconsensual sexual imagery of real women — content that has largely been treated by the losers creating this stuff like it’s all just one big meme. We’ll continue to follow whether X makes meaningful changes — or if it continues to choose inaction.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-06</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a blunder that sums up Tesla’s struggling efforts in the self-driving space, Electrek reports that the Elon Musk-owned automaker has badly screwed up trying to get a trademark for its upcoming “Cybercab.”

The Cybercab, for the uninformed, is Tesla’s purpose-built vehicle for giving driverless rides. Right now, its capital-R Robotaxi service, which operates as a comically tiny fleet exclusively in Austin, Texas, uses existing Tesla Model Ys, not specialized cars (and its trademark is itself under peril due to yet more incompetence, as we’ll explain later.) A prototype of the two-passenger, no-steering wheel Cybercab was unveiled at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event over a year ago, and Musk claims it’ll enter production in Q2 this year.

That promise could still end up being fulfilled, if you’re to ignore Musk’s proclivity for making overblown statements. But in the meantime, the fabled Cybercab is in serious danger of losing its name.

According to a US Patent and Trademark Office suspension notice obtained by Electrek, the trademark “Cybercab” has been formally suspended as of November 14, 2025, for two main reasons: a “likelihood of confusion,” the USPTO’s examining attorney wrote, and because another company called Unibev, a French beverage outfit, beat Tesla to the punch.

This wasn’t down to bad luck. Per the reporting, Musk unveiled the Cybercab at the “We, Robot” event on October 10, 2024, but neglected to file an application until November — an astonishing oversight for a company so large and ambitious. Unibev, meanwhile, saw the opening and filed a “Cybercab” application before the end of the month. Tesla had weeks to secure its trademark, even after making the questionable decision of not filing for it before unveiling the new product at a highly covered event.

Unibev is using a tactic called trademark squatting, and it apparently has a vendetta with Tesla, having three trademarks for “TESLAQUILA” in the US, the same name Tesla tried to use for its own line of tequila, Electrek noted.

As we alluded to earlier, this isn’t the only branding blow Tesla has suffered for its self-driving cab efforts. Last summer, the USPTO turned down Tesla’s application for trademarking the term “Robotaxi” for being too generic. Or in the examiner’s words, “merely descriptive,” since the term robotaxi is “used to describe similar goods and services by other companies.” It may as well have tried to trademark its cars as Cars.

With the Cybercab blunder, Tesla has already tried and failed to change the USPTO’s mind, so it looks like it’ll have to cut a deal with Unibev to drop its claim, or argue in court that it can’t hold the trademark since it has no intent to build cars. An Electrek source familiar with the matter says that Tesla and Unibev are in negotiations, but with no agreement reached yet.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If machines ever fight a war against humans, it’ll probably be fought with modern weapons of war — bullets, bombs, and perhaps plasma weapons a la “The Terminator” — in a conflict, the robots will presumably dominate against us sacks of flesh and blood. Heck, the AI could even just bioengineer a virus to wipe us out.

And even if the battlefield were somehow constrained to kicks and fists, we’re increasingly sure that humankind would catch an epic beatdown as humanoid robots show ever-greater advances in dexterity and martial arts acumen.

A new video shared by Chinese industry titan Unitree, for instance, shows off a new six-foot-tall H2 humanoid robot that’s capable of pulling off some seriously impressive moves. The lanky bot can be seen performing an impressive air kick while coming eerily close to the head of a human engineer standing nearby, destroying watermelons hung up above its head height with a mighty foot, and even sending two heavy punching bags spinning after delivering yet another powerful blow.

Unitree’s $30,000, 180cm (nearly 6 ft tall) H2 humanoid robot. This version is likely powered by an Nvidia Jetson AGX Thor platform, built on Blackwell architecture. pic.twitter.com/E3tTHUjRGw

In other words, if the fate of humanity were to be decided in the dojo via mixed martial arts, we’re not even sure humankind’s entire stable of UFC fighters could save us.

While Unitree’s latest demonstration of its H2 robot, a follow-up to its hugely popular and much shorter G1, is certainly impressive, it raises an interesting question. Why is the firm — and seemingly the vast majority of its competitors — so focused on martial arts? Just last month, Chinese company EngineAI posted a video of its CEO being kicked in the stomach by its perhaps appropriately-named T800 humanoid robote.

Whatever happened to far more useful applications for humanoid robotics, like cleaning the kitchen, doing laundry, or assisting the elderly?

Sure, H2 can spin on its own axis midair and turn a watermelon into pulp in one swift fusillade — but can it pick up a dirty sock off the ground?

Hell, if Unitree and its contemporaries are looking to impress us with their robots’ lethal prowess, why not attach some weapons to their extremities? Why go through the trouble of teaching them how to roundhouse kick?

Plenty of questions remain surrounding the viability of humanoid robots and their future role in society, despite billions of dollars being poured into their development. They may excel at pulling off pre-programmed martial arts moves, but the devil is in the details.

Manipulating objects and adjusting to the constantly changing conditions of the real world are proving far more challenging, further distancing us from a future in which humanoid robots are there to help us in our everyday lives, let alone become affordable enough for the average consumer.

And if they were to turn against us, they’d likely need to pick up a lot more skills than slick punches and kicks to wipe us off the planet for good.

Besides — as perfectly illustrated in a recent viral video that appears to show a man who’s remotely controlling a G1 humanoid robot to essentially kick himself in the nuts with the bot — chances are, humanity will have no problem defeating itself.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While peering into some of the oldest regions of the known universe — dating back to just 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang — an international team of astronomers made a puzzling discovery.

As detailed in a paper published the journal Nature, they discovered an extremely hot galaxy cluster that’s far hotter and older than current theories allow.

In other words, the discovered cluster is, under our current best understanding of cosmology, impossible — which could upend our current understanding of how the early universe evolved.

“We didn’t expect to see such a hot cluster atmosphere so early in cosmic history,” said lead author and University of British Columbia PhD candidate Dazhi Zhou in a statement about the finding.

“In fact, at first I was skeptical about the signal as it was too strong to be real,” he added. “But after months of verification, we’ve confirmed this gas is at least five times hotter than predicted, and even hotter and more energetic than what we find in many present-day clusters.”

The astronomers’ best theory is that the cluster somehow got a massive head start — previously unimaginable even to top thinkers — thanks to black holes lurking at its core.

“This tells us that something in the early universe, likely three recently discovered supermassive black holes in the cluster, were already pumping huge amounts of energy into the surroundings and shaping the young cluster,” added coauthor and Dalhousie University professor Scott Chapman, “much earlier and more strongly than we thought.”

Conventional theories suggest that galaxy clusters gain energy as the gases inside are pulled together and squeezed due to intensifying gravitational forces. The latest research, however, suggests there’s more to how these clusters evolve — perhaps even a separate source beyond these gravitational forces.

The team found the strange readings when they analyzed observations by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Atacama desert in Chile that examined a “baby” galaxy cluster called SPT2349-56.

The cluster, which dates back to around 12 billion years, is huge: its core alone measures around half a million light-years across. That’s roughly the size of the halo that circles our own Milky Way galaxy, a vast region that contains globular clusters and older stars — yet it spawns stars more than 5,000 times faster.

The astronomers are hoping to figure out what allowed it to get so incredibly hot, a source of energy that defies our current models. The research suggests galaxy clusters evolve in a far more explosive manner than previously thought, aided by gravitational interactions between multiple supermassive black holes.

“We want to figure out how the intense star formation, the active black holes and this overheated atmosphere interact, and what it tells us about how present galaxy clusters were built,” Zhou explained in the statement. “How can all of this be happening at once in such a young, compact system?”

“Understanding galaxy clusters is the key to understanding the biggest galaxies in the universe,” Chapman said. “These massive galaxies mostly reside in clusters, and their evolution is heavily shaped by the very strong environment of the clusters as they form, including the intracluster medium.”

            <div id="article-text">AI’s use in the legal sphere is the gift that keeps on giving.

This time, it’s the sobering sense of disappointment that set in after a team building an AI chatbot for Alaska’s court system actually tested it and found out it was a hallucinating disaster, NBC News reports.

The chatbot, dubbed the Alaska Virtual Assistant, was designed to help people handle forms and other procedures involved in probate, the legal process of transferring a person’s belongings after their death.

In a predictable turn of events, instead of streamlining an already headache-inducing process inflicted on people who are probably mourning the loss of a loved one, the AI bungled simple questions and left most users feeling annoyed rather than supported.

Exhibiting a failing inherent to all large language models, the esteemed virtual assistant kept hallucinating, or making up facts and sharing exaggerated information, according to the people involved in its development.

“We had trouble with hallucinations, regardless of the model, where the chatbot was not supposed to actually use anything outside of its knowledge base,” Aubrie Souza, a consultant with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC), told NBC News. “For example, when we asked it, ‘Where do I get legal help?’ it would tell you, ‘There’s a law school in Alaska, and so look at the alumni network.’ But there is no law school in Alaska.”

And rather than finding it helpful, most people who tested it found it incredibly grating. The bot, unsurprisingly, suffered from the same character flaw plaguing most chatbots: being too sycophantic and cloying, feigning empathy and plying you with pleasantries instead of just getting down to business.

“Through our user testing, everyone said, ‘I’m tired of everybody in my life telling me that they’re sorry for my loss,” Souza said. “So we basically removed those kinds of condolences, because from an AI chatbot, you don’t need one more.”

Built in collaboration with Tom Martin, a lawyer who runs an a company called LawDroid that makes AI legal tools, the AVA AI has been trapped in development hell for over a year now, when it was “supposed to be a three-month project,” according to Souza. After lowering their expectations — and assuredly ironing out its horrendous flaws — AVA’s team says it’s finally ready for a public launch in late January.

“We did shift our goals on this project a little bit,” Stacey Marz, administrative director of the Alaska Court System and an AVA project leader, told NBC News. “We wanted to replicate what our human facilitators at the self-help center are able to share with people. But we’re not confident that the bots can work in that fashion, because of the issues with some inaccuracies and some incompleteness.”

“It was just so very labor-intensive to do this,” Marz added, despite “all the buzz about generative AI, and everybody saying this is going to revolutionize self-help and democratize access to the courts.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If there is one point of consensus among the CES 2026 keynote speakers, it is that AI is reshaping technology with a speed and scale unlike any previous technological revolution.

In a live taping on Tuesday of the All-In podcast, co-host Jason Calacanis interviewed Bob Sternfels, Global Managing Partner of McKinsey & Company, and Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. Their discussion focused on how AI is transforming investment strategies and the workforce.

“The world has completely changed,” Taneja said about the unprecedented growth of AI companies. He noted that while it took Stripe about 12 years to reach a $100 billion valuation, Anthropic, another General Catalyst portfolio company, soared from a $60 billion valuation last year to a “couple hundred billion dollars” this year.

Taneja believes we are on the verge of seeing a new wave of trillion-dollar companies. “That’s not a pie-in-the-sky idea with Anthropic, OpenAI, and a couple of others,” he said.

Calacanis pressed them on what’s driving this explosive growth. According to McKinsey’s Sternfels, while many companies are testing AI products, non-tech enterprises remain on the fence about full adoption. Sternfels says the question that McKinsey consultants often hear from CEOs is: “Do I listen to my CFO or my CIO right now?”

CFOs, seeing little return on investment, argue for delaying implementation. Meanwhile, CIOs claim it’s “crazy” not to adopt AI because “we’ll be disrupted,” Sternfels said.

Another key concern is how AI is reshaping the labor force. “Some people are looking at AI and they’re scared,” Calacanis said, noting concerns that AI could replace entry-level jobs traditionally filled by recent graduates. He asked Sternfels and Taneja for advice on what young people should do in this new landscape.

Sternfels said that while AI models can handle many tasks, sound judgment and creativity remain the essential skills humans must bring to succeed in an AI-infused world.

Meanwhile, Taneja argued that people must recognize that “skilling and re-skilling” will be a lifelong endeavor. “This idea that we spend 22 years learning and then 40 years working is broken,” he said.

Calacanis agreed that in a world where it may take less time to build an AI agent than to train a new worker, people must find ways to stay relevant. “To stand out, you’re going to have to show chutzpah, drive, passion,” he said.

Sternfels provided a glimpse into that future. While he expects McKinsey to have as many “personalized” AI agents as employees by the end of 2026, he noted that headcount will not necessarily decrease. Instead, the firm is shifting its composition; it’s increasing employees who work directly with clients by 25% while reducing back-office roles by the same percentage.

            <h2>Meta’s Manus news is getting different receptions in Washington and Beijing</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/metas-manus-news-is-getting-different-receptions-in-washington-and-beijing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta’s $2 billion acquisition of AI assistant platform Manus is unsurprisingly caught in a regulatory tug-of-war — but not because of U.S. regulators. They appear assured that the deal is legitimate despite earlier misgivings about Benchmark’s investment in Manus. China’s regulators, however, are reportedly not quite as sanguine, according to the Financial Times.

When Benchmark led a financing round for Manus earlier this year, the investment sparked immediate controversy. U.S. Senator John Cornyn complained about the deal on X, and the investment prompted inquiries from the U.S. Treasury Department around new rules restricting American investment in Chinese AI companies.

The concerns were significant enough to spur Manus’s eventual relocation from Beijing to Singapore — part of what drove the company’s “step-by-step disentanglement from China,” as one Chinese professor described it on WeChat this past weekend.

Now the tables have turned. Chinese officials are reportedly reviewing whether the Meta deal violates technology export controls, potentially giving Beijing leverage it wasn’t initially perceived as having. Specifically, they’re examining whether Manus needed an export license when it relocated its core team from China to Singapore — a move that’s apparently now so common it has earned the nickname “Singapore washing.” A recent Wall Street Journal article speculated that China has “few tools to influence the deal given Manus’s foothold in Singapore,” but that assessment may have been premature.

The concern in Beijing is that this deal could encourage more Chinese startups to physically relocate to dodge domestic oversight. Winston Ma, a professor at New York University School of Law and partner at Dragon Capital, told the Journal that if the deal closes smoothly, “It creates a new path for the young AI startups in China.”

History suggests Beijing could act. China previously used similar export control mechanisms to intervene in Trump’s attempted TikTok ban during his first term. The Chinese professor on WeChat even warned that Manus’ founders could face criminal liability if they exported restricted technology without authorization.

Meanwhile, some U.S. analysts are calling the acquisition a win for Washington’s investment restrictions, arguing it shows Chinese AI talent is defecting to the American ecosystem. One expert told the FT that the deal demonstrates “the US AI ecosystem is currently more attractive.”

It’s too early to know if this impacts Meta’s plans to integrate Manus’s AI agent software into its products, but this $2 billion deal may have gotten more complicated than anyone anticipated.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 is in full swing in Las Vegas, with the show floor open to the public after a packed couple of days occupied by press conferences from the likes of Nvidia, Sony, and AMD and previews from Sunday’s Unveiled event.

As has been the case for the past two years at CES, AI is at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. We’ll be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still catch the spur-of-the-moment reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground via our live blog right here.

Let’s dive right in, starting with some of Monday’s biggest players.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our Senior AI Editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open-source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners including OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Lei, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, Senior Reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of Atlas that was shown on stage. Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via its browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer Editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, Consumer Reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions and a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with the debut sets both having a Star Wars theme. Senior Writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week in Las Vegas, tech companies at CES 2026 are unveiling the latest wearable health devices — glucose monitors, blood pressure trackers, fitness trackers. Probably not mentioned at the show is that these gadgets might be creating a massive environmental problem.

It isn’t something that tends to get much attention, but a new study from Cornell University and the University of Chicago found that by 2050, demand for health wearables could hit 2 billion units per year, or 42 times more than today. Unless we change how they’re made, these devices could generate over a million tons of electronic waste and 100 million tons of carbon dioxide over that same period, the authors warn.

An even bigger surprise is that it’s not the plastic that’s the problem. The study, published in Nature, found that the printed circuit board — the device’s “brain” — accounts for 70% of its carbon footprint, largely due to intensive mining and manufacturing.

The researchers suggest two fixes: develop chips using common metals like copper instead of rare minerals like gold, and make devices modular so the circuit board can be reused while the outer covering gets replaced.

Wrote one of the study’s co-authors, “When these devices are deployed at global scale, small design choices add up quickly.” It’s something to think about while scrolling through CES announcements.

            <h2>A viral Reddit post alleging fraud from a food delivery app turned out to be AI-generated</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/a-viral-reddit-post-alleging-fraud-from-a-food-delivery-app-turned-out-to-be-ai-generated/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Reddit user claiming to be a whistleblower from a food delivery app has been outed as a fake. The user wrote a viral post alleging that the company he worked for was exploiting its drivers and users.

“You guys always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality is actually so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories,” the supposed whistleblower wrote.

He claimed to be drunk and at the library to use its public Wi-Fi, where he was typing this long screed about how the company was exploiting legal loopholes to steal drivers’ tips and wages with impunity.

Those claims were, unfortunately, believable — DoorDash actually was sued for stealing tips from drivers, resulting in a $16.75 million settlement. But in this case, the poster had made up his story.

People lie on the internet all the time. But it’s not so common for such posts to hit the front page of Reddit, garner over 87,000 upvotes, and get crossposted to other platforms like X, where it got another 208,000 likes and 36.8 million impressions.

Casey Newton, the journalist behind Platformer, wrote that he contacted the Reddit poster, who then contacted him on Signal. The Redditor shared what looked like a photo of his UberEats employee badge, as well as an 18-page “internal document” outlining the company’s use of AI to determine the “desperation score” of individual drivers. But as Newton tried to verify that the whistleblower’s account was legitimate, he realized that he was being baited into an AI hoax.

“For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together,” Newton wrote. “Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?”

There have always been bad actors seeking to deceive reporters, but the prevalence of AI tools has made fact-checking require even more rigor.

Generative AI models often fail to detect if an image or video is synthetic, making it challenging to determine if content is real. In this case, Newton was able to use Google’s Gemini to confirm that the image was made with the AI tool, thanks to Google’s SynthID watermark, which can withstand cropping, compression, filtering, and other attempts to alter an image.

Max Spero — founder of Pangram Labs, a company that makes a detection tool for AI-generated text — works directly with the problem of distinguishing real and fake content.

“AI slop on the internet has gotten a lot worse, and I think part of this is due to the increased use of LLMs, but other factors as well,” Spero told TechCrunch. “There’s companies with millions in revenue that can pay for ‘organic engagement’ on Reddit, which is actually just that they’re going to try to go viral on Reddit with AI-generated posts that mention your brand name.”

Tools like Pangram can help determine if text is AI-generated, but especially when it comes to multimedia content, these tools aren’t always reliable — and even if a synthetic post is proven to be fake, it might have already gone viral before being debunked. So for now, we’re left scrolling social media like detectives, second-guessing if anything we see is real.

Case in point: When I told an editor that I wanted to write about the “viral AI food delivery hoax that was on Reddit this weekend,” she thought I was talking about something else. Yes — there was more than one “viral AI food delivery hoax on Reddit this weekend.”

            <h2>Mobileye acquires humanoid robot startup Mentee Robotics for $900M</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/mobileye-acquires-humanoid-robot-startup-mentee-robotics-for-900m/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mobileye made its name, and money, by supplying automakers with millions of computer vision chips designed to support automotive safety features and advanced driver assistance systems. The Intel subsidiary and publicly traded company later expanded to tackle autonomous driving through its chips and software.

Now, co-founder and president Amnon Shashua is taking the company into what he calls Mobileye 3.0. And that means robotics and a hefty acquisition.

The Israeli company announced Tuesday during CES in Las Vegas it has reached a deal to acquire Mentee Robotics — a startup co-founded by Shashua in 2022 — for $900 million. Under the agreement, Mobileye will buy Mentee Robotics for about $612 million in cash and up to 26.2 million shares of common stock. Shashua, who is the chairman, co-founder, and a significant shareholder of Mentee, recused himself from the Mobileye board’s consideration and approval, according to the company.

The transaction, which was approved by the Mobileye board and Intel, its largest shareholder, is expected to close in the first quarter. The transaction is expected to modestly increase Mobileye’s operating expenses in 2026 by a low-single-digit percentage.

“Today marks a new chapter for robotics and automotive AI, and the beginning of Mobileye 3.0,” Shashua said Tuesday. “By combining Mentee’s breakthroughs in humanoid robotics with Mobileye’s expertise in automotive autonomy, and its proven ability to productize advanced AI, we have a unique opportunity to lead the evolution of physical AI across robotics and autonomous vehicles on a global scale.”

Mentee Robotics, which is developing humanoid robots, will continue as an independent unit within Mobileye. Of course, with Shashua as brains and shareholder between the two companies, there will surely be plenty of overlap.

The benefits for Mobileye aren’t entirely obvious except that every one seems to be jumping into the humanoid robot game these days. Officially, Mobileye said the acquisition “broadens the scope of the business with a decisive step toward Physical Artificial Intelligence in general.” Specifically, systems that are designed to understand context and intent as well as act natural with humans and the physical world.

In other words, Mobileye, and Shashua, seem to want to move beyond the technology used to allow vehicles to navigate the world and apply it to humanoid robots as well. The company suggests in its announcement it has the funds to get it there, noting that its current automotive revenue pipeline — driven by its advanced vehicle autonomy and core advanced driver assistance tech — is $24.5 billion over the next eight years. The company said that pipeline figure is up more than 40% compared to January 2023.

Of course, the development of humanoid robots that can eventually go into production will be a costly enterprise. Mentee stands to gain considerably as it can tap into Mobileye’s resources, which include advanced AI training infrastructure — aka compute.

The acquisition news comes a day after Mobileye announced another customer win for its next-generation chip built for hands-off advanced driver assistance systems. The company announced Monday that a “top 10 automaker” struck a deal to buy 9 million of its EyeQ6H-based Surround ADAS systems. Volkswagen Group announced in March it would also use the chip. Mobileye now estimates future delivery of more than 19 million EyeQ6H-based Surround systems.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/kennedy-childhood-vaccine-schedule/685527/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly a year ago, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pledged during his confirmation hearing to support the CDC’s childhood-vaccine schedule. Yesterday, he broke that promise. The Department of Health and Human Services has announced that the CDC will drop several vaccines from its recommendation list. With that move, Kennedy has shown that he can change the vaccine schedule by fiat.

Kennedy appears to have a clear road if he wants to do more. The acting CDC director, Jim O’Neill, who signed off on the plan, took over the position when the previous director was fired after defying Kennedy. The new recommendations were written by two Kennedy allies at HHS; the agency’s vaccine advisory board, which Kennedy remade in his own image last year, appears to have been cut out of the process entirely. Following this map, Kennedy could dispense with any recommendation he dislikes, issue whatever advice strikes him and those he’s hired as wise, and thereby remake public-health policy in the United States in accordance with the anti-vaccine arguments he’s been advancing for 20 years.

The move didn’t come as a surprise. Kennedy spent much of 2025 undermining confidence in vaccines and sidelining public-health officials who disagreed with him. The overhaul of the pediatric schedule followed a request last month by President Donald Trump to bring the United States in line with a set of other developed countries and had been hinted at for weeks, as well. The vaccines no longer universally recommended for children include those for hepatitis A, rotavirus, and the flu. Although these diseases can be serious—the CDC estimates that, before the vaccine, rotavirus killed dozens of children each year and sent hundreds of thousands to the hospital—they don’t represent the same level of threat as polio or the measles, each of which killed thousands of children in the 1950s and each of which, at least for now, remain on the vaccine schedule. An HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, told me that the new list “maintains strong protection against diseases that cause serious harm or provide clear community benefit, while aligning U.S. guidance with international norms.” Whatever the pros and cons of any particular vaccine, this move is still the strongest evidence yet that the health secretary intends to unilaterally impose his will on an agency he has repeatedly assailed as corrupt.

Read: Rotavirus could come roaring back—very soon

Public-health experts are generally aghast at the new policy. Although Mehmet Oz, the chief of Medicare and Medicaid, said yesterday that insurers will still cover the vaccines that are no longer recommended, the onus will now be on doctors and professional associations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics to make the case for the demoted immunizations to parents. Daniel Jernigan, the former director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told me that revoking the recommendations for some immunizations “sends a message that those vaccines are of uncertain value.” That could prove dangerous: Vaccination rates have already fallen in many states in recent years, and Jernigan fears that the schedule change might lead parents to forgo certain shots, or perhaps not immunize their children at all.

Nixon said that the new schedule “returns decision-making to families,” and Kennedy has said that it is intended to rebuild trust in public health. (In a survey last fall, just over half of Americans said they considered the vaccine schedule safe.) But it seems guaranteed to contribute to greater confusion. In the short term, if the schedule change leads to fewer vaccinations, children in America will suffer through more diarrhea from rotavirus, nausea from hepatitis A, and fevers from the flu. In the long term, it could lead to an increased burden on American hospitals.

The schedule overhaul was hailed as a “victory for American children” by the Informed Consent Action Network, which has paid millions of dollars to attorneys challenging vaccine mandates. Del Bigtree, who was the communications director for Kennedy’s presidential campaign and is the CEO of ICAN, told me that the change is “setting our children on the same path to health that Denmark enjoys,” because the new recommendations mostly mirror that country’s. (The comparison is fraught: Denmark is far smaller and less diverse than the United States, and it has universal health care.)

Yet Bigtree and other Kennedy allies see the announcement as merely a first step toward eliminating all of the government’s vaccine recommendations. Aaron Siri, a lawyer who has sued states over vaccine mandates and has been a close adviser to Kennedy, told me that he is especially keen on removing the polio vaccine from the recommended list, along with DTaP, which protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough. Bigtree wants an end to vaccine mandates, which he sees as a violation of the Nuremberg Code, he said. (The CDC’s recommendations are not mandates but are frequently used to justify states’ school-admission requirements.) Mark Gorton—who is best known as the creator of the file-sharing service LimeWire and has since become an anti-vaccine activist and a co-president of the MAHA Institute, a pro-Kennedy think tank—told me he would like to go much further. He favors pulling all vaccines from the market until they’ve undergone additional testing. (Decades of evidence have shown that the vaccines on the U.S. pediatric schedule are safe.) “Politically, we’re not there yet,” he told me. But if Gorton has anything to do with it, that’s where the U.S. is heading. (Nixon declined to comment on whether Kennedy and HHS are actively considering any of these moves.)

If more American parents opt out of the inoculations that the federal government no longer recommends, harm will inevitably come to pass. The high fevers, hospitalizations, and dehydration that these illnesses cause can be painful and disruptive—and, with vaccines, avoidable. This year’s brutal flu season is a reminder of just how devastating even routine infections can be. But the illnesses that the U.S. is now officially less concerned about preventing are not usually deadly or permanently debilitating. The World Health Organization does not recommend universal vaccination against any of them, with the exception of Hepatitis B. (As of last month, the U.S. recommends that vaccine only to children who are born to a mother who is positive for the virus or whose status is unknown.)

The same cannot be said of the immunizations the CDC still does recommend. If they were to be taken off the market or if more parents were to opt out of them, Americans could see diseases that most of us have never encountered—such as polio and diphtheria—return with a vengeance. The nation is getting a taste of that already with the resurgence of measles, which killed three people last year, and whooping cough, which claimed the lives of more than a dozen. Without the protection that widespread vaccination provides, the United States could become a nation that’s not only far sicker but also much less safe for children.</div>

            <h2>The Polymarket Bets on Maduro Are a Warning</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>

When U.S. Delta Force commandos slipped into Venezuelan airspace over the weekend, they did so in secrecy. And yet, in the hours before President Donald Trump gave the final order for the strike, someone bet more than $20,000 that Nicolás Maduro would be ousted as the country’s leader by the end of January.

On Polymarket, the online platform that lets people wager on almost anything, an anonymous trader somewhere in the world placed a series of suspiciously well-timed bets. Using a fresh account created last month, the individual made just a few bets in the days leading up to the raid, according to The Wall Street Journal—all on the possibility of imminent regime change in Venezuela—and appeared to come away with more than $400,000.

Listen: Prediction markets and the ‘suckerifcation’ crisis, with Max Read

Perhaps the bettor just got phenomenally lucky. Or perhaps they knew about the raid ahead of time and leveraged it for a quick payout. We can’t know, because Polymarket, a so-called prediction market where people turn their idle hunches into real cash, allows some of its customers to remain anonymous. Traders place their bets using crypto, which could provide another layer of cover. The Maduro trade has generated a huge amount of speculation and controversy; the internet is now full of jokes that Barron Trump, hunched behind dual monitors in his NYU dorm room, may have been behind it.

This is not the first instance of a well-timed bet on Polymarket raising questions about insider trading. Just before María Corina Machado, a leader of Venezuela’s opposition to Maduro, was declared the winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, the probability that she would win the award began to spike on Polymarket (despite a highly secretive selection process). The Nobel Institute has said that it may have been a victim of espionage. Early last month, a trader made a series of bets related to Google’s most popular searches of 2025. Just before the company released its “Year in Search” report, the user bet on some of those top searches with uncanny accuracy. In the end, the account netted more than $1 million.

Traditional financial markets have clear-cut rules around insider trading: Capitalizing on nonpublic information is plainly illegal. Polymarket seems to have no such policies in its terms of use (although it does ban activity that violates “applicable laws”). The company’s CEO, Shayne Coplan, has also explicitly said that Polymarket creates a “financial incentive for people to go and divulge” new information. The thinking is that, if the function of these tools is to predict the future, then rewarding people for leaking information could be seen as a positive. When insiders push markets toward what’s actually going to happen, they can hypothetically turn prediction markets into a source of real-time unfiltered news. There are legal ways to find and divulge new information—say, in scraping publicly available data for an edge over other traders—but Coplan did not draw that distinction. (Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment.)

Not all prediction markets share this ethos. Kalshi, Polymarket’s biggest competitor, “explicitly prohibits insider trading of any form,” a spokesperson told me over email. But the concept of treating insider trading as a feature rather than a bug seems to be gaining traction. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase—a cryptocurrency exchange that recently purchased a prediction-market firm—laid out this line of thinking at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit last month: “If your goal is actually for the 99 percent of people trying to get signal about what’s going to happen in the world—like, ‘Is the Suez Canal going to be reopened?’ or whatever—you actually want insider trading.”

Outsourcing privileged information to prediction markets in the name of “news” has some clear problems. Maduro’s ouster is a helpful example: Both the Times and The Washington Post reportedly learned of the plans for Saturday’s raid before it happened, and held off on publishing their stories to avoid endangering U.S. troops. No such editorial-judgment calls are being made across betting markets. The democratization of certain kinds of information can be a social good—but not like this.

As it becomes easier for people to bet on everyday phenomena, more opportunities will open up for insiders to leverage private information for fast cash. Hypothetically, the Deloitte employees who tabulate Grammy votes can bet on who might win Song of the Year, and the White House aide with a sense of the president’s mood can bet on whether he’ll publicly use the word fuck before the end of the month. It’s no secret that these markets can be gamed. Armstrong closed Coinbase’s most recent earnings call with a string of non sequiturs (“Bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain, staking, and Web3”) in a nod to the traders betting on whether those specific words would crop up during the call.

Polymarket has become enormously popular, even though its main platform isn’t meant to be accessed from within the United States. In 2022, the company shut down its domestic service as part of a settlement with the Biden administration over alleged regulatory violations. Still, American bettors have found an easy work-around in the digital trickery of VPNs, or virtual private networks. Polymarket is now gearing up for a U.S. comeback, with the support of the new White House. The company tapped a former Trump campaign manager to lobby on its behalf last year, and Donald Trump Jr. now serves as an adviser to both Polymarket and Kalshi. The Trump family’s media company is working on a prediction market too: Truth Predict.

Insider trading is frowned upon because it further slants an already uneven playing field, further enriching those in proximity to the biggest and most consequential decisions of the day and leaving the public at a disadvantage. This, at least, has been the prevailing view for much of the modern history of American commerce. Traditional financial markets aren’t always fair, but they at least purport to operate from a shared perspective. Among the central innovations of prediction markets is the idea that an unequal playing field might actually facilitate the truth. It’s a convenient line. But it obscures the fact that these are still very much also just markets. When insiders win, the rest of us lose.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This weekend’s attack on Venezuela produced plenty of indelible images. The one burned into my brain was shared by President Donald Trump on Truth Social. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is sitting in front of a laptop at a makeshift command center in Mar-a-Lago. He’s monitoring the raid with a grave expression on his face, eyes intently focused on something out of frame.

At first glance, the image has all the trappings of a Serious Tactical Raid Photo, à la Pete Souza’s famous Situation Room snapshot, which showed President Barack Obama and his national-security team tracking the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound. But then you see what’s behind Hegseth: a large screen displaying an X feed. The photo is blurry, but it seems to show Hegseth and company using X’s search function to monitor tweets about the raid. On the screen, hovering over Hegseth’s left shoulder, is a giant face-holding-back-tears emoji (🥹).

The photo quickly spread around the internet on Saturday—mostly as a way to mock just how terminally online the Trump administration appears to be. “They monitor the situation just like how we do,” one person who works in crypto wrote on X. On Bluesky, I watched others make fun of Hegseth, Trump, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as part of a “podcaster-occupied government.”

It is no secret that the Trump administration is social media–addled. Over the past year, most of the government’s major online accounts—especially on X—have become megaphones for cruel and racist shitposting, not unlike what one might see from a garden-variety troll on 4chan. These accounts have shared deportation ASMR; an AI-generated, Studio Ghiblified version of a real photo of a crying woman being arrested by ICE; a post comparing immigrants to the alien vermin in the Halo video-game series; and Nazi-coded “Defend the fatherland” memes. And who could forget the AI-slop video of Trump in a fighter jet dropping what appeared to be human feces on protesters in Times Square. These official government communications are a key part of how the Trump administration does its job. It is governance through content creation.

This is why the Trump administration is staffed with former reality-show stars, cable-news hosts, and popular podcasters. It is why the government allows friendly camera crews to accompany ICE raids, why former Congressman Matt Gaetz is given a Pentagon press credential along with Laura Loomer, and why Vice President J. D. Vance spends his days trolling people on X. It’s why Kristi Noem staged a photo op in front of a cage full of men at El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, and why the administration has allowed YouTubers to make videos there. It’s why an assistant attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice is on X, grousing about her follower count stalling at a paltry 1.3 million and asking, “What kind of content do my folks want to see more of to like and share?” And it’s the reason that Katie Miller—who left the Trump administration to work for Elon Musk and then left Musk to start a podcast—posted a photo on X on Saturday showing a map of Greenland colored as an American flag with the caption “SOON.” The U.S. government is concerned first and foremost with spectacle, engaging in both fan service for its most extreme supporters and the constant trolling of its enemies. The goal, above all else, is to elicit a response.

The Hegseth photo from Saturday and others like it confirm this dynamic. Why would the men in charge of the most powerful military and intelligence services in the world be monitoring a popular X account called “OSINTdefender” if they weren’t performing for an online audience? (The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.) Perhaps one could defend their scrolling as potentially useful data gathering on the grounds that, during the bin Laden raid, early tweets from local citizens began to break the news well before the mainstream media caught on. But such posts are low-level intelligence, a kind that is arguably far too trivial for a Cabinet secretary or president to pay attention to. The simplest explanation is that everyone in that room at Mar-a-Lago wanted to observe the spectacle created by their actions.

“I watched it literally like I was watching a television show,” Trump said in a phone interview Saturday with Fox News. “It was an amazing thing.” His description suggests military invasion as personal entertainment—a reality show with stark geopolitical consequences that the president can produce and direct via his whims.

Trump is obsessed with ratings, and social media provides ample opportunities to watch numbers go up at the same time as other politicians, media members, and onlookers respond. And so you get not only an invasion and a press conference but a slew of posts. In the first day after Nicolás Maduro was seized, Trump or official government accounts had shared:

The more I watched the fallout from the invasion play out online, the more futile any effort to make sense of it felt. I felt like I was trapped in a recursive loop of a very specific style of internet content: the reaction video.

Reaction videos began on YouTube in the mid-2000s, and they are now a hallmark of online content. As the name suggests, they show people responding to other media. In the early days, these were typically gross-out videos like the infamous “2 Girls, 1 Cup,” and as The New York Times’ Sam Anderson wrote back in 2011, their appeal was allowing “people to watch this taboo thing by proxy, to experience its dangerous thrill without having to encounter it directly.”

Over time, reaction videos became far more interesting and varied—a way to experience something vicariously for the first time or to share the joy of something you love with others. As Anderson noted, the videos are best at capturing surprise: “that moment when the world breaks, when it violates or exceeds its basic duties and forces someone to undergo some kind of dramatic shift.”

Today, the world feels like it’s breaking in any number of ways—so perhaps it makes sense that the logic and structure of the reaction video pervades media, culture, and politics. Some of this feeling has to do with the structure of social media, where timelines are no longer sorted chronologically but algorithmically, feeding users a steady stream of content that’s likely to elicit a strong reaction. The algorithmic internet has always been chaotic, but as the platforms have matured and evolved, the culture they produce and behaviors they provoke have become insular and inscrutable—at least to people who don’t spend huge chunks of time online. Especially on X, algorithmic culture is characterized by ceaseless iteration: Everything that’s happening is piled atop all the things that just happened.

When any given event occurs—a raid in Venezuela, say—the trolls, pundits, know-it-alls, and shitposters flood in immediately. Discourse is a gameable phenomenon now; people know how to play their roles by heart. These days, one doesn’t experience the news on these platforms before seeing the memes and reactions—the reaction and the news are, in essence, one thing now.

By the time I saw the news of the raid, a photo Trump had posted showing a blindfolded Maduro in a Nike sweatsuit had already become a meme. Just a few minutes later, that meme had mixed with a dozen others. In a few hours, I stumbled upon a split-screen generative-AI slop video of Maduro DJing in the sweatsuit in one frame while, in the other, Trump’s face was superimposed onto a clip of Jon Hamm blissed out and dancing in a club. An image of Maduro in handcuffs wearing a blue sweatshirt and giving a thumbs-up was followed immediately by a marketing meme posted by that sweatshirt’s manufacturer; scroll more and there’s the same photo, now with Maduro’s face replaced by Charlie Kirk’s.

The result is essentially insane and postliterate. But it is also pretty much legible for those steeped in online culture. It is coherent incoherence, everything reacting to everything else, all at once. The same thing happened after Kirk was shot. The memes, commentary, and speculation became a culture unto itself, a loop of ironic posting, information warring, and commentary on commentary—all before his shooter was identified or Kirk was even pronounced dead. This process is nihilistic, and it has a dehumanizing effect. Stories about people or countries in conflict become abstract, buried under a pile of memes and recursive references that exist for little more than scroll-by entertainment. Over the past decade, online performance for others has evolved out of popular culture and media and become a primary means of communication for everyone—mass shooters, meme makers, and POTUS all included.

Trump has been rightfully called the Twitter president in the past, and a crucial part of that legacy is the skilled exploitation of this information environment. His administration’s chief output is online shitposting. It’s not an actual form of governance, nor is it a kind of policy, but it is performative speech that’s supposed to signify action and, in the case of the Venezuela raid, strength. The resources of the most powerful military in the world are being marshaled in service of making memes declaring, “THIS IS OUR HEMISPHERE.” All because the country’s leaders think it’s good theater, and in a postliterate political era, the spectacle is propulsive. It gives so many of the entities of our media, political, and cultural ecosystems what they crave: something to react to.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nicolás Maduro wasn’t due to arrive at his arraignment yesterday in downtown Manhattan until noon, but a large crowd had already formed outside the federal courthouse by 9 a.m. Actually, two crowds. One had come to tell Donald Trump to keep his hands off Venezuela. The other, which seemed largely Venezuelan, had come to celebrate.

Maduro was, until Saturday, a widely hated ruler. His last election campaign consisted of threatening his people with a “bloodbath” if he lost. (Even so, he lost, but he claimed victory anyway.) The two crowds outside the courthouse mirrored the split reaction following Maduro’s capture by the United States. For many international observers, his ouster was cause for alarm—a sign that a U.S. president can drop bombs abroad and overthrow a foreign leader without a declaration of war or congressional approval. But for so many Venezuelans, the sight of Maduro in shackles was about a tyrant facing justice.

Before the hearing began, the hallway outside the courtroom was packed with people hoping to get a seat. Some were law students who had come because they sensed that a legal precedent was being set, though not necessarily a good one. The way Maduro was captured “puts the system of international law in danger,” Leo Enderle, a German student at NYU, told me. Another group of people had come for the sheer spectacle. The man standing in front of me said he had attended the arraignments of Sean Combs and Donald Trump in the same building; according to him, this crowd was just as big. When I arrived, he was outraged that a Venezuelan man had cut in line to join a friend. The Venezuelan explained that he had been a political prisoner for years and had dreamed of this moment. Just because you were a political prisoner, the man in front of me was lamenting, doesn’t mean you get to cut the line.

But by far the largest group of attendees I spoke with were Venezuelans who wanted to see Maduro punished. The last time I had stood in line with so many Venezuelans angry at Maduro was in 2013, when I still lived in the country, in one of the infamous breadlines that resulted from rationing. Then, like now, people were very talkative. At the courthouse, an elegantly dressed woman from Caracas told me she had left her newborn granddaughter at home with a nanny. “This historical moment, I couldn’t miss it!”

David Cardenas, a Venezuelan opposition activist, told me that Maduro had singled him out on TV one day, threatening to send police to his house and jail him as part of “Operation Knock-Knock.” Soon after, Cardenas, who lives in the United States, posted a video saying Maduro would be the target of Operation Trump-Trump. “I guess Trump-Trump came before Knock-Knock,” Cardenas told me with a smile.

Elsewhere in line, a young woman I’ll call Maria had come to the courthouse with her mother, who was visiting from Venezuela for the holidays. (She asked me to withhold her name for privacy concerns.) Maria told me that nobody she knew in America could understand why she was excited to see Maduro arrested: “My friends are like, ‘This is imperialism!’ and ‘So sorry Trump did this to your country!’” When one of her housemates told her they were thinking of going to protest Maduro’s capture, Maria responded that not every prisoner deserves sympathy.

After we were seated in the courtroom, Maduro walked in, escorted by guards. Instead of his usual button-down, he wore a navy-blue T-shirt, with an orange one peeking out from underneath. Maduro scanned the audience as though he were looking for a friendly face, but he didn’t seem to find one. “Buenos días,” he said to no one in particular, and sat down.

“Are you Nicolás Maduro Moros?” the judge asked.

Maduro responded in Spanish, as he would throughout the hearing. “I am Nicolás Maduro Moros, the constitutional president of Venezuela,” he said, and went on to explain that he’d been kidnapped by the United States. He called himself a “prisoner of war.” Visibly impatient, the judge suggested that Maduro should respond with a simple yes or no. “Are you Nicolás Maduro Moros?” the judge asked again. “I am Nicolás Maduro Moros,” he responded.

The judge then read the charges aloud: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine-importation conspiracy, and two others related to weapons. Maduro pleaded not guilty, adding, “I’m a decent man and still the president of Venezuela.” Once again, the judge told Maduro to keep his answers succinct, before addressing Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, who was sitting nearby wearing the same outfit.

The judge told Maduro that, as a foreigner facing trial in the United States, he had the right to consulate resources. But Maduro himself had effectively closed Venezuela’s consulates when he recalled the country’s diplomats from the United States in 2019, leaving more than half a million people without representation. It’s unclear, then, exactly what resources Maduro will have access to.

As the hearing finished and Maduro stood to leave, spectators jeered at him in Spanish, a liberty that—had they taken it in Venezuela just last week—would probably have landed them in prison, or worse. “Have fun in jail,” one said. “On behalf of all Venezuelans, you will pay,” shouted another. One woman was even more blunt: “Damn you.”</div>

            <h2>The New History of Fighting Slavery</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/02/slavery-resistance-history-carrie-gibson-sudhir-hazareesingh/685429/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1812, Spanish officials in Havana, searching the house of a man named José Antonio Aponte, discovered a wooden box hidden in a clothing trunk, opened it, and were stunned by what they found inside. “It was unlike any book they had ever seen,” Carrie Gibson writes in The Great Resistance: The 400-Year Fight to End Slavery in the Americas, “filled with Biblical and historical images, with many black faces, as well as cut-out bits of paper and handwritten words.” Aponte, a freeman who had once served in the local militia, was part of a group that had sought to launch an uprising among the enslaved. The goal was to overthrow slavery and make Cuba independent, but the rebellion had been quickly suppressed.

Put on trial, Aponte was questioned for three days about what his interrogators called his “book of paintings.” In Daring to Be Free: Rebellion and Resistance of the Enslaved in the Atlantic World, Sudhir Hazareesingh emphasizes the global sweep of Aponte’s portraits, among them versions of Abyssinian royalty and, as Gibson notes, the Greek philosopher Diogenes the Cynic, believed to have once been a slave himself. One element particularly alarmed the Spanish: scenes of Black soldiers vanquishing white troops, evoking the victories of Haitian revolutionaries against the French a decade earlier. During meetings at his house, Aponte had shown them to fellow insurrectionists as proof that they, too, could win a war against slavery.

When he was asked to explain why he had chosen to include what he did, his answer was simple: “For reasons of history.” Aponte was executed after his trial, and his book disappeared. All that is left are Aponte’s descriptions of the work, page by page, at his trial. But that testimony has allowed contemporary historians and artists to reconstruct his visionary awareness that, in seeking to change his world, he first had to compile his own history of what had come before.

In their ambitious histories of slave resistance, Gibson and Hazareesingh are working in the tradition of Aponte, offering a new intellectual and political perspective on the emergence of freedom in the modern world. A generation ago, foundational works on the history of antislavery movements tended to focus on political thinkers and prominent abolitionists, figures who left ample written records behind. But over the past several decades, scholars have made headway in piecing together the ideas and actions of resistance leaders such as Aponte, as well as of the enslaved themselves. This is challenging work: The system of slavery frequently barred access to literacy, and most accounts of enslaved resistance come from people who were not just hostile to the venture but actively seeking to suppress it. By gathering second- and thirdhand traces and elusive sources and data, historians have illuminated communities in the forests of the Kongo region, the deltas of West Africa, the mangroves of Cuba, and the swamps of the Carolinas.

From the November 2025 issue: The Black loyalists of the American Revolution

The Great Resistance and Daring to Be Free synthesize this growing body of scholarship to offer detailed accounts that stretch from the 15th century, when enslaved people from West Africa were first imported to Iberia, through the abolition of slavery in the United States, Cuba, and Brazil in the late 19th century. Gibson builds on her own earlier wide-ranging history of the Caribbean, Empire’s Crossroads (2014), and Hazareesingh branches out from Black Spartacus (2020), his biography of Toussaint Louverture, a leader of the Haitian Revolution.

The story of resistance begins in Africa, where the slave trade itself originates. There, Hazareesingh argues, lie the foundations of a long and influential tradition of antislavery activity that continued into resistance efforts throughout the Americas. He assembles evidence of what he calls an “African fugitive politics”: people on the continent threatened by enslavement taking concerted action in collective ways, intent on self-determination. In many different regions, groups seeking sanctuary from raids by slavers created new settlements during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many of them exist to this day, their founding histories preserved and celebrated in oral traditions.

The Tofinu took refuge in the lagoons along the Bight of Benin, a core area of the slave trade, venturing forth in canoes with harpoons, javelins, and swords to fight off raiders from powerful nearby kingdoms. In present-day central Nigeria, the Eggon created fortified positions in the hills from which they launched stones, spears, and even beehives against would-be enslavers. The focus on living in freedom nurtured a nonhierarchical approach to politics, Hazareesingh writes, and he describes an ethos rooted in honor and consensus. Settlements were named to convey their fugitive origins. “Here where no one can reach them anymore,” one was called; another was “the village of free people.”

Millions couldn’t escape the raiders on the continent. But the remarkable SlaveVoyages database—which both Gibson and Hazareesingh draw on—has transformed our knowledge of resistance at sea. An open-access digital project, it has documented the scale of the slave trade originating on the continent, compiling data on roughly 35,000 voyages that carried at least 10 million people across the Atlantic from Africa. It has also found references to 465 shipboard revolts. Using the database, one study suggests that open resistance may have occurred in as many as 10 percent of slave voyages. The majority of the revolts date back to well before Joseph Cinqué’s carefully plotted rebellion on the Amistad in 1839, the most famous of them and one of a small number that succeeded in securing freedom for those aboard.

Historians are also indebted to written documents left behind by Islamic and Catholic thinkers in Africa who developed religious critiques of slavery. Both Gibson and Hazareesingh single out a Kongolese man named Lourenço da Silva Mendonça, who in the 17th century articulated a particularly powerful attack. He was born into the Ndongo royal lineage in the Kingdom of Kongo, where many had adopted Catholicism. In 1671, he and his family were forced out of the kingdom by the Portuguese and sent to the colony of Brazil. Having seen the ravages of slave-raiding in his homeland, he now witnessed the system of slavery into which many of his people had been sold. He then traveled to Portugal and took up residence in a monastery where several others from the Kongo, as well as Indigenous Brazilians, lived and studied.

Convinced that slavery went against the teachings of Catholicism, he wrote a brief denouncing the institution, which he brought to the Vatican in 1684. “Humanity is infused with the spirit of God,” he argued, and racial differences, an “accident of nature,” are in no way grounds for enslavement. As he pressed his case at the Vatican, Mendonça gathered a dossier that included firsthand accounts from Africans in Portugal.

Along with his own experiences, that evidence fueled his eloquent denunciation of “the unjustified methods used to enslave” people in Africa, “from which results the loss of countless Souls,” as well as the “cruelties” practiced against the enslaved in the Americas. Torture with hot wax and tree sap appalled Mendonça; some of the torments, he observed, were worse than those visited on the early Christian martyrs, and all the more shocking because they were meted out by Christians against other Christians. Mendonça also advocated on behalf of the “New Christians,” among them Jews who had converted to Catholicism but were often still pursued by the Inquisition.

Pope Innocent XI responded by calling on Spain and Portugal to at least curtail the cruelty of slavery. But the profitable slave trade continued, crucial to the colonial order that the leaders of these and other European kingdoms had decided to build. Mendonça’s singular legal case lay buried in the Vatican archives for centuries. Now recovered, his story is an example of the constant cross-Atlantic transmission of information and ideas that Gibson and Hazareesingh highlight as integral to the far-reaching struggle for abolition.

During his time in Brazil, Mendonça had contact with the residents of Palmares, a network of nine jointly governed maroon communities, many of whose members were formerly enslaved refugees from the Kongo. (In the 16th century, the Spanish used the term cimarrónes—originally applied to untamed animals—to describe people who escaped from plantations; other colonial powers adopted versions of it, including the English term maroon.) Probably the largest of all such settlements in the Americas, Palmares thrived through much of the 17th century, its population numbering as many as 10,000 or perhaps even 20,000 residents at one point, and it wielded clout on a different scale than smaller fugitive communities in Africa did.

Under a leader named Gana Zumba, Palmares signed a peace treaty with the Portuguese guaranteeing its freedom. It established alliances with Indigenous Brazilians in the area, and its inclusivity extended to people who weren’t enslaved but were fleeing colonial society, including Jews persecuted for their religious beliefs. African culture, language, and religious practices undergirded community life, but a Catholic priest performed baptisms in a church in Palmares adorned with statues of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and Saint Blaise, an Armenian martyr whose story of taking refuge from persecution in the Cappadocian mountains resonated with the maroons.

Gibson recounts the trajectory of Palmares as just one part of a much longer history of people seeking freedom and sanctuary in the midst of colonial societies. In Spanish Santo Domingo, the first slave society in the Americas, Africans on a sugar plantation owned by Christopher Columbus’s son rebelled on Christmas Day 1521. They escaped into the hills and allied with an Indigenous group fleeing Spanish control, led by a man named Enriquillo. After 15 years, Spanish troops dispersed the settlement—which had grown to 4,000, and had its own cavalry—but subsequent maroon groups forced colonizers to sign treaties with them.

As the plantation colonies of the British and French Caribbean grew in the late 17th and 18th centuries, escapees formed maroon enclaves there as well. The region also saw a series of mass revolts against slavery. In the 1760s, enslaved organizers in Jamaica launched an uprising that was later known as Tacky’s Revolt. It was, as Gibson writes, “not a small, local eruption, easily snuffed out. Rather, this resistance was akin to a multisite, decentralized guerrilla war, not against a particular king or ruler, but against a social and economic system.”

And then in 1791, the largest such uprising in history took shape in the nearby French colony of Saint-Domingue. It led to the abolition of slavery by France in 1794 and, when Napoleon Bonaparte sought to reenslave the population, to Haiti’s independence from France on January 1, 1804, when the island was rechristened with the original Indigenous name for the territory. Hazareesingh and Gibson emphasize the revolution’s role in articulating a radical idea of universal rights and cultivating new forms of democratic participation. (As the notes in The Great Resistance and Daring to Be Free indicate, the close-knit field relies on scholarly interchange; both authors draw on my work on Haiti, and I gave Hazareesingh feedback, reading suggestions, and a blurb.)

The Haitian Revolution’s success in overthrowing slavery and then establishing a new nation gave rise to a very different archive, including writings by and about its most recognized leader, Louverture, and Haiti’s founder, Jean-Jacques Dessalines. These offer us a personal understanding of the influences that shaped their lives and ideas. Dessalines, for instance, acknowledged his deep debt to the woman he considered his “second mother,” Toya Montou, one of a number of women who participated directly in combat. She taught him about his African roots and during the revolution led her own unit of insurgents.

The dramatic victory in Haiti nourished the imaginations of enslaved people across the hemisphere, helping create what Hazareesingh describes as a “popular encyclopaedia” that was “embedded in songs, music, images, and artefacts, and stories, tales, and myths about the revolution’s heroic leaders and the achievements of the Haitian people.” Brazilian authorities were alarmed in 1805 when they found Black officers in the local militia wearing “miniature portraits of Dessalines around their necks.” Parishioners in Black churches in Philadelphia celebrated the anniversary of Haitian independence, if quietly. In Louisiana, a man named Charles Deslondes led a two-day revolt in 1811, the largest in U.S. history, and almost certainly inspired by the Haitian Revolution. Two decades later, Nat Turner planned his (ultimately thwarted) 1831 rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia, to begin on the 40th anniversary of the Haitian Revolution’s start.

From the August 1861 issue: Nat Turner’s Insurrection

The events of the Haitian Revolution reshaped the history of North America: Napoleon’s defeat there prompted him to sell Louisiana—which he had reacquired from Spain as part of his plan to build a French empire in the Americas—to the United States in 1803. The purchase doubled the country’s size, enabling the U.S. to become a bleak outlier: During the next decades, while slavery was being abolished in newly independent Latin American republics and in the British Caribbean, the U.S. expanded slavery into the recently acquired territory.

With the Louisiana Purchase, a huge domestic slave trade got under way, supplying labor to cotton and sugar plantations. Though only roughly 5 percent of the total number of enslaved Africans brought to the New World from the 16th century through the start of the 19th ended up in North America, by the time of the Civil War, the enslaved population had grown to approximately 4 million, mostly native-born. All of their efforts at rebellion in the 19th century were swiftly and brutally suppressed.

Still, other powerful forms of resistance surfaced. Escapes to the North were organized by figures such as Harriet Tubman. Some who had won their freedom, among them Frederick Douglass, wrote powerful autobiographies that were also devastating critiques of slavery. And abolitionist materials produced in the North traveled south. A Mississippi plantation manager complained in 1847 about an enslaved woman named California who had “an idea that she is free” and was passing that idea on to her children. In an echo of Aponte, she had decorated the walls of her cabin with antislavery prints, which were often circulated along with pamphlets.

From the December 1866 issue: Frederick Douglass’s ‘Reconstruction’

When the Civil War began, as many as 500,000 enslaved men and women escaped toward Union lines. After the Emancipation Proclamation, the involvement of 200,000 Black soldiers in the war proved crucial in the Union victory. Some African American recruiters invoked the earlier history of the Haitian Revolution in their pitch, recalling how Black troops in Haiti had secured and protected abolition: Like those forebears, new “black Toussaints” could strike “blow after blow for freedom,” and bring liberation to all of those still enslaved in the South.

As Aponte knew, the way you look at the past shapes your hopes about the present and future. In the U.S., debates about how to understand our experience of slavery and its ultimate demise are as intense as ever, and will continue to be at the core of broader questions about how to narrate our national story. But Hazareesingh and Gibson invite us to see ourselves as inheritors of something much broader too: a powerful history of political thought and on-the-ground resistance—in many forms, always against seemingly insurmountable odds—that stretched across continents and centuries.

Ooookay, slashvertisement department, you could not be any more transparent.

Well, it is AI slop from venture beat, what did you expect?

TFA sounds like simple orchestration compared to Co-pilot [github.blog]. At least co-pilot allows your &#39;team&#39; [visualstudio.com] to have various skills [microsoft.com] as they work cooperatively with each other. In other words, the technology is similar yet co-pilot has a whole API developed.

...a developer agent might use Anthropic Claude, a documentation agent might use Gemini, and a testing agent use Codex, because those LLMs have their specialties that set them apart. Co-pilot manages the team.

Claude is very good at documentation and general text generation. I frequently have Claude write documentation in MD files describing the plan, detailed API docs, progress reports, etc.  For the most part it&#39;s coherent and not as slop-sounding as I expected.  Sometimes I have it write git commit messages which I have to say are often way better than the ones I write. More descriptive yet more concise than my own style.  I just have to remind it to not use emojis in the messages (no icons basically).  Claude

You don&#39;t have unlimited access to an entire data center. He does.

Claude has been generating pretty good Qt code for me. Most of it is boiler plate of course.  I haven&#39;t personally had it litter my code with exception handling, but I have seen it do that to others.

You can always add to your CLAUDE.md file a note to tell it to avoid using exception handling. I&#39;m pretty sure you could tell it to only catch exceptions that the code specifically is set to deal with, and let all others go on up.

Or you could tell it to behave like someone who actually can code, and check all pre- and post-conditions, and invariants, so you don&#39;t get exceptions.

the creator of Claude Code ...
&quot;I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal,&quot;How did he get to the first Claude? And is that all it&#39;s good for? Creating more Claude? What else can it do?

Anthropic has a bunch of legacy models you can use, but the recent Claude Opus 4.5 is the best coding assistant I&#39;ve tried by far. Better than Google&#39;s Gemini, better than OpenAI GPT-5.2.

Unfortunately it is also relatively expensive, 2-4x the price of much of the competition. This guy runs 5 of them to help him and I bet they really do. I use one to do planning now and then or when the lesser models get stuck. I could burn through a several $100/month with 5 Claudes but it would be worth it in some situatio

Some shops in the UK are using a known broken facial recognition system on shoppers. I&#39;m considering options. I try to avoid those shops, but it is spreading.

Maybe a shirt with a load of random face-like markings? A hat with IR LEDs? The point is not just to screw with their system, it&#39;s to make them react so they reveal the use of the system.

Which shops?! As a fellow Brit, I&#39;d like to know where to avoid. Surely the ICO would say this is not proportionate data collection

but they gained some valuable marketing insights in their pants.

Sorry, but you won&#39;t be able to store data on my eyes or face because I&#39;ve write-protected them, but feel free to write my biometric data onto my voice.

The problem is that if I miss seeing my specialist doctor and the prescription goes out of date, the specialty pharmacy cuts me off right away, causes me to miss doses until I can see the specialist again.

The best way to do these renewals using an advanced autocomplete system rather than a regular, non-AI, logical algorithm is why exactly?

The plan is to use human doctors to validate 250 prescriptions, and then declare the AI good for autonomous doctoring? A pharmacist fills somewhere around 500 scripts a day (according to the internetz). So, the company is gonna pay a pharmacist for a half-day’s worth of work double-checking their AI, and then they think they can just hit “run” followed by “profit forever”? 250 prescriptions in each medication class.

Since the demise of Roe v. Wade, red-state lawmakers have been looking for political cover for unpopular criminal abortion bans, and a simple strategy has emerged: stressing that bans in theory afford access in exceptional cases that voters overwhelmingly support, such as medical emergencies. The goal of this maneuver is straightforward. For voters who are conflicted about abortion, a focus on exceptions makes bans moderate and reasonable. But a major decision on Tuesday by the Wyoming Supreme Court striking down the state’s abortion ban suggests that abortion exceptions are fast becoming a Catch-22 for the GOP—a potential political lifeline that can create real trouble in court.

To appreciate why abortion exceptions can create legal headaches for Republicans, it helps to understand the Wyoming litigation. A group of patients, doctors, and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the state’s abortion bans under Article 1, Section 38 of the Wyoming Constitution, passed as part of the backlash to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The amendment recognizes a right to make health care decisions. The plaintiffs argued that this right was fundamental and encompassed people’s decision to terminate a pregnancy. The state responded that abortion wasn’t health care—it was the intentional taking of human life—and that even if abortion were health care, the state’s interest in protecting prenatal life was enough to justify its ban. This focus on protecting life made strategic sense; all five justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court were appointed by Republicans, and polls suggest that even Americans who support legal abortion think fetal life has value, despite their opposition to the sweeping criminalization of decisions about pregnancy.

That’s where the plaintiffs pointed to the state law’s abortion exceptions: If the state really valued protecting fetal life, and if abortion wasn’t health care, the plaintiffs argued, these specific exceptions were a funny way of showing it.

Take the state’s exceptions for fatal fetal abnormalities, which apply only if a physician expects that a newborn’s death will occur within days of a live birth. The court asked how this exception made any sense. How did the state protect life by making women in other cases when death of the newborn was just as certain—but who had a longer timeline to sit with that doomed outcome—carry their pregnancies to term? Given that pregnancy could pose risks to abortion seekers, the justices thought the fetal-abnormality exception threatened patients’ health without advancing the state’s supposed goals.

The same was true of Wyoming’s exceptions for medical emergencies, which explicitly excluded mental health crises, such as depression or psychosis, during pregnancy. The state presented no evidence that mental health wasn’t an issue during pregnancy—and no wonder: Mental health conditions accompany a significant number of pregnancies and can lead to seriously adverse outcomes.

Even the state’s rape and incest exception was a problem. The court’s justices didn’t see any connection between the state’s supposed goal of protecting all life in the womb and allowing abortions in cases of sexual abuse, and neither should anyone else. If the state believes that life or even rights begin at fertilization, it’s hard to comprehend why that wouldn’t be true in instances of sexual assault too.

That Wyoming’s abortion exceptions were weird and incoherent shouldn’t be a great surprise. In recent years, any abortion-ban exception reflects an inherently odd compromise between the demands of anti-abortion lobbyists and the electoral needs of GOP lawmakers. Republicans want to win election. That requires keeping a lid on the most heartbreaking stories, narratives that can shape the vote well outside the state where a tragedy has occurred. Abortion opponents want as many abortions as possible stopped, with the exception of a vanishingly small number of serious threats to life.

Conservative lawmakers thus propose exceptions to make abortion bans seem less harsh. Exceptions, ultimately, are a mere messaging strategy, one that undermines the legal case for abortion bans.

That’s reflected in the oddball design of many exceptions. Medical-emergency exceptions, for example, are meant not so much to give physicians real discretion in addressing urgent conditions as to rule out certain cases (such as threats to mental health) that abortion foes dismiss as “abortion on demand.” Rape-and-incest exceptions, like Wyoming’s, often contain reporting requirements intended to ferret out patients who “cry rape,” a solution in search of a problem in a culture in which sexual violence is massively underreported and rarely prosecuted. In a big-picture sense, exceptions are intended to broadcast that abortion bans are far less harsh than they appear, but on closer examination, they’re designed as much to reassure conservative lawmakers that people won’t be able to get abortions anyway.

And exceptions don’t work—by design. Historically, very few patients have sought out abortions under exceptions. That trend has continued—so much so that red states like Texas and Kentucky have passed laws said to clarify that some abortions are justified under state law. That state of affairs suits conservative lawmakers, who seek the political benefits of exceptions with none of the real abortion access they might afford.

The Wyoming Supreme Court’s ruling in State v. Johnson sends a message that this have-it-both-ways strategy on exceptions won’t always work as Republicans expect. The court saw the very same inconsistencies of exceptions as a sign that they didn’t deliver on the state’s purported goals.

It’s not clear what will come next in fights about abortion exceptions. More challenges like Johnson might come before state supreme courts, given that a number of conservative states, including Oklahoma, Ohio, Alabama, and Florida, have similar health amendments in their constitutions. But Republicans are doubling down on exceptions as a strategy: In Missouri, for example, voters will decide on whether to repeal a reproductive rights amendment passed in 2024. GOP lawmakers have tried to package the repeal amendment as allowing abortion in exceptional cases, like medical emergencies.

Republicans may think this strategy is working; some polls suggest that supporters of abortion rights are less passionate about the issue than they once were. That likely has much more to do with conservatives’ struggles to enforce abortion bans—abortion seems more, not less, common in many ban states since the fall of Roe—than with exceptions. But even when voters are willing not to look hard at what an exception really says and does, the Wyoming decision shows that the same might not be true of courts.

The Trump administration’s justifications for bombing Venezuela and arresting its president shifted in real time this weekend. Was this a national security–related counternarcotics operation, an oil heist, or a regime-change play to topple a dictator?

That lack of clarity—combined with the administration’s propensity to, well, tell a lot of lies—only added to the mass confusion over what’s really going on. After all, Donald Trump’s Venezuela adventure isn’t an isolated incident, and it’s best understood in proper historical context: the long tail of U.S. intervention in Latin America.

To help make sense of what just happened, and to get answers on what might happen next, I turned to Tiziano Breda. He’s a senior analyst covering Latin America and the Caribbean at ACLED, the independent conflict-monitoring organization that tracks political violence and protests worldwide. Breda has spent more than a decade studying Latin American politics and security.

In our conversation, he unpacks how this operation fits into the long arc of U.S. intervention in the region, the internal dynamics of Venezuela’s ruling “Chavista” coalition, the role of oil, and why the most dangerous consequence of this moment may not be what happens next in Caracas, but what it signals across the world. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Aymann Ismail: There’s so much in flux right now. What are the most important things we still don’t know about what’s happening between the United States and Venezuela?

Tiziano Breda: There are at least three variables that remain unclear. The first is how this will play out inside Venezuela now that Maduro has been removed. What has this generated within the Chavista power structure—in the government, the military, and across different sectors of society? What comes next depends on factors like whether Delcy Rodríguez [Venezuela’s acting president] can ensure continuity for the Chavistas while at the same time becoming somewhat more lenient toward U.S. interests.

The second is how this strike is being received in the United States. There has been backlash from Congress. The Trump administration has framed it as a law enforcement operation, but lawmakers say they were bypassed and are questioning the legality of the operation. The key question is how this lands with a Trump support base that is, in principle, uninterested in foreign interventions.

And third, at the international level, it’s still unclear how other major powers are interpreting this—whether they oppose it or see an opportunity. For countries like Russia and China, the question is whether this represents the loss of an ally, a precedent that could be applied in their own spheres of influence. For China in particular, it would mean not recovering the billions of dollars it still has as credit with Venezuela.

This didn’t come out of nowhere. There were months of escalating tensions. How does this moment fit into the longer U.S.–Venezuela standoff? Were you surprised when Trump announced the U.S. captured Maduro?

When Trump took office, his administration was mostly focused on immigration. Marco Rubio struggled with Richard Grenell over whose voice would be more influential in the White House on Venezuela. For the first few months Grenell seemed to have the upper hand: There were prisoner exchanges, deportation flights, Chevron’s license was renewed. But in 2025, Rubio established himself as a key strategic adviser on Venezuela. There was a noticeable shift: military buildup in the Caribbean, harsher rhetoric and labeling organized crime groups as terrorist organizations, allegations tying Maduro to some of them.

That framing was used to justify strikes against suspected drug-trafficking vessels—at least 34 so far with over 110 confirmed fatalities—not only in the Caribbean, but also in the Pacific. When that didn’t produce cracks within Maduro’s administration, we saw an escalation: oil tankers seized or chased, and a blockade on Venezuelan oil. That caused much more damage to the Maduro government’s ability to keep revenues afloat, yet there were still no cracks in Maduro’s network of alliances. So Trump was left with two options: either back down and strike some kind of deal or escalate. There had already been a CIA strike in late December, but I did not expect an operation of this kind.

The U.N. has already said this violates international law. Is there any real ambiguity here?

I’m not an expert on international law, but it’s my understanding that the U.S. does have the right to try someone in the United States for crimes that may have affected the U.S., such as drug trafficking. Thousands of drug traffickers have gone through this process. But I’m much less sure that this means the U.S. has the authority to go and extract Maduro from another country. Usually, the United States would request the extradition of a person believed to have committed a crime in the U.S. I’d say there are serious deficiencies in the legality of the operation.

The closest precedent, at least in Latin America, is the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989, to capture and extract President Noriega on drug-trafficking charges. That operation was on a much larger scale and far more costly in terms of lives, duration, and scope. But it occurred in the context of the Cold War—a moment in history that preceded the era of multilateralism, international governance, and the development of international human rights norms. I’m concerned, seeing a return of this practice in 2026. It suggests much of what was built after that period is now unraveling, or being dismantled by the United States.

So what does the future of Venezuela look like? Rodríguez seems to be in control. Rubio is saying that she’s illegitimate. Do you see regime change on the horizon? Not in the short term, unless Rodríguez is unable to do two things. She needs to avoid taking a confrontational stance toward the United States, and instead strike deals and make concessions in the oil sector. Simultaneously, she needs to project an image of someone who remains loyal to Chavismo principles—respect for national sovereignty, resistance to excessive U.S. imperial practices, and so on. If she manages this balancing act, avoiding further U.S. strikes while preventing fractures within the Chavista ranks—both in the military and in social networks—Venezuela can stabilize in the short term. But if either of these fails, I think more violence is likely.

The United States has declared they intend to run the country. How will that complicate Rodríguez’s ability to stabilize Venezuela?

The U.S. is looking to ensure that this removal leads to more functional agreements with the Venezuelan government—guaranteeing U.S. companies can get in more freely, invest, settle, and sell all the oil they can pump. A full-fledged regime change does not seem to be the main goal of the Trump administration in the short term. They are aware that the [Venezuelan, anti-Maduro] opposition may have popular support, but they do not have the buy-in of the military in particular. Installing a government without military support would carry the risk of throwing the country into chaos.

Is there something about the way that the Venezuelan government is set up that will make it particularly challenging for Rodríguez to consolidate?

Like all governments and political forces, the Maduro government—the Chavistas—has its own internal currents and branches. Maduro, and particularly Cilia Flores, are relevant here. Their removal matters because Maduro and Cilia Flores had managed to pacify the different factions within Chavismo and build a system in which elites could extract wealth from Venezuela.

For example, the military benefited from revenues from the gold-mining sector. The security sector, some would say, participated in illegal drug trafficking, and of course benefited from oil and shipping. There was a balance, and wealth was distributed among military, economic, and political elites in a way that kept the system stable. Rodríguez may try to replicate this, but she will be dealing with a very different level of U.S. pressure than Maduro faced. There may also be Maduro loyalists who obstruct her government. So even if the overall architecture remains in place, simply replacing the person at the top will have repercussions across the entire government.

What role does oil actually play in all of this? I look at a country like Saudi Arabia and think, Wow, they got lucky they have so much oil. Why was this not necessarily possible for a place like Venezuela?

The key difference between Maduro and Chávez is that Maduro politicized the oil sector too heavily. When Chávez was in power, Venezuela benefited from a boom in energy prices in the mid-2000s. He also appointed people with technical expertise to manage the oil sector. When Maduro came to power in 2013, in a quest to consolidate his authority, he replaced almost all the Chavistas he didn’t trust—including the minister of oil—and replaced them with loyalists who lacked knowledge of the sector. That lack of understanding began to create problems with maintenance, delays, production failures, and so on.

Then you had the plummeting of oil prices about 10 years ago, which hurt Venezuela’s revenue. Even before the U.S. sanctioned the oil sector in 2019, under the first Trump administration, the sector was already collapsing due to corruption and overall mismanagement. They could still maintain significant production—almost a million barrels a day—but that was down from 3 million about 15 years earlier. With that, they had enough money to sustain the elites, but the rest of society and the broader economy collapsed. That’s why you had around 8 million Venezuelans fleeing the country, as the government itself remained intact.

Up until last week, Nicolas Maduro was challenging the United States to invade, publishing videos of his military conducting drills. I know a little bit about his background, that he was originally a bus driver. What can you tell me about his character?

The role of Cilia Flores [Maduro’s wife, who was also arrested] is often overlooked. Some people refer to her as the power in the shadows, operating behind the scenes. Maduro did not reach his position alone. Flores was a key figure in liaising with the different branches of the Chavismo project. She has been head of the National Assembly, a deputy, and a minister. Her political trajectory was similar to Maduro’s, even though it was Maduro who was appointed by Chávez as his political heir. Maduro relied heavily on Cilia Flores, who played a key role in holding his government together.

Maduro also made use of humor and self-parody as a political tactic. He presents himself as a funny, silly, good guy. He even created a cartoon version of himself called “Súper Bigote,” or “Super Mustache.” I can’t think of another leader who has leaned so heavily into laughing at himself. He uses that strategy to conceal the authoritarian nature of his government, to soften accusations of massive human rights violations, suppression of dissent, waves of political arrests, extrajudicial killings, and so on.

And then you see the images of him being detained in the United States. He has a big grin, giving two thumbs up. What explains that?

There was also an attempt to keep the character going, to play on the empathy of the audience, watching a guy who, in another context, might greet you with a thumbs-up and say “Happy New Year.” He appears certain of his innocence, as though he believes he will be released once the truth comes out. While the aim of the United States might have been to show that a man who had been in power since 2013—so for over a decade—who had seemed untouchable was being brought down to the level of a common criminal.

I haven’t seen much from inside Venezuela. How are Venezuelans reacting inside the country?

At ACLED, we have so far recorded only two protests inside Venezuela, and both were in favor of Maduro. It’s not only that there are no protests, there has also been a decrease in traffic and economic activity over the past couple of days. Inside the country, the government has imposed a state of emergency and deployed military forces to the streets, which has disincentivized mobilization. Uncertainty is also playing a key role. There have been mixed messages coming from the United States—the sidelining of María Corina Machado [prominent opposition leader and recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize], the attempt to reach an agreement with Rodríguez, who is part of the same system as Maduro, and the broader fear that if this doesn’t work out, it could trigger chaos within the Chavista ranks and lead to violence. So I think people are avoiding the public sphere.

And what about abroad? How are Venezuelans in the diaspora reacting to this?

The vast majority of Venezuelans abroad have celebrated Maduro’s removal from power, though not as many agree with the way it happened through the bombing of Caracas. Most Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years did so either because of political persecution or because of the economic collapse caused by the Maduro administration.

It’s strange to see people celebrating the bombing of their own country.

It is. But it’s a testament to the level of discontent and anger toward an administration that has effectively dismantled the country’s economy. Twenty years ago, Venezuela was the wealthiest country in South America. Today, roughly a quarter of the population has been forced to leave because the economy collapsed. The relief—if not outright celebration—among many Venezuelans reflects that deep discontent with the Maduro administration.

How are other leaders and peoples in Latin America reacting to this?

There has been a mixed reaction. Leftist governments like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico have strongly condemned the U.S. action. On the other hand, more right-wing governments like Argentina, Ecuador, and the newly elected president of Honduras have been more supportive, and in some cases even enthusiastic about the operation. The divisions have been quite clear along ideological lines.

For people particularly in countries that have been most affected by the influx of Venezuelan migrants and refugees—Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Chile—the arrival of Venezuelans has strained public resources, and in some cases it has been instrumentalized by xenophobic political figures, creating a stigma.

Maduro is widely perceived as the main cause of Venezuelan migration and is deeply unpopular. There was polling showing that, across Latin America, and particularly in the countries most affected by Venezuelan migration, many people were already in favor of major intervention in Venezuela, even before this happened.

The U.S. seems to be configuring the reasoning for capturing Maduro in real time, offering conflicting information. What do you think is really driving the U.S. here, and what’s bullshit?

There are three reasons. First, reasserting U.S. dominance in the hemisphere, especially actors seen as being in cahoots with the U.S.’s main global competitors, Russia and China. Second, widening U.S. access to energy and other resources. Venezuela is rich in gas, minerals, and gold, and expanding U.S. access to those sectors is strategically important for the American economy. Third is migration. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans live in the United States, and millions more across the region. By removing what is perceived to be the country’s main problem—Maduro—and projecting the image that the U.S. will now invest in Venezuela, the administration is trying to create a picture that things have improved and encourage Venezuelans living in the U.S. without legal status to return.

The BS part is drug trafficking, which is paradoxically the legal rationale being used to bring Maduro to justice. He’s being charged with drug trafficking, terrorism, and weapons offenses. But the narrative that Maduro himself is a central drug-trafficking threat—and that attacks on drug vessels or even Maduro’s trial will significantly reduce the flow of drugs to the U.S. or elsewhere—doesn’t really hold up.

This is a return to a more assertive U.S. approach toward Latin America. It’s something that had waned over the years and been replaced by a greater emphasis on regional cooperation through institutions like the Organization of American States, and by U.S. soft power projected through development projects. This attack marks a clear end to that era and a return to one in which the United States is willing to use its full power—economic, diplomatic, and military—to ensure that its preferences materialize in the region. It’s somewhat anachronistic, but it’s a renewed version of the Monroe Doctrine, which held that the U.S. has a responsibility to influence and direct political, economic, and military developments in the hemisphere, and to keep external forces from undermining its interests.

Does the speed at which Donald Trump pivoted to Greenland and Mexico reveal anything about how he might be thinking about Venezuela?

Trump may feel emboldened because it has cost the United States little in terms of human lives and equipment, which he emphasized repeatedly during his press conference on Saturday. Let’s see what the U.N. Security Council says and what comes next, but for now the international cost also appears limited. Whether more action happens in the immediate future will depend on how the situation in Venezuela unfolds. If it triggers domestic turmoil, violence between different factions of Chavismo, or broader social unrest, then it becomes less likely that this approach would be applied elsewhere. Paradoxically, if it works, there is a risk that it could be repeated in other contexts.

For those hoping that Gen Z would usher in a new era of progressive politics in America, the past two years have been a whipsaw. In 2024 there was great panic over young voters’ drift toward Donald Trump. But in 2025, after young voters in New York City, New Jersey, and Virginia helped deliver Democratic wins, there was a reassessment. In light of these liberal victories, many put forward amended evaluations, stating that Gen Z is both more participatory and progressive than it has been given credit for, and that concerns about Democratic erosion among young men, spurred by the influence of the “manosphere,” have been exaggerated. In fact, Gen Z was lauded for being the most progressive generation ever based on recent measures of racial attitudes from the 2024 Cooperative Election Study dataset, a nationally representative survey of over 60,000 Americans.

So which is it? Is Gen Z a bastion of progressives who are immune to the manosphere’s toxicity? Or is 2025 a blip, and is Gen Z bucking the long-running trend of younger generations moving left?

The short answer is that it’s complicated, and neither of those dueling narratives gets to the truth.

The slightly longer answer is this: According to the best available data, on issues of race, members of Gen Z are, on average, far more progressive than any of their older counterparts. But when it comes to attitudes toward gender, Gen Z members are no more progressive than the rest of us.

It’s a sobering finding with large-scale implications, both for the future of U.S. politics and for our understanding of how the first generation to grow up online is processing the modern media ecosystem.

It’s also particularly telling about the manosphere— a corner of the digital landscape that features communities dedicated to men’s issues ranging from things like self-help, dating, and fitness to explicitly misogynistic forums defined by grievances toward feminism and women. Although the manosphere content often cited by media and scholars is not necessarily racially regressive, it is distinctly gender regressive, and that appears to be taking a toll on Gen Z.

OK, those are big claims. So how do I know this? I’m an academic whose work has focused explicitly on the importance of identity in American politics—things like race, gender, and class—and how we can use surveys to understand its influence. I’m going off not just vibes here; my conclusions are based on that same 2024 survey, which, as noted, drew from more than 60,000 Americans.

Among questions in which the survey asks how much one agrees or disagrees with statements like “Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for Blacks to work their way out of the lower class” and “Whites get away with offenses that African Americans would never get away with,” members of Gen Z are unique. Of all age groups, they show the lowest levels of what scholars call racial resentment, a standard survey index that combines multiple questions to measure racism. However, on measures of ambivalent sexism, via statements such as “Women seek to gain power by getting control over men” and “Women are too easily offended,” Gen Z–ers are strikingly no different from their grandparents. Let’s break it down.

The figure above shows that Gen Z’s level of sexism is only slightly below average, and negligibly lower than the Silent Generation’s. Sexism is measured using respondents’ level of agreement with two statements, mentioned earlier, about women seeking power over men and being too easily offended. Generational scores are then standardized so that they demonstrate how each generation compares with the overall average across all respondents in the CES. Values closer to “high” indicate groups that are more sexist than average, while values closer to “low” indicate groups that are less sexist than average.

This gender finding stands in sharp contrast to racial attitudes. Racial resentment is measured using five survey items about structural racial inequality and is also depicted relative to the overall average. On race, each older generation consistently displays higher resentment compared with the generation that succeeded it. Gen Z is notably lower than average on racial resentment.

The takeaway is not that Gen Z–ers are uniformly progressive, but that their progressivism is uneven. It is real and pronounced based on race but far more tenuous when it comes to gender.

Gen Z’s lack of progress on gender issues is all the more stark when you break down the differences in responses across genders.

One can look at how men and women across age differ in levels of racism and sexism. The first figure shows that younger generations are slightly less sexist than older generations (though this data is in no way as stark as that of racism). However, if you look at this by men and women in different generations, this slightly lower level of sexism is driven entirely by women in those generations. Men across each age group are above average in their level of sexism, and there is no generational difference in level of gender progressiveness.

These trends, unsurprisingly, differ by political party identification. Republicans exhibit the highest level of both sexism and racial resentment for all age cohorts. Interestingly, younger Republicans are actually more sexist than their elders, suggesting a potential regression in attitudes toward women across generations. This further lends support to the narrative that young people on the right are being influenced by sexist content online. Overall, Democrats and independents show rising racial progressiveness across age—but no similar generational shift on sexism.

If the narrative that Gen Z is uniquely progressive were true, we would expect Gen Z–ers to be more progressive than older generations by outright rejecting sexist statements. Older cohorts tend to hover around mild tolerance, so a genuinely more progressive generation (Gen Z Democrats included) should move decisively beyond that baseline. It doesn’t.

It is easier and more comfortable to conclude that Gen Z is pretty great and to advise people to stop panicking—to embrace a comforting narrative that the youth are here to save us. It is also reasonable to applaud reductions in racism that have taken shape over generations.

But dwelling too long on that can foster misplaced faith and ill-timed complacency.

The data reveals that concerns over young people, especially young men, are not unfounded. Gender-focused research supports the lived experience of what women already know: There is a rising tide of gender-based antagonism both online and offline. It does us no favors to conflate the important gains in racial progress among Gen Z with the real evidence of the impact of the manosphere and red-pill communities.

Beyond the findings presented here, research from scholars like Michael Tesler, John Sides, and Colette Marcellin, as well as from Melissa Deckman, supports this broader pattern of gender attitudes. According to their work, young Republicans, men and women alike, are gravitating toward traditional gender roles, and young men overall are becoming more conservative. This shows that gender attitudes broadly are an effective terrain for Republican appeals. Gender attitudes may be a bridge issue that allows the GOP to find new voters without conceding ground on other issues.

Young Republicans, the ones who are more sexist than their grandparents, are increasingly setting the tone and strategy for their party. And this new cohort has focused on reaching young voters in the media environments they already inhabit with campaign strategies that focus on entertainment-forward social media and generationally relatable messages.

In practice, this looks like using masculinity-based appeals to reach young voters, particularly in spaces that sit outside the conventional conservative-media ecosystem. From an attitudinal perspective, this strategy may be well suited to the moment. The lack of clear progress of Gen Z on gender attitudes leaves an opening in which appeals grounded in masculinity and skepticism toward feminism can resonate without triggering partisan backlash. If Republicans continue to organize their outreach around this dimension, the strategy may prove durable over time.

Over the next few decades, these attitudes toward both racism and sexism will shape not just elections, the focus of current commentary, but institutions and policy. A generation that is progressive on race but not on gender will not be able to implement a fully egalitarian society. There will be uneven progress, with movement forward on issues of racial inequality but stagnation and resistance toward inroads into gender inequality. This will manifest across institutions, producing a political world that can accommodate racial inclusion while continuing to normalize unequal gender relations in families, workplaces, and governance.

President Donald Trump’s military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is flatly illegal under international law and almost certainly illegal under federal law—an unauthorized use of force against a foreign nation that pushes executive power past its breaking point. Yet there is no real chance that the courts will curb it, even as the mission evolves into a possible occupation of Venezuela and an expansion of hostilities to its neighbors. Nor is there any signal that Congress will impose restraints on what appears to be the dawn of a new conflict overseas, surrendering its constitutional war powers to Trump without objection. And even if Congress does try to assert its authority to oversee (or end) military action in South America, it will face an uphill battle in a judiciary that persistently favors the commander in chief.

This inversion of our constitutional order sets a perilous precedent that even many celebrating Maduro’s fall may come to regret. It marks the death knell of the post–World War II settlement that, however imperfect, wrestled the anarchy of war into a framework designed to condition armed aggression on legal justification. The executive branch’s consolidation of power now reverberates far beyond the United States’ shores as a saber-rattling president abandons any pretense that the law can constrain his resort to military force. Indeed, the legal theories the administration has floated to defend its actions draw on a historical source Trump once disavowed: the arch-interventionist claim that the U.S. has an inalienable right to police the world.

It is difficult to tally all the ways in which the Maduro operation was illegal, but start with a point that few dispute: This act violated international law. Trump’s invasion of Venezuela to capture its president cannot be squared with Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which bars member nations from deploying “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” This principle—the most important rule of international law today—should bind the United States, which ratified the charter in 1945. And it clearly prohibits the American government from invading another country to make an arrest.

Yet Mike Waltz, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, did not even pretend that the administration complied with Article 2(4) in his address to the U.N. Security Council on Monday. Instead, Waltz rejected the premise that this rule should apply to Venezuela at all, because Maduro was an “illegitimate narco-terrorist” and “fugitive from justice.” Of course, if a country can disregard the U.N. Charter whenever it concludes that another nation’s leaders have given up their claim to “territorial integrity or political independence,” then the charter means nothing. Arguably worse was Waltz’s insistence that Venezuela’s vast “energy reserves” also justified the action, a motive Trump has laid bare from the start. It should go without saying that the charter does not, under any circumstances, permit one nation to invade another to secure control over its natural resources.

So what is the government’s legal defense of its military incursion into Venezuela? The administration purports to be following the Panama precedent of 1989—when President George H.W. Bush ordered the military invasion of Panama to arrest its dictator, Manuel Noriega, ostensibly so he could stand trial in the U.S. But this episode was not approved by Congress (which found out just hours before) or the U.N. (which condemned it) or a federal court (which never passed on its legality). Instead, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel justified the aggression in a secret memo signed by William Barr, who would go on to serve as attorney general for the first Bush and Trump.

In that memo, Barr claimed that the president has inherent constitutional authority to conduct extraterritorial arrests for violations of U.S. law. Even if those arrests require complex military incursions into foreign nations, he wrote, they remain within the president’s inherent powers and do not require congressional approval. Barr further asserted that these arrests did not have to comply with Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. That provision, he wrote, does not actually bind the executive branch because it is not “self-executing,” freeing the commander in chief to disregard it.

This conclusion was obviously wrong: Even if the charter cannot be enforced by federal courts, it remains binding on the executive branch and is a law that the president has a constitutional duty to faithfully execute. The memo was so absurd, in fact, that the DOJ did everything in its power to conceal it, as New York University law professor Ryan Goodman has documented. After Congress demanded to see Barr’s memo, the department refused, even failing to comply with a subpoena ordering its disclosure. When Barr eventually testified about its contents under oath, he omitted its assertion that the president can “override” the U.N. Charter (a legal justification that made up a mere four paragraphs). The Clinton administration finally released the memo in 1993, and in the years since, legal experts have derided it as “deeply counterintuitive and indefensible,” “fundamentally flawed,” “preposterous,” and utterly “bereft of citation to supporting authority.”

But embrace, for a moment, the nihilism of Barr’s memo and assume that international law imposes no legitimate constraints on the president’s use of force. Even then, Trump’s actions in Venezuela would still be illegal—or, most generously, an egregious distortion of the constitutional war powers. It is Congress, after all, that has the authority to declare war and must authorize use of military force. The president is the commander in chief, the civilian leader of the armed forces, but he holds no independent power to commence hostilities. Needless to say, Congress has neither declared war on Venezuela nor authorized military force within its borders.

From where, then, did Trump derive authority to invade Venezuela? As Harvard Law professor Jack Goldsmith has explained, the administration evidently contrived it from its desire to arrest Maduro on federal charges. The logic goes like this: The DOJ sought to take the dictator into custody on charges of drug trafficking. It could do so only by storming Venezuela. That operation would require protection from the military. And as a matter of “unit self-defense,” these accompanying troops had a right to bomb, shoot, and otherwise overwhelm any threats to the mission through lethal force. This rationale is quintessential bootstrapping: The alleged goal of trying Maduro in the U.S. gives Trump permission to launch a hostile incursion into a sovereign nation, whose ramifications may well give rise to a broader regional conflict.

Georgetown Law professor and Slate contributor Steve Vladeck has laid out the danger of this shameless maneuver: It subverts the constitutional order by allowing the president to set off offensive military operations under the pretext of carrying out an arrest warrant on foreign soil. If troops face any resistance, they can escalate with further use of force, sliding quickly toward war—all without authorization from the legislative branch. So the Trump administration’s apparent rationale is less of a loophole than a complete end run around Congress’ war powers with no limiting principle in sight.

Despite all this, no one seriously thinks that any federal court will slow or stop Trump’s attacks in Venezuela and its neighbors. Americans seem to have consigned ourselves to the reality that legal constraints on the commander in chief’s operational decisions are entirely theoretical, with no meaningful mechanism for enforcement. Congress has handed over to the president more and more of its authority over foreign affairs. The Supreme Court has persistently forbidden federal judges from second-guessing the executive branch’s use of military force. (That’s why the Trump administration’s legal defense comes not from a court decision but from a self-serving opinion produced by the Department of Justice.) And the rest of the world has no means to secure accountability for the United States, which does not even recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.

So Trump, already a “unitary executive” at home, becomes a kind of ersatz emperor abroad, bound by no law of nations, no treaty or charter, no checks but those he elects to honor. The post–World War II consensus, as enshrined in the U.N. Charter, rejected this kind of unbridled aggression as an invitation to perpetual conflict. Trump, in turn, rejects that consensus. It may be tempting to ignore the consequences of this radical new doctrine when it is wielded against an illegitimate dictator like Maduro. But Trump is already threatening action against Colombia, Cuba, Iran, and even Mexico, a liberal democracy with a legitimately elected president. The end point, it seems, is whatever this president says it is. That theory of American dominance does not merely push legal limits. It subordinates law to the logic of conquest.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If there was a kingdom of laptop screen flexibility, Lenovo would take the crown. Last year, the company released the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, with a mechanical screen that could roll out to increase its size from 14 to 16.7 inches. Now, it’s back with the ThinkPad Rollable XD concept laptop that expands from 13.3 to 16 inches at the touch of a button or a swipe, along with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist, which uses a motor to rotate its screen and follow you around the room.

We had a chance to see the ThinkPad Rollable XD concept at a New York press event in December and were impressed with its ability to make the most of its display technology. According to Lenovo, this is a ThinkPad X13 chassis, with the rollable panel and mechanism added on, so expect roughly the same performance you would get from the X13 and its selection of Intel Core Ultra processors.

The rollable display technology wraps around the top lip of the lid, leaving room for the equivalent of a second screen on the back. This secondary display, on the concept unit, showed a series of three widgets, which you could theoretically use for tasks like viewing the weather, stock quotes, or AI answers. It’s not big enough to hold a full application window, so forget about using it to show a presentation to the person sitting across from you.

When you either hit a button above the keyboard or slide your finger over the right side of the top lip, the system changes modes, sliding the screen open to its 16-inch mode or closed to its 13-inch mode if it was already open. The entire display is 2048 x 2350 and is only completely visible when opened.

One really cool effect is that, when the ThinkPad Rollable XD concept is opening or closing its screen, you can look at the back and see the two motors moving it. I called this its elevator guts because it reminded me of what you might see from the motors and pulleys in an elevator.

Unfortunately, the Rollable XD is just a concept for now so you won’t be able to buy it. If something like this does come to market, it will probably have a slightly different implementation and will likely carry whatever Intel or AMD CPU is current at that time.

Lenovo is also showing off how rollable displays could be used to improve the gaming experience with its Legion Pro Rollable. This concept design features a 16-inch OLED screen that expands both left and right to grow into 21.5-inch Tactical Mode or 24-inch Arena Mode. These three sizes carry resolutions of 2048 x 1280, 2986 x 1280, and 3413 x 1280.

Lenovo says the expandable screen is meant to help esports gamers. Tactical Mode is supposed to improve peripheral vision while gaming, while Arena Mode is aimed at &quot;elite&quot; training. Whatever the reasoning, it’s always good to have more screen real estate.

Lenovo has also equipped the Pro Rollable with some AI features that help players win. Designed for FPS and MOBA games, AI Scene Detection zooms in on certain areas of the screen and blows them up in the upper right corner of the screen. Cursor Tracking displays a zoomed in window based on where your cursor is. AI Game Assistance knows what game you are playing and offers hints in a breakout window.

Adaptive AI Lighting changes the RGB lights on the system to match what’s happening in game. For example, if you’re bleeding, the lights will turn red.

The Legion Pro Rollable is based on the Legion Pro 7i laptop, which is available with Intel Core Ultra processors and up to an Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU. However, this rollable concept seems unlikely to come to market anytime soon.

2-in-1 laptops that rotate into tablet mode are nothing new, but how about one that does it using a motor and then uses that movement for other purposes? At first glance, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist looks like a typical convertible, though you may notice that there’s a single rotating hinge in the middle rather than dual side hinges you usually see on bend-back displays.

The display itself is a colorful, 14-inch, 2.8K OLED touch panel that operates at up to 120 Hz and 500 nits of brightness. The laptop weighs a reasonable 3.09 pounds (1.4 kg) but finds room for a generous 75 Wh battery inside.

If the Auto Twist is closed and you double tap your fingers on the lid, it will use the motorized hinge to open into clamshell mode. You can use voice commands to tell the laptop to bend into tablet mode.

The hinge can also use the webcam to guide its rotation so that it keeps you centered on video calls, even as you stand up and move around the room. I got a chance to try this out and was intrigued by how it could stay focused on me by highlighting my face. Granted, having a second person enter the frame could throw it off.

Perhaps most interestingly, at my demo, a Lenovo representative showed off a built-in tool that turns the Auto Twist into a friendly, helpful robot. As I watched, he asked the laptop about the weather and, as it answered, a pair of eyes and a mouth appeared on the screen, making the entire lid look like the head of a robot.

The friendly robot swivels its head to show personality while it’s answering your questions. It can also show a right-hand side panel with more details. For example, when our rep asked about hotels, a list of Las Vegas hotels appeared in this pane. Sadly, this was just a demo: Lenovo didn’t say when or if this experience was coming to the Auto Twist nor what models it might apply to.

Lenovo also says that the Auto Twist will come with a suite of AI software it calls its SMB Vertical AI Solution. This will allow for on-device meeting transcription, captioning (with translation), and AI-assisted video creation.

One of Intel’s latest Core Ultra Series 3 (aka Panther Lake) processors powers the Auto Twist. These chips are the first ones based on Intel’s 18A process and promise significantly more performance per watt than prior generations. A little less importantly, the CPU’s 50 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second) NPU allows the Auto Twist to qualify as a Copilot+ PC, which means that it can run exclusive offline AI tools such as Microsoft Recall and Windows Studio Effects.

You’ll be able to buy the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist in June for a starting price of $1,649 in the US.

Lenovo’s flagship ThinkPad, the X1 Carbon, is entering its 14th generation with a new design under the hood that’s the same as the X1 2-in-1 (Gen 11). The company is using what it calls its Space Frame, an internal layout that allows for components to be placed on both sides of the motherboard and for vastly improved repairability.

The bottom surface is held in place with a limited number of captive Phillips-head screws, but, as I saw in a demo, it comes on and off easily. The battery underneath is held in place by three screws. And, if you unplug some ribbon cables and unscrew a few more screws inside, you can pop the top surface with the keyboard and touchpad off and replace it.

Unfortunately, as with older models, the RAM is soldered onto the motherboard so you can’t replace it. However, you can more easily replace other parts and there’s always been access to upgrade the M.2 PCIe SSD.

By reorganizing the X1 Carbon’s innards, Lenovo is able to add more cooling to the laptop and therefore improve the heat dissipation by 20 percent over the prior model. This allows the CPU to run at a sustained 30 watts, which is a step up from the 2025’s 13th generation.

The X1 Carbon accomplishes all of this while staying thin: It has a maximum thickness of just 0.6 inches (15.3 mm) and weighs a mere 2.2 pounds (996 g).

On the inside, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 and X1 2-in-1 Gen 11 are powered by Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 processors, which themselves promise a significant boost in performance per watt, and LPDDR5x 9600 MHz memory. A new, 10-MP webcam sports a wide, 110-degree field of view so you can fit your whole background into the frame.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 and X1 2-in-1 Gen 11 will both be on sale in March for starting prices of $1,999 and $2,149 respectively. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A year after a series of fires obliterated communities in Los Angeles, Amazon&#39;s Ring security service has announced a feature called Fire Watch intended to mitigate future wildfire risk.

Introduced in conjunction with CES 2026, Fire Watch is a feature in the Neighbors section of the Ring app, which Ring users use for neighborhood alerts and community safety updates. It&#39;s scheduled to roll out nationwide this spring.

Fire Watch relies on wildfire alerts and reporting from Watch Duty, a nonprofit organization focused on the distribution of public safety information. It&#39;s intended as a way to spot and report signs of fire activity as soon as possible, to give first responders and people in affected areas as much time as possible to act.

When Watch Duty identifies a wildfire, the service sends notifications to nearby Ring users. Eligible outdoor cameras will then start monitoring for signs of fire using AI-based image recognition.

Camera owners should receive an alert if the AI detects smoke or flames, though Ring cautions, &quot;Your camera can make mistakes and might produce false positives (detecting fire when there isn&#39;t one) or false negatives (missing actual fires).&quot;

&quot;Ring began with a single doorbell I built in my garage – one that was sadly lost in the Palisades fire last year,&quot; said Jamie Siminoff, chief inventor of Ring, in a statement. &quot;While that loss is small compared to the devastation experienced by families and the lives lost, it reinforces why this work matters so deeply to me.&quot;

The one-year anniversary of the Los Angeles fires also finds California working to draft new regulations that require vegetation to be cleared around homes to reduce the risk of wildfire.

As part of the product launch, Ring said it has donated $1 million to Watch Duty to help the nonprofit expand across all 50 US states and to improve the organization&#39;s real-time fire reporting capabilities.

Ring is also implementing other AI capabilities to warn users of danger.

The AI Unusual Event Alert is designed to trigger when a Ring camera catches something unusual. The system computes its baseline for what&#39;s normal by analyzing Ring Video Descriptions – text summaries of Video Preview Alerts and Event History entries – and then presents an alert when it determines that something out of the ordinary has occurred, although the documentation includes a caveat that &quot;AI Video Descriptions might occasionally be inaccurate.&quot;

Active Warnings uses AI-generated Video Descriptions in conjunction with context-specific audio-based warnings to deter threats. The idea is that when the camera spots a person, it can issue a real-time warning based on where the person is and what the person is doing.

AI Unusual Event Alerts and Active Warnings are expected to be available later this month to customers with compatible subscription plans who have Video Descriptions enabled, except in Illinois.

Ring AI Video Descriptions, AI Single Event Alert, and AI Unusual Event Alert are unavailable in Illinois as a result of the state&#39;s privacy law.

The company&#39;s Familiar Faces feature, which applies facial recognition technology to people captured on Ring cameras and was made available last month, has been disallowed even more widely – in Texas, Illinois, Portland (OR), and Quebec.

There&#39;s still no comprehensive federal privacy law in the US and the current administration appears disinterested in pursuing one. That leaves civil liberties advocacy groups and privacy-minded politicians to push back against Ring, which the ACLU and EFF characterize as an enabler of techno-authoritarianism.

Last month, US Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) released findings following his probe of Amazon&#39;s Ring, after having tried and failed to get Amazon to abandon the Ring Familiar Faces feature. His primary objection is that those who have had their faces scanned by a Ring Doorbell camera have not given their consent to have their faces captured and analyzed.

&quot;Despite my warnings, Amazon unleashed a new privacy nightmare on the American people by releasing its Ring doorbell facial recognition feature without any meaningful privacy protections,&quot; said Senator Markey in a statement. &quot;This is a giant step toward a dystopian future where Americans cannot leave their homes without being tracked and surveilled.&quot;

Amazon in response [PDF] to Markey&#39;s inquiry said that it tells customers who enable Familiar Faces that &quot;they should comply with applicable laws that may require obtaining consent.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last fall, Jakub Ciolek reported two denial-of-service bugs in Argo CD, a popular Kubernetes controller, via HackerOne&#39;s Internet Bug Bounty (IBB) program. Both were assigned CVEs and have since been fixed. But instead of receiving an $8,500 reward for the two flaws, Ciolek says, HackerOne ghosted him for months.

The open source bug bounty program finally contacted Ciolek on Tuesday, but only after The Register reached out to HackerOne asking about the status of his reward payment and the IBB program in general.

HackerOne&#39;s IBB is a crowdfunded bug bounty program that encourages researchers and maintainers to find and fix vulnerabilities in open source software by offering pooled cash payouts. Any organization that relies on open source code to run its technology or chains (in other words: everyone) can contribute to the bounty pool.

Once CVE-tracked vulnerabilities are fixed, the program deducts the funds automatically and issues rewards, with 80 percent of the bounty going to the hacker who reported the bug, and 20 percent to the open source project to help fund the fix.

That&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to work, anyway.

When researchers are instead met with silence - even after CVEs are issued and fixes are shipped - it undermines confidence in the entire model

&quot;When researchers are instead met with silence - even after CVEs are issued and fixes are shipped - it undermines confidence in the entire model,&quot; Ciolek told The Register. &quot;A simple notice saying &#39;the program is inactive&#39; would go a long way. Ghosting researchers does the opposite.&quot;

The two high-severity denial-of-service flaws, CVE-2025-59538 and CVE-2025-59531, affect Argo CD, a GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. If exploited, these issues could allow a remote attacker to crash vulnerable instances without any authentication.

The open source project&#39;s maintainers fixed both vulnerabilities in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19, released on September 30, and credited Ciolek with reporting the flaws.

Since October, Ciolek said he tried multiple times to reach someone at HackerOne to find out when and if he&#39;ll get a payout, or if the IBB program has been paused, despite still being listed as active on the website. All of these inquiries were met with radio silence, according to Ciolek. He&#39;s not some noob either – he&#39;s got some 20 bug disclosures under his belt and earned two payouts from this bounty program last year.

&quot;I submitted the reports to HackerOne on October 30, 2025, as required by the IBB process,&quot; he told The Register. &quot;Since then, I&#39;ve repeatedly tried to get confirmation or an update from HackerOne.&quot;

This includes sending messages via the platform on November 14, November 19, and December 15, he said. He also emailed the official IBB address (ibb@hackerone.com) on December 15, and reached out to an employee on December 22.

&quot;None of these attempts received a response,&quot; Ciolek said. &quot;According to HackerOne&#39;s own IBB page, the last resolved report appears to be from roughly eight months ago.&quot;

On Tuesday, however, he did receive an email from HackerOne thanking him for his patience, confirming the program remains active, and noting his bug reports remain &quot;pending reward processing due to a temporary operational backlog.&quot;

HackerOne told Ciolek it expects to resume its regularly scheduled rewards payout by the end of the first quarter or sooner.

The bug bounty platform did not respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries.

While it looks like Ciolek will receive a monetary award for his time and effort, the lack of communication to researchers still presents a problem.

&quot;Bug bounty programs run on trust and clarity,&quot; Ciolek said. &quot;If a program is paused, defunded, or otherwise inactive, that&#39;s completely understandable – but it needs to be communicated.&quot;

&quot;I want to stress that I don&#39;t do vulnerability research purely for money,&quot; he added. &quot;Most of my findings come without bounties attached. But bounties matter: they help offset the time spent auditing, documenting, and responsibly disclosing issues, and they make it easier for researchers to justify working on open-source projects that don&#39;t otherwise have funding.&quot;

Ciolek also wonders if AI slop is at least partly to blame.

&quot;I suspect platforms are also dealing with increased noise - including low-quality LLM-based or automated submissions,&quot; he said. &quot;But that makes responsiveness to valid, high-signal reports even more important, not less.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The data platform Snowflake is putting Google&#39;s Gemini to work inside its Cortex AI, aiming to give customers access to a foundational model within the boundaries of their data environment across supported clouds, the company told The Register.

Customers use Snowflake to store nearly any operational data, including financial records such as ERP data, CRM records including tickets and transactions, IoT and sensor data, API calls and responses, website user activity, and even content such as PDFs, document files, images, videos, and audio. Cortex AI allows users to pick the model of their choice, now including Gemini, to process that glacier of information using an LLM to get business insights.

“By running Gemini natively in Snowflake, customers can use Gemini models across all supported clouds via cross-region inference, regardless of whether their Snowflake environments run on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud,” Dwarak Rajagopal, VP of AI Engineering and Research at Snowflake, told The Register via email.

Snowflake’s phased rollout is part of its AI model-agnostic strategy, which he said should ensure customers can use best-in-class models across the Cortex stack without re-architecting data or workflows.

“Our philosophy is model choice without compromise – customers shouldn’t have to trade off innovation, governance, or simplicity to use the best models available,” Rajagopal said.

Cortex AI already supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek, Meta, and Mistral. With Cortex AI, users can access those models directly in SQL or via APIs, analyze multimodal data, and then build AI use cases.

While the company is not disclosing pricing, it&#39;s apparently consistent with Snowflake’s “broader consumption model,” Rajagopal said.

“Customers only pay for what they actually use, which lowers risk, encourages innovation, and makes it easier to move AI from experimentation into production with confidence,” he said, adding that Snowflake wants customers to get to work inside the platform “to start small, experiment freely and scale AI usage based on real value” rather than sunk costs.

Snowflake customers can begin using a public preview of Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash through Cortex AI Functions as of Tuesday. Support is coming soon for Snowflake Intelligence and Snowflake Cortex Agents, which customers use to build AI agents that tap into company data. ®

According to Shivan Kaul Sahib, VP of privacy and security for Brave, company software engineers have been able to reduce memory consumption by around 75 percent since the reengineering began last year.

&quot;The upgrade represents roughly 45 MB of memory savings for the Brave browser on every platform (Android, iOS and desktop) by default, and scales even higher for users with additional adblocking lists enabled,&quot; said Sahib in a blog post.

The benefits of reduced memory consumption include improved battery life and smoother multitasking, while also leaving more memory for other applications.

Brave&#39;s initial refactoring effort, as of June 2025, saw the memory footprint shrink from 150 MB to 121 MB. By October 2025, memory usage went from 119 MB to 108 MB. Presently, Brave puts its browser&#39;s memory footprint at 104 MB in version 1.85.118, down from 162 MB in version 1.79.118, released May 2025.

When The Register examined Brave version 1.85.118 under macOS Tahoe (26.1), the browser memory footprint upon reinstallation showed 121 MB in the built-in Task Manager. After fiddling with settings to ensure the browser&#39;s Leo AI assistant was completely disabled and restarting, the footprint dropped to 106 MB.

We note, however, that Brave&#39;s own screenshot shows an increase in the memory footprint of the GPU process, from 52.2 MB to 81.9 MB between the two versions being compared.

&quot;That is unrelated to the adblock engine memory improvements,&quot; Sahib told The Register in an email. &quot;Such fluctuations in browser resource consumption across browser runs are extremely common; even the screenshot doesn&#39;t show exactly 45 MB of memory reduction, it actually shows a bigger decrease!

&quot;Performance measurement is heavily dependent on statistical averaging across multiple runs (which is what our improvement numbers indicate) and we don&#39;t have any evidence of a GPU footprint regression internally.&quot;

Brave has been able to eke out greater memory efficiency by incorporating FlatBuffers, a cross-platform serialization library initially created by Google for game development. It allows access to serialized data without unpacking or parsing – extra steps that add overhead.

&quot;This architectural transition allowed us to move the roughly 100,000 adblock filters shipped by default from standard, heap-allocated Rust data structures (such as Vecs, HashMaps, and structs) into a specialized, zero-copy binary format,&quot; explained Sahib in his post.

Company engineers have also been integrating other improvements like stack-allocated vectors for better memory management, tokenizing common regex patterns for better filter matching performance, resource sharing among adblock engines, and optimized resource memory storage.

Sahib said Brave&#39;s adblock-engine has led to better performance and battery life on mobile devices, pointing to a series of related blog posts.

&quot;The upshot is that blocking ads and trackers significantly improves user experience around page loading since fewer resources have to be downloaded,&quot; he said. &quot;Brave has also built BatteryLab Device Evaluations for browser performance measurement across mobile devices.&quot;

Beyond the performance improvements, Rust has helped make Brave more secure.

&quot;Rust makes entire classes of security and reliability bugs impossible,&quot; said Sahib. &quot;Chromium (and so Brave) follows a Rule of Two for safely handling untrusted input from the Internet, and using a memory-safe language like Rust (for adblocking, or QR code generation) is a great way to increase trust in the safety of the browser.&quot;

Brave is not alone in its affinity for Rust code, popular these days because it manages to perform well while offering memory safety guarantees. Mozilla, where Rust was created, has implemented Rust code in Firefox and more so in its browser engine spin-off project Servo. Google is supporting the use of Rust in Chromium. And Microsoft is applying Rust more broadly.

Brave is also working on a variation of its browser called Brave Origin. It will require a one-time fee (but not on Linux) in exchange for the absence of sponsored images, Brave Rewards, Brave Wallet, Brave VPN, Leo, and telemetry. Security updates will be offered.

Sahib said Brave isn&#39;t yet ready to share a release date for Brave Origin. ®

            <h2>Optimus Schmoptimus - Boston Dynamics' humanoid robot is already in mass production</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/boston_dynamics_atlas_production/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 Remember when Elon Musk predicted that there would be thousands of Optimus robots at Tesla factories by the end of 2025? Well, that didn&#39;t happen, but competitor Boston Dynamics has just announced that its humanoid robot, Atlas, is going to the big time.

Not only is Boston Dynamics beginning commercial production of the final version of Atlas, but it&#39;s also solidified plans to deploy tens of thousands of Atlas units at Hyundai Motor Group manufacturing facilities. Hyundai, Boston Dynamics&#39; majority shareholder, will start with deployment of Atlas at its Robot Metaplant Application Center in the coming months. Boston Dynamics noted that Hyundai&#39;s $26 billion investment in US manufacturing announced last year will also include a robotics factory able to produce 30,000 bots a year, many of which will presumably be Atlas units based on its context in the Atlas press material.

In addition to its planned Hyundai deployments this year, Boston Dynamics also announced a partnership with Google DeepMind at CES that will see the pair working out how to integrate Gemini Robotics AI foundation models into Atlas to, according to Boston Dynamics, &quot;give the robot greater cognitive capabilities.&quot;

Those two commitments mean that all the Atlas units slated for production this year are spoken for, but Boston Dynamics noted it&#39;s planning to add additional customers in early 2027. We asked if Boston Dynamics had any customers lined up for 2027, but it declined to name any.

We&#39;ve known the all-electric, commercial version of Atlas was coming since 2024, when Boston Dynamics retired the old version in favor of a prototype that looks generally like what the robotics leader unveiled at CES this week.

Speaking of 2024, Boston Dynamics seemed to take direct aim at some other humanoid robot manufacturers when it cited its late entry into the game.

&quot;Boston Dynamics only announced its intention to build a commercial humanoid in 2024, after it became clear that recent AI advances had accelerated the pace of how robots could be trained and deployed into real-world applications,&quot; the company said in a press release.

You may recall Tesla AI Day 2021, when Elon Musk embarrassingly trotted out a guy in a morph suit to demonstrate his dream of humanoid robots able to serve as replacements for human labor. By the following year, Optimus hadn&#39;t advanced all that much. Fast-forward to 2025, and Musk was predicting Optimus version 3 prototyped by the end of the year.

Not only did that not happen, but Musk&#39;s claim Tesla would produce 5,000 to 10,000 Optimus robots in 2025 butted up hard against the embarrassing reality that Optimus isn&#39;t only behind the curve, but likely doesn&#39;t have any autonomous capabilities at all.

Atlas, on the other hand, is now in production and has software that allows it to not only be tele-operated via VR or controlled by a tablet, but also lets it function autonomously.

&quot;Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works, and it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children – useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling,&quot; Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said of the Atlas production launch.

The robot has two batteries that it&#39;s able to hot-swap on its own, it&#39;s able to operate in temperatures as low as -4° F to as hot as 104° F (-20° C to 40° C), is IP67 rated, has 56 degrees of freedom, is padded and has minimal pinch points to reduce the risk of injury to humans operating in the same space as it, and was designed with simple components that can be swapped out for field repairs with minimal time and effort.

Atlas is supposedly able to learn autonomously from its environment, and can push its newfound knowledge to other Atlas units in a company&#39;s fleet. Atlas also has 360-degree vision to help it spot people before they get too close to its working space, and is designed to pause whenever it could put a person in danger, then continue its work once they&#39;re clear.

As to it making a leap forward in humanoid robotics with this announcement, Boston Dynamics told us we shouldn&#39;t be surprised.

&quot;Over a decade ago, we were one of the only companies on the planet putting real R&D into humanoid robots. Now it seems like every week a new company pops up with big plans to make humanoids,&quot; a company spokesperson told The Register. &quot;We don’t take it lightly, and if we were going to make a commercial humanoid, we had to be convinced we have a solid plan not only to build something cool, but to build something useful.&quot;

The hydraulic version of Atlas that the company retired in 2024 had been under development since 2013, and by the end of its run, was capable of doing some impressive stunts.

&quot;Our commercialization track record with Spot and Stretch gives us confidence that our commercialization with Atlas will be successful,&quot; the company added, noting that its customers are hungry for new Boston Dynamics robots &quot;because they know what to expect.&quot;

Tesla didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

A custom-designed version of its new CPUs could make Intel-based gaming handhelds a better option this time around.

Intel announced yesterday that it’s developing an entire “handheld gaming platform” powered by its new Panther Lake chips, and joining an increasingly competitive field. Qualcomm is hinting about potential Windows gaming handhelds showing up at the Game Developers Conference in March, and AMD’s new Strix Halo chips could lead to more powerful handhelds.

According to IGN and TechCrunch, sources say Intel is going to compete by developing a custom Intel Core G3 “variant or variants” just for handhelds that could outperform the Arc B390 GPU on the chips it just announced. IGN reports that by using the new 18A process, Intel can cut different die slices, and “spec the chips to offer better performance on the GPU where you want it.”

As for concrete details about the gaming platform, we’re going to have to wait. According to Intel’s Dan Rogers yesterday, the company will have “more news to share on that from our hardware and software partners later this year.” The Intel-based MSI Claw saw a marked improvement when it jumped to Lunar Lake, and hopefully the new platform keeps up that positive trend.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Qira, Lenovo’s biggest AI push yet, is designed to live across Lenovo laptops and Motorola phones.

﻿Qira, Lenovo’s biggest AI push yet, is designed to live across Lenovo laptops and Motorola phones.

While most attention in the AI race is focused on model builders and cloud platforms, Lenovo sits closer to millions of users than most companies. As the world’s top PC maker by volume, Lenovo ships tens of millions of devices every year. What it decides to ship, bundle, and integrate can directly shape how AI shows up in many everyday lives.

That’s what made Lenovo’s announcement today at CES notable. At a flashy event on Tuesday at The Sphere in Las Vegas, it introduced Qira, a system-level, cross-device AI assistant designed to live across Lenovo laptops and Motorola phones. It’s Lenovo’s most ambitious AI effort to date and a rare look at how a hardware giant with global reach is thinking about integrating AI more deeply.

Jeff Snow, Lenovo’s head of AI product, told me how Qira came together, why the company is deliberately avoiding a single exclusive AI partnership, and what he learned from earlier experiments like Moto AI and Microsoft’s Recall debacle.

Qira emerged from a quiet but meaningful internal reorganization less than a year ago, according to Snow. Lenovo pulled AI teams out of individual hardware units such as PCs, tablets, and phones and centralized them into a new software-focused group that works across the entire company.

For a company long optimized around hardware SKUs and supply chains, the move signaled a shift toward putting AI more front and center. “We wanted a built-in cross-device intelligence that works with you throughout the day, learns from your interactions, and can act on your behalf,” Snow said. He mentioned using Qira’s on-device model during his flight to CES to help him workshop how to talk about the news in meetings based on the notes and documents on his PC.

“We wanted a built-in cross-device intelligence that … learns from your interactions and can act on your behalf.”

Qira is not built around a single flagship AI model. Instead, it’s modular. Under the hood, it mixes local, on-device models with cloud-based models, anchored by Microsoft and OpenAI infrastructure accessed through Azure. Stability AI’s diffusion model is also integrated, along with tie-ins to app-specific partners like Notion and Perplexity.

“We didn’t want to hard-code ourselves to one model,” Snow said. “This space is moving too fast. Different tasks need different tradeoffs around performance, quality, and cost.”

That stance runs counter to the push from major AI labs, many of which would happily become the exclusive intelligence layer for a company with Lenovo’s reach. Lenovo’s view is that optionality matters more, especially given its control over one of the largest consumer computing distribution channels in the world.

Snow previously worked on Moto AI, Motorola’s assistant, which he said saw high initial engagement. More than half of Motorola users tried it, but retention wasn’t good. He said that too much of the experience felt like prompt-based chat features people could already get elsewhere.

“That pushed us away from competing with chatbots,” Snow said. “Qira is about things chatbots can’t do, like continuity, context, and acting directly on your device.”

Lenovo also paid close attention to the backlash around Microsoft’s Recall feature. Snow said Qira is designed from the outset with opt-in memory, persistent indicators, and clear user controls. Context ingestion is optional. Recording is visible. Nothing is silently collected.

Cost pressures loom over all of this. Memory prices are rising as AI demand strains supply chains, and analysts expect PC prices to follow. Qira does not raise baseline system requirements for PCs, Snow said, but it performs best on higher-end machines with more RAM. Lenovo is working to bring local models down to smaller memory footprints, like 16 gigabytes of RAM, without watering down the experience.

Strategically, Lenovo sees Qira as both a retention play and a hedge against hardware commoditization. In the short term, it hopes that tighter integration between laptops and phones will nudge customers to stay within the Lenovo ecosystem. Over the longer term, Snow framed Qira as a way to differentiate Lenovo devices when specs alone are no longer enough.

The new SmartPower HDR tech adjusts the voltage to keep laptop displays from draining your battery unnecessarily.

Samsung Display and Intel have teamed up on laptop technology called SmartPower HDR that they claim can minimize power usage while you’re watching HDR content on an OLED screen. Intel showed off this technology last year, but Samsung Display is sharing details about how it works and the power savings you might expect. However, the company didn’t say which laptops may get SmartPower HDR, so it’s still unclear when it will actually be in laptops you can use.

With SmartPower HDR, Samsung Display says the laptop’s chipset monitors the peak brightness of each frame it’s rendering in real-time. Then the OLED panel’s timing controller chip uses that data along with the ratio of active pixels to find the optimal driving voltage for the panel.

For example, general laptop use cases such as web browsing or document editing can operate at lower voltage levels. In contrast, high-definition content such as games or video playback requires higher brightness and voltage. Traditional HDR modes remain locked at maximum brightness, resulting in excessive power usage even in standard scenarios. As a result, many laptops default to SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) mode despite the color and brightness advantages of HDR.

In comparison, SmartPower HDR™ reduces the power consumption associated with OLED pixel emission by up to 22% in general usage and by up to 17% during HDR content. Notably, in general usage scenarios, power consumption is comparable to that of SDR mode.

The Moto Watch stands out with up to 13 days of battery life, open-source software, and Polar-powered dual-frequency GPS.

At CES, Motorola announced its latest smartwatch, the Moto Watch. According to Motorola, the Android watch offers up to 13 days of battery life, alongside Polar-powered health tracking, open-source software, and dual-frequency GPS — a combination that helps set it apart from Apple’s and Google’s flagship wearables.

Battery life is easily its most notable feature. Motorola says the 47mm watch can last up to 13 days on a single charge, or around seven days with the always-on OLED display enabled. If those claims hold up, it would put the Moto Watch well ahead of rivals like the Apple Watch Series 11, Google Pixel Watch 4, and even Fitbit’s Charge 6, which typically last a day or two with always-on displays turned on.

Motorola is also taking a different approach to health and fitness by partnering with Polar, the company behind the world’s first wireless heart rate monitor. Through Polar, the Moto Watch offers dual-frequency GPS, which should result in more accurate location and distance tracking outdoors — a feature more commonly found on sport-focused watches. While Google recently added it to the Pixel Watch 4, it’s still missing from the Apple Watch Series 11.

On the tracking front, the Moto Watch covers familiar fitness basics like steps, distance, continuous heart rate, and sleep tracking, while adding extra context around those metrics. Features like Nightly Recharge look at how your body handled stress overnight and suggest whether you should take it easy the next day or push harder. Activity Score shows how intense or effective a workout was compared to your goals, while Smart Calories break down how much energy you burned during workouts and across the day — including the types of energy your body relied on. You also get wellness tools like hydration and medication reminders.

Software is another key differentiator. Unlike most Android-compatible smartwatches, the Moto Watch doesn’t run Wear OS. Instead, it relies on open-source software, though Motorola hasn’t yet shared many details about what that experience looks like in practice.

Durability is another area where the Moto Watch stands out: it carries an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, putting it on par with the Pixel Watch 4 and giving it an edge over the Apple Watch Series 11 for outdoor use.

The Moto Watch also offers all the smartwatch essentials. You can take calls directly from your wrist thanks to a built-in microphone and speaker, receive notifications over Bluetooth, and store music offline.

The wearable is set to arrive on January 22nd. Motorola hasn’t shared pricing yet, but we’ve reached out and will update when we hear more.

Correction, January 6th: An earlier version of this story misstated that this is Motorola’s first smartwatch. It is its latest smartwatch, not first.

The auto-opening ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist is actually coming out.

At CES 2026, Lenovo is announcing a new ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist laptop. Once a concept, the 14-inch thin-and-light sports a motorized pivoting hinge, allowing it to twist and angle its screen toward you. It can be manually controlled, but the real trick is tracking your head and automatically adjusting to your position or posture. It can follow you around a portion of a room while giving a presentation, and you can knock on its closed lid to have it automatically open.

The Auto Twist will also have an emoji-like AI companion software that reminds me of GERTY from the 2009 sci-fi movie Moon, turning to follow you and react to your actions. I saw a brief demo of it, and it seemed cute when it waved with its little hands or put on sunglasses. But it was slow to load and seemed awkward to use after the novelty wears off. The Auto Twist also supports live language translation, turning the screen back and forth to each speaker.

As for the conventional laptop stuff, the Auto Twist’s screen is a 2880 x 1800 / 120Hz OLED touchscreen with stylus support, it weighs 3.09 pounds / 1.4 kg, and it’s packing Intel Panther Lake chips. It’s set to launch in June with a starting price of $1,649.

Accompanying it is the Yoga Slim 7i Ultra, Lenovo’s slimmest and lightest Yoga.

Lenovo’s new pair of Yoga laptops for CES 2026 are its most powerful and most lightweight models. The flagship Yoga Pro 9i is a creator-focused laptop with a 16-inch 4K tandem OLED reaching 1,600 peak nits of brightness, Intel Panther Lake processor options, and up to an RTX 5070 for a discrete GPU. It also includes a Yoga Pen Gen 2 stylus that can magnetically attach to the lid, either on its own or in its protective case. The pen can be used on the screen or on the trackpad.

The new Yoga Pro 9i Aura Edition will start at $1,899.99 when it launches in Q2 2026.

The new Lenovo Yoga 7i Slim Ultra Aura Edition is also expected in Q2 2026, starting at $1,499.99. It’s also got Intel Panther Lake chips, but the main appeal of this 14-inch is how thin and light it is. It weighs just 2.15 pounds / 975 grams, and it’s just 0.55 inches / 13.9 mm thick. Its 2880 x 1800 / 120Hz OLED isn’t as bright as the Yoga Pro 9i, but with 1,100 nits of peak brightness, it’s no slouch. It doesn’t feature any USB-A ports, but as a trade-off it’s got three Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C ports.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Water shortages in Southern California made an indelible impression on Evelyn Wang ’00 when she was growing up in Los Angeles. “I was quite young, perhaps in first grade,” she says. “But I remember we weren’t allowed to turn our sprinklers on. And everyone in the neighborhood was given disinfectant tablets for the toilet and encouraged to keep flushing to a minimum. I didn’t understand exactly what was happening. But I saw that everyone in the community was affected by the scarcity of this resource.”

Today, as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities around the world, Wang is leading MIT’s effort to tackle the interlinked challenges of a changing climate and a burgeoning global demand for energy. Last April, after wrapping up a two-year stint directing the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E), she returned to the campus where she’d been both an undergraduate and a faculty member to become the inaugural vice president for energy and climate.

“The accelerating problem of climate change and its countless impacts represent the greatest scientific, technical, and policy challenge of this or any age,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a January 2025 letter to the MIT community announcing the appointment. “We are tremendously fortunate that Evelyn Wang has agreed to lead this crucial work.”

MIT has studied and worked on problems of climate and energy for decades. In recent years, with temperatures rising, storms strengthening, and energy demands surging, that work has expanded and intensified, spawning myriad research projects, policy proposals, papers, and startups. The challenges are so urgent that MIT launched several Institute-wide initiatives, including President Rafael Reif’s Climate Grand Challenges (2020) and President Kornbluth’s Climate Project (2024).

But Kornbluth has argued that MIT needs to do even more. Her creation of the new VP-level post that Wang now holds underscores that commitment.

Wang is well suited for the role. The Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT and former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, she joined the faculty in 2007, shortly after she completed her PhD at Stanford University. Her research centers on thermal management and energy conversion and storage, but she also works on nano-engineered surfaces and materials, as well as water harvesting and purification. Wang and her colleagues have produced a device based on nanophotonic crystals that could double the efficiency of solar cells—one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017. And the device she invented with Nobel laureate Omar Yaghi for extracting water from very dry air was named one of 2017’s top 10 emerging technologies by Scientific American and the World Economic Forum, and in 2018 earned her the Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water. (See story on this water harvesting research in the January/February issue of MIT Technology Review.)

Wang has a deep knowledge of the Institute—and even deeper roots here. (See “Family Ties,” MIT Alumni News, March/April 2015.) Her parents met at MIT as PhD students from Taiwan in the 1960s; they were married in the MIT chapel. When Wang arrived at MIT in 1996 as a first-year student, her brother Alex ’96, MEng ’97, had just graduated and was working on a master’s degree in electrical engineering. Her other brother, Ben, would earn his PhD at MIT in 2007. She even met her husband, Russell Sammon ’98, at MIT. Apart from her time at ARPA-E, a very brief stint at Bell Labs, and sabbatical work at Google, she has spent her entire professional career at the Institute. So she has a rare perspective on the resources MIT can draw on to respond to the climate and energy challenge.

“The beating heart of MIT is innovation,” she says. “We are innovators. And innovation is something that will help us leapfrog some of the potential hurdles as we work toward climate and energy solutions. Our ability to innovate can enable us to move closer toward energy security, toward sustainable resource development and use.”

The prevailing innovative mindset at MIT is backed by a deep desire to tackle the problem.Many people on campus are passionate about climate and energy, says Wang. “That is why President Kornbluth made this her flagship initiative. We are fortunate to have so many talented students and faculty, and to be able to rely on our infrastructure. I know they will all step up to meet the challenges.” But she is quick to point out that the problems are too large for any one entity—including MIT—to address on its own. So she’s aiming to encourage more collaboration both among MIT researchers and with other institutions.

“If we want to solve this problem of climate change, if we want to change the trajectory in the next decade, we cannot continue to do business as usual,” she says. “That is what is most exciting about this problem and, frankly, is why I came back to campus to take this job.”

The coupling of climate and energy in Wang’s portfolio is strategic. “Energy and climate are two sides of the same coin,” she explains. “A major reason we are seeing climate change is that we haven’t deployed solutions at a scale necessary to mitigate the CO2 emissions from the energy sector. The ways we generate energy and manage emissions are fundamental to any strategy addressing climate change. At the same time, the world demands more and more energy—a demand we can’t possibly meet through a single means.”

“Zero-emissions and low-carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate … We need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

What’s more, she contends that switching from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, while fundamental, is only part of the solution. “Zero-emissions and low-­carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate,” she says. “We need to consider the environmental impacts of these new fuels we develop and deploy. We need to use data analysis to move goods and energy more efficiently and intelligently. We need to consider raising more of our food in water and using food by-products and waste to help sequester carbon. In short, we need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

That challenge seems destined to grow more daunting in the coming years. There are still, Wang observes, areas of “energy poverty”—places where people cannot access sufficient energy to sustain their well-being. But solving that problem will only drive up energy production and consumption worldwide. The explosive growth of AI will likely do the same, since the huge data centers that power the technology require enormous quantities of energy for both computation and cooling.

Wang believes that while AI will continue to drive electricity demand, it can also contribute to creating a more sustainable future.“We can use AI to develop climate and energy solutions,” she says. “AI can play a primary role in solution sets, can give us new and improved ways to manage intermittent loads in the energy grid. It can help us develop new catalysts and chemicals or help us stabilize the plasma we’ll use in nuclear fusion. It could augment climate and geospatial modeling that would allow us to predict the impact of potential climate solutions before we implement them. We could even use AI to reduce computational needs and thereby ease cooling demand.”

MIT was humming with climate and energy research long before Wang returned to campus in 2025 after wrapping up her work at ARPA-E. Almost 400 researchers across 90% of MIT’s departments responded to President Reif’s 2020 Climate Grand Challenges initiative. The Institute awarded $2.7 million to 27 finalist teams and identified five flagship projects, including one to create an early warning system to help mitigate the impact of climate disasters, another to predict and prepare for extreme weather events, and an ambitious project to slash nearly half of all industrial carbon emissions.

About 250 MIT faculty and senior researchers are now involved in the Climate Project at MIT, a campus-wide initiative launched in 2024 that works to generate and implement climate solutions, tools, and policy proposals. Conceived to bolster MIT’s already significant efforts as a leading source of technological, behavioral, and policy solutions to global climate issues, the Climate Project has identified six “missions”: decarbonizing energy and industry; preserving the atmosphere, land, and oceans; empowering frontline community action; designing resilient and prosperous cities; enabling new policy approaches; and wild cards, a catch-all category that supports development of unconventional solutions outside the scope of the other missions. Faculty members direct each mission.

With so much climate research already underway,a large part of Wang’s new role is to support and deepen existing projects. But to fully tap into MIT’s unique capabilities, she says, she’s aiming to foster some cultural shifts. And that begins with identifying ways to facilitate cooperation—both across the Institute and with external partners—on a scale that can make “something truly transformational” happen, she says. “At this stage, with the challenges we face in energy and climate, we need to do something ambitious.”

In Wang’s view, getting big results depends on taking a big-picture, holistic approach that will require unprecedented levels of collaboration. “MIT faculty have always treasured their independence and autonomy,” she says. “Traditionally, we’ve tried to let 1,000 flowers bloom. And traditionally we’ve done that well, often with outstanding results. But climate and energy are systems problems, which means we need to create a systems solution. How do we bring these diverse faculty together? How do we align their efforts, not just in technology, but also in policy, science, finance, and social sciences?”

To encourage MIT faculty to collaborate across departments, schools, and disciplines, Wang recently announced that the MIT Climate Project would award grants of $50,000 to $250,000 to collaborative faculty teams that work on six- to 24-month climate research projects. Student teams are invited to apply for research grants of up to $15,000.“We can’t afford to work in silos,” she says. “People from wildly diverse fields are working on the same problems and speaking different professional languages. We need to bring people together in an integrative way so we can attack the problem holistically.”

Wang also wants colleagues to reach beyond campus. MIT, she says, needs to form real, defined partnerships with other universities, as well as with industries, investors, and philanthropists. “This isn’t just an MIT problem,” she says. “Individual efforts and 1,000 flowers alone will not be enough to meet these challenges.”

Thinking holistically—and in terms of systems—will help focus efforts on the areas that will have the greatest impact. At a Climate Project presentation in October, Wang outlined an approach that would focus on building well-being within communities. This will begin with efforts to empower communities by developing coastal resilience, to decarbonize ports and shipping, and to design and build data centers that integrate smoothly and sustainably with nearby communities. She encouraged her colleagues to think in terms of big-picture solutions for the future and then to work on the components needed to build that future.

“As researchers, we sometimes jump to a solution before we have fully defined the problem,” she explains. “Let’s take the problem of decarbonization in transportation. The solution we’ve come up with is to electrify our vehicles. When we run up against the problem of the range of these vehicles, our first thought is to create higher-density batteries. But the real problem we’re facing isn’t about batteries. It’s about increasing the range of these vehicles. And the solution to that problem isn’t necessarily a more powerful battery.”

“Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom … The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing?”

Wang is confident that her MIT colleagues have both the capacity and the desire to embrace the holistic approach she envisions. “When I was accepted to MIT as an undergraduate and visited the campus, the thing that made me certain I wanted to enroll here was the people,” she recalls. “They weren’t just talented. They had so many different interests. They were passionate about solving big problems. And they were eager to learn from one another. That spirit hasn’t changed. And that’s the spirit I and my team can tap into.”

Wang believes MIT and other institutions working on climate and energy solutions also need to change how we talk about the challenge. “Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom,” she says. “The underlying issue here is our well-being. That’s what we care about, not the climate. The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing? How can we create conditions of resilience, sustainability, and prosperity? That is the framework I would like us to build on.” For example, in areas where extreme weather threatens homes or rising temperatures are harming human health, we should be developing affordable technologies that make dwellings more resilient and keep people cooler.

Wang’s colleagues at MIT concur with her assessment of the mission ahead. They also have a deep respect for her scholarship and leadership. “I couldn’t think of a better person to represent MIT’s diverse and powerful ability to attack climate,” says Susan Solomon, the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies at MIT and recipient of the US National Medal of Science for her work on the Antarctic ozone hole. “Communicating MIT’s capabilities to provide what the nation needs—not only in engineering but also in … economics, the physical, chemical, and biological sciences, and much more—is an immense challenge.” But she’s confident that Wang will do it justice. “Evelyn is a consummate storyteller,” she says.

“She’s tremendously quick at learning new fields and driving toward what the real nuggets are that need to be addressed in solving hard problems,” says Elsa Olivetti, PhD ’07, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering and director of the MIT Climate Project’s Decarbonizing Energy and Industry mission. “Her direct, meticulous thinking and leadership style mean that she can focus teams within her office to do the work that will be most impactful at scale.”

Wang’s experience at ARPA-E is expected to be especially useful. “The current geopolitical situation and the limited amount of research funding available relative to the scale of the climate problem pose formidable challenges to bringing MIT’s strengths to bear on the problem,” says Rohit Karnik, director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) and a collaborator with Wang on numerous projects and initiatives since both joined the mechanical engineering faculty in 2007. “Evelyn’s leadership experience at MIT and in government, her ability to take a complex situation and define a clear vision, and her passion to make a difference will serve her well in her new role.”

Wang’s new MIT appointment is seen as a good thing beyond the Institute as well. “A role like this requires a skill set that is difficult to find in one individual,” says Krista Walton, vice chancellor for research and innovation at North Carolina State University. Walton and Wang collaborated on multiple projects, including the DARPA work that produced the device for extracting water from very dry air based on the original prototype Wang co-developed. “You need scientific depth, an understanding of the federal and global landscape, a collaborative instinct and the ability to be a convener, and a strategic vision,” Walton says—and she can’t imagine a better pick for the job.

“Evelyn has an extraordinary ability to bridge fundamental science with real-world application,” she says. “She approaches collaboration as a true partnership and not as a transaction.”

Climate scientists explore broad swaths of time, tracking trends in temperature, greenhouse gases, volcanic activity, vegetation, and more across hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years. Even average temperatures and precipitation levels are calculated over periods of three decades.

But in the realm of politics, change happens much faster, prompting sudden and sometimes startling shifts in culture and policy. The current US administration has proposed widespread budget cuts in climate and energy research. These have included slicing more than $1.5 billion from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), canceling multiple climate-related missions at NASA, and shuttering the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the agency responsible for publishing the National Climate Assessment. The Trump administration submitted a budget request that would cut the National Science Foundation budget from more than $9 billion to just over $4 billion for 2026. The New York Times reported that NSF grant funding for STEM education from January through mid-May 2025 was down 80% from its 10-year average, while NSF grant awards for math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and materials science research were down 67%. In September, the US Department of Energy announced it had terminated 223 projects that “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Among the agencies affected is ARPA-E, the agency Wang directed before returning to MIT. Meanwhile, MIT research programs that rely on government sources of funding will also feel the impact of the cuts.

Acknowledging the difficulties she and MIT may face in the present moment, Wang still prefers to look forward. “Of course this is a challenging time,” she says. “There are near-term challenges and long-term challenges. We need to focus on those long-term challenges. As President Kornbluth has said, we need to continue to advocate for research and education. We need to pursue long-term solutions, to follow our convictions in addressing problems in energy and climate. And we need to be ready to seize the opportunities that reside in these long-term challenges.”

Wang also sees openings for short-term collaboration—areas where MIT and the current administration can find common ground and goals. “There is still a huge area of opportunity for us to align our interests with those of this administration,” she says. “We can move the needle forward together on energy, on national security, on minerals, on economic competitiveness. All these are interests we share, and there are pathways we can follow to meet these challenges to our nation together. MIT is a major force in the nuclear space, in both fission and fusion. These, along with geothermal, could provide the power base we need to meet our energy demands. There are significant opportunities for partnerships with this or any administration to unlock some of these innovations and implement them.”

While she views herself as a researcher and an academic, Wang’s relevant government experience should prove especially useful in her VP role at MIT. In her two years as director of ARPA-E, she coordinated a broad array of the US Department of Energy’s early-stage research and development in energy generation, storage, and use. “I think I had the best job in government,” she says. Designed to operate at arm’s length from the Department of Energy, ARPA-E searches for high-risk, high-reward energy innovation projects. “More than one observer has called ARPA-E a moonshot factory,” she says.

Seeking out and facilitating “moonshot”-­worthy projects at a national and sometimes global scale gave Wang a broader lens through which to view issues of energy and climate. It also taught her that big ideas do not translate into big solutions automatically. “I learned what it takes to make an impact on energy technology at ARPA-E and I will be forever grateful,” she says. “I saw how game-changing ideas can take a decade to go from concept to deployment. I learned to appreciate the diversity of talent and innovation in the national ecosystem composed of laboratories, startups, and institutions. I saw how that ecosystem could zero in to identify real problems, envision diverse pathways, and create prototypes. And I also saw just how hard that journey is.”

MIT researchers are tackling climate and energy issues from multiple angles, working on everything from decarbonizing energy and industry to designing resilient and prosperous cities. Find out more at climateproject.mit.edu.

While MIT is already an important element in that ecosystem, Wang and her colleagues want the Institute to play an even more prominent role. “We can be a convener and collaborator, first across all of MIT’s departments, and then with industry, the financial world, and governments,” she says. “We need to do aggressive outreach and find like-minded partners.”

“Although the problems of climate and climate change are global, the most effective way MIT can address them is locally,” said Wang at the October presentation of the MIT Climate Project. “Working across schools and disciplines, collaborating with external partners, we will develop targeted solutions for individual places and communities—solutions that can then serve as templates for other places and communities.” But she also cautions against one-size-fits-all solutions. “Solar panels, for example, work wonderfully, but only in areas that have sufficient space and sunlight,” she explains. “Institutions like MIT can showcase a diversity of approaches and determine the best approach for each individual context.”

Most of all, Wang wants her colleagues to be proactive. “Because MIT is a factory of ideas, perhaps even a moonshot factory, we need to think boldly and continue to think boldly so we can make an impact as soon as possible,” she says. She also wants her colleagues to stay hopeful and not feel daunted by a challenge that can at times feel overwhelming. “We will build pilots, one at a time, and demonstrate that these projects are not only possible but practical,” she says. “And that is how we will build a future everyone wants to live in.”

            <div id="article-text">Few people, if any, contemplate stars—celestial or cinematic—the way Aomawa Shields does.

An astronomer and astrobiologist, Shields explores the potential habitability of planets beyond our solar system. But she is also a classically trained actor—and that’s helped shape her professional trajectory in unexpected ways.

Today, Shields is an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine, where she oversees a research team that uses computer models to explore conditions on exoplanets, or planets that revolve around stars other than the sun. But while searching for life many light-years away is her day job, creative endeavors round out her purpose on Earth.

In 2023 Shields published a memoir, Life on Other Planets: A Memoir of Finding My Place in the Universe. She has started an influential educational program that encourages young girls to explore space, given a hugely popular TED Talk about how we’ll find life on other planets, and won a string of prestigious academic awards, honors, and grants. She also plays the violin, cooks, practices yoga, and is a mom. And as what she calls a “rest leader”—a professional proponent of slowing down—Shields has somehow managed the seemingly impossible: She makes time.

Her unorthodox path began on the screen, in the realm of make-believe.

“I wanted to become an astronaut. That dream started very early in my life, at the age of 12, after seeing a movie that dramatized kids getting launched into space,” she says, referring to SpaceCamp, an ’80s kids’ comedy about an accidental space shuttle flight.

The next bit of cinematic inspiration cemented her interest.

“Charlotte Blackwood was an astrophysicist, and she was very glamorous, too,” Shields says, smiling at how she was captivated by the heroine in Top Gun. “There’s an iconic scene where she’s walking down the aisle between Tom Cruise and other pilot trainees, and she just kind of whips off her glasses and just looks like such a badass.”

A high-achieving student while growing up in California, Canada, and Massachusetts, Shields made her way to Phillips Exeter Academy, in large part drawn by its state-of-the-art astronomical observatory. Once there, she got pulled into acting in a serious way. “Enter a new dream,” she says.

Throughout high school her astronomy and acting aspirations “kind of danced beside each other,” Shields remembers. “But I held firm to the first one and went to MIT because I understood that it’s the best science school in the country. I learned that at the age of 12—that’s where I’m going to go.”

At MIT, Shields struggled academically at first and took refuge in the creative arts. She was chosen to participate in the Burchard Scholars Program, whose monthly dinner seminars bring faculty members together with students who excel in the arts, social sciences, and humanities. She sang in the a cappella group the Muses and performed in lots of plays. At the end of her senior year, she found herself wondering: “Do I go to grad school in acting or astronomy?”

“There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD.”

The latter won out, but not for long. Shields headed to a graduate program in astronomy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “During that year, I had a white male professor tell me to consider other career options, and that was hard to hear,” she says. She remembers thinking, “I’m going to the other dream because clearly someone’s telling me that I don’t belong here. Maybe they’re right.”

So she applied to UCLA, where she got an MFA in acting, leaving astronomy for more than a decade. But then, when Shields was working odd jobs to supplement her acting gigs, a mentor from her undergraduate years encouraged her to look on a Caltech-operated job website. She saw an opening for a help desk operator at the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that is particularly adept at viewing the formation of young stars—and it only required a bachelor’s degree. “I’d refer the harder questions to the PhDs,” she says. “But by taking that job, I got to go to astronomy talks again … This field of exoplanets had just exploded during the time I’d been away.”

Shields had some success in acting, including a part in a film called Nine Lives, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. But a big break—and then heartbreak—came after she was cast as the host of the show Wired Science, only to lose the job when the producers decided to change presenters. It was a “devastating moment,” she says.

Soon after, she emailed the astrophysicist and science communications luminary Neil deGrasse Tyson, whom she’d been introduced to over email by an astronomer working with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and relayed what had happened. He replied that he’d seen her in the pilot and told her that “without a PhD you don’t have that street cred if you want to do science television,” she recalls. Meanwhile, she had applied to NASA’s astronaut candidate program but didn’t make it past the first level. (She did, however, get to play an astronaut in a recent Toyota ad.) “There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD,” she says. So she did, earning her doctorate in astronomy and astrobiology in 2014 from the University of Washington.

Astrobiology, Shields explains, is a relatively new field that studies the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe: “It’s about how life got started on Earth.”

Astrobiologists might focus on the habitability of planets, or on methods for exploring life on other planets, or on liquids other than water that could support life. It’s a highly interdisciplinary field. “There are astronomers that are looking for these planets and are using their particular field of expertise to answer that question: Are we alone?” Shields explains. Some of them are “also chemists and biologists and oceanographers and geologists who tackle these questions from their own lens and specific area of expertise,” she says. “That’s why I love it. As an astrobiologist, we don’t have to get 15 PhDs. We get to collaborate with people in different departments who lend their own expertise … on those science questions.”

Shields is trying to answer a question sparked by the night sky—one that’s deeply personal yet universal in both the astronomical and the colloquial sense. “Ever since I was a little girl, I would look up at the sky and wonder what was out there,” she says. “It comes from a sense of wonder for me. I still have that feeling when I look up at the night sky and I see these little pinpoints of light. I wonder: Is there anyone looking back at me? … How far does space go?”

There are, she explains, 100 billion stars in our galaxy, most orbited by at least one planet, and over 100 billion galaxies beyond ours. That’s about 1022 stars in the universe. The likelihood that only Earth was able to produce life “I think is pretty low,” Shields says.

“I’m looking for planetary environments that could be conducive to life beyond Earth,” she says. “And my team does that largely using climate models. These are the same kinds of models that can predict climate and weather on Earth.”

Shields plugs information gathered by observational astronomers into such models, along with different potential combinations of other, unknown variables—like the type of light a planet receives from its host star, the composition of its atmosphere and surface, and certain orbital information. “There’s only so much that you can really tell about a planet from the telescope information that you get,” she explains. “We can explore that parameter space with climate models and say: Okay, if it has this surface composition, this is what the temperature would be like on this planet. If it has this atmospheric composition, this type of orbit, this is what the climate would be like, and this is how habitable it would be across its surface.”

Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered 6,000 exoplanets. Shields says those in Earth’s size range—in which she’s most interested—number in the hundreds. A smaller subset of those are orbiting in what’s called the “habitable zone” of their star, creating warm enough conditions to maintain water in liquid form—the key to life. So far, as many as 100 or so planets that fall into that category have been identified, but the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, could find even more potentially habitable planets by detecting “biosignatures” suggesting a biological presence, such as particular gases in their atmospheres or glints that might be reflections of water on the planetary surface.

Being able to detect more of these sorts of signals, Shields says, is the next “big mission” in astronomy.

Today, in her academic work, her mind hurtles to the farthest reaches of the universe. But in her precious hours outside of academia, she has learned to be still. When her work schedule started to overwhelm her, Shields’s health began to suffer. Then she discovered the practice of yoga nidra—an ancient form of meditation in which practitioners are guided into a deeply restful “yogic sleep.” Shields read the book Do Less: A Revolutionary Approach to Time and Energy Management for Ambitious Women, which claims that 20 or 30 minutes of yoga nidra “feels like three hours of sleep in your body,” she says. “And as the mother of a young child, I was like: Okay, sign me up!”

Last year she trained with Karen Brody, author of Daring to Rest: Reclaim Your Power with Yoga Nidra Rest Meditation, and became a certified facilitator. “It’s been important to me to share it broadly and to really try to do my part to introduce the culture of academia, in particular, to this notion of resting as a daily practice,” she says. Now she’s at work on a book about her attempt to moderate—to resist the temptation to take on too much. She has learned to decline invitations and put firm boundaries between her work and personal life.

Shields has realized that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Combining them makes her a more effective educator.

On a weekday in August, an ayurvedic soup simmers on her kitchen stove. A music stand occupies the corner of a room where she sometimes picks up her violin and plays fiddle tunes. (Her parents, both professional musicians, derived her name from a chant of vowel sounds they made up.) She mentions the poem “swim | women of color”by Nayyirah Waheed and recites it in a soft, rich voice. Part of it goes: “This structure counts on your inability to say no. mean no. they take no from our first breath. go back and return it to your mouth. your heart. your light.”

“I need to graciously let go or say no—make room for someone else to say yes,” Shields says. “That allows me to have more spaciousness in my schedule, because one thing I’ve discovered is that women of color, as we proceed up the academic ladder, the requests just exponentially increase, and so saying no is not simply an important skill—it’s a survival skill.”

Along the way, Shields has come to realize that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. In fact, combining them—and sharing her passion for both—makes her a more effective educator. Her training as an actor helps her craft lectures that keep students engaged and animates her presentations, including her TED Talk, in a way that resonates with nonscientists.

Shields is also tapping into her love of acting to inspire the next generation of scientists who will help answer astronomy’s big questions. As part of a postdoctoral fellowship through the National Science Foundation, she was asked to design an educational outreach component. “I was like: Is there a scenario in which I could use acting to teach astronomy?” she says. “And I looked it up. There was precedent for that. Astronomy education journals had shown that when you involve girls in creative arts—theater, writing—and you incorporate that into astronomy education, you increase girls’ confidence in both asking and answering questions.”

The finding resonated with her own experience. After all, it was acting—which she turned to when her professor discouraged her from studying astronomy—that gave her the confidence to pursue astronomy again. “I looked at acting as this outlet, this safe space,” she says. “Nobody could tell me that I was wrong as an actor.”

With that in mind, Shields launched Rising Stargirls, which holds workshops using the creative arts to teach astronomy to ­middle-school-aged girls of all backgrounds. She and her colleagues have since published a study showing that girls who attended the program reported being more excited to take science classes and were more likely to believe they could do well in science.

“We want them to know that who they are is inherently pivotal and critical to their study and practice of astronomy,” Shields says. “The sciences are incredibly creative, and they get to bring that creative imagination and creative inspiration they find through the arts into learning about the universe.”

That same exchange has played out in Shields’s life, but it’s only recently that she’s come to see similarities between her roles as an astronomer and an actor. “They’re both about story,” she says.

Actors have to convey the arc or evolution of a story through the lives of their characters. “Stars, ­planets—they have lives, too,” Shields says. “They have births, they have evolution, and they die. It’s my job as a scientist to unveil the story—to discover the story of whether there’s life elsewhere.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since nuclear fusion was discovered in the 1930s, scientists have wondered if we could somehow replicate and harness the phenomenon behind starlight—the smashing together of hydrogen atoms to form helium and a stupendous amount of clean energy. Fusing hydrogen would yield 200 million times more energy than simply burning it. Unlike nuclear fission, which powers the world’s 440 atomic reactors, hydrogen fusion produces no harmful radiation, only neutrons that are captured and added back to the reaction. Instead of radioactive wastes with long, lethal half-lives, fusion’s by-product is helium, the most stable element—and a year’s worth from a fusion plant wouldn’t supply a party balloon business.

Dennis Whyte’s part in the fusion quest began in graduate school, in a lab belonging to the electric utility Hydro-Québec, just outside Montreal. There he was shown a device built to replicate stellar fusion on an earthly scale. It was a doughnut-shaped hollow chamber, big enough for a lanky physicist like him to stand inside, based on a design conceived in 1950 by the future Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov, who also developed hydrogen bombs for the Soviet Union. It was called a tokamak, a word derived from a Russian phrase meaning “ring-shaped chamber with magnetic coils.”

The idea is straightforward: Fill the doughnut with hydrogen gas, and then heat that gas until it turns to electrically charged plasma. In this ionic state, plasma would be held in place by magnets positioned around the tokamak. Achieving fusion on Earth without the immense pressure of a star’s interior, scientists calculated, would require temperatures nearly 10 times hotter than our sun’s center—around 100 million degrees Celsius. So the trick would be to suspend the hot plasma so perfectly in a surrounding magnetic field that it wouldn’t touch inner surfaces of the chamber. Such contact would instantly cool it, stopping the fusion reaction.

The good part about that was safety. In a failure, a fusion power plant wouldn’t melt down—just the opposite. The bad part was that gaseous plasma wasn’t very cooperative—any slight irregularity in the chamber walls could cause destabilizing turbulence. But the concept was so tantalizing that by the mid-1980s, 75 universities and governmental institutes around the world had tokamaks. If anyone could get fusion—the most energy-dense reaction in the universe—to work, the deuterium in a liter of seawater could meet one person’s electricity needs for a year. It would be, effectively, a limitless resource.

Besides turbulence, there were two other big obstacles. The magnets surrounding the plasma needed to be really powerful—meaning really big. In 1986, 35 nations representing half the world’s population—including the US, China, India, Japan, what is now the entire European Union, South Korea, and Russia—agreed to jointly build the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, a $40 billion giant tokamak in southern France. Standing 100 feet tall on a 180-acre site, ITER (the acronym also formed the Latin word for “journey”) is equipped with 18 magnets weighing 360 tons apiece, made from the best superconductors then available. If it works, ITER will produce 500 megawatts of electricity—but not before 2035, if then. It’s still under construction. The second obstacle is the biggest: Many tokamaks have briefly achieved fusion, but doing so always took more energy than they produced.

After earning his doctorate in 1992, Whyte worked on an ITER prototype at San Diego’s National Fusion Facility, taught at the University of Wisconsin, and in 2006 was hired by MIT. By then, he understood how huge the stakes were, and how life-changing commercial-scale fusion energy could be—if it could be sustained, and if it could be produced affordably.

MIT had been trying since 1969. The red brick buildings of its Plasma Science and Fusion Center, where Whyte came to work, had originally housed the National Biscuit Company. PSFC’s sixth tokamak, Alcator C-Mod, built in 1991, was in Nabisco’s old Oreo cookie factory. C-Mod’s magnets were coiled with copper to serve as a conductor (think of how copper wire wrapped around a nail and connected to a battery turns it into an electromagnet). Before C-Mod was finally decommissioned, its magnetic fields, 160,000 times stronger than Earth’s, set the world record for the highest plasma pressure in a tokamak.

As Ohm’s law describes, however, metals like copper have internal resistance, so it could run for only four seconds before overheating—and needed more energy to ignite its fusion reactions than what came out of it. Like the now 160 similar tokamaks around the world, C-Mod was an interesting science experiment but mainly reinforced the joke that fusion energy was 20 years away and always would be.

Each year, Whyte had challenged PhD students in his fusion design classes to conjure something just as compact as C-Mod, one-800th the scale of ITER, that could achieve and sustain fusion—with an energy gain. But in 2013, as he neared 50, he increasingly had doubts. He’d devoted his career to the fusion dream, but unless something radically changed, he feared it wouldn’t happen in his lifetime.

The US Department of Energy decided to scale back on fusion. It informed MIT that funding for Alcator C-Mod would end in 2016. So Whyte decided he would either quit fusion and do something else or try something different to get there faster.

There was a new generation of ceramic “high-temperature” superconductors, not available when ITER’s huge magnets were being wrapped in metallic superconducting cable, which has to be chilled to 4 kelvin above absolute zero (–452.47 °F) for its resistance to current to fall to zero. Discovered accidentally in 1986 in a Swiss lab, the new ceramic superconductors still needed to be cooled to 20 K (–423.7 °F). But with far smaller power requirements, their output was so much greater that a year later the discoverers won a Nobel Prize.

The potential applications were limitless, but because ceramic is so brittle, coiling it around electromagnets wasn’t feasible. Then one day Whyte ran into research scientist Leslie Bromberg ’73, PhD ’77, in the hallway holding a fistful of what resembled unspooled tape from a VCR cassette. “What’s all that?” he asked.

“Superconducting tape, new stuff.” The filmy strips were coated with ceramic crystals of rare-earth barium copper oxide. “It’s called ReBCO,” Bromberg said.

ReBCO’s rare-earth component, yttrium, is 400 times more common than silver. Could superconducting tape, Whyte immediately wondered, be wound like copper wire to make much smaller but far more powerful magnets?

The class met in a windowless room in a former Nabisco cracker factory, surrounded by blackboards.

He assigned his 2013 fusion design class to see. If the students managed to double the strength of a magnetic field surrounding hot plasma, he knew, they might multiply fusion’s power density sixteenfold. They came up with an eye-­opening design they called Vulcan. It yielded five peer-reviewed papers—but whether layers of wound ReBCO tape could stand the stress of the current needed to hold plasma suspended while being superheated to ignite a fusion reaction was unknown.

For two years, his classes refined Vulcan. By 2015, with ReBCO more consistent in quality and supply, he challenged his students—11 male and one female, including an Argentine, a Russian, and a Korean—to outdo what 35 nations had been attempting for nearly 30 years.

“Let’s see if ReBCO lets us build a 500-megawatt tokamak—the same as ITER, only way smaller.”

If superconducting tape could let them make a fusion reactor to fit the footprint of a decommissioned coal-fired plant, he told them, it could plug right into existing power lines. To then make enough carbon-­free energy to stop pushing Earth’s climate past the edge, its components would have to be mass-­producible, so any competent contractor could assemble and service them.

The class met in a windowless room in a former Nabisco cracker factory, surrounded by blackboards. Divided into teams, the students set about figuring out how thin-tape electromagnets could be made robust, and how to capture neutrons expelled from fusion reactions so their heat could be used for turning a turbine—and so they could be harnessed to breed more tritium for the plasma. That’s crucial, because natural tritium is exceedingly rare. Since ReBCO-wrapped magnets would be so much smaller, shrinking the dimensions of one component rippled through everything else. One team’s innovations fed another’s, and parts of the design started to link together. As excitement spread through PSFC, members of earlier classes, now postdocs or faculty members, pitched in. Whyte’s students, some with doctoral dissertations due, were putting in 50-hour weeks on this, reminding him of why he’d dreamed of fusion in first place.

Whyte looked it over for the thousandth time. He was pretty sure they hadn’t broken any laws of physics.

And then, at the semester’s end, out popped their design. Just over 10 feet in diameter, it actually looked like a prototype power plant. While ITER had massive shielding, their tokamak would be wrapped in a compact blanket containing a molten-salt mixture of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride to absorb the heat of the neutrons escaping from the fusion reaction. Those neutrons would also react with the lithium to breed more tritium.

The blanket’s heat would be tapped for electricity—except one-fifth of the heat energy would remain in the plasma, meaning the reaction was now heating itself and was self-sustaining, producing more energy than was needed to ignite it. Net fusion energy had been achieved.

The ReBCO magnets, although just a 40th the size of ITER’s, could deliver a magnetic field strength of 23 tesla (a hospital MRI machine typically operates at 1.5 tesla). That was more than enough to achieve a fusion reaction, yet it would require less electricity than its copper-clad C-Mod predecessor by a factor of 2,000. Everything was designed for easy maintenance, and parts could be replaced without having to dismantle the entire reactor.

Most important, the calculated energy output was more than 13 times the input.

Whyte looked it over for the thousandth time. He was pretty sure they hadn’t broken any laws of physics. He calculated the cost per watt and was astonished. Suddenly their goal wasn’t just building a much smaller ITER. It was being commercially competitive.

Stunned, he told his wife, “This can actually work.”

They called it ARC, for “affordable, robust, compact.” “Buildable in a decade,” Whyte predicted.The peer-reviewed article his 12 students published in FusionEngineering and Design estimated it would cost around $5 billion. In 2015, that wasn’t much more than the cost of a comparably sized coal-fired plant, and one-eighth ITER’s price tag.

That May, Whyte gave a keynote about ARC at a fusion engineering symposium in Austin, Texas. Four of his students attended. When he described their plan for a workable reactor by 2025, in just 10 years, conferees were astounded—everyone else was talking decades. Afterward, the MIT contingent went to lunch at Stubb’s Bar-B-Q. It was clear that with the climate eroding and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warning that yet-­uninvented technologies were needed to keep temperatures from soaring into dreaded realms, they had to do this. But since the DOE had pulled its funding, how could they?

On a napkin, Whyte started listing what they’d need to do and what each step might cost. Over ribs, they crafted a proposal to spin off a startup to raise venture capital to finance a SPARC (for “soon-as-possible ARC”) demo fusion reactor to show that this could really happen. Then they’d build a commercial-scale ARC.

Forming a company would free them from academic and government funding cycles, but they were plasma physicists, most still in their 20s, without business backgrounds. Nevertheless, Whyte and Martin Greenwald, deputy director of the PSFC, agreed to join them, and in 2018 Commonwealth Fusion Systems, CFS, was born. Three of his former students would run the company, and three would remain at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, which—in a profit-sharing agreement—would be CFS’s research arm.

They opened shop up the street, in The Engine, MIT’s “tough tech” startup incubator, and gained the attention of climate-concerned backers like Bill Gates, George Soros, and Jeff Bezos. But they weren’t the only ones competing for fusion funds, and it became a race to see who could make commercial-scale fusion first.

The CFS team may have been young, but because of its partnership with MIT and its more than a hundred experienced fusion scientists, it had a running start.

By the end of 2021, Commonwealth Fusion Systems had raised more than $2 billion and was breaking ground on 47 acres outside Boston for a commercial fusion energy campus, to build SPARC by 2025—and commercial-scale, mass-­producible ARC by 2030.

Gaining and actually sustaining net energy is perpetually called fusion’s yet-unreached “holy grail,” but by September 2021, the CFS team of CEO Bob Mumgaard, SM ’15, PhD ’15 (a coauthor of the Vulcan design), chief science officer Brandon Sorbom, PhD ’17 (lead author of the 2015 fusion design class’s breakthrough paper), Whyte, and their 200 CFS colleagues were confident they could do it—if their magnets held. For three years, straight through the pandemic, they’d worked in PSFC’s West Cell laboratory, the cavernous former Oreo factory that had housed Alcator C-Mod, furiously solving problems like how to solder thin-film ReBCO tape together into a structure strong enough to withstand 40,000 amps passing through it—enough to power a small town.

The completed SPARC would have 18 magnets encircling its plasma chamber, but for this test they’d built just one. It was composed of 16 layers, each a D-shaped, 10-foot-high steel disk grooved like an LP. On one side, the grooves held tight spirals of ReBCO film, 270 kilometers in all—the distance from Boston to Albany. “Yet all that ReBCO holds just a sprinkling of rare earth,” said Sorbom. “That’s the magic of superconductors: A tiny bit of material can carry so much current. By comparison, a wind turbine’s rare-earth neodymium magnets weigh tons.”

On each disk’s flip side, the grooves channeled liquid helium to cool the superconductor for zero resistance. (The design dates to history’s first high-field magnet, built at MIT in the 1930s, which used copper conductors and water for coolant.) Each layer was built on an automated assembly line. “The idea,” said Mumgaard, “is to make 100,000 magnets a year someday. This can’t be a scientific curiosity. This needs to be an energy source.”

Although covid-19 had waned, an outbreak could foil everything, so they maintained coronavirus protocols, moving computer terminals outside beneath a tent to avoid crowding within. Others worked virtually. For a month, dozens worked eight-hour, continuous shifts. Some operated the electromagnetic coil, encased in stainless steel in the middle of the room, which over a week had to be gradually supercooled from room temperature of 298 K down to 20 K before slowly ramping up to full magnetic strength. Others constantly compared real-time data with redundant models. As the temperature dropped, the internal connections, welds, and valves contracted at different rates, so they watched for leaks.

On September 2, 2021, the Thursday before Labor Day, they started ramping up by a few kiloamps, stopping frequently to check what the current was revealing, how the cooling characteristics had changed, and how the stresses on the ReBCO coil increased as the magnetic field strengthened to record heights.

Two nights later, they cranked the amperage toward their goal: a 20-tesla magnetic field, powerful enough to lift 421 Boeing 747s or contain a continuous fusion reaction. They’d been aiming for 7:00 a.m. on Sunday, the 5th. At 3:30, the large screen in the design center showed that they’d reached 40 kiloamps, and the magnetic field had reached 19.56 tesla.

At 4:30 a.m., they were at 19.98 tesla. Things got very quiet. At 5:20 a.m., every redundant on-screen meter read 20 tesla, and nothing had leaked or exploded—except under the tent, where champagne corks were popping.

Five years earlier, on its final four-­second run, C-Mod’s copper-conducting magnet had consumed 200 million watts of energy to reach 5.7 tesla. This took 30 watts—less energy by a factor of around 10 million, Whyte told reporters—to produce a magnetic field strong enough to sustain a fusion reaction. The joints that transferred current from one layer to the next actually performed better than expected. That was the biggest unknown, because there was only one way to test them: in the magnet itself. They looked spectacular.

After five hours, the team ramped down the power. “It’s a Kitty Hawk moment,” Mumgaard said.

            <div id="article-text">Jaden Chizuruoke May ’29 worked with teammates Rihanna Arouna ’29 and Marian Akinsoji ’29 to design the chemically powered model car whose framework he is building in this scene from the Huang-Hobbs BioMaker Space, where students have a chance to work safely and independently with biological systems.

The assignment to build the car—and the layered electrochemical battery that powers it—came in a class called “Hands-On Engineering: Squishy Style Making with Biology and Chemistry” taught by the lab’s director, Justin Buck, PhD ’12. “It is definitely one of my favorite classes,” says May, who appreciates that after being trained, students are given the freedom to figure out how to tackle each task in a project.

Located in the basement of Building 26, the BioMaker Space welcomes novices and expert mentors alike, offering workshops in such things as bacterial photography, biobots, lateral flow assay, CRISPR, and DNA origami.

For May, the makerspace has been a hub for collaboration. “I could never have done anything in that lab without my peers and counselors helping me, and the emphasis placed on teamwork is what makes the class feel both welcoming and exciting,” he says, adding that he made some of his first friends at MIT there: “It has been a great introduction to campus.”

May says he’s thinking of double majoring in Course 10-ENG (energy) and Course 21W (writing)—but the class has gotten him interested in biology, too.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As MIT navigates a difficult and constantly changing higher education landscape, I believe our best response is not easy but simple: Keep doing our very best work. The presidential initiatives we’ve launched since fall 2024 are a vital part of our strategy to advance excellence within and across high-impact fields, from health care, climate, and education to AI and manufacturing—and now quantum. On December 8, we launched Quantum at MIT, or QMIT—the name rhymes with qubit, the basic unit of quantum information—to elevate MIT’s long-standing strengths in quantum science and engineering across computing, communication, and sensing.

More than 40 years ago, MIT helped kick off what is widely considered the second quantum revolution as host of the first Physics of Computation Conference at Endicott House, bringing together physics and computing researchers to explore the promise of quantum computing. Now we’re investing further in that promise.

Like all MIT’s strategic priorities, QMIT will help ensure that new technologies are used for the benefit of society. Faculty director Danna Freedman, the Frederick George Keyes Professor of Chemistry, is leading the initiative with a focus that extends beyond research and discovery to the way quantum technologies are developed and deployed. QMIT will enable scientists and engineers to co-develop quantum tools, generating unprecedented capabilities in science, technology, industry, and national security.

Although QMIT is a new initiative, it grew naturally from the Center for Quantum Engineering (CQE), created in 2019 to help bridge the gap between PIs at MIT and Lincoln Laboratory. A key to QMIT’s success will be integration with Lincoln Lab, with its deep and broad expertise in scaling and deployment.

And CQE has already gotten us started with industry collaborations through its Quantum Science and Engineering Consortium (QSEC), which brings together companies—from startups to large multinationals—that can help us realize positive, practical impact. We’re even envisioning a physical home for quantum at the heart of campus, a space for academic, industry, and public engagement with quantum systems.

As we set out for this new frontier, QMIT will allow us to shape the future of quantum, with a focus on solving “MIT-hard” problems. We hope that as the initiative evolves, our alumni and friends will be inspired to join us in supporting this exciting new effort to build on MIT’s quantum legacy.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.
