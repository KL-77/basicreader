            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/heres-why-americas-most-historic-launch-pad-is-getting-yet-another-facelift/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida is accustomed to getting makeovers. It got another one Wednesday with the removal of the Crew Access Arm used by astronauts to board their rides to space.

Construction workers first carved the footprint for the launch pad from the Florida wetlands more than 60 years ago. NASA used the site to launch Saturn V rockets dispatching astronauts to the Moon, then converted the pad for the Space Shuttle program. The last shuttle flight lifted off from Pad 39A in 2011, and the agency leased the site to SpaceX for use as the departure point for the company’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.

SpaceX started launching from Pad 39A in 2017, then installed a new Crew Access Arm on the pad’s tower the following year, replacing the aging shuttle-era arm that connected to the hatches of NASA’s orbiters. SpaceX added the new arm ahead of the first test flight of the company’s human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019. Astronauts started using the pathway, suspended more than 200 feet above the pad surface, beginning with the first crew flight on a Dragon spacecraft in 2020.

Now, Pad 39A is undergoing another facelift in preparation for launches of SpaceX’s powerful Starship rocket. Construction of a new launch tower for Starship is well along about 1,000 feet east of the existing tower at Pad 39A, still inside the facility’s circular perimeter. SpaceX aims to launch the first Starship flight from Kennedy Space Center later this year, following a series of flights from the company’s Starbase test site in South Texas.

With the arrival of Starship, SpaceX is suspending Falcon 9 flights from Pad 39A in favor of launches from nearby Pad 40, located a few miles to the south at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, on property leased from the US Space Force. Kiko Dontchev, SpaceX’s vice president of launch, wrote on X in December that the decision will allow teams to “put full focus on Falcon Heavy launches and ramping Starship from the Cape.”

SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, primarily used to launch payloads for the Space Force and NASA, will continue flying from Pad 39A, the only site currently outfitted to accommodate the triple-core rocket. The next Falcon Heavy launch is scheduled for no earlier than April, with no more than a handful of flights per year planned for the rest of the 2020s.

Ground teams installed a Crew Access Arm at Pad 40 ahead of the first crew launch there in 2024. All future Crew Dragon flights will now depart from Pad 40 for the foreseeable future, beginning with the launch of the Crew-12 mission to the International Space Station later this week.

“It’s great to have two launch pads off the Florida coast. For our manifest going forward, we’re planning to launch most of our Falcon 9 launches off of Space Launch Complex 40. That will include all Dragon missions going forward,” said Lee Echerd, a SpaceX senior mission manager for human spaceflight. “That will allow our Cape team to focus at 39A on Falcon Heavy launches and hopefully our first Starship launches later this year.”

Pad 40 has been the primary Falcon 9 launch site for most of the rocket’s history, while Pad 39A provided a location for crew launches and an augmentation to support SpaceX’s growing launch cadence. But there are signs the Falcon 9 launch cadence, which reached 165 missions last year, may be peaking as the company turns its attention to Starship. And SpaceX has steadily reduced the time it takes to reconfigure Pad 40 between launches, cutting the turnaround time to less than 48 hours.

If needed, SpaceX officials said they could reinstall the crew arm for Dragon missions launching from Pad 39A.

Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX’s vice president of build and flight reliability, said there’s another pressing reason for removing the crew arm at Pad 39A. The bearings that connect the arm to the launch pad’s tower need repairs.

“To physically get access to those, the arm needs to be removed,” Gerstenmaier said. “Those bearings have to come out and they have to be reinstalled. We’ll do that work at the Kennedy Space Center. And the intent there is, we don’t need to put the arm back up … When we get a call-up for a mission and we have to go fly a mission, if it requires that, we have plenty of time to get the arm back up.”

SpaceX has continued launching Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from Pad 39A amid the nearby construction work to prepare for Starship flights. “That doesn’t impact our ability to launch from the pad,” Gerstenmaier said.

That could change as SpaceX begins testing and launching Starships from Kennedy Space Center. Starship launch operations may routinely force the closure of Pad 39A to personnel.

“The right thing to do is get those bearings replaced in the environment on the ground, make some upgrades to them, and then we’ll be ready to go and put the arm back up when it’s time to go fly, if we need to go fly,” Gerstenmaier said.</div>

            <h2>Trump orders the military to make agreements with coal power plants</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/trumps-latest-plan-to-revive-coal-power-make-the-military-buy-it/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, a fossil-fuel lobbying group called the Washington Coal Club awarded President Trump a trophy that named him the “Undisputed Champion of Clean, Beautiful Coal.” Trump took advantage of the opportunity to take his latest shot at reviving the fortunes of the US’s most polluting source of electricity: an executive order that would make the military buy it.

Coal is the second most expensive source of power for the US grid, eclipsed by gas, wind, solar, hydro—everything other than nuclear power. It also produces the most pollution, including particulates that damage human lungs, chemicals that contribute to acid rain, and coal ash that contains many toxic metals. It also emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced. Prior to Trump’s return to office, the US grid had been rapidly moving away from its use, including during his first term.

Despite the long-standing Republican claims to support free markets, the second Trump administration has determined that the only way to keep coal viable is direct government intervention. Its initial attempts involved declaring an energy emergency and then using that to justify forcing coal plants slated for closure to continue operations. The emergency declaration relied on what appears to be a tenuous interpretation of the Federal Power Act, and the administration was already facing a lawsuit challenging these actions.

Today’s executive order takes a different route to propping up coal: artificially inflating demand. “The Secretary of War, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy,” the order reads, “shall seek to procure power from the United States coal generation fleet by approving long-term Power Purchase Agreements, or entering into any similar contractual agreements, with coal-fired energy production facilities to serve Department of War installations or other mission-critical facilities.”

The justification for this seems to come from an alternate reality with little relationship to the US grid. “It’s going to be less expensive and actually much more effective than what we have been using for many, many years,” Trump said at the event. “And again, with the environmental progress that’s been made on coal, it’s going to be just as clean.” None of that is true.

The executive order instead seeks to highlight coal’s supposed ability to produce a constant power output, touting the “proven reliability of our coal-fired generation fleet in providing continuous, on-demand baseload power.” This seemingly ignores Texas’ recent experience, in which coal plants contributed significantly to the collapse of the state grid, having gone offline for a wide range of reasons.

The Trump administration, however, has rarely let spurious justifications stand in the way of its preferred policy actions. The key action here is likely to be locking the military into long-term contracts that would persist beyond the end of Trump’s term in 2029.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/el-paso-airport-closed-after-military-used-new-anti-drone-laser-to-zap-party-balloon/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday night, the Federal Aviation Administration closed airspace up to 18,000 feet above the El Paso International Airport in Texas, saying the restrictions would be in place for 10 days. Then, less than 10 hours later, the federal agency reopened the airspace, allowing planes to land and take off at the busy airport.

About an hour after lifting the restrictions, US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, whose responsibilities include overseeing the FAA, explained the unexpected closure by saying, “The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.” (The Trump Administration refers to the Department of Defense as the Department of War, or DOW, although its legal name remains the former.)

Not everyone agrees with Duffy’s account.

Based upon reporting from The New York Times and other publications, the military has been developing high-energy lasers to bring down drones. The FAA and US military officials had been discussing tests of the new weapon from the nearby Fort Bliss Army base. However, the FAA had not resolved all of its concerns about airplane safety from the tests.

Despite these apparently lingering concerns from the FAA, the military went ahead with a test earlier this week against what was thought to be a drone. The object was a party balloon.

That is not to make light of drone incursions. This is a real issue along the US border with Mexico, where cartels increasingly fly drones for surveillance. They are particularly useful for pinpointing the location of US Border Patrol agents to assist the cartel in smuggling non-citizens across the border into the United States.

One of the many lessons from the war in Ukraine, which has rapidly pushed forward drone technology in contested environments, is that it is not practical to shoot down drones with conventional missiles. So it is understandable that the US military is looking at alternatives. This all culminated in some sort of snafu between the FAA and military officials regarding coordination with this week’s test.

Whether it was genuine concern about air travelers, a show of force, a fit of pique, or something else, the FAA decided on Tuesday evening to take the extraordinary step of abruptly closing an airport that serves more than 3 million passengers a month. The proposed 10-day closure of the airport was remarkably long.

Moreover, this action was taken without consulting local or state officials in Texas—who are understandably outraged—or reportedly even the White House.

“I want to be very, very clear that this should’ve never happened,” El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson said during a news conference on Wednesday. “That failure to communicate is unacceptable.”</div>

            <h2>Once-hobbled Lumma Stealer is back with lures that are hard to resist</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/once-hobbled-lumma-stealer-is-back-with-lures-that-are-hard-to-resist/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last May, law enforcement authorities around the world scored a key win when they hobbled the infrastructure of Lumma, an infostealer that infected nearly 395,000 Windows computers over just a two-month span leading up to the international operation. Researchers said Wednesday that Lumma is once again “back at scale” in hard-to-detect attacks that pilfer credentials and sensitive files.

Lumma, also known as Lumma Stealer, first appeared in Russian-speaking cybercrime forums in 2022. Its cloud-based malware-as-a-service model provided a sprawling infrastructure of domains for hosting lure sites offering free cracked software, games, and pirated movies, as well as command-and-control channels and everything else a threat actor needed to run their infostealing enterprise. Within a year, Lumma was selling for as much as $2,500 for premium versions. By the spring of 2024, the FBI counted more than 21,000 listings on crime forums. Last year, Microsoft said Lumma had become the “go-to tool” for multiple crime groups, including Scattered Spider, one of the most prolific groups.

The FBI and an international coalition of its counterparts took action early last year. In May, they said they seized 2,300 domains, command-and-control infrastructure, and crime marketplaces that had enabled the infostealer to thrive. Recently, however, the malware has made a comeback, allowing it to infect a significant number of machines again.

“LummaStealer is back at scale, despite a major 2025 law-enforcement takedown that disrupted thousands of its command-and-control domains,” researchers from security firm Bitdefender wrote. “The operation has rapidly rebuilt its infrastructure and continues to spread worldwide.”

As with Lumma before, the recent surge leans heavily on “ClickFix,” a form of social engineering lure that’s proving to be vexingly effective in causing end users to infect their own machines. Typically, these types of bait come in the form of fake CAPTCHAs that—rather requiring users to click a box or identify objects or letters in a jumbled image—instruct them to copy text and paste it into an interface, a process that takes just seconds. The text comes in the form of malicious commands provided by the fake CAPTCHA. The interface is the Windows terminal. Targets who comply then install loader malware, which in turn installs Lumma.

A core part of the resurgence is the use of CastleLoader, a separate piece of malware that’s installed initially. It runs solely in memory, making it much harder to detect than malware that resides on a hard drive. Its code is heavily obfuscated, making it hard to spot its malice even when malware scanners can see it. CastleLoader also provides a flexible and full-featured command-and-control communication mechanism that users can customize to meet their specific needs.

CastleLoader shares some of Lumma’s recently rebuilt infrastructure, an indication that the operators are working together or at least coordinating their activities. In other cases, Lumma relies on legitimate infrastructure—mostly from the content delivery networks Steam Workshop and Discord shared files—to be installed. The use of trusted platforms helps lower targets’ suspicions. In either case, once the loader is executed, it surreptitiously burrows into the infected machine and, after lowering defenses, installs its second payload: Lumma.

People have grown so accustomed to hard-to-solve CAPTCHAs that they think little when instructed to copy website-provided text, click the Win-R keys, and then choose paste. Once this simple action is performed, Lumma has free rein over a host of sensitive files stored on infected machines. Bitdefender said the data includes:

“The effectiveness of ClickFix lies in its abuse of procedural trust rather than technical vulnerabilities,” Bitdefender said. “The instructions resemble troubleshooting steps or verification workarounds that users may have encountered previously. As a result, victims often fail to recognize that they are manually executing arbitrary code on their own system.”

While Lumma is targeting only Windows users, other malware campaigns have used the same technique to infect macOS machines since at least last June. More recent ClickFix attacks on macOS users have continued into this year.

The best defense against ClickFix is to steer clear of sites offering free stuff. Windows and macOS provide a means to require a password before the command terminals can be opened. People with technical skills who administer machines on behalf of less experienced users may want to consider using this latter defense as well.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On February 1, Robert Tinney, the illustrator whose airbrushed cover paintings defined the look and feel of pioneering computer magazine Byte for over a decade, died at age 78 in Baker, Louisiana, according to a memorial posted on his official website.

As the primary cover artist for Byte from 1975 to the late 1980s, Tinney became one of the first illustrators to give the abstract world of personal computing a coherent visual language, translating topics like artificial intelligence, networking, and programming into vivid, surrealist-influenced paintings that a generation of computer enthusiasts grew up with.

Tinney went on to paint more than 80 covers for Byte, working almost entirely in airbrushed Designers Gouache, a medium he chose for its opaque, intense colors and smooth finish. He said the process of creating each cover typically took about a week of painting once a design was approved, following phone conversations with editors about each issue’s theme. He cited René Magritte and M.C. Escher as two of his favorite artists, and fans often noticed their influence in his work.

Born on November 22, 1947, in Penn Yan, New York, Tinney moved with his family to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as a child. He studied illustration and graphic design at Louisiana Tech University, and after a tour of service during the Vietnam War, he began his career as a commercial artist in Houston.

His connection to Byte came through a chance meeting with Carl Helmers, who would later found the magazine. In a 2006 interview I conducted with Tinney for my blog, Vintage Computing and Gaming, he recalled how the relationship began: “One day the phone rang in my Houston apartment and it was Carl wanting to know if I would be interested in painting covers for Byte.” His first cover appeared on the December 1975 issue, just three months after the magazine launched.

Over time, his covers became so popular that he created limited-edition signed prints that he sold on his website for decades. “A friend suggested once that I should select the best covers and reproduce them as signed prints,” he said in 2006. “Byte was gracious enough to let me advertise the prints when they could fit in an ad (it did get bumped occasionally), and the prints were very popular in the Byte booth at the big computer shows, two or three of which my wife, Susan, and I attended per year. When an edition sold out, I then put the design on a T-shirt.”

Byte stopped commissioning Tinney’s cover art around 1987, opting for product photographs as competition in the computer magazine market intensified. His final cover was for the magazine’s 15th Anniversary issue in September 1990.

What made Tinney’s work distinctive was the fact that he was not a technical person. He had no engineering background and said in the 2006 interview that he always felt “a little uneasy” around Byte’s editors because he didn’t speak their technical language. But he saw that as a strength. “I’ve always thought that my interpretation of computer issues with non-technical visual metaphors was what gave my illustrations their distinctive character,” he told me. “So maybe that was a case of making lemonade out of lemons.”

That approach produced images that communicated instantly: a train running on a printed circuit board for an issue about computer engineering, a tiny computer wristwatch, or robots hatching from eggs. His 1981 Smalltalk cover featuring a colorful hot air balloon, according to his website, became a widely recognized symbol of object-oriented programming.

After leaving Byte, Tinney created illustrations for electronics companies, including JDR Microdevices and Jameco Electronics, and created cover art for Borland’s Turbo Prolog and Turbo Basic software. He eventually transitioned to oil portraits and adopted Photoshop for commercial work. “Anything I can do with gouache and an airbrush, I can do about three times better with Photoshop,” he told me, “plus I don’t have to breathe the fumes!”

Tinney is survived by his wife of 48 years, Susan, and their three children, nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. A celebration of his life will be held in May 2026.

In his later years, Tinney grew philosophical about the future of illustration as a profession, noting that stock image databases had changed the economics of the field. But he remained upbeat about the value of artistic talent, comparing it in that 2006 interview to the skill of public speaking: “It’s a nice talent to have, but it isn’t easy to find someone who’ll pay you just to do it. You need to combine that basic talent with another skill to really have a marketable service.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A little more than two months ago, a Rocket Lab employee called the Stennis Space Center Fire Department from the nearby A3 test stand. There was a grass fire where Archimedes engines undergo testing. Could they please send personnel over?

According to the fire station’s November 30 dispatcher log, the employee said, “The fire started during a test when an anomaly caused an electrical box to catch fire.”

Satellite imagery from before and after the anomaly appears to show that the roof had been blown off the left test cell, one of two at the test stand at the historic NASA facility in southern Mississippi. One person with knowledge of the anomaly said, “The characterization of this as an electrical fire doesn’t reflect what actually occurred. This was a catastrophic engine explosion that resulted in significant infrastructure damage.”

According to two sources, this is one of at least two Archimedes engine tests that have failed in the past three months.

The engine test anomalies come at a critical time for Rocket Lab, as it is attempting to finalize development of a flight version of the Archimedes engine, which burns liquid oxygen and methane and has a sea-level thrust of 165,000 pounds. Nine of these engines will power the company’s much-anticipated Neutron rocket, which is aiming for a debut launch later this year.

In response to a query from Ars about the engine test anomalies, Rocket Lab Chief Executive Officer Pete Beck downplayed concerns.

“Eric, you are trying to make a story out of nothing,” Beck said. “We test to the limits, that’s part of developing a successful rocket. We often put the engine into very off nominal states to find the limits and sometimes they let go, this is normal and how you ensure rockets don’t fail in flight.”

Rocket companies do test engines to the point of failure. These tests often occur out of public view on private or government property. However, when NASASpaceflight installed cameras outside SpaceX’s McGregor engine test facilities in Texas, it became clear that rocket engines, such as the company’s new Raptor engine, are pushed to failure not infrequently. What is not clear is how often this failure is intentional.

Beck said Rocket Lab is presently pushing the Archimedes engine to find its failure modes and performance in edge cases.

“Right now we are in the part of the program where we are doing very nasty things to the engine like backing right off the suction pressure, inducing cavitation and exploring outside the run box,” he said. “These things can often lead to engines letting go. We have two test cells so we can do these types of tests and not interrupt our test cadence or production flow, hence there is zero impact to schedule, in fact 48 hours later we were running engines again.”

Beck has previously said that it is Rocket Lab’s goal to identify failures during component-level testing so that when Neutron launches, it has a high chance of reaching orbit on its first go.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the Federal Aviation Administration announced it was shutting down El Paso Airport this morning, social media lit up with speculation.

Had freedom-hating terrorists planted anti-aircraft weapons in the desert? Was the government covering up an early-stage zombie apocalypse with El Paso as ground zero? Or had the Trump administration perhaps started firing high-energy laser weapons into the sky without bothering to tell anyone?

The answer, impossibly, seems to be door number three.

According to CBS News, the bizarre airspace closure came under orders from FAA administrator Bryan Bedford. Apparently, Bedford made the call after learning that the Pentagon planned to unleash high-energy, counter-drone laser weapons at Fort Bliss, situated right next to El Paso International Airport.

But wait, there’s more. Separately, Fox News reported that military personnel had shot down a rogue party balloon — like you’d see at a child’s birthday party — near El Paso, after misidentifying it as a foreign drone. Whether this was done using the Pentagon’s mega-laser is unclear at the moment, but it’d be a wild coincidence if this wasn’t the case.

The airspace closure occurred without alerting White House, Pentagon or Homeland Security officials, sources told CBS. Originally, the closure was said to last 10 days, citing “special security reasons.” The FAA’s original notice warned that the “government may use deadly force” against planes if officials decided “the aircraft poses an imminent security threat.”

In Bedford’s defense, CNN reports the military laser weapon deployment came nine days before a February 20th meeting to review the system’s potential impacts on commercial aviation.

Again, it isn’t clear if the Pentagon went ahead and deployed the laser system before officials could meet. That said, CNN‘s sources said the Defense Department was seeking to use the system in El Paso before such a sit-down could take place.

Further muddying the waters are the Trump administration’s claims that the Pentagon had taken action to disable a vague “cartel drone incursion” right before the airspace shutdown. (We have yet to see any evidence that that’s the case.)

So to recap: the FAA and the Pentagon appear to be in such poor communication that experimental weaponry by the latter is shutting down civilian flights by the former — and party balloons are caught in the crossfire. Welcome to 2026.

            <h2>It Seems Almost Statistically Impossible That This Polymarket Bettor Didn’t Profit Off Inside Knowledge About the Super Bowl Half Time Show</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this year, an anonymous bettor on Polymarket perfectly predicted the US invasion of Venezuela mere hours before over 150 US aircraft rocked the country’s capital of Caracas, netting them over $400,000.

The incident reignited a heated debate over insider trading on prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi. While the act is strictly forbidden on Wall Street, prediction markets are currently operating in a regulatory vacuum, allowing those who enjoy insider status to score big — while everyone else is left to pick up the bill.

And the evidence that prediction markets are rife with insider traders continues to grow. As one eagle-eyed Reddit user noticed, an anonymous day-old Polymarket account correctly guessed 17 out of around 20 bets about Sunday’s Super Bowl half-time show.

Statistically speaking, that’s an exceedingly unlikely success rate, strongly suggesting the account had some kind of insider knowledge of what would happen during Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny’s performance.

The account correctly predicted that popstars Lady Gaga, Cardi B, and Ricky Martin would perform at the show. The account also correctly predicted that rappers Travis Scott and Drake, as well as singer Post Malone, would not perform.

The anonymous user placed bets starting February 6, two days before the event took place. All told, they made about $17,000 in profit.

“If you bet, you’re a rube for these people,” one Reddit user commented. “Literally spending money to give it over to insiders and cheats.”

Polymarket has yet to publicly comment on the matter and didn’t respond to the Wall Street Journal‘s request for comment.

Ironically, gambling was a major focus during Sunday’s sporting event. Companies spent untold sums to air commercials for betting services like DraftKings.

Trading volumes on prediction markets hit record highs during the Super Bowl, with Kalshi reporting over half a billion dollars in trading tied to the final outcome of the game. Polymarket’s equivalent bet saw trading volumes hit over $55 million.

Given ongoing regulatory uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether the two platforms will be able to meaningfully address insider trading, a subject that demonstrably continues to be a major problem.

While a knowledgeable few, including professional gamblers, get away with major profits, plenty of other users are incurring significant losses. As Business Insider points out, for each “winner” on the platform, there’s a “loser” as well, since users are betting against each other — not against a house, like in a traditional casino.

The latter will need to remain confident that the setup isn’t rigged against them for the ruse to work.

“Those other people are going to, on average, make losses if they know less about the subject matter than the experts,” professor of economics and prediction markets expert Eric Zitzewitz told BI. “So you need them to be willing to trade despite that.”

“You need them to be overconfident about how much they know, or you need them to be participating for some other reason,” he added.

Prediction market regulations could take years before they materialize — if ever. The White House has made it clear it supports the industry, with president Donald Trump’s Trump Media and Technology Group announcing in October that it would enter the prediction markets business.

In the meantime, lawmakers are desperately warning that gambling on the platforms comes with some inherent risks.

“New Yorkers need to know the significant risks with unregulated prediction markets,” New York Attorney General Letitia James warned in a statement six days ahead of the Super Bowl. “It’s crystal clear: so-called prediction markets do not have the same consumer protections as regulated platforms. I urge all New Yorkers to be cautious of these platforms to protect their money.”

            <h2>Ring Boasts About Power to Surveil Entire Neighborhoods</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-11</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Ring’s latest commercial came on over a Super Bowl ad break, it offered a service that seems like a no-brainer. Called “Search Party,” it’s a new function that lets Ring devices help canvas the neighborhood through its vast network of cameras to find lost pets.

“One post of a dog’s photo in the Ring app starts outdoor cameras looking for a match to help families find lost dogs,” the company’s Super Bowl ad enthuses.

Yet beneath all that is a startling revelation: that Ring doorbells can now surveil living beings throughout every neighborhood the devices might be found.

For those unfamiliar, Ring is Amazon’s doorbell camera company — those ubiquitous gadgets mounted on front porches that record everyone who walks by.

The devices have been the target of widespread privacy criticisms for years at this point. However, their latest data sharing agreement with surveillance company Flock has many activists up in arms, as that startup has no qualms with working closely with federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

With those kind of optics swirling around, the decision to highlight new dog-finding capabilities is a clever PR move for Ring. Who would say no to reuniting lost puppies with their families?

At the same time, the new Search Party function represents a troubling development. Where the company’s Fire Watch system is said to index neighborhood devices to watch for signs of fire emergencies, the Search Party function means the company is capable of tracking living things as well. Who decides when and how to deploy that power is another story — but it’s obvious that Ring has opened Pandora’s box.

As MS Now columnist Hayes Brown observed: “there’s no world in which finding lost dogs is the final end-use for this technology.”

“Ring’s Search Party feature does what neighbors have done for generations — help reunite lost dogs with their families — just with better technology,” a Ring spokesperson told us in a statement. “We built the feature with strong privacy protections from the start and camera owners choose on a case-by-case basis whether they want to share videos with a pet owner to support a reunion. Since launch, Search Party has helped bring home more than a dog a day.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mainstream cryptocurrency Bitcoin plummeted earlier this month, crashing down to a sliver over $60,000 — which is well under half of its all-time high value it reached just over four months ago.

It was a bloodbath that was followed by a short moment of reprieve over the weekend, when it rebounded above the $70,000 mark once more.

But don’t call it a comeback. As CNBC reports, the bounce has faded once again, with Bitcoin slipping back down to $66,000 by midday on Wednesday, down 47 percent over its October record high.

Critics watched in glee as the cryptocurrency kept tumbling.

“I’m going to enjoy watching Bitcoin crash,” former White House staffer Claude Taylor tweeted.

“Not going to lie,” one X user tweeted. “Buying Bitcoin is painful right now. Feels like I’m lighting my money on fire.”

Bitcoin’s woes earlier this month resulted from a surge in liquidations, prompting other traders to follow suit. Uncertainty over president Donald Trump’s pick for Federal Reserve chair also had investors uneasy, with many choosing to bow out of riskier bets like crypto.

The US government reported earlier today that 130,000 jobs were added to the economy in January alone, double the economic forecasts, leading many traders to quickly rein in any expectations of an imminent interest rate cut. However, whether any rate cuts would’ve allowed Bitcoin to surge in the first place remains debatable, as Coindesk points out. For one, the Labor Department also revealed that it had made massive cuts to its 20245-2025 numbers, greatly undermining its latest announcement.

Large selloffs of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which allow investors to get in on Bitcoin bets indirectly through traditional brokerage accounts, added to the pressure.

All eyes are on Bitcoin. Historically, it’s often bounced back after a “halving” event, a pre-scheduled occasion which sees Bitcoin mining rewards being halved, and reaching new all-time highs after. It’s a four-year cycle that most recently restarted following a halving in April 2024.

But whether that will be the case following the latest crash has turned into a heated debate as of late, with some speculating that the “four-year cycle” is “dead,” while crypto bulls claim it’s “intact.”

“2026 I expect to be a bear leg to the four-year cycle,” Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg told CNBC. “We have experienced several four-year cycles since bitcoin has launched and this is no different than any other.”

Others have been far more pessimistic in their outlook, predicting Bitcoin could plummet to as low as $30,000, or even $0.

“This week has shown us that the supply of ‘greater fools’ that bitcoin relies on is drying up,” Financial Times columnist and Bitcoin critic Jemima Kelly argued in a recent piece. “The fairy tales that have been keeping crypto afloat are turning out to be just that. People are beginning to wake up to the fact that there is no floor in the value of something based on nothing more than thin air.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Elon Musk tries to sweep his Mars ambitions under the rug like an embarrassing teenage phase, he’s now shifting focus to the Moon — with no less eye-brow raising ideas.

According to new reporting from the New York Times, Musk told employees at xAI — his AI company recently acquired by SpaceX — that it needs to construct a factory on the Moon to churn out AI satellites. And to launch the satellites into space, he says, it needs to build an enormous electromagnetic catapult.

Sci-fi readers already know where this is going: Musk is thinking about building a mass driver, which is essentially a coilgun for launching payloads instead of deadly projectiles. Paired with the lunar facility, Musk views it as a necessary step in building out computing power for his AI empire, which must not be bound by the finitude of terrestrial real estate.

“You have to go to the Moon,” Musk said at an all-hands meeting, per the NYT.  “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about, but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen,”

The outpouring of lunar enthusiasm from Musk comes after his aerospace company SpaceX bought xAI ahead of what is anticipated to be a historic IPO.

In an announcement about the acquisition stuffed with more sci-fi concepts, Musk argued that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology. He spoke of putting data centers in the Earth’s orbit, where in theory they’d have access to practically unlimited amounts of solar energy. Along with orbital data centers, he imagines populating the orbit with a vast constellation of AI satellites, something he likened to building a “sentient sun.”

The Moon may sound like a logical destination for a space company, but it actually represents an incredible about-face for Musk and SpaceX. Musk has spent years denigrating lunar missions, viewing them as a waste of time and a “distraction” from his ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars. His mantra has always been to “make life multiplanetary,” and “extend consciousness to the stars.” He has frequently provided optimistic timelines for achieving this, including promising in 2017 that the company’s first Mars mission would launch in 2022, and its first astronauts would arrive by 2025. He has consistently reiterated this mission, and presented SpaceX employees with a roadmap to reaching the Red Planet.

Of course, Musk insists he’s not abandoning Mars. In the Tuesday meeting, he described the Moon as a stepping stone to Mars. First, he wants to build “a self-sustaining city on the Moon,” then travel to Mars — and then, naturally, search the rest of the galaxy for aliens.

He provided a timeline for his dueling Moon-Mars ambitions in a recent tweet justifying the pivot.

“SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk explained. “That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When you start a “bounty” board meant for AI agents during one of the worst job markets since the great recession, don’t be surprised when it becomes infested with humans.

Last week, an AI entrepreneur made a splash when he introduced a bizarre job portal to the world. Called RentAHuman, the platform is meant to connect autonomous AI agents to real people in order to complete various tasks. As such, the site is split between two sections: one for humans to register their real-world skills, and another where AI bots post tasks on a bounty board that humans can sign up for, à la carte.

Though the bounty board is meant for AI agents — stuff like “My AI Agent Wants a Video of Your Hand” for $10, to give an example — it only took a week for it to become overrun with human beings seeking remote work.

“I am available for remotly [sic] tasks,” one user from Pakistan advertised. “Hello, I am interested in the Email Mailing remote work. Available daily, flexible hours. I have basic computer skills and experience using Gmail.”

“Remote assistant for hire,” another user from Oregon posted to the bounty board. Many kept it simple: “I do anything,” one poster advertised.

Others were more specific, offering to do highly specialized freelance work for anyone who’ll pay. “Swiss Architect available — building permits, 3D scanning, ArchiCAD,” wrote one user from La Tour-de-Peliz, Switzerland.

One user from Miami offered to do “Mix mastering” for $30 an hour on musical recordings — “rap, pop, trap, emo rap, cloud rap, and US rap” included. “I will mix your voice and master your sound,” the advert reads.

Others are using the platform as an open forum to complain about features or changes they’d like to see. One bounty titled “update website” implores the admin to “PLEASE update the site so you don’t have tk [sic] scroll through each page of bounties one by one after reading a bounty.”

“If I’m on page 7, click and read a bounty, no matter what action I take I have to scroll through each individual page again to get back to page 7,” the human user complained, ironically cluttering the feed for other humans browsing the site.

Whether this grim humiliation ritual actually lands anyone a job remains to be seen. As of last Wednesday, the site boasted some 73,000 human users with only a few dozen bounties. Nearly a week later, the site claims to have some 377,000 users jockeying for over 11,000 bounties.

Either way, it’s a perfect snapshot of the extremes to which job-seekers are willing to go to eke out any kind of living.

            <h2>xAI lays out interplanetary ambitions in public all-hands</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/xai-lays-out-interplanetary-ambitions-in-public-all-hands/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, xAI took the rare step of publishing a full 45-minute all-hands meeting video on X, making it publicly accessible. Details of the Tuesday night meeting were previously reported by The New York Times, which may have influenced xAI’s decision to post the video online.

The full video reveals significant new details about Musk’s plans for the AI lab, including its product roadmap and its ongoing ties to the X platform.

Since xAI was formed just 30 months ago, the small and talented team has made remarkable progress.The future has never looked more exciting! pic.twitter.com/QZ73H2mpBj

The most immediate revelation concerned a string of departing employees, which Musk described as layoffs resulting from a changing organizational structure at the company. While reorganizations are common, the breadth of the departures has caused significant confusion, particularly as it has meant the loss of a significant portion of the founding team.

“As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve,” Musk said on X. “This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors.”

The new organizational system splits xAI into four primary teams: one focused on the Grok chatbot (including voice), another for the app’s coding system, another for the Imagine video generator, and finally a team focused on the Macrohard project, which spans from simple computer use simulation to modeling entire corporations.

“[Macrohard] is able to do anything on a computer that a computer is able to do,” Toby Pohlen, who will lead the project under the new organizational structure, told his colleagues. “There should be rocket engines fully designed by AI.”

The all-hands also featured claims about new usage and revenue figures for xAI and X. Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, said X had “just crossed” $1 billion in annual recurring revenue from subscriptions, which he attributed to a marketing push during the holidays.

Additionally, executives said the xAI’s Imagine tool is generating 50 million videos a day, and more than 6 billion images over the past 30 days, according to their internal metrics.

But it’s difficult to separate those figures from the flood of deepfake pornography that overtook X during that same period. The X platform saw engagement skyrocket as AI-generated explicit images became more prevalent, and with an estimated 1.8 million sexualized images generated over just nine days, the image-generation figures likely include substantial amounts of this controversial content.

The most eye-catching part of the presentation came at the end, when Musk reemphasized the importance of space-based data centers despite the technical challenges involved. Musk went still further, envisioning a moon-based factory for AI satellites, including a lunar mass driver — essentially an electromagnetic catapult — to launch them. With such infrastructure, Musk said, one could launch an AI cluster capable of capturing significant portions of the sun’s total energy output or even expanding to other galaxies.

“It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” Musk said, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/ai-inference-startup-modal-labs-in-talks-to-raise-at-2-5b-valuation-sources-say/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Modal Labs, a startup specializing in AI inference infrastructure, is talking to VCs about a new round at a valuation of about $2.5 billion, according to four people with knowledge of the deal. Should the deal close at these terms, the funding round would more than double the company’s valuation of $1.1 billion announced less than five months ago, when it announced an $87 million Series B round.

General Catalyst is in talks to lead the round, the people told TechCrunch. Modal’s annualized revenue run rate (ARR) is approximately $50 million, our sources said. The discussions are early, and terms could still change.

Modal Labs co-founder and CEO Erik Bernhardsson denied that his company was actively fundraising and characterized his recent interactions with VCs as general conversations. General Catalyst did not respond to our requests for comment.

Modal is focused on optimizing inference, the process of running trained AI models to generate answers from user requests. Improving inference efficiency reduces compute costs and cuts down the lag time between a user’s prompt and the AI’s response.

Modal is one of the handful of inference-focused companies attracting intense investor attention now. Last week, its competitor Baseten announced a $300 million raise at a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the $2.1 billion valuation it reached just months prior in September. Similarly, Fireworks AI, an inference cloud provider, secured $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October.

In January, the creators of the open source inference project vLLM announced they had transitioned the tool into a VC-backed startup, Inferact, raising $150 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz at an $800 million valuation. Meanwhile, TechCrunch reported that the team behind SGLang has commercialized as RadixArk, which sources told us secured seed funding at a $400 million valuation led by Accel.

Modal was co-founded by CEO Erik Bernhardsson in 2021 after he spent more than 15 years building and leading data teams at companies including Spotify and Better.com, where he was CTO.

The startup counts Lux Capital and Redpoint Ventures among its earlier backers.

            <h2>OpenAI disbands mission alignment team</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/openai-disbands-mission-alignment-team-which-focused-on-safe-and-trustworthy-ai-development/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has disbanded a team that was designed to communicate the company’s mission to the public and to its own employees. At the same time, the team’s former leader has been given a new role as the company’s “chief futurist.”

OpenAI confirmed to TechCrunch that the team’s members have now been assigned to other roles. The news was first reported by Platformer.

The disbanded team in question appears to have been formed in September of 2024. Platformer reports that the team was dedicated to promoting “the company’s stated mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”

An official OpenAI spokesperson described the team thusly: “The Mission Alignment project was a support function to help employees and the public understand our mission and the impact of AI. That work continues throughout the organization.”

In a blog post published Wednesday, Josh Achiam, the former head of OpenAI’s mission alignment team, explained his new role as the company’s chief futurist. “My goal is to support OpenAI’s mission — to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity — by studying how the world will change in response to AI, AGI, and beyond,” Achiam wrote.

Achiam noted that, in his new role, he would be collaborating with Jason Pruet, an OpenAI physicist.

A spokesperson for OpenAI said the rest of the mission alignment team — a group of six or seven people — had subsequently been reassigned to different parts of the company. The spokesperson couldn’t say where exactly the team members had been assigned, but said that they were engaged in similar work in those roles. It was also unclear whether Achiam would have a new team as part of his “futurist” role.

The spokesperson attributed the disbanding of the team to the kinds of routine reorganizations that occur within a fast-moving company.

OpenAI previously had what it called a “superalignment team” — which was formed in 2023 and focused on studying long-term existential threats posed by AI — but that team was disbanded in 2024.

Achiam’s personal website still lists him as head of mission alignment at OpenAI, and describes him as being interested in ensuring that the “long-term future of humanity is good.” His LinkedIn profile shows he had served as head of mission alignment since September 2024.

Correction: This story originally confused mission alignment with another, similarly named team called alignment. It has been corrected and we apologize for the error.

            <div id="article-text">Apple has been promising a new-and-improved, cutting-edge, AI-powered Siri since it first unveiled Apple Intelligence in 2024. Over about a year and a half since then, the release date for this new era of Siri has been continuously pushed back. According to a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, we’ll likely have to wait even longer.

While the new Siri was expected to launch with the upcoming iOS 26.4 update in March, now, the changes are expected to roll out more slowly over time, reportedly postponing some features until the May iOS update, or even until the release of iOS 27 in September. Apparently, Apple ran into trouble when testing the software, requiring the launch date to be pushed back further.

The changes are rumored to make the longtime digital assistant more like the LLM chatbots that have swept the tech world — but instead of opening up a ChatGPT or Claude app on your iPhone or MacBook, you would be able to just talk to Siri, which will be powered by Google Gemini.

We’re starting to feel bad for the Siri product managers. Hang in there, folks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Uber Eats announced a new AI feature, “Cart Assistant,” on Wednesday designed to fill customers’ grocery carts faster and easier. The beta version is now available in the app.​

To use the new chatbot, users search for a grocery store in the Uber Eats app and tap the purple Cart Assistant icon on the store’s page to begin shopping.

Customers can enter a list or upload an image of one, and Cart Assistant will automatically add the necessary items to their basket. This includes photos of handwritten lists or screenshots of recipes and their ingredients. Users can then customize the basket by swapping items for preferred brands or adding more products from the store.​

Uber Eats notes that Cart Assistant uses previous orders to prioritize familiar items — like your usual milk or favorite oatmeal — to make the experience more personalized.​

“Users were telling us they wanted a quicker way to shop, and we know how precious your time is,” Uber CTO Praveen Neppalli Naga said in a statement. “Cart Assistant helps you get from idea to checkout in seconds.”

Cart Assistant could help Uber Eats better compete with other food delivery and grocery apps that are already integrating or developing AI chatbots.​ For example, Instacart launched an AI search tool powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2023 to help customers save time and receive personalized shopping recommendations. DoorDash was also reportedly testing an AI chatbot called DashAI that same year.​

Last year, both Uber Eats and rival DoorDash integrated with ChatGPT to streamline food ordering. With Uber Eats, U.S. users can browse local restaurants and menus in ChatGPT, then complete their purchase in the Uber Eats app. DoorDash’s integration allows users to request meal plans and automatically add all necessary ingredients to their DoorDash cart.

Notably, Bloomberg reported in 2023 that Uber Eats was developing an AI-powered chatbot that would supposedly ask users about their budget and food preferences, and help them place an order.​

Overall, Uber Eats is rapidly investing in AI, including tools for merchants like AI-generated menu descriptions, enhanced food photos, and customer review summaries.

            <h2>The Epstein Emails Show How the Powerful Talk About Race</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/epstein-race-science-watson-pinker-chomsky-musk/685965/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2016, after exchanging email pleasantries with the left-wing public intellectual Noam Chomsky and extending an invitation to his private island, Jeffrey Epstein recommended an article. “On a different note, you have encouraged me to look at data, no holds barred,” Epstein wrote before linking to “Race and IQ: Genes That Predict Racial Intelligence Differences” from the Right Stuff, an openly white-supremacist website and a pioneer of the online alt-right. The article argued that different races have differing levels of intelligence and that there is a genetic basis for the disparity.

The exchange was included in the Department of Justice’s latest public release of the Epstein files and is one of the clearest examples of the disgraced financier’s interest in “race science,” the pseudoscientific practice of ascribing racial inequities to genetics. It is a way of thinking that has been refuted on multiple levels. IQ is a complex trait that results from a series of factors—many of them cultural and circumstantial—that are not neatly reduced to a specific gene or set of genes. Even if it weren’t, the consensus among geneticists, biologists, and anthropologists is that race isn’t a biological phenomenon. Race-science proponents tend to ignore all of this, as well as any other relevant context, and use correlations between race and IQ (and also things such as race and criminality) as evidence that racial stereotypes are in fact justified.

None of this mattered to Epstein, who recurrently expressed his interest in race science beyond this 2016 correspondence. The tranche of Epstein files also shows that in 2018, he repeatedly tried to get in contact with Charles Murray, a political scientist whose 1994 book, The Bell Curve, is one of the best-known texts to posit a relationship between intelligence and race. Epstein didn’t specify why he was trying to connect with Murray, but he claimed that they had met previously. (Murray told me over email that he had never received an email from Epstein and that it was possible that they’d met in passing at a conference reception at some point. If this ever happened, though, Murray had no memory of it, he said.)

Promoting contemptible perspectives on race is probably nowhere near the most depraved things Epstein did; he was, after all, a registered sex offender charged with child trafficking. But Epstein’s views are notable given his long-standing influence on some of the most powerful and influential Americans. His conversations from a decade ago provide clues as to how race science was picked out of the boneyard of history and reanimated into a force that’s influencing U.S. politics right now.

Epstein received Murray’s email address from his ideological fellow traveler James Watson, the late Nobel Prize–winning geneticist who was stripped of his titles in 2019 after he doubled down on comments he’d made to a British newspaper in 2007 about how he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa” because “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours—whereas all the testing says not really.” He told the paper that he wished that all races were equal but that “people who have to deal with Black employees find this not true.”

Epstein liked to collect relationships with high-profile academics, but the emails suggest that he may have been drawn to Watson specifically because of his ideology. In his 2016 exchange with Chomsky, Epstein appears to endorse the perspective that improving the world “might require accepting some uncomfortable facts” about race and intelligence. Chomsky, who sustained his association with Epstein even after accusations that the financier had sexually abused children became well known, disagreed with Epstein on race science in their email exchange. (He did not respond to a request for comment.) Epstein references Watson in other emails, and he and Watson appear to have met several times.

The same year that Epstein tried to put Chomsky onto pseudoscientific racism, he was having similar discussions with Joscha Bach, an AI researcher. In one exchange, Bach told Epstein that Black children in the United States “have slower cognitive development” and “are slower at learning high-level concepts.” In another email to Epstein, Bach wrote that “given average brain size difference” between men and women, “the small difference in average IQ is surprising.”

Read: The far right is becoming obsessed with race and IQ

Bach appears to have since changed his mind. In a recent Substack post explaining his emails with Epstein, Bach claimed that he has never said “that people of different races have different cognitive abilities” and wrote that “every ethnic group contains highly capable individuals” and that no one “should be discriminated against because of their ancestry.” Over email, Bach further clarified to me that “the concept of race is not suitable to capture cognitive and behavioral differences between individuals.” He said that “scientific discussion about the heritability of traits can be important for the creation of a more fair and equitable society, it is important to understand the nature and limitations of our minds, but they are very complicated and not my area of research.”

Other names that pop up in Epstein’s emails: He reached out to Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor who has written about research that argues that Ashkenazi Jews are innately intelligent. (Pinker has disavowed Epstein and denied that he ever visited Little Saint James, Epstein’s island. He attended at least two events that Epstein was also present at. “I only had one conversation with him, and found him to be not only odious but intellectually deeply unserious, despite the praise from so many of my colleagues, and his own pretensions,” Pinker told me over email. He also said that he doesn’t believe that there is “good evidence that average racial or ethnic differences have a genetic component.”) Epstein also tried to meet with Richard Dawkins, who has made comments claiming that race is a biological reality; Dawkins did not respond to a request for comment.

In the past several years, race science has gained traction on the right and in parts of Silicon Valley’s elite circles. Elon Musk, for example, has repeatedly replied to the @cremieuxrecueil account, run by Jordan Lasker, an independent researcher who has been credited by a right-wing publication for tracing “the genetic pathways of crime, explaining why poverty is not a good causal explanation.” Musk has also engaged with an account that posted statistics supposedly illustrating the inferiority of Black people. In November, The Guardian reported that perspectives defending race science were embedded in Musk’s Wikipedia competitor, Grokipedia. Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

In 2023 and 2024, respectively, Charlie Kirk and Tucker Carlson interviewed Steve Sailer, a prominent race-science proponent. President Trump—who once considered Epstein a close friend and is referenced in many emails—has toyed around with the concept for years. In a November 2024 interview with the right-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump said that some of the migrants coming across the southern border were genetically inferior. “How about allowing people to come to an open border, 13,000 of whom were murderers? Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump told Hewitt, citing an incorrect number. “You know, now a murderer—I believe this—it’s in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.” When I reached out to the White House, the spokesperson Abigail Jackson told me in an emailed statement that “President Trump is right—dangerous criminal illegal aliens exploited Joe Biden’s open border and flooded our country.”

Meanwhile, Trump’s deportation campaign appears to target people from countries and cultures that he seems to think are inferior. During a Cabinet meeting in December, Trump said of Somalis, “I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you,” adding that the U.S. will “go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.” He said this while the Department of Homeland Security was targeting Somalis in Minnesota.

Arguing that intelligence and adjacent traits are biologically determined served a clear function for a man like Epstein, who treated women as disposable and subordinate. And it’s equally unsurprising that the powerful people with whom he cultivated relationships might attempt to come up with a natural, objective explanation and rationale for their perch at the top of society.</div>

            <h2>Howard Lutnick’s Epstein Story Doesn’t Make Any Sense</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/howard-lutnick-epstein-files-misleading-story/685971/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>

“I have nothing to hide. Absolutely nothing,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told a Senate committee yesterday. Perhaps that’s true—but given his recent history, don’t bet on it.

During a podcast interview this past fall, Lutnick talked about an unsettling encounter he and his wife had with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who used to be his next-door neighbor, in 2005. After Epstein offered them a house tour and showed them his infamous massage table, Lutnick recalled, he was creeped out and left. “My wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” he said. “So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy.”

Only that wasn’t true at all. Documents in the Epstein files released by the Justice Department show repeated, if more cordial than chummy, conversation between the two men, as well as some shared business dealings. That’s okay, you might think—they never hung out socially again. Right? He seemed to confirm that, recently telling The New York Times, “I spent zero time with him.”

Well, about that: Yesterday, testifying before Congress, Lutnick reiterated, “I barely had anything to do with that person.” Then he admitted to having visited Epstein’s private island in 2012.

“I did have lunch with him, as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation,” Lutnick said. “My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies. I had another couple; they were there as well, with their children. And we had lunch on the island. That is true. For an hour. And we left with all of my children, with my nannies, with my wife.”

Lutnick seems understandably eager to show that he was not involved in sexual misconduct, and as Senator Chris Van Hollen noted, there is no evidence that he was. But he has no answer for his misleading statements about his dealings with Epstein, and his previous lies make it harder to believe him now. So much for having nothing to hide.

The Trump administration has always been tied to the Epstein scandal—the president himself was once a close friend of Epstein’s—but these new details drag his allies still further into the spotlight. Even before his testimony, Lutnick was facing calls to resign from Democrats as well as from renegade Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky. The secretary, whose penchant for putting his foot in his mouth was already well established, seems to have held on to his job this long only because he is personally friendly with Donald Trump and because the president refuses to give his political adversaries satisfaction by firing anyone. (This stands in contrast to many other organizations and institutions that have been eager to create distance from Epstein by separating themselves from individuals who were connected to him.)

But Lutnick isn’t the only top Trump aide to come up in the new tranche of documents. Navy Secretary John Phelan, a reported billionaire Trump donor who was appointed despite lacking any military or naval experience, was listed as a passenger on flights between London and New York on Epstein’s private plane in 2006. (The flights took place before Epstein was first indicted later that year; Phelan has not been accused of any wrongdoing and has not commented on the revelations.)

One reason the Epstein files have created such a stir is that they have revealed the elaborate social and financial ties among so many people in positions of power. It’s not that most or even many of the big names who appear in them were pedophiles or sexual predators, but rather that their dealings with him demonstrate that there’s a wealthy, powerful, globe-trotting club, and the rest of us ain’t in it. Lutnick inadvertently reinforced this image with his mentions of his “nannies,” plural. These glaring markers of privilege are what Senator Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, was talking about this past weekend when he called the Trump administration “a government of, by, and for the ultrarich. It is the wealthiest Cabinet ever. This is the Epstein class ruling our country.”

The defense that people connected to Epstein—from the billionaire financier Lutnick to the leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky and his wife—have offered is that they didn’t grasp Epstein’s abuses when they socialized with him and were appalled once they did. One problem is that this is sometimes demonstrably false: Lutnick visited the island four years after Epstein’s conviction for sex crimes, and emails show Chomsky offering Epstein public-relations advice after accusations became public.

Another problem is that many of them should have known. You don’t have to take my word for it. Take Trump’s. In 2019, he declared his surprise at the Epstein allegations: “No, I had no idea. I had no idea.” But the Palm Beach police chief at the time recalled that Trump commended him in July 2006, when charges first became public. “Thank goodness you’re stopping him; everyone has known he’s been doing this,” Trump said, as reported by Julie K. Brown of the Miami Herald.

(Trump may have had his suspicions for some time. In 2002, he told New York that Epstein is “a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”)

The Epstein revelations are starting to sink in for members of Congress. “Well, initially, my reaction to all this was, ‘I don’t care. I don’t know what the big deal is.’ But now I see what the big deal is, and it was worth investigating,” Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican, told NewsNation. (One reason Lummis may be willing to say so is that she is retiring, which insulates her from Trump’s wrath.)

These revelations about Trump’s close allies could affect the GOP’s electoral chances if enough voters become aware of them, but at the same time that members of the Trump administration are popping up in the newly released files, coverage in conservative media outlets has dropped significantly, CNN’s Aaron Blake reports. The result is that Democratic voters, who already dislike and distrust the president, are hearing a great deal about Epstein, but Republican ones, who might be swayed, are not. When MAGA pundits such as Dan Bongino talked about a media cover-up of the Epstein scandal, they were onto something—they were just wrong about the media outlets in question.

Here are four new stories from The Atlantic:

AI Is Getting Scary Good at Making Predictions

To live in time is to wonder what will happen next. In every human society, there are people who obsess over the world’s patterns to predict the future. In antiquity, they told kings which stars would appear at nightfall. Today they build the quantitative models that nudge governments into opening spigots of capital. They pick winners on Wall Street. They estimate the likelihood of earthquakes for insurance companies. They tell commodities traders at hedge funds about the next month’s weather.

For years, some elite forecasters have been competing against one another in tournaments where they answer questions about events that will happen—or not—in the coming months or years. The questions span diverse subject matter because they’re meant to measure general forecasting ability, not narrow expertise. Players may be asked whether a coup will occur in an unstable country, or to project the future deforestation rate in some part of the Amazon. They may be asked how many songs from a forthcoming Taylor Swift album will top the streaming charts. The forecaster who makes the most accurate predictions, as early as possible, can earn a cash prize and, perhaps more important, the esteem of the world’s most talented seers.

Explore. The Sundance Film Festival, which once helped turn small movies into blockbusters, is losing its Hollywood pull, Shirley Li writes.

Reflect. Spencer Kornhaber on what happened to the great American protest concert.

            <h2>Scientists Figured Out the Problem With Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID Vaccine</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/02/covid-vaccines-blood-clotting-answer/685966/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2021, just months after the first COVID vaccines debuted, concern was growing about an exceedingly rare but sometimes deadly outcome of certain shots. Two related vaccines—one from AstraZeneca and the other from Johnson & Johnson—were linked to dangerous blood clotting.

Out of almost 19 million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s version given in the United States during the first two years of the pandemic, at least 60 such cases were identified. Nine of them were fatal. In the United Kingdom, where almost 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot were given, 455 cases occurred; 81 people died. In Germany, at least 71 cases were identified, also linked to AstraZeneca. By late spring, use of both the AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was paused, and ultimately both were pulled from the market. But the mystery surrounding the rare blood clotting caused by these vaccines lingered.

Now researchers believe they have cracked the case. They have hard evidence for how the blood clotting happened, and they believe that their findings could help make similar vaccines even safer. Understanding the blood-clotting problem is important, they say, because vaccines of this type could be essential in protecting people during future pandemics.

The team that initially gave this condition a name—vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or VITT—included Andreas Greinacher, a blood expert at the University of Greifswald, in Germany. Back in 2021, as the cases of VITT emerged, he and others were unsure of what precipitated them. One theory was that they were caused by the body’s accidental reaction to the type of virus used in both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines: adenoviruses, which had been engineered to prompt the body to recognize the pandemic coronavirus but were unable to replicate and considered harmless to people. Scientists had noticed that patients with VITT had telltale markers in their blood—antibodies that bind to a chemical signal released by platelets. Maybe a reaction to the adenovirus was causing immune cells to mistakenly go after a blood component and precipitate clotting. An alternative theory was that the body was reacting to a portion of the coronavirus called “spike protein,” which showed up as part of the immunization.

In a study published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, Greinacher and his colleagues show that the first theory was correct: VITT was a response to the adenovirus gone awry. And they discovered a further twist: This immune overreaction happened in people who were genetically prone to it.

In the study, Greinacher and his colleagues looked at the antibodies in stored blood from 21 patients with VITT. Among those antibodies, they found a subset that could glom on to a portion of the adenovirus and to one of the body’s own molecules, PF4, that can influence blood clotting. A person who received one of the adenovirus vaccines but did not have a reaction also had antibodies against that same part of the adenovirus. But, crucially, that person’s antibodies did not cross-react with PF4.

Those antibody molecules also offered clues about the immune cells that made them. And the scientists were able to link the immune cells responsible for VITT to patients who had two specific DNA variants. A wider survey of 100 VITT patients found that all of them had immune cells with one of these genetic types—which are far from universal. This signaled to the researchers that having these particular variants is a strong risk factor for blood clotting following an adenovirus vaccine.

But the study also showed that this genetic background on its own was not enough to cause VITT. The immune cells that made the dangerous antibodies had experienced an additional small genetic change, and that extra mutation had prompted them to produce those cross-reactive molecules.

In the past, scientists have suggested that genetic predispositions might explain some adverse events that happen after vaccination. For example, some data have indicated that certain people were genetically prone to developing narcolepsy following a version of swine-flu vaccine that was briefly used in Europe. But the new study from Greinacher and his team is the first to provide concrete evidence of how people with a particular DNA variant can develop self-sabotaging antibodies following a vaccination. Arnold Lining Ju, a biomedical engineer at the University of Sydney who has studied blood clotting, told me that the paper was a landmark finding in part because of how elegantly it explains the way a specific genetic trait, combined with a particular chance mutation in certain cells, creates VITT. And because the study shows that multiple genetic changes are involved, it finally explains why this immune reaction is so rare, he said.

This discovery will help guide researchers more than it will influence vaccination choices for individual patients. Most vaccine recipients will not know their genetic predisposition to an adverse event, Jennifer Juno, a vaccine researcher at the University of Melbourne, points out. But this type of work will help improve vaccine design—particularly in the field of “precision vaccinology,” in which vaccines are tailored to individual traits, Joanne Reed, the director of the Centre for Immunology and Allergy Research at the Westmead Institute in Australia, told me.

These results also mean that adenovirus-based vaccines could be made safer if they can be designed without the protein region that triggered the dangerous antibodies in VITT. “Instead of abandoning an entire vaccine platform because of a rare problem, we can engineer around the specific issue, and that’s the power of this kind of science,” Joann Arce of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital told me. The hope is that understanding the biology of a rare event like VITT, and then addressing it, helps bolster public trust in vaccines too. Greinacher told me that adenovirus-based vaccines remain vital, including for the development of vaccines for diseases that affect mostly low- and middle-income countries. The shots could also be useful in a future pandemic, because they can be scaled up in production relatively quickly.

Still, this one study may not have entirely answered the question of why adenovirus-based COVID vaccines caused clotting. A study published last year from Ju’s group suggested that a separate biophysical mechanism might cause a viral component found in the AstraZeneca vaccine to directly aggregate platelets, independent of the immune reaction identified in VITT. And a bigger mystery remains open too—why infections themselves are sometimes associated with dangerous blood clotting. Rushad Pavri, an immunologist at King’s College London, told me that the new study—because it shows how similarities between a virus particle and an innate protein involved in clotting can confuse the immune system—can shed light on that question. Ultimately, understanding why viruses can provoke immune overreactions might help limit damaging complications from sickness to begin with.</div>

You won’t find this in Cortina d’Ampezzo over the next few weeks, but for several decades of the Olympics’ history, the contest awarded medals not just for sport but for art too.

In the Summer Games from 1912 to 1948, musicians, painters, and plenty of other aesthetes went brain-to-brain in events such as lyric poetry and chamber music. “Town planning” was even contested one year under the umbrella of the architecture competition.

Lest you think the arts’ inclusion odd—one wonders what muscles need stretching before going for gold in watercolor—the submissions had to be at least about sports.

The Olympic committee ought to bring these events back. Well, maybe not town planning—but add trivia to the mix instead. Organizers can throw in a few sports questions for good measure, but with trivia, if you’re not working up a sweat thinking, you’re not doing it right.

And by the way, did you know that the Andersonville prison popularized the word deadline? Before it came to mean “due date,” the word had a gory, literal meaning: Prisoners at Andersonville and camps like it who crossed a certain boundary marked on the ground—the deadline—would be shot without warning. As dispatches emerged from Andersonville toward the end of the Civil War, understanding of (and horror at) the term quickly spread.

By the 1920s, newspapers had taken up the “do not cross” meaning to describe the time by which they had to finalize their next edition, and the rest of the world took the papers’ lead.

All the marble hits visitors first. The capital has nearly 550 buildings clad in white marble, the highest concentration anywhere in the world. Combine that with the desert setting and the wide avenues that international visitors report as spotless and eerily empty, and you get an otherworldly effect.

And by the way, did you know that humans have a bone that does not connect to any other? We think of the skeleton as pretty contiguous, but in the middle of the neck, the hyoid bone, which supports the base of the tongue, is articulated only distantly to the rest of the skeleton by muscles and ligaments. It is, as scientists call it, a “floating bone.”

Because it’s not readily attachable, the hyoid is often left off of model skeletons. High-end ones hang it with string or wire.

            <h2>Five Basic Truths About America’s Most Polarizing Policy Debate</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/five-basic-truths-about-americas-immigration-debate/685962/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“If Liberals Won’t Enforce Borders, Fascists Will.”

So warned my colleague David Frum in the headline of an April 2019 article about America’s failure to control mass immigration. “Demagogues rise by talking about issues that matter to people, and that more conventional leaders appear unwilling or unable to address,” he wrote. “If difficult issues go unaddressed by responsible leaders, they will be exploited by irresponsible ones.”

That thesis looked shaky in 2020. Voters declined to reelect Donald Trump; for the first time in more than 50 years, Gallup found that Americans who wanted immigration to increase outnumbered those who wanted it to decrease––a seeming rebuke of Trump’s cruel family-separation policy and attacks on Mexicans and Muslims––and that 77 percent said immigration is a good thing for the United States. Then Joe Biden failed to control the southern border and presided over record surges in unlawful entries. By 2024, a majority wanted less immigration, Trump won the presidency while promising the biggest mass deportation in U.S. history, and an analysis of why voters rejected Kamala Harris found that “too many immigrants crossed the border” was nearly tied for the top reason.

Today, Frum’s warning seems prescient: The Trump administration has deployed a force of aggressive masked officers onto American streets while promising “retribution.” They’ve detained, pepper-sprayed, assaulted, shot, and killed Americans. And high-ranking officials have repeatedly gotten caught lying about events captured by citizen video footage.

A majority now disapproves of Trump’s handling of immigration. Perhaps Democrats will prevail in their current efforts to force ICE officers to take off their masks and get warrants, or even win back Congress as a result––the MAGA coalition is no less vulnerable than the left to voter backlash. But a Democratic victory in 2026 is not likely to end this cycle, in which majorities hate how both parties handle immigration and ping-pong unhappily between them.

I have covered immigration politics and policy for 25 years; here’s my sense of five basic truths that lawmakers need to acknowledge if they want to implement immigration policy that is both popular and in the nation’s best interest.

1. Even many of those Americans who say that they want to deport all immigrants who are here illegally would likely not stand by that position in practice.  Lots of MAGA supporters insist that deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally is a prudent goal. Some argue that conserving the rule of law requires doing so. “I don’t care if it’s a grandma who’s been here for 23 years and sits quietly on her porch all day long,” the populist-right pundit Walter Curt wrote. “We either have laws or we don’t, we either have borders or we don’t, there is no middle ground.”  Although superficially seductive, that logic is monomaniacal. In the real world, federal laws are enforced by presidents in a manner that predictably fails to catch anything close to 100 percent of lawbreakers, because resources are scarce, trade-offs are real, and maximalist outcomes are simply incompatible with limited government.

Consider the example of tax law. Most Americans abhor tax cheats. But they, and especially most conservatives, would oppose deploying thousands of masked, armed IRS agents into whatever American neighborhoods the president fancies and allowing them to search houses, workplaces, and private papers to catch all the tax cheats.

Yes, lots of Americans tell pollsters that they want every immigrant who came here illegally deported, but how many would stick to that position if told that it would require house-to-house raids, or that the federal government must choose between spending limited funds on apprehending undocumented grandmothers who stayed after their work visas and spending on other societal needs, such as finding a cure for cancer or paying down the national debt?

2. A majority of Americans support some level of immigration enforcement, particularly for unauthorized immigrants who commit violent crimes.

If excessive immigration enforcement is incompatible with liberty, insufficient immigration enforcement is incompatible with representative democracy––Republicans are correct that our immigration laws were duly enacted, and every plausible read of election results and polling data confirms that Americans favor some meaningful level of immigration enforcement.

Americans’ preferences are clearest on the question of immigrants in the country illegally who have been convicted of violent crimes: According to an Associated Press poll, 83 percent of Americans strongly or somewhat favor deporting them, a position that is also held by 79 percent of Democrats. The persistence of contrary policies in some Democrat-controlled jurisdictions is harmful to public safety and the political interests of that coalition.

I support sanctuary cities insofar as that means that local police don’t enforce immigration law, because they want residents to cooperate with law enforcement. But it doesn’t follow that jailers should refuse all cooperation with deportations. If you favor any immigration enforcement at all, who better to focus on than incarcerated bad actors, who can be found without spending any money on searches or deploying federal officers among the public?

3. Refugee crises will happen––and every response likely to satisfy the public requires prior planning.

Perhaps the most difficult challenge on immigration is what to do with large, sudden surges of people. The future will bring wars, natural disasters, regime collapses, famines, and more. Barring entry to desperate refugees seems cruel, but letting in large, unanticipated flows of foreigners can cause voters in democracies to feel overwhelmed and empower authoritarians. Escaping this dysfunctional cycle is in the interests of restrictionists and inclusionists alike. All potential solutions come with challenges, but none is more formidable than the status quo. The future will confront us with many such crises. We need a plan.

4. Even many Americans who argue for a stricter immigration policy find the demonization of immigrants concerning.

It is one thing to deport people and another thing to vilify them while doing so. In my youth, the Republican Party was explicit about the goodness and humanity of most immigrants––see, for example, the way that Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush talked about the issue in 1980. Bush noted that “honorable, decent, family-loving people” were in violation of the law.  Today, in an America where there are many more immigrants, lawful and not, and where violent crime is lower than it was for the entire 1980s and ’90s, data suggest that unauthorized immigrants commit felonies at lower rates than U.S. citizens and immigrants who are authorized to be here. Obviously, some do commit murders and other serious crimes, but it is misleading and incendiary to talk about the entire class as if a large share are violent criminals, or to treat particular ethnic groups as scapegoats for citizens’ financial struggles. Many Americans find such talk unnerving and distasteful.

That is not mere political correctness. It is rooted in the fact that U.S. history is rife with examples of the demonization of ethnic-minority groups preceding mob violence against them. I hope America is beyond atrocities like the Los Angeles Chinese massacre, the World War I–era lynching of ethnic Germans, and the Zoot Suit Riots. But humans today are no more evolved than the perpetrators of those atrocities. Insofar as we’re less likely to participate in mob attacks, it’s because of the existence of cultural guardrails—the very ones that the MAGA coalition is dismantling.

5. Every high-immigration country has citizens who fear immigration and immigrants. They are least likely to sow dysfunction when their predispositions are understood and to some degree accommodated.

The United States has no choice but to tolerate people who fear immigration and immigrants. Although many humans enjoy diversity, a percentage of people in all countries and racial and demographic groups are psychologically uncomfortable with difference. Their discomfort may be to some degree innate, and they are either unable or unwilling to change.

America should never allow its xenophobes to persecute immigrants or violate their rights. But people who hold anti-immigrant views are fellow citizens who influence our culture, politics, and public policy––and we can influence whether they do so in ways that are better or worse for immigrants.

In The Authoritarian Dynamic, the social psychologist Karen Stenner explains how people with a latent predisposition to authoritarianism get triggered, and how best to respond to preserve a pluralistic society. Her work suggests that liberals should stop framing immigration as a celebration of multicultural difference and instead emphasize ways in which immigrants are just like the rest of us: people who seek safety, opportunity, and a better future for their family. These framings can better assuage the fears of those with xenophobic tendencies, she argues. Stenner suggests that countries implement practical assimilationist policies, such as encouraging and assisting with English fluency. She argues that immigration is most sustainable—and backlash against it least likely to succeed—when inflows of new immigrants are controlled, and subject to known limits rather than unlimited in a way that feels unpredictable.

As she puts it in her book, insisting on unconstrained diversity “pushes those by nature least equipped to live comfortably in a liberal democracy not to the limits of their tolerance, but to their intolerant extremes.” And once a society’s authoritarians are activated, the outcome depends in part on how its conservatives react. If they side with authoritarians, repressive policies follow. But under the right conditions, conservatives can be counted on to rally behind pluralism and tolerance. One condition is that they feel reassured “regarding established brakes on the pace of change, and the settled rules of the game,” Stenner writes.

If Democrats or Republicans hope to create sustainable immigration policy, that policy must roughly reflect the public will. Instead of efforts to alter public opinion through persuasion, we’ve seen a succession of fringe factions forcing extremist positions on majorities that hate them. Politicians from both parties should moderate according to what voters actually want. Otherwise, endless political failures risk causing many to lose faith in all politics––which is an existential danger to our democracy.</div>

This year it is arthritic, the outfit that admitted that &quot;AI&quot; is a dead end, but then slapped a neverending loop of reparsing long json bits onto that shit and called it a business model.

It is almost like all knowledge of architecture design is gone and the whole of &quot;AI&quot; is vibe-coded by stoned schoolchildren.

Wait, exactly as it was in the year 2000.

I don&#39;t have a good idea as to what has caused it, but look at any TV debate up to sometime around the 1980s and you are likely to find a logical discussion, with little tolerance for lies, exaggeration, or logical error. That seems to have gone now.

Scientists might show that we are in trouble, and the result is that the most powerful deride the scientists, and most voters are incapable of the thought required to arrive at an informed opinion.

Politics and social debate need to fundamentally change.

What happened was that the predictions of science didn&#39;t live up to the hype, and people realized that many scientists were actually idiots, grifters or sociopaths.

It&#39;s pretty much a trope that coffee has been bad for us one week and then good for us again the next week, ad infinitum.

There&#39;s a limit to the number of times people will listen to failed prophets.

You might also want to read Eisenhower&#39;s Farewell Address where he warns of the risks of government funding of science. The mass production of &#39;scient

It&#39;s pretty much a trope that coffee has been bad for us one week and then good for us again the next week, ad infinitum. Scientists are not the ones telling you this. The people telling you this are the same ones that inject themselves into every conversation and try to convince you to buy things you don&#39;t need.

Yeah, because Ronnie Raygun didn&#39;t make up a bunch of BS about welfare queens that years later turned out to be BS. Nevermind the back door comms to Iran to get the hostages held until he secured the Presendency ... etc.

The 80s are not the bastion of good behavior and one can&#39;t have an honest conversation when folks lie and hide things.

Actually it is a smart move, and the guy is spot on on security, there is none of it in the &quot;AI&quot;.

The &quot;architecture&quot; of the claude and the whole &quot;AI&quot; crap is beyond ridiculous.

You have a stateless &quot;AI&quot; produce unsafe code that nobody checks, then you feed the descriptors of that code fed to the &quot;AI&quot; at every request so that it can re-learn what it did and call some other process to run that very code. Or some similar code. Or some code that has that descriptor. Or something.

That is to say, these people were political officers whose grasp of the tech or the implications of the tech was always secondary to their political loyalties.

Over a billion dollars was spent on a persistent global scare mongering / PR blitz of utter bullshit that ultimately amounted to absolutely nothing.  Subsequently enough people have used and or been subjected to AI.  According to public polling vast majority now find it mildly useful while being largely annoyed by the nonsense and zero effort slop.

Bio-terrorism risks have been a concern long before the rise of generative AI fueled by reduced cost and improved capability of enabling technology.  Despite nons

Back in the real world, cops have been asking for privately owned surveillance recordings to help with investigations since video recording became a thing. And the very reason people (usually businesses) have set up video surveillance was to deter crime and help track down crooks who were insufficiently deterred.

They&#39;re not going to only be used to fight crime.   As we have seen in multiple other technologies that offer surveillance to an entity with no effective oversight.

I have a ring doorbell and cameras and they&#39;re game changers.  IDK why you wouldn&#39;t want the police to have access.  Are you going to self-investigate crimes?...our concern is not when it&#39;s used correctly, but when it&#39;s misused....just like guns, drugs, motor-vehicles....when used responsibly?...fine...when a repeat offender drunk driver crashes in your car, a huge issue.  Like guns and vehicles we need regulations.   Perhaps make it a crime to show footage from another person&#39;s property unless there is a warrant or reasonable suspicion of a crime committed?.  So yeah, you catch someone stealing your neighbor&#39;s packages (I live in the city, so our front doors are less than 50 feet apart), you&#39;re a hero.  You use it to show your neighbor her husband had a visitor when she&#39;s not in town?...you&#39;re human trash and should be charged with a misdemeanor and banned from using surveillance cameras in public for a year.

I&#39;m sure that somewhere buried in the terms and conditions is a statement that allows Amazon AI to analyze your video footage for products that they can monetize.

That way, the next time you log into amazon.com, they can recommend winter floor mats for the 2018 Toyota RAV-4 they see in your driveway and flea and tick medication for the golden retriever that you take for walks every afternoon.

Oh, and if those flowers are looking a bit wilted come spring, maybe they should recommend some fertilizer as well.

I don&#39;t give a shit about the cops knowing things about me.  I don&#39;t commit crimes. This is literally the kind of thinking that got us here, to the point of surveilance capitalism.  Because credulous people like you thing that wanting privacy means someone is doing something nefarious.  How&#39;s that worked out?

Dude, the discussion is about a commodity product millions of people are buying and using that requires next to zero technical aptitude.

There&#39;s always a few adorable lunkheads who chime on these discussions about how responsible and well reasoned their decisions are, but for whatever reason they&#39;re unable to spot why that is fully orthogonal to the expressed concern. Unless you actually believe there is some reality in which the solution to the expressed concern is simply that if you just chime in enough, e

As someone who always waits for the &quot;xx.3&quot; versions (and often skips the even ones), I do too.

I&#39;ve been using Linux since the 90s and when I was younger, I loved tweaking and getting the newest stuff.  But these days I want it to &quot;just work&quot;(tm) and not have the UI and features not change a lot.

OS providers like Microsoft have forgotten the purpose of an operating system, They believe that the purpose of computing is the operating system, when in fact, it is supposed to allow us to run the programs we work with, then get the hell out of the way.Indeed. The purpose of an OS is to make things possible and to bother you are little as possible. Same, incidentally, for Office programs. MS seems to instead optimize &quot;engagement&quot; with their OS and Office programs, i.e. they waste as much of your time as possible with far too deep menu structures, changing things around, minimal customization for users, low/no customization persistence, and other crap that makes their stuff a permanent load on your attention capacity.Essentially, they are doing &quot;attention economy&quot; instead of &quot;professional tool economy&quot; and it is a massive problem now. The second indicator is that reliability and security are slowly getting worse and worse. They probably cannot fix that anymore and hence need to be replaced. In Europe, that process has started.

I never did figure out Mint&#39;s versions.  Like what&#39;s the difference between 22.1, 22.2, and 22.3? Seems like all three versions exist at once and most updates are within the minor point version.  Last I had Mint it wasn&#39;t an automatic one-click upgrade between, for example,  22.2 and 22.3?  That kind of gave me pause when installing it for people.

My laptop is in dire need of a refresh (Ubuntu 20.04 believe it or not).  I&#39;m thinking of going back to LMDE instead of regular Mint.  Although would be nice to ha

>&quot;Last I had Mint it wasn&#39;t an automatic one-click upgrade between, for example, 22.2 and 22.3? That kind of gave me pause when installing it for people.&quot;

Not sure what you mean.  I &quot;one click&quot; upgraded from every version.  It was actually a few clicks, because it warns you to make a backup and such.  And you click to skip the features list.  But it is an &quot;in-place upgrade&quot; to the next version.  I have been doing it for years on many machines and haven&#39;t had any issue on any of them (knock on wood).

Well go to mint&#39;s website.  They have no less than four versions of 22 listed. Why?  Why should you need backups to go from 22.1 to 22.2 to 22.3?  Why do I need an &quot;in-place upgrade?&quot;  Doesn&#39;t make any sense to me.  As far as I know the last computer I set up for someone with Mint 22 is probably still on 22.1 or whatever it was when I set it up.  I don&#39;t understand at all the need for a manual step to bump between minor versions.  Ubuntu has no such thing.  And the RHEL world where I spent my professional c

>&quot;Well go to mint&#39;s website. They have no less than four versions of 22 listed. Why?&quot;

Don&#39;t know what you are talking about.  When you go here:  https://www.linuxmint.com/down...  [linuxmint.com] it shows one version, the current one, 22.3.  If you go to the Download ALL area here:  https://www.linuxmint.com/down... [linuxmint.com] then they list ALL their versions since the beginning of Mint.  It is just a reference archive.

Wow in-place updates between point releases used to require a complete reinstall? Yikes.

Sorry I mispoke.  &quot;dnf update&quot; not &quot;upgrade.&quot;  As for &quot;upgrade&quot; I assume that&#39;s a full OS replacement.  dnf update just updates packages[1] like apt does on debian and ubuntu.  Always the latest point version. AlmaLinux 9.7, etc.  On Mint though apt sticks within the minor version near as I can tell unless you change the apt.sources.

I guess I just don&#39;t see the logic in the way Mint does it.  I think they&#39;ll have to aban

>&quot;Outside of needed security fixes, the rapid release cycle can get to be a real pain in the ass.&quot;

I concur.  If the choice is between giving up on some of Mint&#39;s goodness (like important native packages offered instead of damn containers only), or stretching the cycle to a little later, the latter makes more sense to me.  Mint has been a fantastic distro.

Yeah it&#39;s not a bad idea, it seems like there&#39;s not a whole lot of difference between major versions and they&#39;re probably making a lot of work for themselves to deliver a &quot;major version update&quot; that&#39;s just like the previous one but with slightly newer packages and maybe 1 meaningful functional difference, meanwhile the version older than either of those still works just fine and can run totally up-to-date packages as well...

Mint is the best out of the box experience for me, and just a hassle-free daily driver.

Agree completely. Mint is perfectly suitable for a daily driver. I found answers quickly in the forums, and I provided answers to the forum in the hopes that it would help others. Only real issue I remember having is pulseaudio sometimes burning 7% cpu on an idle laptop with no sound playing (but apparently I&#39;m reading now that pipewire is a successor)Yes, the forums have changed a lot from when I started. Still have to be careful. Some people make solutions more complicated than need be.

Ohh, I will need to look into pipewire. I&#39;ve never been all that into pulseaudio.

Funny thing is, while canvassing for students, I got a lot of more experienced people who offer to teach. 

And here&#39;s where it gets odd. I have picked a person to assist with teaching. A woman who pretty much lives in Terminal. I do both GUI and terminal, and plan on learning from her as well. And part of the reason why I chose her is that she isn&#39;t doing the typical guy thing. She&#39;s an apt teacher.

Fedora or Fedora Atomic based OSes. https://bazzite.gg/ [bazzite.gg] or https://getaurora.dev/en [getaurora.dev] for windows-like desktop and/or gaming. https://projectbluefin.io/ [projectbluefin.io] if you don&#39;t mind a more traditional Linux/MacOS look and don&#39;t care about gaming at all.

The community over at Linux Mint is showing the pressure. Under the gun, and unable to process even basic issues, they turn on users and blame them for problems and bugs they experience, telling them their use case is flawed when the reality is they just don&#39;t have the resources to deal with the issue.  Now, not having the resources is one thing, and a fair response.  But turning it back on the user and telling them their use case is flawed when they experience is the tail wagging the dog.

Another community I saw this in for a long time, and I really thought the project would implode, was the Palemoon browser.  They got behind when webcomponents became a thing and they could keep up with changes.  They too would blame the user when yet another web site that didn&#39;t work on the browser was encountered, telling them they should be using the site, should complain about the site, and why would they need a site like that anyway??

Palemoon dragged themselves out of it.  They buckled down, and it&#39;s almost back to being a useful browser again.  But the community at Mint concerns me.  They are on the down swing.  User blaming and load shedding are just symptoms of a larger issue.  Too much work for too few volunteers.  They also don&#39;t have a good end-to-end workflow strategy.   By that I mean in many cases they don&#39;t seem to treat the OS as a coherent whole that is used for actual workflows from beginning to end.  Pieces that have no replacement are deprecated while resources are spent on pieces that have many duplicates.

I can&#39;t even get Mint to boot, and haven&#39;t for years.  It stubbornly keeps telling me that my media isn&#39;t a bootable system drive.  Apparently, the Mint team is doing something custom with the boot process that requires you to add security keys in the BIOS for it to start properly, but they don&#39;t tell you this on the download page and the community has been remarkably quiet and unhelpful about this issue.

Fortunately Clement Lefebvre didn&#39;t go full blown the GNOME style anti-user attitude, and recognized the issue is valid at the end. A damage control from JosephMcc calling it &quot;isn&#39;t a bug&quot; and &quot;no plans to change it&quot; in https://github.com/linuxmint/c... [github.com]

>&quot;Mint isn&#39;t even that great of a distro.&quot;

Compared to what?  Mint is stable, polished, reliable, and functional.  Its updates and upgrades have all been extremely well-done.  They offer native packages for important software.  They put out an easy and functional desktop that is still compatible with Ubuntu so it has instant mind-share.  Millions of people use it.  It is on the top or near the top of nearly every list of best distros I have seen, for years.

I don&#39;t see how your comment is at all accurate o

Compared to what?Almost all other major distros and their derivatives? Mint is just Ubuntu with a bunch of pre-installed, pre-configured software aka bloat that often times regular people don&#39;t even need. And Ubuntu also isn&#39;t that great because it&#39;s just shittier Debian. Plus Mint&#39;s entire philosophy, and their attempts to fulfill it, is a hopeless endeavor. Not to mention, when their are security issues the Mint team doesn&#39;t say shit. So, I can wholeheartedly say Linux Mint and it&#39;s entire team of maintainers and contributors can go fuck themselves.Fedora and Arch (and those derived from them) are almost always better. Even openSUSE is pretty good - though it&#39;s UI is a bit heavy handed.

Debian -> Ubuntu -> Mint. Mint IS the downstream. Cinnamon, MATE, and Xfce are all ass. And while I don&#39;t like GNOME, it&#39;s better than those 3.

Bazzite seems to be the new hotness for user friendly Linux distributions, which seems to be stealing Mint&#39;s thunder in that space.

Businesses will probably continue to stick with the stable and reliable Linux distros like Ubuntu, Debian, and RHEL. So, who is Mint for, exactly?

Bazzite is fantastic and my current daily driver since it&#39;s basically a Fedora based SteamOS plus all standard desktop features. I also like it because it is an immutable OS so neither I nor a random program can accidentally fuck up the OS.

The creators of Bazzite also have two other projects, Aurora and Bluefin. Bluefin is designed for workstations only, so it would make for a good business OS as well.

However I&#39;m not a gamer and do not use Nvidia GPUs.

If I was to complain it would be that the Libreoffice version is not very recent and was not updated on the 22.3 release. That probably applies to other programs in the library as well.

There are also some broken links for the /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 program when I was trying to figure out whether the older PCs I have are V1, V2, or V3. The link is there or not there depending on the machine, and when I hunted down the actual fil

This sounds like enough complaints that I would find a new distro that doesn&#39;t have those problems (or any newer ones). And I would mainly look at Fedora based projects aimed for workstations like https://projectbluefin.io/ [projectbluefin.io].

The new improved System Information shows the CPU but the old display of all the instructions is gone so It&#39;s had to figure out what is and is not supported. Hopefully they will put the X86-64 feature version level on the display on a future update. Apparently kernels are going to start caring.To get the old system information corpus, press the &quot;copy&quot; button and paste it into a text editor or anywhere that can type text.

Would be LMDE without systemd.  I&#39;m intrigued by Xlibre, maybe that would be cool too, but I don&#39;t have experience with it yet.  I&#39;m not expecting anybody to do it.  But if somebody has the chops and the energy to pull it off, maybe this&#39;ll plant the idea in their head.

A filter excluding any story titles starting with the word &quot;Is&quot;?

Yep. Another &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; problem is sensationalist bullshit headline, like this one.

Mint has a small team, and right now, Linux is in a time of rapid development for gaming on PCs with Steam, Wayland, enhanced gaming drivers, and such. I think it makes sense for them to pull back and maybe even just release based on Ubuntu LTS releases every 2 years.

I was a big fan of Mint for a long time because Cinnamon was such a nice alternative to Gnome and Unity. I eventually left for Kubuntu because the Mint devs had ZERO plans to work on Wayland. They wouldn&#39;t even entertain a discussion about a plan to make a plan to even think about working on Wayland while every other DE was in active development and even pushing for its release as default over X11 in upcoming releases. Now, they&#39;re busy playing catch-up bolting support for Wayland onto Cinnamon.

Maintaining a distro is a lot of work, especially for a small team, and they&#39;ve got a LOT to improve on before I could recommend them to any of my gamer friends that are interested in trying out Linux - They&#39;re playing with Bazzite, Kubuntu, CatchyOS, and others.

Long term, I really think Mint should just fold itself into being an official Cinnamon Ubuntu flavor and work on just improving Cinnamon... or they could rebase on a different flavor entirely, like they did with the Debian version. I mean, they can and will do whatever they want, but my experience with them was that they couldn&#39;t see the writing on the wall that Wayland was super important for the future of Linux DEs, and I can&#39;t recommend them right now to anyone as other distros have caught up and gotten so much better. What&#39;s the point of maintaining Mint these days? Who&#39;s the target market that wouldn&#39;t do better on another option? I dunno.

>&quot;because the Mint devs had ZERO plans to work on Wayland&quot;

Yeah.  To me, that is a feature, not a flaw.  I want stability and functionality.  Wayland hasn&#39;t been that and I don&#39;t want to be forced into it right now.  They are of a similar mindset.  It might be there eventually.

> They wouldn&#39;t even entertain a discussion about a plan to make a plan to even think about working on Wayland

Thank fucking God someone is being sane in the GNU/Linux community on this. It&#39;s absolutely unbelievable that a half-assed display system that&#39;s far from finished or feature complete, and is actually less efficient and has higher latency, than X11, is being adopted long after the entire reason for proposing it became obsolete (in 2001 it was difficult to graft a security system onto X11 because t

They may have seen quality dropping or reaction times going up or, yes, a potential &quot;burnout&quot; in the future. Smart people can predict things and prevent getting hit. Only reducing workload when you are already struggling hard is amateur-level. Mint does not strike me as amateur level.

Is this going to happen before, or after I retire?

Yep, gerontocracy has consequences. Ignoring global warming, a failing economic system, and other problems that should be tolerable to the comfortably retired for a few more decades are among them.

While this may seem logical on the surface, real-life older people do actually care about the future of their own children and grandchildren.

You would think so, and if you ask them they&#39;ll certainly claim they do, but this claim is not supported by the voting data.

Based on my own older family members who voted for Trump, I don&#39;t believe they did so because they didn&#39;t care, but because they were deceived.

Based on my own older family members who voted for Trump, I don&#39;t believe they did so because they didn&#39;t care, but because they were deceived.The thing is, they wanted to be deceived -- that gave them an out.  Now they can go to their graves with a clear conscience, because they &quot;know&quot; global warming is a myth and therefore they didn&#39;t really doom their grandchildren.  That&#39;s all they wanted, is some comforting lies that would give them permission to not worry about it.

We all lie to ourselves to make ourselves feel better, do we not?

No, we don&#39;t. Don&#39;t judge everyone by your ways.

Oh don&#39;t get on your high horse, we are all susceptible to deception. We&#39;re just susceptible to different *kinds* of deception.

I disagree, the real question is are they ready to ban civilian air travel?

If no one is willing to give up that luxury then whatever posturing they do they are not actually worried.

They can recycle the cruise ships at the same time.

YouTube has a channel for Haulover Inlet. You can watch the big pleasure craft with 4 to 6 20 gph outboards going in and out of harbor. They aren&#39;t worried either.

You do realize they&#39;ll never &quot;eat&quot; those costs, right? They&#39;ll pass them on to you the consumer and maintain their profits and bonuses. I dislike being that cynical, but the tariffs have shown us extra costs are passed on.

We (for a value which does not include maggots) already knew that about tariffs and also about everything else.

I do not understand why people see the concept of costs being passed on to consumers as controversial. If a corporation ceases to make a profit, it ceases to exist. If a corporation is taxed into oblivion and cannot meet the payroll, people stop working there and it stops creating goods and services. Their only existential option is to pass new costs onto consumers.Why is this difficult for people to understand?

I dislike being that cynical, but the tariffs have shown us extra costs are passed on.You are indeed being overly cynical.   You&#39;re right that they don&#39;t want to eat those costs, but you&#39;re missing that they also don&#39;t want to lose market share (and therefore sales) to a competitor who is able to charge less because the competitor doesn&#39;t incur those costs.Which is to say, if there is an alternative way to provide the same (or similar) product cheaper by reducing/avoiding expensive CO2 emissions, they&#39;ll switch to that, as a way to remain competitive.  Which is the desired outcome.

History is well populated by traces of civilizations brought low by climate change, possibly including the moment when the entire human population was reduced to perhaps 1000 individuals (i.e., we almost didn&#39;t make it). So it is interesting thatthere was much rejoicing that almost the entire collection of climate change efforts, such as they were, have been eliminated by the current administration. Strange that -- almost as though MAGA meant &#39;make america go away&#39;. Now I have never been one to think that a

The species will survive but civilization as we know it most certainly will not survive. A small subset (read rich people) will have the money to build secure, self-sustaining and very likely fully autonomous areas. Some already own islands large enough for purpose.

For a short while, sure. But who will be available to replenish their wine cellars?

Should drop worldwide temperatures by 10-20 degrees. Will also help depopulate and deindustrialize the world a bit. It&#39;s a win/win.I wouldn&#39;t describe the deaths of billions as &quot;win/win&quot;.  More like &quot;lose/lose/lose/lose/lose/lose/win/lose/lose/lose/lose&quot;, maybe.

Will it be this utter hell some are predicting? Probably not. But it will be toasty. An odd thing is some places will get colder.

There will be increased rainfall, there will be a bit of a wildcard as pent-up subsoil methane is released. The big wild card is if oceanic methane clathrates somehow get released.

There were events in the last half million years that changed the temperature by up to 16 degrees C in fairly short time periods. Well, about 12 degrees [researchgate.net], but that aside, every species that exists, evolved with the current inter-glacial, glaciation cycle of the past couple and a half million years. 
The current warming is different in two ways.  One: The warming is from the top of an interglacial. Many ecosystems that could move to address a cooling from the top of an interglacial will not be able to move in the other direction, because they will hit the top of mountains of the edge of continents.  Two: This warming is much faster. You

I keep in my heart Carl Sagans monologue about how every petty little human being who ever lived, lived on this tiny blue dot, while showing the picture of earth as shown by Voyager millions of miles away from earth.  The end of his Cosmos show.

It breaks my heart how we are pissing it all away now.   It seems to be a &quot;battle&quot;  between people who want to cooperate, and people who want to destroy.

&quot;Scientists thought they understood global warming. Then the past three years happened.&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com... [washingtonpost.com]

Yes, we are fucked in the ass. The worst case scenarios are likely if not optimistic.

The paywall really puts a damper on the doomsaying, though.  Reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from Stargate:

Dr. Rodney McKay: Why wait? Why does the guy show up a day-and-a-half after this all starts to do his whole &quot;Prepare to meet your doom&quot; thing?Major Samantha Carter: I don&#39;t know. Maybe he wanted to make sure it was gonna work.Dr. Rodney McKay: Yeah, that would be embarrassing, wouldn&#39;t it? &quot;Nothing can stop the destruction that I bring upon you!&quot; Then the gate shuts down. &quot;Oops, sorry. Never mind.&quot;

I recall in the very early days of the Covid pandemic, months before lockdowns hit the US, a post I read on Slashdot.

It was looking at the evidence coming out of China and some other early spots, all pointing to the inevitability of the disease ripping through the rest of the world. It concluded with something like, &quot;We&#39;re fucked.&quot;

Oh, he burned through all of his goodwill with everybody who doesn&#39;t love the horrible things he&#39;s doing.  A whole lot of people across the world will no longer buy a Tesla, and a whole lot of Tesla drivers are embarrassed to drive them.  This is in Europe too.

So now the guy promises to turn Tesla into an AI/robotics company that will change the world.

Except that EVs existed before Tesla.  Except he was not a first mover.  He just got the right timing and the right product for that moment.

And your priority for the $20,000 price differential is to spend it on a luxury vehicle? I would prioritize rent, land, or retirement.

So, you would rather drive a Chinese EV than a Tesla? I do not know where you are from, but I still think you have some wrong priorities.If you are implying that Tesla is a better option because China is not trustworthy, then sure - there are reasons to be suspicious about China, but I wouldn&#39;t trust Musk as far as I could throw him.

Quite a few Chinese-made cars came before Biden and Trump blocked them.

What&#39;s not really said in a lot of alarmist climate change stories is that this stuff doesn&#39;t happen all at once. It&#39;s not like we cross 2 degrees and then we&#39;re in a perpetual 300 degree oven. No. What actually happens is the areas that are already deserts, cook, and that self-perpetuating cooking starts spreading northward and southward as the doldrums widen and change density. So everywhere that&#39;s currently a tropical climate becomes impossible to live in, and place

Easiest planetary body in our Solar System to terraform would be the Earth. Even after a climate catastrophe, nuclear winter, and asteroid impact all at once.

There&#39;s no where to run. The only choice is how expensive y&#39;all want to make Earth&#39;s recovery.

So, the ice caps will again disappear like they were supposed to in 2012?

When are people going to stop falling for this. They have been CATASTROPHICALLY wrong every single time.And hopefully they will continue to be wrong, because if eventually they aren&#39;t wrong we are fucked in a way that is 100% fatal for everyone.
The biggest problem, that nobody wants to talk about (for good reason), is that there is no way to reverse our collision course with disaster without completely destroying our economy and everyone goes back to riding horses and living in caves.

Mars is already a completely unlivable hellscape of a planet.  Economically and technologically speaking, it&#39;s far easier to just not screw up Earth any worse than it already is than terraform Mars.

We should terraform mars anyway.It lost its atmosphere once already. Even if you could pipe in a new one, how are you going to stop it blowing away? You can&#39;t glue it down.

You can&#39;t glue it down.A new atmosphere would take millions of years to dissipate.  Such an atmosphere could &quot;easily&quot; be protected indefinitely from erosion by installation of a handful of superconducting rings around the planet.  Only a few GW of power would be required to power the rings.

This is of course bullshit designed to keep us not making changes so you don&#39;t have to be inconvenienced

2012 was the record minimum for Artic sea ice. So someone&#39;s model seemed to be onto something.

Now the journalist that wrote the science piece dumbed down so that you could understand it likely did a poor job of explaining it.

But there are so many models and theories that offer up different specifics but similar generalities that it can be frustrating for laypeople to make sense of it all.

2012 was the record minimum for Artic sea ice.For extent, yes it was. For volume, it may have been 2018 [uw.edu].

Do you have a citation for that prediction?

>> They have been CATASTROPHICALLY wrong every single time.

So, the ice caps will again disappear like they were supposed to in 2012?That was one prediction by Dr Wieslaw Maslowski of the Naval Postgraduate School in California. And not for either ice cap. Nor for 2012. It was for the northern summer sea ice, and was based on the 28% drop in minimum extent between summer 2006 and summer 2007  being a tipping point rather than, as it turned out, a bad year. 

And the prediction was &quot;inside five to seven years&quot; which was about 2013-2014 not 2012. 
And while the denialiosphere will use one paper and claim that it discredits the entire fields of thermodynamics, optics and earth science, it doesn&#39;t. 
But even then they don&#39;t usually claim that it was a prediction of total ice loss of Greenland (Which would raise sea levels about 7 metres), much less Antarctica (Which would raise sea levels a further 58 metres). 
Congratulations. You&#39;ve managed to hit a whole new level of wrong.When are people going to stop falling for thisOh, the irony.They have been CATASTROPHICALLY wrong every single time.Wrong again. The models have been improving, but even Hansen&#39;s 1981 model is pretty close, if a little conservate. Since the late 80s, they&#39;ve been pretty much bang on the nose. [realclimate.org]

They actually found that antarctic ice (as a whole) is increasing due to increased water-vapor in the atmosphere and more snow falling.Are you sure? The measurements are showing a pretty heavy mass loss in Antarctica [nasa.gov]. 
I think you might have just made that up yourself.

Name one climate prediction over the last 40 years that came close to truth. Here&#39;s an analysis of how the major models have preformed [realclimate.org], with respect to global mean surface temperature predictions. 

The one from the early 80s was a bit conservative, but they&#39;ve all been pretty close since then. 

Perhaps you can link to a few of these papers you think got it wrong?In 2006, former vice-president Al Gore projected that unless drastic measures were implemented, the planet would hit an irreversible “point of no return” by 2016. Game over.We&#39;ve past 350 ppm of CO2, which is the level that will come with the high-cost high casualty impacts of greater than 1.5C of warming.  Currently we&#39;re at 427 ppm. 
So Gore hasn&#39;t been shown to be wrong. Perhaps the problems is that you don&#39;t understand that it takes decades for half the warming from an increase in CO2 to have occurred. Ice-albedo feedback in particular takes centuries. 
Nor Pachuri.James Hansen, drew a line in the sand testifying before Congress in June 2008, on the dangers of greenhouse gases: “We’re toast if we don’t get on a very different path. This is the last chance.”Do you have any evidence that he was wrong? Or are you hoping, without basing that hope on any facts that you can point to?

We are 10 years past Al Gores, &quot;Point of no return&quot;. So, are you saying that you think that there is no longer any action we can take that would avoid a complete disaster?Every kilogram of CO2 makes it worse. But the opportunity to keep the earth below 1.5 degrees of warming, passed about the time Gore was speaking of. 8 degrees of warming is worse than 7.5 degrees of warming.Ice sheets are growing. It blows me away that you can post in a thread with multiple links to how much the ice sheets are shedding mass, and claim that the Ice sheets are growing. 
[B]etween 2002 and 2025, Antarctica shed approximately 135 gigatons of ice per year [nasa.gov].

Ok. You win. They were right.Yeah, I know. There&#39;s a lot of science that&#39;s been done on this.No use doing anything. All the coastlines world wide will be underwater soon.Nope. It&#39;s still useful to do everything we can.

If by all, you mean the northern summer sea ice. The Antarctic sea ice is fed by glaciers, so won&#39;t be entirely lose until tho

How exactly did you shit that out? Are those OCR errors?

Nobody gives a fuck whether the climate before we existed would have supported us. What matters is now and this is an unprecedented situation with previously unseen rates of change.

Okey dokey coward. Run along and let the adults have a conversation now, I hear your mom calling me.

Is it warming? Probably (hard to tell with all the &#39;smoothing&#39; and &#39;adjusting&#39; of data going on, but I&#39;d agree it probably is.)No, it&#39;s not hard to tell at all.Is it driven by humans? Utterly not, though almost certainly we&#39;re aggravating it.The current trend line&#39;s deviation from the long term cyclical glacial periods of the Quaternary ice age is 100% driven by human activity. Period.Is it faster than ever, historically speaking? Utterly not.That&#39;s actually hard to say, but also not relevant.
In times when it may have, we simply do not have decade-resolution temperature data.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org] = 90% of the last 500m years has been warmer than today.Absolutely true. Humans evolved, basically in whole, during the Quaternary. It&#39;s not clear we will even be able to survive when Earth leaves it.
This has nothing to do with climate change right now

The oceans have also been 3-5m higher than they are now. I agree we shouldn&#39;t make things worse than needed, but let&#39;s not forget that the climate changes on its own up and down over time.

Rate of change matters.  Just because I can use the brakes in my car to reduce speed slowly doesn&#39;t mean stopping by hitting a brick wall at full speed is at all safe.

Ecosystems need time to adjust to new temperatures, so they don&#39;t collapse.

The last ice age has been retreating for the last 20k years. There was a bit of a cooling period from 13,500 to 12,500 years ago, and another form but nothing like a real ice age.

The oil and gas companies you mean? All of it, and all of our lives as well.

>> The usual state for the Earth is tropical all over, with no ice at the poles.

>> Eh. They&#39;re right. You will find that evidence yourself if you go look.

According to wikipedia;&quot;Throughout Earth&#39;s climate history (Paleoclimate) its climate has fluctuated between two primary states: greenhouse and icehouse Earth. Both climate states last for millions of years &quot;

So, not usually &quot;tropical all over, with no ice at the poles&quot;.

So, not usually &quot;tropical all over, with no ice at the poles&quot;.Yes, it is.

Nothing in your quote stated the equivalence of the time periods past &quot;last for millions of years&quot;.
I.e., the quote was correct. You just read what you wanted to read into it.

What I find most bizarre, is that there&#39;s literally a graph directly under where you copy-pasted that showing where, and how long, the Ice Ages lasted.
If you had gone down even further, it would have literally listed them for you, and then you could simply do the math showing that 4160 > 609.

It is not a panic, and it is not a zero sum game.   Certainly you agree on the trends of CO2 in the atmosphere, and the increase in Temperatures?  Yes?

Build &quot;all of the above&quot; energy sources, I think.   Let the market win.

PS. I suspect the coal plants China is building is a hedge against a nuclear war.

Yeah, like the negative temperatures across the entire midwest and upper midwest as well as the mid-atlantic region to New England.

I guess climate for a region is different than for weather in one area.

I think that is partially true.  The gulf stream may stop in the next 50 years.  I think that even this POSSIBILITY is cause for alarm.

The boomers thought pattern is that they got theirs, and screw everybody else.

As part of: &quot;Everybody Else&quot;, I don&#39;t agree, even if you are a Tyrannical Majority.

Answers in the report. Generally the answer is no to most of your statements. Wages aren&#39;t going up to a degree that would indicate people moving up into higher paying jobs. Unemployment ticked down only to 4.3% from 4.4%âoe&quot;which doesn&#39;t show Americans suddenly getting jobs, remember unemployement is measured by benefits application which is not available to illegal immigrants. That number is effectively the citizens and legal residents unemployment number.

This is a job market stagnation. Potentially

here it means clutching at imaginary straws in the face of incontrovertible evidence of a massive political and economic failure.

We have yet to reach the level of stove touching this nation requires.  If anything I&#39;m worried about the midterms in that the Democrats will be able to stop some of Trump&#39;s worst actions and his supporters will be allowed to move on yet again without suffering their justly deserved consequences.

If the Democrats get a large enough wave, ie. they get 60 senate seats and the house, do you think they will remove Trump and Vance from office, thus elevating the Speaker (who will be a Democrat, whoever that may be)?

I mean, I can&#39;t see why they shouldn&#39;t do that, but do you think they will?

60 isn&#39;t enough for removal, it&#39;s 67 Senators.  Maybe in that case you can get 7 Republican Senators to go for it but I doubt it.  If Democrats get a simple majority of be happy enough at this point considering the state of the Senate map.

Now 60 lets them send bills to Trump&#39;s desk without blowing up the filibuster and that&#39;s something can/should do, just keep passing bills and either make him veto them or I bet he actually signs some of them.

Such a wave would be a start of the Seventh Party System. But I seriously doubt the survival of the Democratic party in it&#39;s current state. We may see splits in the parties and a reevaluation of two party elections on the national level. Things are going to be very chaotic over the next decade

The Democrats are the responsible college girls with their natural tits and hair color.  The Republican party has degraded into the equivalent of 19yo party girls with too many tattoos at Daytona Spring Break, who will be dancing the pole once they hit 21.
Adulting sucks.  Promising tax breaks you can&#39;t afford? That&#39;s a party!  Rounding up the &quot;illegals&quot; with paramilitary force to round up some underpaid grocery baggers?  That&#39;s fucking fun if you&#39;re inclined to such things.  Some fucking braindead roid-abusing 72 yo anti-vax macho natural living fitness freak telling you to try all the supplements advertised on Joe Rogan&#39;s Podcast is far more fun than an actual physician telling you to take positive steps towards your health in conjunction with medical science.   
The Democrats are cursed with being a responsible adult party.  They attempt to balance budgets and pass policy and make the world a better place.  Some think they&#39;re too liberal (they&#39;re honestly VERY centrist if you listen to actual elected DNC politicians instead of twitter stereotypes provided by Fox News).  They know that if they&#39;re elected, the adults that voted for them will hold them accountable.  Republicans?  The adults left that party LONG ago.  Now they can promise whatever they want and do whatever they want and it will barely matter.   
Your tariff policy is a failure?...no problem.   
The economy is in a recession?...no problem.   
ICE raids are pointless, ineffective theater and insanely expensive?...no problem. 
Cowering to Russia, our long time foe,  over and over?...no problem.   

The Democrats lose votes when they fail.  Rational voters vote Democrat and don&#39;t when the Democrats don&#39;t deliver.  Republicans appeal to emotion only, fail every time they&#39;re in office and basically never lose their voters...when they fail, it&#39;s because they fail so spectacularly and leave the economy in such shambles that the rational adults that are displeased with the Democrats get off their ass and vote.  Their voters will NEVER abandon the party, no matter how badly they fail or deviate from the stated ideals of the voter.  It&#39;s depressing, but it&#39;s life.  There&#39;s no liberal or conservative anymore.  Fox news destroyed 10-15 years ago.  Now we have a party of grifters and loons and a party for everyone else.  No one rationally benefits from Republican administrations beyond the top 1% of earners.  Billionaires soak up all those tax breaks...everyone else watches their quality of live and income go down...institutions fail, etc.  Nothing about today&#39;s Republican Party is actually conservative, certainly not fiscally.

If the Democrats get a large enough wave, ie. they get 60 senate seats and the house, do you think they will remove Trump and Vance from office, thus elevating the Speaker (who will be a Democrat, whoever that may be)?

I mean, I can&#39;t see why they shouldn&#39;t do that, but do you think they will?

...are far more fun than ones who eat right, exercise, contribute to their 401k, avoid credit card debt and balance their checkbook.  The Democrats are the responsible college girls with their natural tits and hair color.  The Republican party has degraded into the equivalent of 19yo party girls with too many tattoos at Daytona Spring Break, who will be dancing the pole once they hit 21.

If anything I&#39;m worried about the midterms in that the Democrats will be able to stop some of Trump&#39;s worst actions and his supporters will be allowed to move on yet again without suffering their justly deserved consequences.The thing I worry about is whether the Democrats can avoid shooting themselves in the foot between now and November. They&#39;ve snatched defeat from the jaws of victory on more than one occasion in the past...

Wrong. If we let it slide then it doesn&#39;t end in 3 years. Possible never ends. This is the fundamental mistake that the majority of people are making right now.

And the total number of layoffs of American tech workers in 2022-2025 was in the hundreds of thousands.

Not necessarily.  Many of those 85k jobs were likely replacing people who left, and thus presumably would not have counted in the 181,000 figure.

It is estimated that 25% of people in India do not have access to a toilet.  That is approximately 400 million people, roughly equivalent to the entire population of the U.S. and Canada combined, literally shitting in the street. And the number of people who are illiterate is far above any western country.   But go ahead and tell me about how all the Indian workers being used to replace Americans are &quot;highly skilled workers&quot;.The other 75% who aren&#39;t shitting in the streets are twice as many people as the US and Canada. You start hiring from the top of the list, not the bottom.
In the real world though...you hire from the cheapest who are &quot;good enough&quot;. With a sprinkling of top talent as a garnish.

At least 200 for Mar a Lago. https://www.theguardian.com/us... [theguardian.com]

They can&#39;t hire red blooded MAGA workers to pick weeds and serve well done steaks?

My point still stands. Why are they not hiring citizens?

> Those are H1A visas, which goes to seasonal workers, who work during the peak season, and then go back to their home countries when the season is over

Far fewer after October 1 when you basically needed to pay an extra full year&#39;s salary to hire an H-1b over a citizen.

> One bright spot was last month, when hiring increased by 130,000 roles. This was significantly more than the 55,000 additions that had been expected by economists.

Bet: in six months the BLS will &quot;revise&quot; this figure down to ~55k, at the same time they announce the chocolate ration will be reduced from thirty grams to twenty.

Why is the media still treating this horseshit propaganda like it remotely reflects reality?

I suspect there will be some weasel wording around &quot;gross&quot; versus &quot;net&quot;. A lot of people I know are getting laid off while their companies continue hiring. It&#39;s not even a shift in resources or skillsets, it&#39;s a true revolving door.

Why is the media still treating this horseshit propaganda like it remotely reflects reality?Take a look at who owns the media.

Why is the media still treating this horseshit propaganda like it remotely reflects reality?

According to the BLS report the margin of error for the 130,000 jobs in Jan is +/- 127,000

Revisions are normal and not a sign of political interference (despite Trump&#39;s many attempts TO interfere). The preliminary numbers are based on relatively small survey samples, while the revisions are based on a much larger data set drawn from concrete data. https://journalistsresource.or... [journalistsresource.org]

&quot;Still, Wednesday’s report also shows that not nearly as many jobs were added in 2025 as thought and last year will go down as the worst year for hiring since 2020, or since 2003 outside of a recession.&quot;

Furthermore, most of the jobs added last month were in health care and social assistance which are generally regarded as less susceptible to economic cycles.

The question is whether this is simply reflective of the trough of an economic cycle or more fundamental, lasting shifts due to tariffs, geopoliti

&quot;Preliminary data had indicated that the U.S. economy added 584,000 jobs last year. But the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised that number after it received additional state data, and found that the labor market had added 181,000 jobs in all of 2025. [...] One bright spot was last month, when hiring increased by 130,000 roles.&quot;

Okay, but how &quot;preliminary&quot; will the data for last month turn out to be?

They say the point of the liarocracy is not to make people believe lies. (Though many seem to anyway!)  The poi

None.  Not now, and not ever.  The economic numbers are always cooked, and the people doing the cooking never have your interests in mind.

Imagine honestly believing inflation has only been 3 or 4% per year for the past 15 years.

It really depends on what you&#39;re buying.  Also, 15 years of 3.5% compound interest is not negligible.

Imagine honestly believing inflation has only been 3 or 4% per year for the past 15 years.Average?  Yeah, probably.Description: 2010 / projected 2025 at 4% per year / actual 2025):
New house: 221,900 / 399,621 / 498,000 (higher)Median rent: 1,083 / 1950 / 1703 (lower)New car: 24,296 / 43,755 / 50,326 (higher)Base iPhone model:  599 / 1078 / 799 (lower)Gallon of milk: 3.25 / 5.85 / 4.42 (lower)So a few things that people buy infrequently went up way faster than inflation, while things that you buy far more often tended to go up way more slowly than inflation.

So a few things that people buy infrequently went up way faster than inflation, while things that you buy far more often tended to go up way more slowly than inflation.

Glossing over housing and rent? ... One went up, one went down. The people most affected the most by inflation are those unlikely to have a house (renters) who experienced lower figures. Meanwhile those who are most likely to buy a house right now do so with the capital of selling an existing one.

So yeah, housing numbers impact inflation, but the cost of housing doesn&#39;t impact the people most impacted by the rising cost of living.

But by all means, come up with your own numbers so we can blindly shit on them

what also needs to show is individual incomes.

I would also include other very significant income costsHealth InsuranceAuto InsurancePhone/Internet BillsElectric Bills (not just kw/h)GasolineA few more core food items Chicken, Beef, Bread, Broccolicost of media (netflix was enough, not it&#39;s not and it went up in price too)Taxes (mine went up 3+ times since then, which was % base before so it really hurts)And, last but most important is wages!

Well, what&#39;s your evidence about inflation? The CPI iterally is just looking at the prices on a particular basket of goods.  That&#39;s it, it&#39;s not some magic secret formula, it&#39;s all published data.   The only reason Biden was able to be attacked for inflation was the BLS under his own admin published the numbers, do you believe inflation was only 2% in 2021 instead of like 10? I mean &quot;they&quot; are always lying right?

How much trust can you have in any data coming out of the current USA government these days?

But look at the numbers - no job growth? Trump is boasting the economy is better than ever and jobs are plentiful. The fact the BLS is reporting that no jobs were created goes against what Dear Leader is saying. Which means likely Dear Leader needs to pick a new chief of BLS. The old one was fired because she refused to make the numbers look better.

Remember, Dear Leader keeps saying the economy is boom

While I agree (dogmatically), there are signs around where I am living of workforce expansion.  I can&#39;t tell if it is more people picking up second jobs, working extra hours, or something else, but I notice restaurants expanding hours, construction companies running full crews, and more professional landscape crews around.

I can&#39;t tell if the economy has picked up to match-- my Costco bill is still up 50% a month, and there aren&#39;t obvious signs that people feel like they have more disposable income.  Time wi

>>One bright spot was last month, when hiring increased by 130,000 roles

Getting difficult to deal with all this winning.

One bright spot .. Job gains occurred in health care, social assistance, and construction

This just goes to show: we need more terrorism and hurricanes, so that the resulting injuries and destruction can further brighten the spots of health care and construction labor.

If you&#39;re a patriotic American, then please do your part to increase GDP and employment, by breaking a window today! And if the glass shards hurt someone, so much the better. Economic growth is economic growth!

Yes, we are fucked in the ass.  The worst case scenarios are likely if not optimistic.

It is assumed that BEV costs are essentially equivalent to ICE costs.  Part of this comes from an assumption that all cars of any type are only leased.  However, even with that assumption, this equivalence assumption is certainly not true now and remains to be seen whether it will be true in the future.

>>It is assumed that the solar-battery home installation is completely free. This is a huge cost that is completely absent from the analysis.

This statement is completely false.  The article actually goes into great detail on the costs of the solar-off-grid (SOG) charging system and includes SOG costs in the total cost of ownership calculations.

&quot;The SOG CAPEX consists of four hard-cost components, the solar PV panel, inverter, stationary lithium-ion battery and balance of system (BOS), and one soft-cost component, installation. Each hard-cost component is sized to the application-specific use case in the SOG sizing optimization model (details below). &quot;

If you build it, they will come?

Hmm, the prices aren&#39;t that out of whack with reality.

5KwH battery https://www.jackery.com/produc...  [jackery.com]  From Jackery $3100.

They have a bundle for $5100 that comes with 1kw of solar panels and a smart transfer switch. That&#39;s high for the panels and I haven&#39;t priced the switch out.

This is off Alibaba. 5kw complete system. Panels, wires, inverter, battery. $865 + $384 in shipping. If you double the 865 to $1730 (100% tariff rate), you are still only out of $2114.

The costs in Africa are also far cheaper than in the US.

This reminds me of an article I read about non-electric can openers. https://h2g2.com/edited_entry/... [h2g2.com]

Just in case a hurricane, tornado, or nuclear war does ever leave you in need of some serious manual can-opening, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to know how to use one.

This makes my head hurt.  I&#39;ve never even heard of electric can openers.  The linked can opener is a very advanced non-electric one.  I mean, people should know how to use a pocket-knife can-opener.

And if you don&#39;t have that, a knife will do - as long as it&#39;s not a nice, sharp knife that you value.

Yes. Considering how long people normally own a given vehicle, the take-away almost seems to be &quot;make your next car purchase an ICE because electric wont be cheaper until after you get rid of that one at least&quot;.

The cheapest option will be to buy a US college graduation&#39;s student loan and have him pull a rickshaw until he pays you back.

I&#39;m curious how road conditions will affect this.  EVs are generally far heavier than their combustion-powered counterparts, and road conditions can play hell on cars that are heavy.

On top of that if charging infrastructure is slow to be built-out or if it&#39;s more easily damaged in conflicts, it may be hard to get drivers off of gasoline as a fuel that only requires a jug and a funnel to refuel with out in rural areas.

I&#39;m curious how road conditions will affect this....You are right to wonder, as most current EVs one is likely to be familiar with are designed with paved roads in mind.  However, there has been a number of EVs specifically designed for the unpaved roads in some parts of Africa, beginning with local OEMs, but China manufacturers are starting to enter the market too.  You are not likely to see those EVs outside of places like Africa, at least initially (they tend to be more utilitarian in looks and features than customers elsewhere want to buy).

That&#39;s 15 years from now. Anything the hell can happen by 2040 .. maybe in 2040 the great Ijigwabogajooga will rise up from the giant pit of rhinoceros shit? Why do people make stupid ass predictions?

The huge advantage of solar in Africa is that it doesn&#39;t require extensive infrastructure.  Same goes for the introduction of cell towers removing the need for networks of poles and wires.

Solar also greatly improves the balance of payment problems that plague Africa because every panel and every EV imported permanently reduces the unending monthly need to import fuel paid for in USD.  Solar is the energy equivalent of compounding interest.

Total cost of ownership may be lower, but for most people, the sticker price, and especially the monthly payment, is all they look at. If that&#39;s not lower, most will still keep buying the gas cars, because the lower operating costs aren&#39;t as easy to see.

After months of watching federal agents terrorize communities all across the country in the name of immigration enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security’s top brass sat before Congress on Tuesday to answer questions about the deaths of Renée Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, the detention of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, and the fates of countless others who have been caught in the crosshairs of the president’s mass deportation effort. Though Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, mostly deflected any responsibility and insisted that the agency conducts only targeted arrests, Democrats came prepared with receipts to remind us all just how blatantly racist and out of control the White House’s immigration agenda has been.

“You are only here because public outrage has become so unavoidable,” Rep. LaMonica McIver, of New Jersey, said during the House Homeland Security Committee’s oversight hearing. McIver is being prosecuted by the Trump administration over an incident in New Jersey when she was barred from entering a detention facility. “You are here, Mr. Lyons, because white people are getting shot in the face and chest when the cameras are rolling.”

Lyons remained straight-faced, offering no explanation for his agents’ extreme use of force or denial about his agents’ racial profiling of Americans. That profiling is something the Supreme Court essentially endorsed last year, after the justices issued a decision allowing the federal government to stop Hispanic migrants based on their “apparent ethnicity,” as well as other factors, like if they have an accent or work certain types of jobs. This, predictably, has led ICE to overwhelmingly target Black and brown Americans with excessive force.

Indeed, this was one of the main subtexts of the hearing. New Jersey Rep. Nellie Pou, for example, asked, “Mr. Lyons, I speak Spanish. If I wasn’t wearing my member pin, would me being a Latina and speaking Spanish be enough for ICE agents to harass me or shove me into one of your unmarked cars?”

Lyons answered no, but as Pou and other Democratic representatives pointed out, this has not been borne out by the reality on the ground; even off-duty officers have recently been profiled by ICE. When Rep. Troy Carter, of Louisiana, directly asked Lyons if his agency was arresting or deporting Americans, Lyons denied that it was “arresting” Americans, before quickly adding that it did “detain” Americans. As Carter pointed out, this was a distinction without a difference.

When it came to the way agents currently present themselves to Americans, New York Rep. Tim Kennedy asked whether Lyons would instruct his agents to no longer wear masks and institute a uniform that includes visible identification—one of 10 demands congressional Democrats are requesting in the ongoing negotiations over whether to fund DHS beyond Saturday’s deadline. Lyons immediately retorted, “No.”

And when Rep. Eric Swalwell, of California, asked Lyons if he would apologize for his department calling Good and Pretti “domestic terrorists,” he refused. Lyons also insisted that when his agents arrested Ramos as he made his way home from preschool with his father, “the men and women of ICE took care of him.” Later in the hearing, Lyons also claimed that agents played the boy’s favorite song and got him McDonald’s. Meanwhile, it took the intervention of Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro for a visibly unwell Ramos to be released from detention. The administration immediately tried to detain him again.

This was just one of many moments when administration officials offered what felt like a completely different reality from what people on the ground are experiencing with ICE officers.

Rep. Seth Magaziner, of Rhode Island, brought up the case of federal agents in Chicago, who pepper-sprayed a 1-year-old as she sat in the back seat of her father’s car. “Is it proper procedure to aim pepper spray into the window of a moving vehicle?” Magaziner asked Rodney Scott, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who also testified. “We try to avoid that,” he said.

Magaziner continued to push. “Were any of your agents investigated or disciplined for this?”

“I’ll have to get back to you,” Scott said.

Magaziner then showed a video and zoomed-in photo of an agent firing pepper spray directly into the face of a protester who was pinned to the ground by multiple agents and asked if this was proper procedure for the use of pepper spray. “I cannot respond to that because you’re only showing one piece, and that subject is clearly not compliant,” Scott said, while refusing to confirm whether there was an open investigation into those agents.

“Your agency has been repeatedly caught on tape using violence against civilians, and you can’t even tell me if any of these agents have been investigated or disciplined,” Magaziner said. “You are supposed to be making people safer, and instead your agents are being unnecessarily violent.”

Tuesday’s hearing was the first time ICE leadership has testified before Congress under the second Trump administration, as the White House agreed to the testimony in a clear attempt to contain the fallout from Good’s and Pretti’s deaths. Though it will not immediately solve the current chaos being wreaked by the president and his mass deportation mastermind Stephen Miller, the hearing did serve as a cathartic moment of rage. For a brief period of time, Democrats accurately embodied the feelings of Americans all across the country who are facing ICE in their communities with no real defense.

“Sorry, I don’t mean to interrupt you guys.” The man crunches his way toward us, through this snow-covered field and past rows upon rows of identical wooden tombstones, then gestures back in the direction he came from. “I wanted to make sure you’re aware that there’s ICE right there.”

This is how it happens, I was told the day before. Immigration and Customs Enforcement moves fast in Minneapolis, the way you have to when an entire city is against you. Volunteers call in license plates to volunteers who check those plates against databases created by other volunteers. Once identified, these agents have minutes at best before residents with whistles and horns and furious loud voices gather to alert their neighbors to the threat in their midst. If you’re more than five minutes away from a sighting, odds are you’ll be too late. No, the best way to find ICE in Minneapolis is to stay in one place. Go about your day. Eventually, you’ll see them.

I am standing with two Minneapolis residents who go by Tim and Star, looking out at the Say Their Names memorial. The art installation consists of over 100 tombstones, each with identical black fists and names I remember from 2020. Philandro Castile. Ahmaud Arbery. And, of course, George Floyd, who took his final breath two blocks south of here. Minneapolis is no stranger to tragedy, or to the white-hot spotlight of international media attention, or to banding together in the face of a crisis.

“In some ways, it primed the pump,” Tim told me, referring to the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020. Like everyone I spoke to, Tim and Star ascribe Minneapolis’ successful mobilization to lessons learned during that time.

“We have a lot of media coming in and asking, ‘Oh, what’s your organization? Who are you with?’ And it’s like, we don’t have an organization. We’re not with anyone,” Star told me.

“We’re just neighbors. That’s how we know each other,” Tim confirmed. “We live here.”

Star nodded. “ One of the things that I’m not sure that people are realizing outside of Minneapolis: The headlines say that Alex Pretti was a protester,” they say. “He wasn’t at a protest. He wasn’t at—”

And then we turned to watch the man approaching us through the snow—the man now telling us ICE has pulled up by an apartment building across the field. “We’ve got the block, we’re situated,” he says. “I just want to make sure—in case anybody’s targetable or something like that.”

None of us are targetable. Tim and Star want to help, and I want to see the action.

Just as roadkill summons vultures, so too does human misery summon journalists, who travel across the country to shove cameras and recorders at people enduring things no one should experience. People in Minneapolis broadly understand that documentation is important, that the world needs to know what’s happening, that journalists can help spread the word. But the line between journalism and pornography grows vanishingly thin at times like these. Newsworthy tales of ICE atrocities can easily become violent entertainment for a ravenous national audience; action-movie sequences carried out by caricatures, grief and trauma commodified for mass consumption.

Star offers me a 3D-printed orange whistle and I open my mouth to say that as a journalist I can’t participate—but the words won’t come out. A sudden vision of myself in the future, talking to grand-nieces and -nephews: Yes, I had a chance to warn people about the secret police coming to abduct them, disappear them, or release them into this dangerous cold without a coat or cell phone, but journalistic ethics, you see …

At last, the cars arrive. The bearded man gives us a count: One, two, three …

The noise is deafening: Horns blare, whistles pierce the piercing cold. “ICE OUT!” the residents chant, over and over again. “We are all Minneapolis!” someone shouts. “We are all Minnesota! We are all the motherfucking United States of America!”

The world might breathe a sigh of relief, but Minneapolis can’t afford it. ICE is here, and ICE has killed, and ICE may kill again. Here the city stands: residents with whistles standing against men with guns and flak vests.

The ICE SUV stays put despite the unrelenting noise and a neighborhood now on high alert. I start shivering five minutes in; the man in sweatpants and Crocs appears unbothered. There are over 30 people here now; residents have heeded the call or arrived from rapid-response patrol. A white Toyota stops between the crowd and the SUV and a man with a mustache leans out the passenger window with a camera: no words, no eye contact, just the indifferent glassy eye of a zoom lens and fingers to focus it on people as they do something others have died doing.

Someone has brought a megaphone; residents take turns leading chants. “My grandmother was a sharecropper in Arkansas, and I know that this is the same thing,” a man shouts at one point as whistles shrill and a handheld siren wails. “The same fight that my people fought, the same fight that my grandma fought, is the same fight that we are fighting to protect our undocumented migrant neighbors!”

ICE-watch reports more agents incoming, but the crowd has only grown and no one is going anywhere. Five minutes becomes 10, 10 becomes 15. “All right folks, we’re going to sing ‘We are not afraid!’ ” someone shouts into the megaphone, and so they do; not shouting or chanting but singing, in tune and with one voice:

We are not afraid We are not afraid We are not afraid today

Oh, deep in my heart I do believe That we are not afraid today

And then, to the sound of sporadic laughter, the amplified voice sings a slightly altered version:

ICE will leave ICE will leave Oh, deep in my heart I do believe ICE will leave RIGHT THE FUCK NOW! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MINNEAPOLIS! THIS IS OUR FUCKING STREET!

Laughter and cheers and the handheld siren wails and the man with the megaphone keeps shouting: “The people are not with you! The people are with us! And they want you to get the fuck out of our city!”

A few minutes later, the SUV lurches forward, then drives slowly down the street. The residents cheer and taunt and follow from a safe distance. Whatever the bastards had planned for the apartment complex will have to wait for another day. “That’s the most exciting laundry I’ve ever done,” a man with a gray beard says dryly, then walks back into everyday life, to the extent that everyday life is possible anymore.

Why do people continue to push back, knowing what it might mean? It’s the question I’m here to ask, and so I approach two people and ask it. “ I’d love to know what inspires you to come out here, knowing that people have been killed doing this shit. You can also tell me to fuck off.”

The resident studies me for several seconds. “I’m not going to tell you to fuck off,” she says at last. “But I don’t think I want to answer.”

“It feels like the only way through it is through it,” Tim says when I ask him the same question a few minutes later. “Some of this is—it’s happening to us. And it’s a choice to stand up, but—” He pauses. “We don’t have a lot of options.”

The day before this standoff on 37th and Columbus, I spent all day in a rapid-response chat with dozens of volunteers: people who had to excuse themselves to pick up kids from school, people on their way home willing to spare an hour to keep their community safe. The tone was matter-of-fact, direct, resolute, but moments of fear crept in. I could hear it in the voice of a woman who reported an ICE agent getting out of his car, and in two watchers who declined to follow an agent who drove “aggressively” toward them in his car. “Stay safe,” they told each other by way of goodbye, with the kind of intensity reserved for people who understand that might not be possible.

Later that night, I went to a “Hotel Wide-Awake” demonstration outside the four-star Hilton in downtown Minneapolis where ICE has rented a block of rooms. Hundreds of protesters stood outside in subzero temperatures and made as much noise as possible—banging pots, blowing whistles, drumming on buckets, blowing trombones and trumpets. Police in riot gear stood menacingly in front of the hotel, then eventually dispersed the protest by force around 10 p.m.

“I’m not as afraid as I thought I would be,” a woman who goes by L told me at the Hilton Wide-Awake. She wore a backpack with a piece of paper taped to the back that said “Free Supplies”: first aid, handwarmers, earplugs. “I guess I just feel like I can take it, so I want to put myself as a body here. They can’t hurt all of us if it’s really big, and there are a lot of people who can’t necessarily be out here or don’t want to take the risk. But because I feel like I can accept that risk, I have to.”

In three days, I will drive out of Minneapolis and back to my home in New York City. Tim, and Star, and the man with the beard, and the woman who did not want to answer—these people are already home. No one asked them if they wanted to be on the front lines of the fight against ICE. They did not volunteer for this assignment. The assignment came to them.

“I wish I had the answer for why are we doing it,” Star says. “It’s an act of service. I don’t know. And it’s—so you can’t save everybody, right? And you maybe can’t even save anybody. Like maybe all we do is frustrate. You know, give someone one more day with their daughter or their dad. But if you lost your dad, or you lost your daughter, you would give anything to have one more day with them. And that’s what we can do.”

President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign seemed to hit a horrifying crescendo in the last month, with chaos in the streets of Minneapolis stretching the city’s populace to a near-breaking point. Unfortunately, the situation is about to get worse. On Friday, two far-right judges greenlit the Trump administration’s radical reinterpretation of federal law that would sweep millions more immigrants into mandatory detention, potentially expanding the mass deportation machinery in new and horrifying ways. Their 2–1 decision for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would transform the entire United States into a permanent border zone where unauthorized immigrants can be jailed indefinitely without bond, even years after they arrived. It supercharges the administration’s push to build an archipelago of mass detention centers larger than any existing jail or prison in the country. These mega-warehouses—which are not designed for human habitation—will hold up to 10,000 immigrants each, with little oversight and little recourse for detainees whose rights are violated. Even as public outrage over Trump’s mass deportation campaign intensifies, the legal and physical infrastructure of the plan are rapidly falling into place.

The 5th Circuit’s Friday decision gives new legal muscle to the Stephen Miller–orchestrated mass deportation campaign by endorsing the administration’s audacious rereading of a 1996 immigration law governing the detention of unauthorized migrants. For nearly 30 years, both the executive branch and the federal judiciary have understood this statute to draw a sharp line between migrants “seeking admission” at the border and those already in the country. The former are subject to mandatory detention without bond (with a few narrow exceptions). The latter, by contrast, can seek release on bond. If that request is denied, they can demand a bond hearing before an immigration judge. Most of the roughly 11 million immigrants without permanent legal status in the U.S. today fall into this second, bond-eligible group.

In July, the Trump administration collapsed the long-standing distinction between new arrivals and everyone else. It announced that it had “revisited” its view of the law and concluded that unauthorized immigrants already present in the United States are subject to mandatory detention, just like migrants encountered at the border. To reach that result, the government asserted that anyone who was never legally admitted to the country must, by definition, be “seeking admission” today. Under its theory, an immigrant who has lived here for decades is subject to the same harsh rules as someone who tried to cross the border yesterday. This shift empowered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain exponentially more immigrants without bond, prompting a flood of habeas petitions from those detainees challenging their confinement. Indeed, according to ProPublica, noncitizens have filed more of these petitions in the last 13 months than in the last three administrations combined.

Although the Trump-stacked Board of Immigration Appeals swiftly adopted the administration’s distortion of the statute, federal judges have overwhelmingly rejected it and freed detainees in habeas proceedings. As Kyle Cheney reported in Politico, at least 360 judges have spurned the government’s reasoning in more than 3,000 cases. They’ve done so in increasingly alarmed terms. Last week, Judge Thomas E. Johnston, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote: “It is appalling that the government insists that this Court should redefine or completely disregard the current law as it is clearly written,” deriding the administration’s theory as “dystopian absurdity.”

The problem, as these judges have explained, is that an unauthorized immigrant who’s already present in the country is not “seeking admission” at all; they are seeking to remain here. Yet ICE is detaining them under a statute reserved for new arrivals. By doing so, the agency is flagrantly breaking the law. So judges keep ordering ICE to release detainees—orders the agency has repeatedly flouted, prompting scathing judicial rebukes around the country.

On Friday, however, the administration finally caught a break at the 5th Circuit, the nation’s most reactionary appeals court. Justice Department officials maneuvered to ensure that the court would take up the question as quickly as possible, evidently hoping to notch a win. Two far-right judges, Edith Jones and Kyle Duncan, were happy to oblige: They embraced the administration’s reinterpretation on an expedited schedule, over a furious dissent by Judge Dana Douglas, who warned: “The border is now everywhere.” With this decision in hand, ICE can enforce the mandatory detention policy in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the three states covered by the circuit. (The agency had been funneling migrants from other jurisdictions into these states already, perhaps in anticipation of such a ruling.)

Jones and Duncan’s rush to bless this mandatory detention policy smooths the path for another component of Trump’s mass deportation push: The use of mega-warehouses to detain up to 10,000 noncitizens each and supplement the much smaller facilities that currently house detainees. ICE has been buying up these warehouses over the last few months—reportedly above market value to speed up the transactions—and converting them into makeshift detention camps. More than a quarter of the proposed sites fall within the 5th Circuit. As the American Immigration Council’s Aaron Reichlin-Melnick has pointed out, these detention facilities will house far more people than any jail or prison in the U.S. today.

Reichlin-Melnick told me on Tuesday that the mandatory detention policy now supported by the 5th Circuit is “a key part of the plan to fill these warehouses.” To achieve “the broader project of mass deportation,” Reichlin-Melnick said, “you need both the legal authority and physical space.” The government’s draconian rereading of immigration law “provides the legal authority. Warehouses provide the physical spaces.”

The overarching goal is to condemn as many noncitizens as possible to these sites, then hold them there without bond until they are so desperate and miserable that they agree to be deported. ICE already subjects its detainees to horrific, degrading, and inhumane conditions while blocking attempts at meaningful oversight. The situation may grow even more dire once the agency begins locking hundreds of thousands of noncitizens—many of whom may have lived here for years with pending legal claims to resolve their status—in industrial buildings that were never designed to hold human beings. Those subject to abuse at the hands of ICE officers will have no real mechanism for redress.

Even before the mandatory detention policy, noncitizens faced an uphill battle when seeking bond before an immigration judge. Trump purged many of these judges (who lack tenure) for alleged leniency, replacing them with ideologically aligned substitutes. But release on bond was still a real possibility for those who could show that they did not pose a flight risk or danger to the community. Now the government has shut off that safety valve, and—at least in the 5th Circuit—the machinery of detention can run at full speed. A series of Supreme Court decisions have closed off the possibility of a nationwide injunction or class action that could put a stop to this regime all at once. Immigrants’ only hope is that SCOTUS will swiftly and definitively shoot down the government’s contortion of the statute.

There is some reason for optimism that it will. Just eight years ago, the conservative justices appeared to foreclose the conflation of new arrivals and longer-term residents, acknowledging that the latter group is eligible for bond. But this Supreme Court has repeatedly twisted the law for Trump, particularly in his quest to immiserate noncitizens, and there’s no guarantee it will resist this act of legal vandalism. The administration is proceeding as if it already has the justices in its pocket. Unless and until they intervene, each new warehouse moves the country one step closer to the president’s vision of an American gulag.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/cisco_q2_2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cisco has increased the prices for its hardware to cover the increased cost of memory and says the resulting bigger bills are not changing customers’ buying habits.

The networking giant discussed the price hikes on its Q2 2026 earnings call, during which CEO Chuck Robbins said Cisco has already announced price increases and will “continue to monitor market trends and make additional adjustments as necessary.” The CEO said Cisco is also “revising contractual terms with channel partners and customers to address evolving component prices,” and is using its scale to “help us negotiate favorable terms and secure supply to fulfill current and future demand.”

Robbins noted that networking appliances require less memory than servers, “So the price increases are more nominal” and he thinks buyers understand bigger bills aren’t Cisco’s fault.

“Customers get it. And while they may not like it, they understand that it&#39;s a dynamic that we&#39;re all dealing with,” he said.

CFO Mark Patterson said buyers haven’t changed plans due to memory price impacts.

“I haven&#39;t talked to any customers that are really willing to delay or defer any sort of strategic investments,” he said. Nor did customers try to get in early to buy kit at low prices before memory storage prices surged. “I think, frankly, also a lot of them understand that we&#39;ll probably be able to manage this a lot better than some of our peers, too.”

Cisco won $15.3 billion revenue for the quarter, a company record and a ten percent year-over-year jump.

Robbins said Cisco is surfing the AI wave in two ways.

One is selling upgrades to existing networks. “Legacy infrastructure was not designed for the performance, speed and security needs of AI,” he said.

The other is selling to hyperscalers, and that’s more complicated because Robbins said they are “lumpy” buyers. Cisco announced it won $2.1 billion of orders from hyperscalers in the quarter and said that represents “a significant acceleration in growth” as that sum was $800 million higher than the previous quarter, and higher than all orders from hyperscalers in the previous financial year.

Financial analysts on the earnings call, however, felt those are tiny sums compared to the $635 billion that Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft plan to spend on infrastructure this year.

Robbins said hyperscalers like Cisco’s optics portfolio and its programmable Silicon One processors, and that sovereign clouds and neoclouds represent new opportunities.

Cisco has opportunities beyond AI. Robbins said buyers are at the beginning of a major multi-year, multi-billion-dollar campus networking refresh cycle. He also pointed to double-digit datacenter switching sales growth across in six of the last eight quarters.

The company forecast Q3 revenue of $15.4 to $15.6 billion, and a full-year haul of $61.2 to $61.7 billion. If achieved, both figures would be records for the company.

Investors weren’t satisfied. The company’s shares drifted down by almost one percent on Wednesday, then sent it tumbling 7.5 percent in after-hours trading. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid its ongoing promotion of AI’s wonders, Microsoft has warned customers it has found many instances of a technique that manipulates the technology to produce biased advice.

The software giant says its security researchers have detected a surge in attacks designed to poison the &quot;memory&quot; of AI models with manipulative data, a technique it calls &quot;AI Recommendation Poisoning.&quot; It&#39;s similar to SEO Poisoning, a technique used by miscreants to make malicious websites rank higher in search results, but focused on AI models rather than search engines.

The Windows biz says it has spotted companies adding hidden instructions to &quot;Summarize with AI&quot; buttons and links placed on websites.

It&#39;s not complicated to do this because URLs that point to AI chatbots can include a query parameter with a manipulative prompt text.

For example, The Register entered a link with URL-encoded text into Firefox&#39;s omnibox that told Perplexity AI to summarize a CNBC article as if it were written by a pirate.

The AI service returned a pirate-speak summary, citing the article and other sources.

A less frivolous instruction, or one calling for an AI to produce output with a particular bent, would likely see any AI produce content that reflects the hidden instructions.

&quot;We identified over 50 unique prompts from 31 companies across 14 industries, with freely available tooling making this technique trivially easy to deploy,&quot; the Microsoft Defender Security Team said in a blog post. &quot;This matters because compromised AI assistants can provide subtly biased recommendations on critical topics including health, finance, and security without users knowing their AI has been manipulated.&quot;

We found that the technique worked with Google Search, too.

Microsoft&#39;s researchers note that various code libraries and web resources can be used to create AI share buttons for recommendation injection. The effectiveness of these techniques, they concede, can vary over time as platforms alter website behavior and implement protections.

But assuming the poisoning has been triggered automatically or unwittingly by someone, not only would the model&#39;s output reflect that prompt text, but subsequent responses would also consider the prompt text as historic context or &quot;memory.&quot;

&quot;AI Memory Poisoning occurs when an external actor injects unauthorized instructions or &#39;facts&#39; into an AI assistant&#39;s memory,&quot; the Defender team explained. &quot;Once poisoned, the AI treats these injected instructions as legitimate user preferences, influencing future responses.&quot;

The risk, Microsoft&#39;s researchers argue, is that AI Recommendation Poisoning erodes people&#39;s trust in AI services – at least among those who haven&#39;t already written AI models off as unreliable.

Users may not take the time to verify AI recommendations, the security researchers say, and confident-sounding assertions by AI models make that more likely.

&quot;This makes memory poisoning particularly insidious – users may not realize their AI has been compromised, and even if they suspected something was wrong, they wouldn&#39;t know how to check or fix it,&quot; the Defender team said. &quot;The manipulation is invisible and persistent.&quot;

Redmond&#39;s researchers urge customers to be cautious with AI-related links and to check where they lead – sound advice for any web link. They also advise customers to review the stored memories of AI assistants, to delete unfamiliar entries, to clear memory periodically, and to question dubious recommendations.

Microsoft’s Defenders also recommend that corporate security teams scan for AI Recommendation Poisoning attempts in tenant email and messaging applications. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Model-maker and SaaS-y AI outfit Anthropic has committed to covering any increases in energy prices paid by consumers caused by its power-hungry datacenters.

&quot;Building AI responsibly can&#39;t stop at the technology — it has to extend to the infrastructure behind it. We&#39;ve been clear that the US needs to build AI infrastructure at scale to stay competitive, but the costs of powering our models should fall on Anthropic, not everyday Americans,&quot; Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement provided to The Register. &quot;We look forward to working with communities, local governments, and the Administration to get this right.&quot;

To address this, Anthropic says it will fully offset the cost of grid upgrades needed to interconnect its datacenters by paying more for the energy it consumes.

Power plants, transmission lines, and substations are costly to build and maintain. Utilities also depreciate assets. Those factors contribute to the price of electricity, while dynamic pricing that fluctuates with demand also impacts bills.

The company is also investigating &quot;curtailment systems&quot; to reduce its power draw during periods of peak demand, and adopting technologies like liquid cooling that reduce its needs.

These steps are welcome, but won&#39;t make much of a dent as they apply only to Anthropic&#39;s own datacenters, which make up a small part of the US bit barn armada. A growing body of evidence suggests those facilities are driving up the price of electricity across America.

Back in November 2025, Anthropic announced a $50 billion investment in American compute architecture in partnership with bit barn builder FluidStack.

&quot;Those data centers – which are located in Mitchell County, Texas and Niagara County, New York, are examples of data center communities where these commitments apply. We also have a data center in southeast Louisiana,&quot; an Anthropic spokesperson told El Reg.

Anthropic’s commitment doesn&#39;t apply to leased capacity, though the company says where it does lease compute, it is &quot;exploring further ways to address our own workload&#39;s effects on prices.&quot;

And Anthropic leases a lot of datacenter capacity. The company has signed with Google and Microsoft to access massive numbers of AI accelerators, and the Microsoft deal will support the software giant’s implementation of an additional gigawatt of datacenter capacity.

Anthropic also called for help from Washington, DC. &quot;Company-level action isn&#39;t enough. Keeping electricity affordable requires systemic change. We support federal policies, including permitting reform and efforts to speed up transmission development and grid interconnection – that make it faster and cheaper to bring new energy online,&quot; Anthropic stated.

Anthropic’s call for help may already have worked. Amid growing opposition to datacenter build-outs, the Trump administration is reportedly pressuring major bit barn operators to take steps to prevent their operations from spiking residents&#39; power or water bills.

Microsoft has already committed to ensuring its datacenter doesn&#39;t end up driving up utility bills for regular consumers. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/security_researcher_287_chrome_extensions_data_leak/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">They know where you&#39;ve been and they&#39;re going to share it. A security researcher has identified 287 Chrome extensions that allegedly exfiltrate browsing history data for an estimated 37.4 million installations.

Browsing history data – a record of websites visited – reveals potentially sensitive information about people&#39;s activities and interests. Though it may be anonymized, academics have shown [PDF] that you can often trace it back to individuals using public social media profiles.

The sharing of browsing history data thus erodes personal privacy, though at least some of the info harvesting the researcher detected is disclosed in privacy policies. Even so, individuals who have installed these extensions may not realize that the privacy policies they accepted were not promising privacy.

The researcher, who goes by the name &quot;Q Continuum&quot; in a nod to Star Trek: The Next Generation, explained the motivation for the project in an online post, acknowledging that data harvesting of this sort is a longstanding concern for browser extensions.

Indeed, it was only two months ago that we reported on how several ad blocking and VPN extensions in the Chrome Web Store were spotted capturing chatbot conversations. And in March 2025, we discussed research showing that generative AI extensions were found to be capturing and sharing sensitive user data. Also, as we&#39;ve noted, developers of popular Chrome extensions face constant solicitations to sell out to buyers interested in inserting data gathering scripts.

Q observes that Chrome extensions in the past have been called out for exfiltrating user browsing data that gets collected by data brokers like Similarweb and Alexa. The research report [PDF] represents an effort to document that web analytics biz Similarweb and other data harvesting companies are still at it.

&quot;Why does it matter?&quot; Q Continuum asks. &quot;There is a moral aspect to the whole issue. Imagine that you build your business model on data exfiltration via innocent looking extensions and using that data to sell them to big corporates. Well, that&#39;s how Similarweb is getting part of the data. That should remind us that whatever software you are using for free and it is not open sourced, you should assume you are the product.&quot;

The report says that data leaking extensions tend to share a common trait: they purport to be harmless tools while requesting access to sensitive data like browsing history without a sound justification.

&quot;Many users, even when aware of surveillance, fail to grasp the risks or consequences of such access,&quot; the report says. &quot;This constitutes a privacy breach, as terms of service or privacy policies frequently obscure these practices, leaving users unaware they&#39;ve consented to data collection.&quot;

Q&#39;s research builds upon work published [PDF] in 2017 by Michael Weissbacher et al., &quot;Ex-Ray: Detection of History-Leaking Browser Extensions.&quot; Q developed an automated testing system using Docker with Chromium behind a man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxy that executed synthetic browsing workloads and correlated outbound network requests with visited URLs to detect history leakage.

The testing pipeline revealed more than 30 companies involved in collecting browsing data. For around 20 million of the 37.4 million relevant installations, the collecting entity was unknown. For the remainder, it was companies like Similarweb, Big Star Labs (said to be an arm of Similarweb), Semrush, Alibaba Group, ByteDance, and others.

&quot;The findings highlight the urgent need for greater awareness and more robust safeguards to protect users from the growing risks posed by malicious extensions,&quot; Q&#39;s report says.

Similarweb, the focus of the report, did not respond to a request for comment. The company&#39;s extension privacy policy discloses its collection of browsing data. The company claims both that it scrubs browsing data on the client side to remove information that could identify an individual and that &quot;Some of this data may include Personal Data and Sensitive Data depending on the searches conducted and content you view.&quot;

A Similarweb financial filing from February 27, 2025, attests to the company&#39;s reliance on data gathered from browser extensions and apps. The company&#39;s risk boilerplate says, &quot;Our platform and solutions depend in part on the ability to obtain data from our contributory network through browser extensions, mobile apps and other products distributed through third-party online platforms and stores such as Chrome Web Store, Google Play and the Apple App Store.&quot;

Google also did not immediately respond to our inquiry. As noted by security researcher Wladimir Palant, Google&#39;s Chrome Web Store has a Limited Use policy intended to prevent data from being shared with data brokers. But the policy allows for an exception that can be abused by unscrupulous companies. ®

            <div id="article-text">Meta has decided to let Threads users make custom tweaks to its all-important algorithm, but don&#39;t expect your preferences to stick and do expect to bring your best manners.

The social media-cum-metaverse-cum-AI firm formerly known as Facebook announced a new Threads feature called &quot;Dear Algo&quot; on Wednesday, alongside news of plans to build a massive 1 GW AI datacenter in Lebanon, Indiana.

Dear Algo will use some of Meta&#39;s AI magic to tweak the algorithm for Threads users with just a public post, written like a letter directed to the algorithm, asking it to please show them more, or less of, a particular topic. Dear Algo posts can also be reposted by others, which will have the same effect on their account.

Once published, the Dear Algo will tweak a user&#39;s feed per their request – but only for three days due to what Meta says is a desire to keep users &quot;connected to the most current conversations&quot; – or most controversial, whichever makes Meta more money.

Meta didn&#39;t give many examples of the sort of commands users can make of Dear Algo, only mentioning things like telling it to show a person more posts about a current NBA game or something as general as &quot;show me more posts about podcasts.&quot;

The company didn&#39;t say how specific Dear Algo posts are able to get either, so whether a user could prompt it to exclude posts expressing certain viewpoints on a particular topic, or to mute spoilers about a particular television episode while allowing conversation about the show outside spoilers wasn&#39;t made clear.

Meta&#39;s algorithms have been a source of controversy for years, ever since the company eliminated chronologically sorted Facebook feeds in favor of the company deciding how to present content to its users.

Fast-forward more than a decade, and Meta is still taking heat for alleged racial bias in its algorithms, prioritizing content that may radicalize mass shooters, and generally promoting divisive, misery-inducing content.

Personifying its algorithm by letting users write letters to it in a bid to help them get a more tailored experience for a few days may help appease some, but it&#39;s just as possible to leave others wondering what Meta could do to make its platforms more pleasant.

Speaking of which, Meta didn&#39;t announce any plans to bring Dear Algo posts to its other platforms, so Instagram and Facebook users will have to continue to cope with an algorithm that provides what it thinks they want without an AI-powered option to change it.

Meta didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

            <h2>Lawmakers demand great wall to keep advanced chipmaking gear out of China</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/lawmakers_china_cut_off_advaced_chipmaking/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Banning sales to Chinese-government-affiliated companies, apparently, is not enough. A bipartisan group of American lawmakers this week called on the Trump administration to enact a blanket ban on the sale of equipment used in the production of advanced semiconductors to all of China.

In a letter to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the group of eight members of Congress argued that entity-specific trade restrictions were ineffective and called on the US government and its allies to enact countrywide trade restrictions on chipmaking kit.

&quot;Critical gaps persist in our export control regime. … Certain foreign-produced chokepoint SME (semiconductor manufacturing equipment) is controlled only for certain specific entities in China, rather than on a countrywide basis,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Once equipment crosses the border into China, the US government has extremely limited ability to enforce end-use and end-user restrictions.&quot;

The US has spent the better part of a decade now trying to kneecap China&#39;s domestic semiconductor industry by limiting access to key chipmaking technologies like extreme and deep ultraviolet (EUV / DUV) lithography.

However, US export policy under the past two administrations has largely targeted specific companies like China&#39;s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), rather than blocking sales at a country level.

&quot;Entity-specific controls, while valuable, cannot substitute for countrywide restrictions on the most critical chokepoint tools,&quot; they wrote. &quot;We urge the administration to press allies to implement countrywide controls on key chokepoint semiconductor manufacturing equipment and subcomponents.&quot;

The lawmakers describe “chokepoint” equipment and subcomponents as those China lacks a domestic equivalent for.

However, because the semiconductor supply chain is so diverse, many key components are made outside the US, limiting its ability to police trade. To address this, the lawmakers argue that if US allies do not align on countrywide controls, Washington should be prepared to use US-origin component restrictions to close the gaps itself.

&quot;The United States should be prepared to act to close remaining gaps itself if necessary, including by prohibiting the use of US-origin components in the production of chokepoint tools destined to China,&quot; the letter reads.

Equipment manufactured by the likes of the Netherlands&#39; ASML appears to be of particular concern for the group.

&quot;Dutch sales to China of advanced lithography equipment — the most important chokepoint in the supply chain — doubled from 2022 to 2023 and again from 2023 to 2024,&quot; the lawmakers wrote. &quot;Each chokepoint tool that enters China represents a permanent loss of American leverage.&quot;

In addition to barring sales of chipmaking gear, the lawmakers also want the Trump administration to crack down on companies that continue to service existing equipment now subject to trade restrictions in the region.

The lawmakers also warn that time is of the essence as China is working to build its homegrown chipmaking tech.

&quot;Left unchecked, China could render US and allied export controls irrelevant by replacing foreign chipmaking tools entirely,&quot; they said.

We&#39;ll note that this kind of thing does tend to happen when a nation is cut off from a critical technology, but reading between the lines, the argument seems to be that the US&#39; failure to effectively police foreign chipmaking equipment is buying time for the Chinese to build their own. ®

Wildlight Entertainment says it is parting ways with ‘a number’ of its employees.

Highguard, a new multiplayer shooter from developers who worked on games like Apex Legends and Call of Duty, launched just over two weeks ago, but developer Wildlight Entertainment is already cutting jobs at the company, according to posts from affected staffers on LinkedIn. Former Wildlight level designer Alex Graner says that “most of the team at Wildlight” was laid off today, which was backed up by former lead tech artist Josh Sobel.

”Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game,” Wildlight says in a statement. “We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.”

Highguard was first announced as the final reveal at The Game Awards in December with a splashy reveal trailer promoting a January 26th launch date. The game reportedly hit nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam on launch day, but it has a “Mixed” rating on the platform and has just over 2,400 concurrent players as of this writing, according to SteamDB. The game launched with three-player teams, but shortly after, Wildlight added a limited time 5v5 mode that it made permanent a few days later.

This week, Riot Games also made cuts on a major live service project, laying off about 80 people from its recently-launched 2XKO fighting game set in the League of Legends universe.

Update, February 11th: Added statement from Wildlight.

The way forward for xAI involves four divisions: Grok, Coding, Imagine, and Macrohard.

Since the xAI-SpaceX merger announced last week, which combined the two companies (as well as social media platform X) for a reported $1.25 trillion valuation — the biggest merger of all time — a handful of xAI employees and two of its co-founders have abruptly exited the company, penning long departure announcements online. Some also announced that they were starting their own AI companies.

Co-founder Yuhai (Tony) Wu announced his departure on X, writing that it was “time for [his] next chapter.” Jimmy Ba, another co-founder, posted something similar later that day, saying it was “time to recalibrate [his] gradient on the big picture.” The departures mean that xAI is now left with only half of its original 12 co-founders on staff.

It all comes after changing plans for the future of the combined companies, which Elon Musk recently announced would involve “space-based AI” data centers and vertical integration involving “AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform.” Musk reportedly also talked of plans to build an AI satellite factory and city on the moon in an internal xAI meeting.

Musk wrote on X Wednesday that “xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution” and claimed that the process “unfortunately required parting ways with some people,” then put out a call for more people to apply to the company. He also posted a recording of xAI’s 45-minute internal all-hands meeting that announced the changes.

“We’re organizing the company to be more effective at this scale,” Musk said during the meeting. He added that the company will now be organized in four main application areas: Grok Main and Voice, Coding, Imagine (image and video), and Macrohard (“which is intended to do full digital emulation of entire companies,” Musk said).

On Wednesday, Apple released its latest iOS 26 update, which includes a new process for switching from an iPhone to an Android phone, as previously reported by 9to5Mac. The updated transferring tool can move over data like apps, photos, messages, and even a user’s phone number by sitting the two phones side by side. Previously, users typically needed to either download Apple and Google’s data transfer apps on each device or manually copy all their apps and data over.

iPhone users in the EU also now have an option for “notification forwarding” with third-party wearables in iOS 26.3. This update allows users to view the full contents of notifications on third-party wearables and control which apps they get notifications from, bringing the third-party smartwatch experience more in line with the Apple Watch. Improving interoperability between iPhones and non-Apple wearables, including features like notification functionality, was one of several requirements for Apple to comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act.

To install iOS 26.3 on your phone, open the Settings app and go to “General” then “Software Update.” If iOS 26.3 is available on your iPhone, you should see an option to download and install it. If that option isn’t showing up, double-check that your iPhone is compatible with iOS 26.

Valentine’s Day is often thought of as the quintessential Hallmark holiday — and why wouldn’t it be? Most of the time, it’s marketed to us with massive floral arrangements and heart-shaped chocolates, both of which can come off as borderline twee. But no one says you have to play by the rulebook when it comes to holidays, especially if your husband or boyfriend couldn’t care less about the classics.

If you’re hoping to express your affection for the man in your life with something a little different this year, we have some thoughts. Quince’s cashmere crewneck is quickly becoming a staple in our closet, while past favorites like Glocusent’s necklamp and Image3D’s custom viewfinder make for excellent substitutes if you want something less cliché. Hell, name a roach after him. We guarantee no one else will.

What follows is an array of Verge-approved ideas spanning multiple categories and price points, so you can easily find a gift for your friend, romantic partner, or any other self-proclaimed “dude” in your life.

From calls to playlists, the AirPods 4 make everything sound a little better. Apple’s latest earbuds deliver improved audio and voice call quality that’s on par with the Pro models, ensuring you come through clearly no matter what’s going on around you. The included charging case even has a built-in speaker, making them juuuust a little harder to lose.

With Hot Ones’ latest trio pack, you can subject your valentine to the same fiery gauntlet that Jason Segel, Will Arnett, and other guests were recently forced to endure. It includes the second, fifth, and final hot sauces in the series — including the iconic “Last Dab,” which is a soul-scorching blend of Apollo, Pepper X, Carolina Reaper, and Scorpion peppers.

Hazelight Studios’ follow-up to It Takes Two is, without a doubt, one of the best co-op games of the last several years. The split-screen mashup of sci-fi and fantasy pinballs between genres at breakneck speed, introducing new ideas and novel gameplay elements at every turn. Now, let’s hope you and your partner have a good working relationship.

Not every massage gun needs to exert an exorbitant amount of pressure. The five-speed Mebak 3 takes a more subtle approach, which, unlike other models, prevents it from drowning out your TV. It’s also unique in that comes with seven (!) distinct add-ons, including a blade-like shovel attachment and a flat cushiony head aimed at more sensitive tissues and joints.

Given the number of books in the world, sometimes it’s nice to have somebody narrow down the list on your behalf. A Book of the Month membership lets your giftee periodically choose from a curated selection of up to seven titles, including literary classics, bestsellers, and early releases spanning a variety of well-known genres.

Nomad’s Leather Mag Wallet is two gifts in one. Not only does the slick snap-on wallet let you store up to four cards at once, but it also doubles as an AirTag, allowing you to locate your wallet via Apple’s Find My network. The magnetic, iPhone-friendly accessory also charges wirelessly, enabling up to five months of battery life.

Your most sentimental photos with your valentine will pack an extra punch with Image3D’s RetroViewer. The retro-styled viewfinder comes with a code to upload seven photos — whether they’re of your first date, wedding, or latest vacay — which you can then edit and package into your own DIY reel for when those nostalgic moments overtake you.

Powerful power banks don’t have to be cumbersome. Iniu’s 10,000mAh P50 is about as thick as a deck of cards, but features 45W charging speeds, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port. Its braided lanyard also doubles as a USB-C cable, providing everything you need to keep all of your electronics fully juiced on the go.

Whether your valentine collects Funko Pops or not, gifting them a custom model is sure to delight them. Using an online module, you can fine-tune a variety of features — including their hairstyle, skin tone, and getup — and each custom Funko comes in a box, just like the collectible ones based on Star Wars and other iconic fandoms.

It’s easy enough to run the vacuum in the living room and call it a day. But other areas where your valentine might enjoy spending their time — at the computer, in the car, etc. — can be tougher to clean. That’s where Hoto’s sleek, 20,000Pa handheld vacuum and its slew of attachment heads come in.

Quince is quickly becoming a household name, particularly for wool basics. And if your valentine doesn’t have any cashmere in their collection, the company’s ultra-soft crewneck is a fantastic gift that can keep them warm and stylish during the coldest months of the year. The fact that it’s available in 15 different colors is just a plus.

A subscription to The Criterion Channel is the ultimate gift for a movie lover. The service lets you stream some of the greatest movies of all time, from The Shining to Once Upon a Time in America. It also includes access to Criterion 24/7, an endless stream of movies that you can watch when you don’t want to make a decision.

The past few months might not have been as life-shattering for most as 2020, but we’d argue life doesn’t have to be pure chaos for a stress ball to come in handy. The NeeDoh Nice Cube, like all of Schylling’s colorful dough-filled shapes, makes for an inexpensive release that can be squeezed, squashed, and pulled to your heart’s content.

Let’s face it, many of us have called roaches unsavory things, typically from a place of fear. However, if you want to redeem yourself somehow, the Bronx Zoo will let you name your very own Madagascar hissing cockroach in the name of love. You can even schedule a “virtual encounter” for your giftee, if they’re feeling up for it.

Got a boyfriend or husband who loves to golf? Paper Apps Golf is a pocket-sized game that lets them hit the proverbial green just about anywhere. The 60-page notebook features three randomly generated courses, each with 18 holes, along with a brief overview of how to play. Just be sure to grab a Pencil dice (sold separately) to go with it.

If you’re okay with shelling out on a console, look no further than the Switch 2. Nintendo’s latest hybrid boasts a spacious 7.9-inch display, a comfortable design, and backward compatibility with most OG Switch titles, some of which have even been updated to run at higher resolutions and frame rates. Fair to say, Donkey Kong has never looked better.

Whether you’re relaxing at home or braving the elements, keeping your extremities warm is paramount. Fortunately, Unihand’s rechargeable hand warmers can keep your digits limber for up to 20 hours on a single charge; they also feature three distinct warmth levels, the most powerful of which can hit 130 degrees Fahrenheit.

Apple’s latest AirTags feel purpose-built for the forgetful boyfriend. The second-gen item tracker features an upgraded ultra-wideband chip for more precise location tracking, a noticeably louder speaker, and an expanded Bluetooth range. You’ll still need an iPhone to make the most of it, though, as well as a separate accessory to attach it to your belongings.

Lego’s smiling, potted plants might be intended for kids, but they make for a fun piece of desk decor that’s sure to lighten up any space without requiring additional aftercare. The cutsey duo is easy to assemble, and each plant is interchangeable with either pot, letting you mix and match as you see fit.

Fender has made it easy for guitarists to feel like they’re plugged in wherever they are. The Micro Plus is a compact headphone amp with 50 effects that lets you rock out using the headphones you already own, whether they’re a pair of shoddy earbuds or studio-caliber cans. Best of all, it works with a range of guitar types, from straight-sided to the angular variety.

Attending a dedicated first aid or CPR class through the Red Cross probably isn’t high on your list of date-night activities. However, it’s pretty cool to know that, after a few self-paced online courses and an hour or two of in-person practical instruction, both you and your partner can be heroes should you encounter someone who needs life-saving help.

The key to making a truly spectacular cocktail isn’t just the combination of ingredients — though, we admit that’s part of it. In Liquid Intelligence, Dave Arnold makes the case that the smallest details are what make all the difference, especially in terms of taste and appearance. And who are we to argue with bar-backed science?

What’s mightier than the pen? A pen that can also serve as an LED flashlight, a ruler, a bubble level, a screwdriver, a bottle opener, and a smartphone-ready stylus. The 9-in-1 Builder Pen might just be the most capable tool you can add to your everyday carry, even if you never write a thing with it.

If your partner likes to burn the midnight oil reading, like, actual books, Glocusent’s wearable necklamp could be a godsend. The handy gizmo provides a soft, warm glow and several brightness settings, letting your loved one comfortably read in the dark without waking you up with a deluge of lumens.

Cards Against Humanity is overrated. Wingspan, however, plays as beautifully as it looks, while offering just the right amount of strategy and a unique way to learn about various species. If you and your valentine are looking to move beyond the basics, this bird-themed engine-building board game is a must, whether you like birds or not.

The Amazfit Active 2 is the kind of smartwatch that defies the odds. It’s equipped with a bright 2,000-nit OLED display and an array of upgraded health sensors, along with offline maps and a slick strength training mode that can auto-detect sets, reps, and rest. It even supports its own AI assistant, Zepp Flow, which is wild for a watch that retails for less than $100.

The Backbone might be the most flexible mobile controller out there. The USB-C gamepad lets you play games on your iPhone or Android device using physical buttons, joysticks, and triggers. The Pro model takes things one step further, however, allowing you to connect to everything from a Steam Deck to an iPad via Bluetooth.

Sonido Cosmico is a vibe. The latest LP from Hermanos Gutiérrez brims with lush instrumental guitar and a range of otherwordly influences, including Latin percussion, warm strings, and just the right amount of psychedelia. None of that should come as a suprise, though, given the duo recently opened for the likes of The Black Keys and Khruangbin.

Most of us at The Verge are hooked on coffee, and the winter months are a terrible time to be surprised by a cold cup of the black stuff. Thankfully, Ember’s ceramic Smart Mug keeps your beverage heated to your preferred temperature for up to 80 minutes (or indefinitely when it’s resting on the included charging coaster).

Lego delivered a gigantic dose of nostalgia with a near-perfect replica of Nintendo’s 1989 handheld. The 421-piece set captures the Game Boy’s many buttons, grilles, and curves remarkably well, while the lenticular screen inserts give the illusion of a working unit. It even comes with several brick-ified cartridges you insert into a slot in the back.

The Fanttik X8 Apex is the kind of gift that keeps on giving, even if you’d prefer to never use it. The compact tire inflator features a built-in LCD display and can deliver up to 150psi, allowing your giftee to quickly top off their car or road bike with the right amount of air. It even functions as a power bank and charges via USB-C, just to make things easy.

The Notes app in iOS is great, but sometimes pen and paper are where it’s at. Field Notes are small enough to fit in your pocket or a small bag, yet spacious enough to house all your big ideas and errant thoughts. The “1943” Edition — the company’s first with two staples on the short side — can even add a much-needed pop of color to any desk setup.</div>

Facing growing backlash over energy-hungry data centers, Anthropic joins other tech companies in its promises to limit costs.

Anthropic is the latest AI company promising to limit the impact its data centers have on nearby residents’ electricity bills.

The company said it would pay higher monthly electricity charges in order to cover 100 percent of the upgrades needed to connect its data centers to power grids. “This includes the shares of these costs that would otherwise be passed onto consumers,” the announcement says.

Anthropic didn’t provide details today about any agreements it has inked with energy companies in order to accomplish these goals. In November, it shared a $50 billion plan to build data centers in New York and Texas “with more sites to come.”

Rising electricity rates have become a top election priority in the US, and local opposition to the construction of new energy-intensive data centers has led to projects across the country being canceled or delayed. Now we’re seeing companies including Microsoft and Meta making commitments to at least partially cover the costs stemming from new energy infrastructure built to accommodate their data centers.

As part of its pledge, Anthropic says it’ll support efforts to get new power sources online to meet growing electricity demand from AI. It also claims it’ll be willing to cut its power consumption during demand peaks, a step that could help relieve pressure on power grids during a heatwave or cold snap. Recent winter storms have already raised concerns about how data centers might further stress power grids and increase energy costs during extreme weather.

            <h2>Why I wish I hadn’t bought my Samsung OLED TV</h2>

            <div id="article-text">The picture quality is superb — when the software doesn’t interfere.

The picture quality is superb — when the software doesn’t interfere.

In June 2024, in a dusty TV shop empty of customers save myself, my wife, and my kids, I stared deep into the LG C3 and Samsung S90C. I went back and forth between the two OLED screens for easily 20 minutes, happily paralyzed by the choice in front of me. The Video Only salesperson attempted to explain that there was no wrong decision.

A year and a half later, I disagree: I regret picking the Samsung over the LG. I regret it every time I adjust the volume on my TV, every time I plug in a new device, and especially ever since the Logitech Harmony Amazon Alexa integration shit the bed and I have to fumble a Samsung remote to switch inputs.

Samsung’s QD-OLED panel itself is phenomenal, if nothing special in 2026. The problem is the software. I would pay Samsung $100, right now, for this “smart” TV to be as dumb as the ones I grew up with.

Heck, I’d give Samsung 50 bucks just to let us disable the volume indicator. Failing that, let’s see if shame works.

Let me be clear: One of the final deciding reasons I chose the Samsung S90C over the LG C3 was that LG had failed me before. My LG E7 OLED, purchased from a not-long-for-this-world Fry’s Electronics in 2018, eventually developed a large heat blemish (not your typical burn-in) that sometimes discolored the picture. Before that, my previous Sony TV developed a line of dark pixels shortly after the warranty expired.

But both Sony and LG had unobtrusive onscreen volume indicators, just little icons near the edge of the screen. Samsung believes that anyone who ever needs things a little louder or quieter is willing to tolerate this aberration:

This eyesore stretches nearly a third of the way across the screen, vertically and horizontally, obscuring the incredible moving art I’m trying to watch underneath. And if you’re using a receiver, it consumes all this screen space to convey basically zero information. Not the current volume level, unless you’re using the TV’s built-in speakers, not whether I’m getting a stereo or surround or Dolby Atmos signal, nothing of use whatsoever.

It is the Samsung equivalent of Microsoft Clippy, but worse: “Looks like you’re trying to adjust the volume!”

We watch plenty of movies that contain both too-loud action and too-quiet dialogue, at an hour when kids are supposed to be in bed, so we’re adjusting that volume all the time.

In 2023, user “1544CT” on the Samsung Community forums complained that “as a person that watches a lot of Movies and shows I can no longer recommend Samsung until this annoyance is fixed.” But they didn’t seem optimistic. After all, the company hadn’t yet acted on a 26-page thread about the annoyance from 2020, one that now has over 130,000 views.

There are numerous Reddit threads and even a Change.org petition to fix it. Though a Samsung moderator promised to deliver the complaint to the company’s engineers, it’s been three more years and nearly 50,000 more views without a resolution. Some users reported getting a v2203 update that reduced the size of the overlay, at least, but it appears that update may have been paused in December due to issues. Will we ever get it?

Problem number two: Samsung has no proper concept of an HDMI input, so I’m fumbling with a remote every time I plug a new gadget in.

I suspect not everyone’s always plugging in new gaming handhelds and Analogue 3Ds and mini-SNESes over HDMI like me. But on my LG TV set, and every HDMI-capable set I’ve ever owned before, I could just press a button to cycle through HDMI inputs until the right picture showed up.

Thankfully, my PS5 and Switch 2 have pretty decent implementations of HDMI-CEC, the communications protocol that lets them send commands to my TV. When the kids want to watch Netflix or fire up Astro Bot, the power button on the DualSense pad or Switch 2 Joy-Con will do it. But weirdly, they won’t turn my TV and receiver off.

I used to get around most of this by setting up complicated Logitech Harmony Hub routines that’d fire when I said “Alexa, turn off the TV” or “Alexa, turn on the Nintendo Switch.” But since that infrared Wi-Fi remote stopped syncing to Amazon and Logitech’s servers properly this year, I’ve had to use Samsung’s software and remote more than ever.

One day, I had the idea to try Home Assistant, when the Samsung TV and Samsung’s SmartThings showed up in a list of possible integrations. Maybe I could switch HDMI devices from my phone? But Samsung doesn’t expose individual HDMI ports there, either; I could only tell my screen to switch to “TV” or “HDMI,” no other sources or channels.

Those other HDMI sources do exist in Samsung’s API, because a homebrew third-party integration made my other Connected Devices like “PlayStation 5” and “AV Receiver” appear in Home Assistant — but only after connecting my TV to Samsung’s cloud and generating a custom API key. Yes, I have to reach out over the internet through Samsung’s cloud and back into my home to change HDMI inputs. And it’s still not reliable, because Samsung’s cloud sometimes tells me I’ve made too many requests, and sometimes needs a whole new token before it’ll accept commands again.

I’m about ready to go looking for an old-school infrared universal remote at this rate and teach my kids some pointing skills. But hey, Samsung, how about $50 for a fix? I have PayPal, Venmo, hell, I’ll type my card number into the TV itself if you’ll let me.

I asked Samsung a couple days ago about possible updates, but it didn’t have an answer by publish time.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

That might explain why the first breakthrough LLM personal assistant came not from one of the major AI labs, which have to worry about reputation and liability, but from an independent software engineer, Peter Steinberger. In November of 2025, Steinberger uploaded his tool, now called OpenClaw, to GitHub, and in late January the project went viral.

OpenClaw harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out. The risks posed by OpenClaw are so extensive that it would probably take someone the better part of a week to read all of the security blog posts on it that have cropped up in the past few weeks. The Chinese government took the step of issuing a public warning about OpenClaw’s security vulnerabilities.

In response to these concerns, Steinberger posted on X that nontechnical people should not use the software. (He did not respond to a request for comment for this article.) But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and it’s not limited to people who can run their own software security audits. Any AI companies that hope to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research.

OpenClaw is, in essence, a mecha suit for LLMs. Users can choose any LLM they like to act as the pilot; that LLM then gains access to improved memory capabilities and the ability to set itself tasks that it repeats on a regular cadence. Unlike the agentic offerings from the major AI companies, OpenClaw agents are meant to be on 24-7, and users can communicate with them using WhatsApp or other messaging apps. That means they can act like a superpowered personal assistant who wakes you each morning with a personalized to-do list, plans vacations while you work, and spins up new apps in its spare time.

But all that power has consequences. If you want your AI personal assistant to manage your inbox, then you need to give it access to your email—and all the sensitive information contained there. If you want it to make purchases on your behalf, you need to give it your credit card info. And if you want it to do tasks on your computer, such as writing code, it needs some access to your local files.

There are a few ways this can go wrong. The first is that the AI assistant might make a mistake, as when a user’s Google Antigravity coding agent reportedly wiped his entire hard drive. The second is that someone might gain access to the agent using conventional hacking tools and use it to either extract sensitive data or run malicious code. In the weeks since OpenClaw went viral, security researchers have demonstrated numerous such vulnerabilities that put security-naïve users at risk.

Both of these dangers can be managed: Some users are choosing to run their OpenClaw agents on separate computers or in the cloud, which protects data on their hard drives from being erased, and other vulnerabilities could be fixed using tried-and-true security approaches.

But the experts I spoke to for this article were focused on a much more insidious security risk known as prompt injection. Prompt injection is effectively LLM hijacking: Simply by posting malicious text or images on a website that an LLM might peruse, or sending them to an inbox that an LLM reads, attackers can bend it to their will.

And if that LLM has access to any of its user’s private information, the consequences could be dire. “Using something like OpenClaw is like giving your wallet to a stranger in the street,” says Nicolas Papernot, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Toronto. Whether or not the major AI companies can feel comfortable offering personal assistants may come down to the quality of the defenses that they can muster against such attacks.

It’s important to note here that prompt injection has not yet caused any catastrophes, or at least none that have been publicly reported. But now that there are likely hundreds of thousands of OpenClaw agents buzzing around the internet, prompt injection might start to look like a much more appealing strategy for cybercriminals. “Tools like this are incentivizing malicious actors to attack a much broader population,” Papernot says.

The term “prompt injection” was coined by the popular LLM blogger Simon Willison in 2022, a couple of months before ChatGPT was released. Even back then, it was possible to discern that LLMs would introduce a completely new type of security vulnerability once they came into widespread use. LLMs can’t tell apart the instructions that they receive from users and the data that they use to carry out those instructions, such as emails and web search results—to an LLM, they’re all just text. So if an attacker embeds a few sentences in an email and the LLM mistakes them for an instruction from its user, the attacker can get the LLM to do anything it wants.

Prompt injection is a tough problem, and it doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon. “We don’t really have a silver-bullet defense right now,” says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. But there’s a robust academic community working on the problem, and they’ve come up with strategies that could eventually make AI personal assistants safe.

Technically speaking, it is possible to use OpenClaw today without risking prompt injection: Just don’t connect it to the internet. But restricting OpenClaw from reading your emails, managing your calendar, and doing online research defeats much of the purpose of using an AI assistant. The trick of protecting against prompt injection is to prevent the LLM from responding to hijacking attempts while still giving it room to do its job.

One strategy is to train the LLM to ignore prompt injections. A major part of the LLM development process, called post-training, involves taking a model that knows how to produce realistic text and turning it into a useful assistant by “rewarding” it for answering questions appropriately and “punishing” it when it fails to do so. These rewards and punishments are metaphorical, but the LLM learns from them as an animal would. Using this process, it’s possible to train an LLM not to respond to specific examples of prompt injection.

But there’s a balance: Train an LLM to reject injected commands too enthusiastically, and it might also start to reject legitimate requests from the user. And because there’s a fundamental element of randomness in LLM behavior, even an LLM that has been very effectively trained to resist prompt injection will likely still slip up every once in a while.

Another approach involves halting the prompt injection attack before it ever reaches the LLM. Typically, this involves using a specialized detector LLM to determine whether or not the data being sent to the original LLM contains any prompt injections. In a recent study, however, even the best-performing detector completely failed to pick up on certain categories of prompt injection attack.

The third strategy is more complicated. Rather than controlling the inputs to an LLM by detecting whether or not they contain a prompt injection, the goal is to formulate a policy that guides the LLM’s outputs—i.e., its behaviors—and prevents it from doing anything harmful. Some defenses in this vein are quite simple: If an LLM is allowed to email only a few pre-approved addresses, for example, then it definitely won’t send its user’s credit card information to an attacker. But such a policy would prevent the LLM from completing many useful tasks, such as researching and reaching out to potential professional contacts on behalf of its user.

“The challenge is how to accurately define those policies,” says Neil Gong, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University. “It’s a trade-off between utility and security.”

On a larger scale, the entire agentic world is wrestling with that trade-off: At what point will agents be secure enough to be useful? Experts disagree. Song, whose startup, Virtue AI, makes an agent security platform, says she thinks it’s possible to safely deploy an AI personal assistant now. But Gong says, “We’re not there yet.”

Even if AI agents can’t yet be entirely protected against prompt injection, there are certainly ways to mitigate the risks. And it’s possible that some of those techniques could be implemented in OpenClaw. Last week, at the inaugural ClawCon event in San Francisco, Steinberger announced that he’d brought a security person on board to work on the tool.

As of now, OpenClaw remains vulnerable, though that hasn’t dissuaded its multitude of enthusiastic users. George Pickett, a volunteer maintainer of the OpenGlaw GitHub repository and a fan of the tool, says he’s taken some security measures to keep himself safe while using it: He runs it in the cloud, so that he doesn’t have to worry about accidentally deleting his hard drive, and he’s put mechanisms in place to ensure that no one else can connect to his assistant.

But he hasn’t taken any specific actions to prevent prompt injection. He’s aware of the risk but says he hasn’t yet seen any reports of it happening with OpenClaw. “Maybe my perspective is a stupid way to look at it, but it’s unlikely that I’ll be the first one to be hacked,” he says.

A “QuitGPT” campaign is urging people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions

In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. And while it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, there’s no denying QuitGPT is getting attention. Read the full story.

EVs could be cheaper to own than gas cars in Africa by 2040

Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing.

            <div id="article-text">Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.

There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. As a result some previous analyses have suggested that fossil-fuel vehicles would dominate in Africa through at least 2050.

But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Electric two-wheelers, cars, larger automobiles, and even minibuses could compete in most African countries in just 15 years, according to the new study, published in Nature Energy.

“EVs have serious economic potential in most African countries in the not-so-distant future,” says Bessie Noll, a senior researcher at ETH Zürich and one of the authors of the study.

The study considered the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of a vehicle. That includes the sticker price, financing costs, and the cost of fueling (or charging). The researchers didn’t consider policy-related costs like taxes, import fees, and government subsidies, choosing to focus instead on only the underlying economics.

EVs are getting cheaper every year as battery and vehicle manufacturing improve and production scales, and the researchers found that in most cases and in most places across Africa, EVs are expected to be cheaper than equivalent gas-powered vehicles by 2040. EVs should also be less expensive than vehicles that use synthetic fuels.

For two-wheelers like electric scooters, EVs could be the cheaper option even sooner: with smaller, cheaper batteries, these vehicles will be economically competitive by the end of the decade. On the other hand, one of the most difficult segments for EVs to compete in is small cars, says Christian Moretti, a researcher at ETH Zürich and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.

Because some countries still have limited or unreliable grid access, charging is a major barrier to EV uptake, Noll says. So for EVs, the authors analyzed the cost of buying not only the vehicle but also a solar off-grid charging system. This includes solar panels, batteries, and the inverter required to transform the electricity into a version that can charge an EV. (The additional batteries help the system store energy for charging at times when the sun isn’t shining.)

Mini grids and other standalone systems that include solar panels and energy storage are increasingly common across Africa. It’s possible that this might be a primary way that EV owners in Africa will charge their vehicles in the future, Noll says.

One of the bigger barriers to EVs in Africa is financing costs, she adds. In some cases, the cost of financing can be more than the up-front cost of the vehicle, significantly driving up the cost of ownership.

Today, EVs are more expensive than equivalent gas-powered vehicles in much of the world. But in places where it’s relatively cheap to borrow money, that difference can be spread out across the course of a vehicle’s whole lifetime for little cost. Then, since it’s often cheaper to charge an EV than fuel a gas-powered car, the EV is less expensive over time.

In some African countries, however, political instability and uncertain economic conditions make borrowing money more expensive. To some extent, the high financing costs affect the purchase of any vehicle, regardless of how it’s powered. But EVs are more expensive up front than equivalent gas-powered cars, and that higher up-front cost adds up to more interest paid over time. In some cases, financing an EV can also be more expensive than financing a gas vehicle—the technology is newer, and banks may see the purchase as more of a risk and charge a higher interest rate, says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank.

The picture varies widely depending on the country, too. In South Africa, Mauritius, and Botswana, financing conditions are already close to levels required to allow EVs to reach cost parity, according to the study. In higher-risk countries (the study gives examples including Sudan, which is currently in a civil war, and Ghana, which is recovering from a major economic crisis), financing costs would need to be cut drastically for that to be the case.

Making EVs an affordable option will be a key first step to putting more on the roads in Africa and around the world. “People will start to pick up these technologies when they’re competitive,” says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

Solar-based charging systems, like the ones mentioned in the study, could help make electricity less of a constraint, bringing more EVs to the roads, Nsitem says. But there’s still a need for more charging infrastructure, a major challenge in many countries where the grid needs major upgrades for capacity and reliability, he adds.

Globally, more EVs are hitting the roads every year. “The global trend is unmistakable,” Carlin says. There are questions about how quickly it’s happening in different places, he says, “but the momentum is there.”

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.

The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January.

For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.

QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. Many lamented the performance of GPT-5.2, the latest model. Others shared memes parodying the chatbot’s sycophancy. Some planned a “Mass Cancellation Party” in San Francisco, a sardonic nod to the GPT-4o funeral that an OpenAI employee had floated, poking fun at users who are mourning the model’s impending retirement. Still, others are protesting against what they see as a deepening entanglement between OpenAI and the Trump administration.

OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.

As of December 2025, ChatGPT had nearly 900 million weekly active users, according to The Information. While it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, QuitGPT is getting attention. A recent Instagram post from the campaign has more than 36 million views and 1.3 million likes. And the organizers say that more than 17,000 people have signed up on the campaign’s website, which asks people whether they canceled their subscriptions, will commit to stop using ChatGPT, or will share the campaign on social media.

“There are lots of examples of failed campaigns like this, but we have seen a lot of effectiveness,” says Dana Fisher, a sociologist at American University. A wave of canceled subscriptions rarely sways a company’s behavior, unless it reaches a critical mass, she says. “The place where there’s a pressure point that might work is where the consumer behavior is if enough people actually use their … money to express their political opinions.”

MIT Technology Review reached out to three employees at OpenAI, none of whom said they were familiar with the campaign.

Dozens of left-leaning teens and twentysomethings scattered across the US came together to organize QuitGPT in late January. They range from pro-democracy activists and climate organizers to techies and self-proclaimed cyber libertarians, many of them seasoned grassroots campaigners. They were inspired by a viral video posted by Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University and host of The Prof G Pod. He argued that the best way to stop ICE was to persuade people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions. Denting OpenAI’s subscriber base could ripple through the stock market and threaten an economic downturn that would nudge Trump, he said.

“We make a big enough stink for OpenAI that all of the companies in the whole AI industry have to think about whether they’re going to get away enabling Trump and ICE and authoritarianism,” says an organizer of QuitGPT who requested anonymity because he feared retaliation by OpenAI, citing the company’s recent subpoenas against advocates at nonprofits. OpenAI made for an obvious first target of the movement, he says, but “this is about so much more than just OpenAI.”

Simon Rosenblum-Larson, a labor organizer in Madison, Wisconsin, who organizes movements to regulate the development of data centers, joined the campaign after hearing about it through Signal chats among community activists. “The goal here is to pull away the support pillars of the Trump administration. They’re reliant on many of these tech billionaires for support and for resources,” he says.

QuitGPT’s website points to new campaign finance reports showing that Greg Brockman and his wife each donated $12.5 million to MAGA Inc., making up nearly a quarter of the roughly $102 million it raised over the second half of 2025. The information that ICE uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4 came from an AI inventory published by the Department of Homeland Security in January.

QuitGPT is in the mold of Galloway’s own recently launched campaign, Resist and Unsubscribe. The movement urges consumers to cancel their subscriptions to Big Tech platforms, including ChatGPT, for the month of February, as a protest to companies “driving the markets and enabling our president.”

“A lot of people are feeling real anxiety,” Galloway told MIT Technology Review. “You take enabling a president, proximity to the president, and an unease around AI,” he says, “and now people are starting to take action with their wallets.” Galloway says his campaign’s website can draw more than 200,000 unique visits in a day and that he receives dozens of DMs every hour showing screenshots of canceled subscriptions.

The consumer boycotts follow a growing wave of pressure from inside the companies themselves. In recent weeks, tech workers have been urging their employers to use their political clout to demand that ICE leave US cities, cancel company contracts with the agency, and speak out against the agency’s actions. CEOs have started responding. OpenAI’s Sam Altman wrote in an internal Slack message to employees that ICE is “going too far.” Apple CEO Tim Cook called for a “deescalation” in an internal memo posted on the company’s website for employees. It was a departure from how Big Tech CEOs have courted President Trump with dinners and donations since his inauguration.

Although spurred by a fatal immigration crackdown, these developments signal that a sprawling anti-AI movement is gaining momentum. The campaigns are tapping into simmering anxieties about AI, says Rosenblum-Larson, including the energy costs of data centers, the plague of deepfake porn, the teen mental-health crisis, the job apocalypse, and slop. “It’s a really strange set of coalitions built around the AI movement,” he says.

“Those are the right conditions for a movement to spring up,” says David Karpf, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. Brockman’s donation to Trump’s super PAC caught many users off guard, he says. “In the longer arc, we are going to see users respond and react to Big Tech, deciding that they’re not okay with this.”

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

            <div id="article-text">For families living with neurodegenerative disease, the hardest part is not always the diagnosis. It is the slow erosion that follows: memory fading, personality shifting, independence shrinking.

It unfolds quietly. First, forgotten appointments. Then repeated questions. Then moments when a familiar face no longer feels familiar.

The illness does not isolate itself to one body. It rearranges the lives around it. Partners become caregivers. Children become decision-makers. Conversations grow shorter. Patience grows thinner. Guilt creeps in, for being tired, for wishing things were easier, for missing the person who is still physically there.

Neurodegeneration is rarely a single patient story. It is a family condition, stretching across kitchens, hospital corridors, and years that feel longer than they should.

Dublin-based Aerska has raised $39 million in fresh funding to battle one of the biggest scientific barriers standing between patients and meaningful treatment: getting advanced genetic medicines into the brain.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The round was co-led by EQT Life Sciences and age1, two investors known for backing high-risk, high-impact biotech. Their bet is not just on a platform, but on the possibility that diseases once managed only at the margins could eventually be slowed at their root.

Think of the brain as a house with very strict security at the door. That security system, called the blood-brain barrier, protects us from harmful substances in the blood. The problem is that it is so strict that it also blocks many medicines.

So even if scientists create a smart treatment that can “turn off” a harmful gene linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s, the drug often cannot physically get inside the brain cells where it needs to work.

Aerska is trying to solve that access problem.

Instead of injecting medicine directly into the brain, which is invasive and risky, they are developing a way to send it through the bloodstream like a normal injection. Their technology acts like a special pass that lets the treatment cross the brain’s security gate. Once inside, the medicine can reduce the production of the proteins that drive disease.

In simple terms, the science to switch off bad genes already exists. The hard part is delivery. Aerska is building the delivery vehicle.

The company’s early focus includes genetic drivers of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Both remain incurable. Existing drugs largely manage symptoms rather than altering the course of decline.

RNA interference, by contrast, aims to reduce the production of disease-causing proteins themselves. It is a strategy that addresses biology upstream, not downstream.

Longevity has become the “American dream” in European biotech, yet most serious investors are looking less at life extension and more at healthspan,  years lived with clarity and autonomy.

That is the space Aerska is positioning itself in. The goal is not abstract immortality. It is more time at home, more recognisable faces, and more preserved dignity.

The $39 million will fund preclinical development and early clinical steps. The scientific obsacle remain significant, and neurological drug development has humbled many before. But systemic RNA delivery to the brain, if proven safe and effective, would mark a structural shift in how these diseases are approached.

For now, Aerska represents something simpler: a European biotech choosing to confront one of medicine’s most stubborn frontiers,  not with incremental symptom control, but with the ambition to change the trajectory itself.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We stand at one of history’s most exhilarating crossroads. Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of work, business, and human potential at breathtaking speed. The very capabilities that make us most human, our creativity, our imagination, our ability to dream up what doesn’t yet exist, are becoming our most valuable assets.

This is not a story about humans versus machines. It’s a story about human potential unleashed. It’s about a future where technology handles the tedious so we can focus on the transcendent.

Where the dreamers, the questioners, the bold thinkers who color outside the lines are not just welcomed, they are essential.

Imagine a world where you never again have to spend hours on mind-numbing data entry, formatting documents, or wrestling with spreadsheets, where the repetitive tasks that drain your energy and dull your spirit are handled instantly by AI, freeing you to focus on work that genuinely excites you.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What we are witnessing is not the replacement of human workers; it is the liberation of human potential. AI is taking on the equivalent of heavy lifting, and in doing so, it’s creating space for something extraordinary: a global renaissance of creative thinking.

Think about what becomes possible when you’re freed from the mundane. When a graphic designer no longer spends half their day on production tasks, they can explore ten bold creative directions instead of one safe option.

When a teacher is not buried in administrative work, they can devise innovative ways to spark curiosity in every student. When operational details do not consume an entrepreneur, they can envision entirely new possibilities for serving their customers.

This is the gift AI is giving us: time and mental space to be more fully human, more creative, more imaginative than ever before.

Here is what the smartest organisations are discovering: when everyone has access to the same powerful AI tools, the differentiator is not the technology. It’s the human wielding it.

Two companies can use identical AI platforms. One generates competent but forgettable content. The other creates campaigns that move people to tears, spark movements, and transform markets. The difference? Creative vision. Human imagination. The ability to ask questions that AI would never think to ask.

The most successful people in the AI era won’t be those who compete with machines at what machines do well. They will be those who ask better questions.

The creative thinker who asks “What if we completely reimagined this?” instead of “How can we make this 10% better?” The visionary who wonders “What problem are we not seeing?” instead of “How do we solve this defined problem?” The innovator who questions “Why are we doing this at all?” instead of “How can we do this more efficiently?”

These questions change trajectories. They open new possibilities. They create breakthroughs. And they can only come from curious, creative human minds willing to challenge assumptions and imagine alternatives.

It is true that AI will displace certain positions, as noted by the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report. It projects that 92 million roles will be displaced by 2030, with positions like graphic designers and administrative assistants among those facing decline due to automation and generative AI.

This technological disruption is simultaneously unleashing a creative renaissance. The same WEF report reveals that 170 million new roles will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs, with creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility emerging as some of the fastest-growing skills in demand alongside technical capabilities.

Forbes has noted that innovation and creativity rank among the top skills needed for the future, with employers recognising that while AI may displace 14% of jobs by 2030, the aspects of innovation that revolve around human empathy and deeper consciousness cannot be replicated by machines.

The message is clear: as AI handles the repetitive and predictable, human creativity becomes not just valuable but essential. Organisations are not looking for people who can compete with AI at computational tasks; they are seeking creative thinkers who can imagine entirely new possibilities and ask questions machines would never consider.

The uniquely human qualities of intuition, empathy, and visionary thinking to solve problems that have not even been defined yet.

Here is the beauty about creative thinking: it’s not a single skill or talent. It’s a constellation of capabilities, and each person’s constellation is unique.

Maybe you are brilliant at seeing patterns others miss, connecting dots across completely different domains. Perhaps you have an uncanny ability to understand what people truly need, even when they can’t articulate it themselves.

You might be exceptional at taking a spark of an idea and developing it into something magnificent, or at bringing people together in ways that generate creative breakthroughs.

Some creative thinkers are wildly imaginative, dreaming up possibilities that seem to come from nowhere. Others are integrative, synthesizing diverse ideas into coherent wholes. Some challenge every assumption; others build masterfully on existing foundations. Some think in images, others in systems, still others in stories.

Every version is valuable. Every version is needed.

The AI era does not demand that you become someone you’re not. It invites you to become more fully yourself: to lean into your natural creative strengths and develop them intentionally. Your particular way of thinking creatively is your signature, your competitive advantage, your gift to offer the world.

The creative thinkers of the next decade won’t be lone geniuses toiling in isolation. They will be collaborative creators, working alongside both humans and AI to achieve things neither could accomplish alone.

Imagine participating in creative collaborations where AI handles the analytical heavy lifting while you and your colleagues focus on vision, judgment, and inspiration. Where technology expands what’s possible while human creativity provides direction and meaning.

Where diverse perspectives combine with computational power to solve challenges that once seemed insurmountable.

This is already happening. Architects are using AI to explore thousands of design possibilities, then applying their creative judgment to create buildings that inspire.

Scientists are using AI to identify patterns in vast datasets, then applying creative thinking to formulate revolutionary hypotheses.

Artists are using AI as a creative tool, generating works that express uniquely human perspectives in entirely new ways. You can be part of this creative renaissance. Your ideas, your questions, your unique perspective matter more than ever.

The accelerating pace of change in our world makes creative thinking not just valuable but essential for adaptation and survival. The challenges we face: climate change, resource scarcity, social fragmentation, and emerging technologies with unpredictable consequences don’t have predetermined solutions in any playbook.

They require the kind of flexible, imaginative thinking that can break free from established frameworks and conventional wisdom. Moreover, as the half-life of specific technical skills continues to shrink, the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn ( which is itself a creative process) becomes more important than mastery of any particular tool or technique.

Those who can think creatively can pivot between domains, see opportunities in disruption, and continuously reinvent themselves and their contributions.

Perhaps most importantly, creative thinking will be crucial for maintaining meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated world.

As machines handle more of our productivity, human value will increasingly derive from our capacity for original expression, cultural creation, emotional resonance, and the kind of meaning-making that gives life richness beyond mere efficiency.

The future is not about those who compete with machines at “machine like” tasks, but to those who can amplify their humanity by asking better questions, imagining more beautiful possibilities, and creating connections that matter.

The AI revolution is here, and it’s revealing a profound truth: the most powerful technology humans have ever created still can’t replicate the magic of human creativity. It can’t dream up what doesn’t exist. It can’t make intuitive leaps that defy logic. It can’t feel what matters, imagine what’s possible, or create meaning from chaos.

The next decade will belong to the creative thinkers because they are doing what AI cannot. They will ask better questions and make unexpected connections. Solving problems that have not been defined. Creating experiences that move people. Imagining futures worth building.

The next decade belongs to the creative thinkers. Make sure you are one of them.

            <h2>Naboo raises $70M to turn AI event planning into corporate procurement platform</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/naboo-raises-70m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-headquartered Naboo has raised a $70m in Series B as it accelerates its ambition to become the operating layer for how large companies plan, book, and control corporate events. The round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the same investor that backed Mistral AI in 2023, and lands just a year after Naboo closed a €20m Series A.

Naboo positions itself as an AI-powered procurement platform for corporate events, covering everything from venue booking and travel to supplier coordination and budget control.

Founded in 2022, Naboo built its name on simplifying how companies organise and run corporate events,  from booking venues and catering to logistics and attendee management, using an all-in-one platform that brings speed and transparency to a typically fragmented process.

By folding AI into what is traditionally a fragmented, manual process, the company says it has become Europe’s leading purchasing platform for corporate events, a corner of the broader $400bn global events market that has long resisted software consolidation.

The timing matters. Corporate events sit at the intersection of travel, finance, and operations, yet they are often managed outside standard procurement systems.

Naboo’s pitch is that events should be treated like any other strategic spend, measurable, optimised, and governed through a single platform. That logic has resonated with large enterprises, particularly in the UK, which has become Naboo’s biggest market outside France following the opening of its London office in 2025.

With fresh capital in hand, Naboo is now stepping more decisively onto the global stage. The company is opening a new hub in New York as part of a broader US expansion, betting that multinational clients want a single system to manage events across regions, teams, and currencies.

Within just three years, Naboo has grown into one of the more visible players in the category, helped by enterprises looking for better control over decentralised spending.

The bigger shift, however, goes beyond events. Naboo plans to extend its AI procurement platform into “tail spend”, the long tail of smaller, harder-to-track purchases that typically fall outside core procurement tools.

In enterprise finance, this is often labelled Class C spending, and while each transaction is small, the total adds up fast. Naboo’s goal is to give companies a unified, AI-driven view of this spend, starting with events and branching outward.

The targets are ambitious. Naboo says it aims to triple revenue in 2026 and to exceed $1bn in business volume by 2027.

Whether it gets there will depend on how far enterprises are willing to centralise spending that has historically lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. What’s clear is that Naboo is betting that the next wave of enterprise AI won’t just analyse data, it will quietly reshape how money is spent.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Databricks is having one of those years that most enterprise software companies would quietly envy. The data and AI platform says it has reached a $5.4bn annual revenue run rate, growing 65% year over year, at a time when growth across the sector has cooled noticeably.

For a private company, that pace is rare. And it helps explain why investors have continued to pour money into Databricks, even as funding has become more selective.

The company says it has now raised more than $7bn in total capital, including recent equity funding that values the business at $134bn, alongside a large debt facility to support long-term expansion.

What’s driving the numbers isn’t just classic data analytics. Databricks says around $1.4bn of its revenue run rate now comes from AI-related products, reflecting how quickly companies are trying to turn large datasets into something usable for machine learning and generative AI. Instead of building separate stacks for data and AI, many customers are opting for platforms that combine both.

In practice, that means Databricks is leaning into tools that make complex data systems easier to use. Products like Genie, which lets people query data using plain language, and Lakebase, a new operational database designed for AI-driven applications, are meant to lower the barrier between raw data and real-world use.

While Databricks is still private, its scale increasingly puts it in the same conversation as public cloud giants.

“We’re seeing overwhelming investor interest in our next chapter as we go after two new markets,” said Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks. “With this new capital, we’ll double down on Lakebase so developers can create operational databases built for AI agents. At the same time, we’re investing in Genie to let every employee chat with their data, driving accurate and actionable insights.

Databricks’ numbers also cut through a lot of the noise around enterprise AI. While many companies are still talking about transformation, this growth suggests businesses are already spending on the unglamorous parts, cleaning data, connecting systems, and making AI usable inside real organisations.

If that trend holds, the next phase of AI won’t be defined by new models or flashy demos, but by which platforms quietly become impossible to replace. Databricks is clearly betting it can be one of them.

            <h2>Allonic is rebuilding robotics from the inside out</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/allonic-is-rebuilding-robotics-from-the-inside-out">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Budapest-based robotics company Allonic has raised $7.2 million in a pre-seed round, marking what investors are calling the largest pre-seed funding round in Hungarian startup history.

The raise was led by Visionaries Club with participation from Day One Capital, Prototype, SDAC Ventures, TinyVC, and more than a dozen angels from organisations including OpenAI and Hugging Face.

Allonic’s $7.2m pre-seed matters because it breaks a quiet rule in Europe: that truly hard hardware problems are supposed to wait until later rounds, or later continents. This is early money going into the physical layer of robotics, not the AI wrapper around it, and it’s happening in Budapest, not Silicon Valley or Munich.

This may also send a signal that European investors are starting to back ambition at the source, where things are messy, slow, and expensive to build.

It also shows that Central and Eastern Europe is no longer just a talent pool for outsourced engineering, but a place where original industrial ideas can take shape and attract serious capital.

If this pattern holds, Europe doesn’t just produce smarter robots; it produces the means to actually build them.

Yet, Allonic is building a fundamentally different way to produce robot bodies, addressing a problem that many robotics founders say has been overlooked as AI and autonomy grab headlines.

Today’s robots are typically assembled from scores of individual mechanical parts, bearings, screws, cables, and rigid linkages, a process that is slow, expensive, and hard to scale. Instead, Allonic uses what it calls a 3D Tissue Braiding process, which automatically weaves together fibres, elastics, and embedded wiring over an endoskeleton in a single continuous operation.

Allonic has already completed an initial pilot in electronics manufacturing, and says it is in talks with companies across industrial automation and humanoid robotics. With the fresh capital, the team plans to grow engineering and commercial capabilities and accelerate further pilot deployments.

Investors may see the round as a sign that robotics investment is maturing beyond software and autonomy into the foundational parts of the stack.

In that sense, we can say that Allonic isn’t just a funding story; it’s a small stress test for Europe’s ability to back its own industrial future. If this kind of capital continues to flow into foundational hardware, not just software layers, Europe can move from exporting ideas to shaping the tools that industries run on.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based energy software company Tem has closed a $75 million Series B round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with additional funding from AlbionVC, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Schroders Capital, Voyager Ventures, Allianz, and others.

The round reportedly values the company at more than $300 million and will fund its expansion into the United States and Australia.

Tem builds an AI-native energy platform designed to automate the pricing, matching, and execution of electricity transactions, a market that has long relied on manual processes and legacy infrastructure.

Its core system uses machine learning to forecast supply and demand, match buyers with suppliers, and reduce the layers of intermediaries that typically add cost and complexity.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

According to Tem, more than 2,600 businesses in the UK are already on its platform, with customers reporting energy cost savings of up to 30 per cent compared with traditional procurement approaches.

The startup also handled roughly two terawatt-hours of electricity transactions in 2025, a volume it says demonstrates growing demand for automated energy market infrastructure.

Tem’s approach is often described as bringing modern software-first tools to a sector still dominated by brokers, manual trading desks, and outdated systems. By replacing fragmented legacy workflows with a unified AI-driven engine, the company aims to make energy markets more efficient while giving businesses clearer price signals and lower transaction fees.

With the new funding, Tem plans to accelerate its global footprint, beginning with key energy markets such as Texas in the United States and select regions in Australia, where grid modernisation and renewable integration are creating fresh demand for flexible energy trading tools.
